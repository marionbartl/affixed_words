I have to admit that I ’m a fan of good - sounding audio equipment .
Through the right amplifier and speakers , I can almost see the music ( pharmaceuticals not needed ) .
That being said , when I see things like the following videos describing how to make a speaker on the cheap it really makes me smile .
As long as you have some regular household items and do n’t mind cutting up a mini- jack cable , the total cost of this DIY speaker is actually 1 cent .
How to make a speaker ( he claims “ high definition speaker ” ) for less than one dollar .
OK , you caught us .
That one is fake .
If you have a little bit of time ( say about 10 minutes ) , you can make a real good sounding speaker with a plastic cup , business card , Lego blocks , a magnet and some wire if you follow the simple instructions .
Better yet , you can make a DIY speaker that actually competes with commercial speakers for about the same cost of materials and about 10 more minutes .
Check it out .
The above video was made by a guy called Jose Pino .
You can view the detailed photos of the speaker assembly mentioned above , and all sorts of other interesting DIY devices on his site .
If you want to get a bit more serious about building speakers , “ Designing , Building , and Testing Your Own Speaker System with Projects ” is an awesome book on the subject .
Matthew Alexander , a senior interrogator from Iraq actually analyzes Cheney 's speech and rebukes most of what Cheney said .
Let me dissect former Vice President Dick Cheney 's speech on National Security using this model and my interrogation skills .
First , VP Cheney said , " This recruitment - tool theory has become something of a mantra lately ... it excuses the violent and blames America for the evil that others do .
He further stated , " It is much closer to the truth that terrorists hate this country precisely because of the values we profess and seek to live by , not by some alleged failure to do so . "
That is simply untrue .
Anyone who served in Iraq , and veterans on both sides of the aisle have made this argument , knows that the foreign fighters did not come to Iraq en masse until after the revelations of torture and abuse at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay .
I heard this from captured foreign fighters day in and day out when I was supervising interrogations in Iraq .
What the former Vice President did n't say is the fact that the dislike of our policies in the Middle East were not enough to make thousands of Muslim men pick up arms against us before these revelations .
Torture and abuse became Al Qaida 's number one recruiting tool and cost us American lives .
Secondly , the former Vice President , in saying that waterboarding is not torture , never mentions the fact that it was the United States and its Allies , during the Tokyo Trials , that helped convict a Japanese soldier for war crimes for waterboarding one of Jimmie Doolittle 's Raiders .
Have our morals and values changed in fifty years ?
He also did not mention that George Washington and Abraham Lincoln both prohibited their troops from torturing prisoners of war .
Washington specifically used the term " injure " -- no mention of severe mental or physical pain ... read on
HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - Sinopec 's $ 7.2 billion bid for oil explorer Addax Petroleum AXC.
TO is a sign that China 's energy giants find it easier to secure reserves in parts of the world where there are fewer hang - ups about Beijing owning local natural resources .
Africa and the Middle East , where Swiss - based Addax has its main assets , are more politically disposed to China than are developed nations such as the United States , where local politicians blocked CNOOC's CEO.N $ 18.5 billion bid for oil company Unocal in 2005 , analysts say .
Earlier this month , Anglo - Australian miner Rio Tinto RIO.
AXRIO.L rejected a $ 19.5 billion tie - up with China 's state - owned Chinalco -- a deal that had triggered political and shareholder opposition .
“ At the end of the day , they may wonder whether it ’s a waste of time going after targets in the developed world , ” said Macquarie analyst David Johnson .
“ The chances of success are higher in Africa , South America and Kazakhstan than other parts of the world . ”
Until now , political sensitivities in the West have limited China ’s outbound investments in resources largely to deals executed on the back of loan - for - oil tie-ups .
In the past half - year , China has lent more than $ 45 billion to Russia , Brazil , Venezuela and Kazakhstan in exchange for long - term crude supplies .
State - owned Sinopec Group , Asia ’s top oil refiner , knocked out rival Korea National Oil Co with an offer that is more than four times Addax ’s stock price in November , and which is China ’s biggest overseas takeover .
Addax AXC.L , based in Switzerland but operating in Africa and the Middle East , has been on the radar of Asia 's acquisitive energy firms since February , when CNOOC 0883.HK and India 's Oil & Natural Gas Corp ONGC .
BO were also touted as potential suitors .

The Addax deal will give Sinopec a strong foothold in oil - rich West Africa and Iraqi Kurdistan and a steady supply of oil for its refining operations .
" The listed company is in desperate need of upstream oil assets to feed its downstream business , " said Gordon Kwan , Hong Kong - based head of energy research at Mirae Asset Financial , referring to listed Sinopec Corp 0368 .
HK600028.SSSNP.N .
“ Without that , it would be at the mercy of China ’s fuel pricing policy . ”
BIG SHAREHOLDER EYES EXIT
Sinopec ’s bid was also helped by the fact that Addax ’s CEO , Swiss citizen Jean Claude Gandur -- one of Europe ’s richest men -- is also its major shareholder with about 38 percent of the company , and was eager to cash out .
“ It ’s not that often you have a major shareholder like this -- that ’s the main reason why this one became available , ” said a Hong Kong - based investment banker who has advised Chinese energy giants on outbound deals , but was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter .
Other Chinese energy firms are eyeing overseas assets in Africa and the Middle East , though future deals might not be as simple as Addax , especially if multiple shareholders disagree about the sale of the target company , bankers say .
CNOOC , China 's top offshore oil and gas producer , has hired Goldman Sachs GS.N to advise it on a bid for a stake in Africa - focused oil and gas firm Kosmos Energy , in a deal that may be worth about $ 3 billion .
Sinopec ’s deal with Addax , if completed , should help meet the Chinese giant ’s need for quality upstream assets to feed its refining business , analysts say .
At least 60 percent of Addax ’s shareholders must approve the deal .
Sinopec Group , parent of Sinopec Corp , may inject Addax ’s upstream assets in Nigeria , Gabon and Cameroon , as well as the Taq Taq field in the Kurdistan region of Iraq , into its listed unit by the year - end , analysts said .
Sinopec Group lost about $ 16.7 billion in its refining businesses last year , as soaring crude oil prices in the first half - year and low state - capped fuel prices squeezed margins .
It was 7 am when Delara Darabi phoned home .
" Oh mother , I see the hangman 's noose in front of me , " she garbled .
" They are going to execute me .
Please save me . "
Moments later a prison official snatched the handset away .
" We will easily execute your daughter and there 's nothing you can do about it , " he barked at the parents .
Then , with a chilling click , the line went dead .
The desperate couple rushed to the Central Prison in Rasht , Iran , wailing at the guards to let them see their 22 - year - old .
As they prostrated themselves , an ambulance emerged , most probably with Delara 's corpse inside .
" They took Delara to the gallows with nobody around her , " Mohammad Mostafaei , one of her lawyers , said in a letter distributed to human rights groups .
" They put the rope on her delicate neck .
I do not know who the cruel person was to pull the chair from under her feet . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Ms Darabi – dubbed The Prisoner of Colours for the love of painting she developed whilst on death row – was convicted for murdering her father 's wealthy cousin in September 2003 , when she was just 17 .
Although she initially confessed to the crime , she later said she had been persuaded to take the blame by her older boyfriend Amir Hossein .
It was in fact Mr Hossein who had killed the rich relation , she said , to get the money .
The 19 - year - old allegedly told Ms Darabi that she could save him from the gallows by confessing and that would be no risk to her own life because she was still a minor .
The young woman complied .
Her boyfriend was sentenced to 10 years in prison for complicity to murder ; she was sentenced to death .
The execution , which happened on Friday , caught everyone by surprise .
Not only had there been no formal notification 48 hours before the hanging , as required under Iranian law , but , just a fortnight earlier , Ms Darabi had actually been granted a two - month stay of execution by the head of the judiciary .
The day before their daughter would end up being walked to the gallows , her parents had even visited her in jail where she had excitedly informed them there was to be an appeal so new evidence could be heard .
Twenty - four hours later , she was dead .
Rights groups inside and outside Iran reacted with horror over the weekend as news of the secret hanging seeped out .
" It appears Iran 's head of judiciary has no ability to control his own judges , " said Zama Coursen - Neff from the children 's rights division of Human Rights Watch .
" This is an outrageous violation of Iranian as well as international human rights law , and a callous affront to basic human dignity . "
Amnesty International said that the decision to rush the execution through in secret " appears to have been a cynical move on the part of the authorities to avoid domestic and international protests which might have saved Delara Darabi's life " .
Iran leads the world in executing juvenile offenders , according to human rights groups , accounting for two - thirds of such deaths in the past four years .
The hanging of Ms Darabi was the second known execution of a juvenile offender this year and lawyers in Tehran estimate that at least 130 more are waiting on death row .
It was the fate to which these young individuals were doomed that Ms Darabi sought to highlight through her haunting paintings .
" Delara is not alone , " she wrote to the president of Stop Child Executions .
" Delaras are trapped in prisons and in need ... of defenders of human rights and humanity . "
Many of her images are monochrome , the harsh charcoal lines depicting anguished , tortured faces .
Others incorporate disturbing splashes of red , spattering the white headscarves of female prisoners , or washed across the background to suggest the hell of incarceration .
Those campaigning to free Ms Darabi put the artwork on display in Tehran .
" I try to defend myself using colours , forms and words .
These paintings are my swear to what I have not done , " the prisoner wrote in the exhibition 's blurb .
" From behind the walls , I say hello to you , who has come to see my paintings . "
As her family buried her at the weekend and the EU joined the chorus of criticism against the Iranian authorities , the human rights lawyer , Mr Mostafaei , recalled the personal gift Ms Darabi had bestowed on him .
" She painted a picture of an old man playing the violin , " he said .
" I did not know that he was playing her death song . "
Net users would face a heavy bill if they had to pay for what they watch online Sending letters to persistent pirates will not stop them copying , suggests research .
Only 33 % of those receiving a letter from their ISP would stop pirating content , found a survey carried out by legal firm Wiggin .
However , it found 80 % would stop if the letter were followed by action such as cutting net connections .
The finding comes a week before the release of a UK government report aimed at tackling web piracy .
The research , commissioned by media lawyers Wiggin , questioned more than 1,500 UK consumers about their changing digital media habits .
On June 16 , the government is widely expected to publish the final version of the Carter Report .
Among the topics considered by the wide - ranging report will be recommendations that ISPs investigate " technical solutions " to piracy which could involve slowing down connection speeds for unrepentant pirates .
" A letter would not be enough , " said Alexander Ross , partner in the media and technology group at Wiggin .
" It does take an ultimate sanction . "
Cash for content
The survey also found that there could be a lucrative market for ISPs if they did changed their flat rates for prices based on usage .
Keen consumers of video , online games would pay a premium to maintain their access to these sorts of content , said Mr Ross .
Media consumption habits are changing radically , suggests the research Men aged 20 - 34 asked in the survey said they would pay £ 48 per month for such media .
Women aged 25 - 34 would pay up to £ 39 per month .
On average , suggests the research , web users would pay £ 26 per month to keep access to their favourite firm of online content .
" The suggestion is that if ISPs develop content services of their own and tier their access there are ready and willing customers for it , " said Mr Ross .
In line with the interest in web content , the survey revealed strong interest , 7 % of those questioned , in watching them on family TV sets .
The appeal of this crossed age divides , found the survey , with 77 % of males and 61 % of women aged 45 - 54 keen to do so .
Also popular were on - demand TV services .
Among those questioned , 46 % said they were occasional and regular users of the BBC iPlayer .
Up from 13 % in 2008 .
Similarly , 4OD use was up from 16 % to 28 % and ITVPlayer up from 12 % to 25 % .
" The distinction between the sit back experience of scheduled broadcasting and the sit forward experience of on demand access is becoming ever more blurred , and consumers are driving the convergence , " said Mr Ross .
However , 49 % of those questioned said they thought it was currently too difficult to connect up a TV and PC to get at net content .
" Internet on the main television is set to become a mass market reality within a short period , " said Russell Hart , boss of Entertainment Media Research which carried out the survey for Wiggin .
Though , he added , makers of TVs had to be sure their products were cheap enough and easy to use if this potential market was to be tapped .

Representative Barney Frank , joined by Reps. Tammy Baldwin and Jared Polis and at least 100 cosponsors , introduced a Federal Inclusive Employment Non-Discrimination ( ENDA ) bill today .
ENDA will add sexual orientation and gender identity to pre-existing employment non-discrimination laws .
ENDA is such a common sense idea that most people believe it is already illegal to fire someone for being Gay , Lesbian , Bisexual , or Transgender .
While there are already 12 states and 100 localities that protect 40 percent of the population , millions are still at risk .
Can you imagine what it would be like to be approached by your boss and fired for who you were born to be ?
What would you do ?
How would you protect yourself and your family ?
Many can not without ENDA .
THIS CAN ’T CONTINUE !
This is wrong .
This is un-American .
We must put an end to it .
Join the Impact is a proud member of the United ENDA Coalition .
Together we have come up with several actions you can do RIGHT NOW :
Call the Capitol Switchboard at ( 202 ) 224-3121 and have them connect you to your Representative ( based on your zip code ) .
Tell them :
I am a constituent and I would like you to please tell Representative _______ that I would like him / her to support the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.
ENDA would ban discrimination against all lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people in the workplace .
Can you tell me whether or not Representative _______ will support the bill ?
Send a message to Laura Hart with United ENDA with a report of your representative ’s response .
Once you make your call , follow up with an e-mail , or even better a physical letter .
You can find contact info here : https://writerep.house.gov/writerep/welcome.shtml

Sweden 's new anti-piracy policy allows copyright holders to quickly obtain the identity of major pirates and prosecute them directly through the courts , without going through the police .
And it 's scared a lot of Swedes straight .

The drop was measured by Netnod , a Swedish web tracking firm , who found that traffic fell from 120 GB /s to 80 GB / s on the day the law went into effect .
Christian Engstrom , VP of Sweden 's Pirate Party ( love it ) is not concerned , however .
He told the BBC :
" Today , there is a very drastic reduction in internet traffic .
But experience from other countries suggests that while file - sharing drops on the day a law is passed , it starts climbing again . .
. One of the reasons is that it takes people a few weeks to figure out how to change their security settings so that can share files anonymously , " he added .

The law is catching a lot of flak for effectively letting corporations enforce anti-piracy code with lawsuits , rather than leaving them to the police to deal with offenders on a criminal basis .
Copyright holders can no go straight to the uploader 's ISP , get his IP address and identity , and sue him up good .
From the country that gave us the Pirate Bay , though , I 'm sure someone will figure out a way to subvert this . [ BBC ]
I just saw an article headlined , “ Michael Jackson Dead Too Soon at 50 . ”
Dead too soon , you sadists ?
The more fitting headline , if you have any heart at all , is “ Michael Jackson Dead Not a Moment Too Soon ” !
Because if ever there was a merciful release , for him and the whole wide world , this was it .
Jackson was about to start a big concert tour when blessed cardiac arrest came to the rescue .
Why are we not all cheering whatever combination of drugs helped the miserable no - nosed sod out of this mortal coil ?
Can you imagine the ongoing carny freak show that was about to ensue ?
Frail , pale Jackson with a face like the Phantom of the Opera desperately moonwalking from city to city to pay off his 400 million dollar debt ?
And those gangs of pitifully weird fans , also aging in ghastly ways , turning out to watch , as if the International Association of Mental Institutions had all released their patients simultaneously for the occasion ?
It ’s monstrous , lamenting Jackson ’s death , wishing him back in his bleached body and up on a stage somewhere wearing a glitter glove and grabbing his skeletal crotch .
All that guff from people like Quincy Jones , who ought to know better , saying he had so much more to give .
Nobody ever saw such a used - up husk of a person , such a walking corpse , as Michael Jackson .
Could n’t one honest person who knew him stand up and say , “ Thank God that ’s over ! ”
He ’s out of his misery now , and we do n’t have to shudder at the sight of him anymore !
There will be no more pathetic comeback CDs !
No more offspring named Prince Michael III , IV , and V !
Assorted children are safe from his creepy affections !
O Death , where is thy sting , when it comes to Michael Jackson ?
The fact is , Michael Jackson peaked at age ten , when he was still a black kid with a robust voice who could really belt it out : “ OHHH baby give me one more CHAAAAAAANCE …. ”
He ’s the only guy in the world whose voice broke and got subsequently higher and reedier .
It went from a fierce yowl too big for the kid ’s body to a breathy contralto , and a speaking voice so exaggeratedly girly it sounded like Marilyn Monroe vocally reincarnated .
As so many have asked in the intervening years — what the hell happened to him ?
Was he an inadvertent castrato or something ?
Did his vicious father Joe do him some permanent injury to the groin area during one of the legendary childhood beatings ?
Or did Jackson himself make a bold first step toward achieving white girlhood , starting with the nuts and moving on to the nose ?
The new soft breathiness of his voice was already noticeable in the ballad “ Ben . ” ( That ’s a love song fourteen - year - old Jackson sang to a rat .
If you were n’t around in the ‘ 70s you would n’t understand about the whole vermin - film subgenre that seemed so right for that decade in America . )
Even the more energetic songs he did later for Off the Wall and Thriller are airy and anemic compared with the splendid childhood stuff : “ Bill - hee Jean is not my luv-huh … ” Maybe it was the type of arrangements that were favored then , in that distressing era of ‘ 80s pop , but there seemed to be a lot of gratuitous “ WHOOOs ” and stuff in those songs , as if to show that Jackson could still throw out a big note when he wanted to .
Speaking of breathy voices , Farrah Fawcett ’s dead too .
We have a celebrity - death two - fer .
Fawcett ’s less interesting , of course , because she never had any talent to lose .
The source of her fascination was how on earth she stayed famous for decades just from one poster that showcased her nipples .
Plus a stupid hairdo that became a cultural blight .
It would n’t go away .
Up through the ‘ 90s , when I went back east to my hick hometown for a visit , I ’d still see women flaunting that appalling flipped - back ‘ do .
Critics and pundits are trying to make posthumous claims that Fawcett had substance ( “ A Serious Actress with Range ” is the tile of Peter Hartlaub ’s “ appreciation ” ) but let ’s be serious here for a moment .
She was a terrible actress and a painfully dippy celebrity presence and a wearying exhibitionist too , judging by that rolling - naked - in - paint attempt at artistry for the Playboy Channel and the I ’m - a - proud - anal - cancer - victim documentary with her mortifying fat git boyfriend Ryan O’Neill hogging the camera .
Her death spares us further Farrah - docs , anyway .
Should n’t there be some policy for putting celebrities down –like horses with broken legs who thrash around maiming themselves horribly –when they get past a certain point of public self - abasement ?
We shoot horses , do n’t we ?
But on the other hand , I have to admit , she was a courteous woman .
That ’s not a small thing .
I can say this because I had a Farrah Fawcett encounter once , years ago .
It was at a Hollywood party , a real cliché of a Hollywood party , with wall - to - wall stars and an almost incredible lack of revelry going on .
Everybody was working , see , “ making contacts , ” showing themselves off to other industry bigshots , trying to move up a rank in the star hierarchy .
It was quite a thing to watch , but one of the worst parties I ever attended if you cling to the standard notion of the word “ party . ”
I was one of the nobodies who happened to be there , for complicated reasons , so naturally I only talked to other nobodies while stars talked to other stars .
I was in a line for the bathroom next to Farrah Fawcett , and she made polite conversation with me while we waited .
An amazing breach of protocol !
Never Engage the Nobodies is one of the basic rules of Hollywood stardom ; do n’t even make eye contact ; they ’ll only try to give you a script or something .
She was very small and thin and rather pretty considering the fact that she had grey skin , I remember .
I ’d never seen anyone with grey skin before , and I ’ve wondered about it ever since .
How does a person get grey skin ?
But that ’s the thing with celebrities , it ’s always a freak show of one sort or another .
Mark Wahlberg , for example , is approximately four feet tall .
Just FYI .
If we ’re going to do death - tributes , here are some honest ones : Farrah Fawcett , a Surprisingly Polite Woman !
Michael Jackson , If Only He ’d Died Younger !
" We cannot move forward without a strong public option , " stated Congressman Raul M. Grijalva ( AZ - 07 ) , Co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus .
" Health care costs are skyrocketing for everyone , and our health is worsening .
It is time that we attain health care reform that prioritizes and alleviates the financial burden on families . "
" The benefits of a public health plan are clear .
A public health plan will guarantee coverage regardless of pre-existing condition .
A public health plan will give patients a choice of doctors and hospitals .
And a public health plan will build in incentives for private insurers to lower costs to compete , " said Congresswoman Barbara Lee ( CA -09 ) , Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus .
" When it comes to the public plan , know that the Congressional Black Caucus , the Congressional Hispanic Caucus , the Congressional Asian Pacific Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus speak with one voice . "
And here 's a quote from Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey about how they 're going to bat for us on the public option in health care reform :
" This process of publicly issuing our own criteria is n't how progressives normally operate .
Usually , we work behind the scenes to strengthen legislation .
This time , however , is different .
No one in this building wants health care reform as much as we do , " said Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey ( CA - 06 ) , Co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus .
" Nonetheless , if reform legislation comes to the floor , and it does not include a real and robust public option that lives up to our criteria , then we will fight it with everything that we have . "
The Energy and Commerce Committee is having their meeting today over the discussion draft of the House bill with the public option in it .
I really NEED for you to CALL the House Energy and Commerce Committee at ( 202 ) 225-2927 to ask them to support a STRONGER public option than what is currently proposed in the Tri-Committee draft with these talking points below :
Tell Representative Waxman that we want them to consider starting the National Exchange and the public option earlier than 2013 because we desperately need affordable health care RIGHT NOW .
Also , tell him or her that YOU DON'T WANT the public option 's tie to Medicare rates to " severed over time as more flexible payment systems are developed . "
You want the public option to be based on Medicare plus rates , and that you do n't want the public option to end up as a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac .
You want it to be administered by the government and NOT by any private insurance companies , and to be like Medicare based on its ability to negotiate rates with providers and pharmaceutical companies .
Also , that you want employer group plans to have ACCESS to the public option , and not be locked out of that access .
Say that you do n't want your health benefits to be taxed , but that you support a raise in taxes for the wealthy to help pay for the public option .
You do n't want the public option to be self - sustained only by premiums because that will help hobble its viability , and that you NEED for it to have some financing from the government .
Also , can you please CALL these TWO other chairmen in the House of Representatives , especially Rep .
Miller who 's leading the charge on health care reform below with your concerns about the weak points of the public option in their house bill ?
CALL Senator Dodd at ( 202 ) 224-2823 and ask him to put in OPTION A , which is the strong , robust Medicare - like public option , NOT OPTION B , which is the Conrad co-op proposal , in the markup .
He says that the CBO will release the score on the public option late today or tomorrow .
Why ca n't we SEE the full text of the public option ourselves in the bill draft ?
ALSO , PLEASE CALL the phone numbers of ALL the Senators on the HELP Committee with these talking points below and tell them to support OPTION A , not OPTION B , in the mark - up :
Tell Senator [ Name ] that you DO NOT want the 7 - year trigger for the public option and take it off the table , and that you want him to support an affordable strong , robust Medicare - like public option .
We NEED a strong , robust Medicare - like public option NOW OPEN TO ALL AMERICANS AND AFFORDABLE , not more of the SAME broken system that 's given us unaffordable premiums , little private insurance coverage , and rising co-pays .
Also , DON'T TAX OUR EMPLOYER HEALTH BENEFITS .
Instead , follow the proposal by President Obama to tax the wealthy above $ 250,000 , eliminate the overpayments in Medicare Advantage , and put tax capital gains to help fund health care reform .
TELL YOUR SENATOR NO ON THE SCHUMER COMPROMISE AND NO ON THE CONRAD CO-OP COMPROMISE .
These are the members of the HELP Committee to CALL today since they 're having their markup .

The Plumber
After having neglected Java for years I began to re-examine it this month together with Jython and my initial reaction was a culture shock .
Java is infamous for being a “ plumbing language ” i.e. you have to subclass some classes or implement a few interfaces and then plug them into a framework .
Alternatively you have to call framework methods that expect a bunch of interrelated objects as parameters .
None of those class implementations is particularly complicated but you have to figure out how all the objects are related to each other and essentially deal with configurations and dependencies on object level .
It is easy to mess things up with every additional point of failure .
There is also a tendency for abstraction inversion : you have to undertake many concrete steps within a complex machinery to create a simple building block .
Abstraction inversion is an indication of a system being overdesigned .
The topic of this article is Javas compiler API and it is a nice show case to highlight some differences which are not really situated on language level but in the way problems are approached .
Take Pythons compile function for example .
Pythons compile function has the following signature
compile : ( code_str , file_name , eval_mode ) -> code_object
and is dead simple to use :
> ; > ; > ; compile ( " import EasyExtend.langlets " , " < input > " , " exec " ) < ; code object < ; module > ; at 00EB0578 , file " < input > " , line 1 > ;
If you need to read the source from a file you do just this
> ; > ; > ; compile ( open ( " module.py " ) . read ( ) , " input " , " exec " ) < ; code object < ; module > ; at 00EB0578 , file " < input > " , line 1 > ;
If you want to store the resulting bytecode in an appropriate file you need to do a little more work
import os , struct , marshal , imp def write_code ( filename , code ) : f = open ( filename , " wb " ) try : mtime = os .
path .
getmtime ( filename ) mtime = struct .
pack ( ' < i ' , mtime ) MAGIC = imp . get_magic ( ) f. write ( MAGIC + mtime ) marshal .
dump ( code , f ) finally : f. close ( )
This creates a Python bytecode file ( usually a ‘ pyc’ file ) and serializes the code object .
Something like this could be implemented on the method level of the code object itself and a single call code.write ( filename ) would suffice to store the code .
How to compile Java dynamically ?
Java is different .
The Java Compiler API is specified in JSR 199 .
It contains 20 classes / interfaces and you have to figure out their interplay in order to compile a source string .
Half of them are JavaFile or JavaFileManager classes / interfaces so what ’s actually peripheral has moved to the center .
The JavaCompiler API is new to Java 6 and it seems dynamic compilation did n’t work out of the box prior to release 6 .
I suppose one had to call javac from the command line or use a different compiler such as Janino .
There is n’t any easy way to get into the compiler API .
The JSR 199 is n’t exactly a design document but a terse javadoc API documentation .
Tutorials are rare and mostly superficial in that they cover the most simple use case only .
A notable exception is an introduction written by Andrew Davison .
It covers the most relevant use cases and more .
Alternatively one might skim through the tests of the JDK 6 .
It contains expression evaluation code written by the JSR 199 implementor Peter von der Ahé .
Once again tests are documentation .
The Jython 2.5 code I ’ll present follows Davisons article and is mostly a transcript of his Java code in the relevant parts .
The JavaCompiler API from Jython
Prerequisites : a JDK for Java 6 has to be installed first .
The Java compiler tools are implemented in
< JDK - Path>/lib/tools.jar
and that path has to be added to the Java class path when Jython is invoked .
Alternatively you can add the path to the PYTHONPATH inside of your application .
I ’ll chose the latter approach here :
import sys sys .
path .
append ( os . path .
join ( os .
environ [ " JAVA_HOME " ] , " lib " , " tools.jar " ) )
The environment variable JAVA_HOME has to be set to your JDK path – not to the JRE path .
This might have to be changed .
In case of my Windows notebook the path is
JAVA_HOME = C: \Programme\Java\jdk1.6.0_13 .
Another configuration aspect concerns access to protected members of Java classes .
By default this is disabled in Jython .
We will need to access protected member functions once we override a Java class loader .
For that reason one has to set following disrespectful flag in Jythons registry file
python.security.respectJavaAccessibility = false
For more information see the Jython FAQ .
Now we are ready to import the compiler tools :
from javax .
tools import * from com. sun .
tools . javac .
api import JavacTool compiler = JavacTool. create ( ) assert compiler
The CompilationTask
After having created a compiler instance we now care about the CompilationTask which is defined in JSR 199 .
It is basically a callable , an interface which specifies a parameter - less call ( ) method that returns a value of type Boolean .
It is this callmethod that has to be overridden in subclasses and called for compilation .
In case of the JavaCompiler framework one does n’t have to override the CompilationTaskexplicitly but fetches it from the compiler object using the the getTask method :
JavaCompiler .
CompilationTask getTask ( Writer out , JavaFileManager fileManager , DiagnosticListener & lt ;?
super JavaFileObject & gt ; diagnosticListener , Iterable & lt ; String & gt ; options , Iterable & lt ; String & gt ; classes , Iterable & lt ;?
extends JavaFileObject & gt ; compilationUnits )
The parameters need further examination but once we have understood how to create the objects required to fetch the CompilationTask the compilation is performed by
compiler .
getTask ( ... ) . call ( )
The meaning of the parameters of the CompilationTask is as follows :
Parameters :
out – a Writer for additional output from the compiler ; use System.err if null
fileManager – a file manager ; if null use the compiler ’s standard filemanager
diagnosticListener – a diagnostic listener ; if null use the compiler ’s default method for reporting diagnostics
options – compiler options , null means no options
classes – class names ( for annotation processing ) , null means no class names
compilationUnits – the compilation units to compile , null means no compilation units
For now we will ignore the out parameter as well as compiler options and class names passed to the annotation processors .
The compilationUnits holds the source code to be compiled .
In case of Jython it will be a Python list containing a single JavaFileObject .
So a call of getTask will have the following shape
compiler .
getTask ( None , fileManager , diagnosticListener , None , None , [ source ] ) . call ( )
Diagnostics
DiagnosticCollectors are used for error reporting .
A DiagnosticCollector implements a DiagnosticListener interface .
It is parametrized by some type S and holds a possibly empty list of Diagnostic < S > objects which can be fetched .
We only need to know as much about diagnostics to handle failure cases :
if not task .
call ( ) : msg = "
" + "
" . join ( str ( d ) for d in diagnostics .
getDiagnostics ( ) ) raise JavaCompilationError ( msg )
The JavaCompilationError is a custom Jython exception .
The JavaCompiler API does n’t raise an exception on compilation failure .
JavaFileObject
The JavaFileObject specifies a file abstraction .
For our own purposes we need two of them : one that is readable and holds the source code ( a string ) and one that is writable and holds the bytecode ( an array of bytes ) .
Both derive from SimpleJavaFileObject which provides an implementation of the JavaFileObject interface .
from java .
net import URI from java .
io import * class StringJFO ( SimpleJavaFileObject ) : ''' JavaFileObject implemention used to hold the source code . ''' def __init__ ( self , className , codestr ) : self .
codestr = codestr super ( StringJFO , self ) .
__init__ ( URI ( className ) , JavaFileObject .
Kind .
SOURCE ) def getCharContent ( self , errs ) : return self .
codestr class ByteArrayJFO ( SimpleJavaFileObject ) : ''' JavaFileObject implementation used to hold the byte code . ''' def __init__ ( self , className , kind ) : super ( ByteArrayJFO , self ) .
__init__ ( URI ( className ) , kind ) self .
baos = ByteArrayOutputStream ( ) def openInputStream ( self ) : return ByteArrayInputStream ( self .
getByteArray ( ) ) def openOutputStream ( self ) : return self .
baos def getByteArray ( self ) : return self .
baos .
to ByteArray ( )
In case of the ByteArrayJFO a writable ByteArrayOutputStream is created that can be fetched by the framework using the openInputStream method .
An instance of StringJFO will become our compilationUnit and an instance of ByteArrayJFO will be returned by a still to be defined FileManager :
class ByteJavaFileManager ( ForwardingJavaFileManager ) : def __init__ ( self , fileManager ) : super ( ByteJavaFileManager , self ) .
__init__ ( fileManager ) self .
code =
None def getJavaFileForOutput ( self , location , className , kind , sibling ) : self .
code = ByteArrayJFO
( className , kind ) return self .
code
A Java compiler in Jython
Now we can put all those things together and define a compileClass function .
def compileClass ( className , codeStr , * flags ) : compiler = JavacTool. create ( ) assert compiler , " Compiler not found " diagnostics = DiagnosticCollector ( ) jfm = ByteJavaFileManager ( compiler .
getStandardFileManager ( diagnostics , None , None ) ) task = compiler .
getTask ( None , jfm , diagnostics , flags , None , [ StringJFO ( className + " . java " , codeStr ) ] ) if not task .
call ( ) : e = "
" + "
" . join ( str ( d ) for d in diagnostics .
getDiagnostics ( ) ) raise JavaCompilationError ( e ) return jfm .
code
In order to initialize the StringJFO object we have to pass a file name which corresponds to the the class name we use .
The return values of compileClass is an object of type ByteArrayJFO that holds the byte code .
Adding a ClassLoader
We are almost done .
To complete our exercise we have to make the byte code executable which means we have to define a class loader and create an actual Java class .
Since we operate from within Jython it will be immediately wrapped into a Python type .
from java .
lang import ClassLoader from java .
lang import ClassNotFoundException class ByteClassLoader ( ClassLoader ) : def __init__ ( self , code ) : super ( ByteClassLoader , self ) .
__init__ ( ClassLoader . getClassLoader ( ) ) self .
code = code def findClass ( self , className ) : code = self .
code .
getByteArray ( ) cl = self .
defineClass ( className , code , 0 , len ( code ) ) if cl is None : raise ClassNotFoundException ( className ) else : return cl def createJavaClass ( className , codeStr , * compilerflags ) : loader = ByteClassLoader ( compileClass ( className , codeStr , * compilerflags ) ) return loader .
loadClass ( className )
To a very good end we have hidden the JavaCompiler API behind a single function with a tiny interface .
There is not something Python has been needed for actually .
The JavaCompiler API is a Swiss Army knife style API that requires a whole object tree to be created to achieve a simple effect .
Java classes from within Jython
Finally we want to demonstrate the value of our implementation showing a few simple examples .
The jcompile .py module contains the complete code and can be downloaded here .
The first example is our “ Hello Jython ” :
codeStr = " " " public class Foo { public static void main ( String args [ ] )
{ System.out.println ( " Hello , " +args [ 0 ] ) ; } } " " " Foo = createJavaClass ( " Foo " , codeStr ) print Foo # < type ' Foo ' > Foo. main ( [ " Jython ! " ] ) # Hello , Jython !
In our next example we import some symbols from a Java library :
codeStr = ''' import java.lang .
Math ; public class Prime { public static Boolean is Prime ( double n ) { for ( int d=2;d<=Math.sqrt(n ) ;d++ ) { if ( n %d == 0 ) return false ; } return true ; } } ' '' Prime = createJavaClass ( " Prime " , codeStr ) Prime . is Prime ( 2 ) # True Prime . is Prime ( 9971 ) # False Prime . is Prime ( 9973 ) # True
— — — —— Update !
We. 2009-24-06 — — — ——
–
Right now it is not possible to derive a class from a dynamically compiled Java class .
If Foo is a dynamically generated Java class and Baris defined as
class Bar ( Foo ) : pass
then a ClassNotFoundException is raised .
The only possible workaround I see right now is to store the class to the disk and import it right after this .
A possible adaption of the createJavaClass function looks like :
def createJavaClass ( className , codeStr , todisk = True , remove = True , * compilerflags ) : '''
Compiles and loads a new Java class . ''' compiled = compileClass ( className , codeStr , * compilerflags ) if todisk : code = compiled .
getByteArray ( ) clsfile = open ( className + " .class " , " wb " ) try : code .
tofile ( clsfile ) finally : clsfile .
close ( ) jclass = __import__ ( className ) if remove : os .
remove ( className + " .class " ) return jclass else : loader = ByteClassLoader ( compileClass ( className , codeStr , * compilerflags ) ) return loader .
loadClass ( className )

log in | register How Your HDTV is Holding Back Your Games
By RevolvingDork
In one form or another , lag is something that most gamers have had to contend with .
In the 90s , " lag " usually referred to network latency .
It was a direct reflection of the speed and stability of your internet connection .
A low ping time could be the difference between a visceral game of Quake and trudging through a soup of seemingly random death .
Thanks to more widespread broadband internet access and better programming tricks , network latency is n't as big a problem as it once was .
Unfortunately , modern technology has introduced a new type of lag into our games : HDTV processing lag .
What causes processing lag ?
HDTV processing lag ( also known as " input lag " ) is a phenomenon that is unique to modern televisions .
In the pursuit of making the end picture better , TV manufacturers have built a myriad of video processing filters into their products .
These filters have been designed to aesthetically benefit the playback of movies and broadcast TV .
This video processing lengthens the time between a signal being passed from its source ( your DVD player , antenna , or game system ) and the resulting picture being displayed on the screen .
Please note that processing lag is a completely seperate entity from response time , which is the time it takes any given pixel of a display to go from black to white and back again .
Manufacturers often advertise their response time figures in milliseconds ( ms ) .
Response time has no bearing on processing lag .
How does processing lag affect videogames ?
Generally speaking , this delay is in the ballpark of a fraction of a second .
In the case of non-real - time media like broadcast TV and movies , it does n't make much of a difference .
The signal may be delayed , but it does n't matter because you are n't interacting with it .
In the case of console videogames , this situation is less than ideal .
Your console is working in real - time ;
When you press the A button it makes Mario jump .
If your display is portraying the jump late , the game begins to fall somewhere between sloppy and unplayable .
This type of lag is most apparent in games where split - second timing is an inherent part of how they 're played .
Music games like Rock Band , Guitar Hero , and Dance Dance Revolution can be crippled by processing lag .
What about in - game calibration ?
In the cases of Rock Band and Guitar Hero , game developers have implemented video calibration options that attempt to compensate for this lag .
The newest Rock Band instruments have even gone so far as to include sensors you can use to calibrate the game automatically by holding them up to your screen .
These options work well enough to combat video lag , but there 's another issue that calibration alone can't alleviate : audio lag .
Audio signals are subject to similar degrees of laggy processing .
The end result is the same ; audio is played slightly later than the source sends it out .
Modern music games have additional calibration settings for audio lag but you will quickly discover that they provide no substitution for real - time sound .
When you beat the drums during a freestyle fill or sing into the microphone , the actual sound is reflected by your TV later than " truth " .
This results in a very unpleasant echo effect that drains the fun out of improvised drumming .
How can I eliminate processing lag ?
We 've established that modern TVs introduce video / audio lag and that it's a bad thing for games .
What can we do about it ?
Sadly , there is no way to entirely eliminate processing lag in modern flat - panel televisions .
Every flat - panel TV currently being manufactured for the consumer market will introduce some degree of lag .
Older non-HD CRT ( cathode ray tube ) displays are your only option for real - time gameplay .
Without going off the deep end and buying outdated analog TVs , let 's do our best to mitigate the damage .
You can try to find an HDTV that utilizes less video processing and therefore introduces less lag .
Unfortunately , TV manufacturers do not include this information in their specifications .
Worse yet , most professional audio / video reviewers do n't mention processing lag in their reports .
This kind of information can only be found online anecdotally in places like the AV Science forums ( a fantastic resource , for a message board ) .
Before making a big purchase , you should absolutely test out prospective TVs in person .
Bring your console to the electronics store , plug it into a set , and measure the lag ( again , music games are best for this ) .
You might look obsessive but you 'll be much happier later on knowing that you bought the best device for your hobby .
If you own a big fancy HDTV and you want to cut down its processing lag , you have a few options .
1. Ensure that your console is outputting video at the display 's native resolution whenever possible .
The native resolution of a television is generally the highest resolution it can display .
If you have a 1080 p display but your console is feeding it 720 p , the TV will have to perform additional calculations to make it fit the screen .
2. Check to see if your TV has a " game mode " .
Some TVs have a lower - latency video setting that turns off some bells and whistles to get the picture to the screen faster .
Some have multiple game settings , so be sure to delve into your TV 's manual to find them all .
3 . Manually turn off every video processing option your TV gives you access to .
You can usually identify these as a stream of acronyms : DRE , ACL , CTI , 3DNR .
Turn them all off .
You will sacrifice some picture clarity but you 'll gain precious milliseconds .
4 . You can eliminate audio lag by connecting the audio cables from your console directly into an analog stereo receiver .
This may prove problematic if you 're using a digital audio output method like HDMI , but you may be able to find a good digital receiver that 's faster than your TV if you 're using external speakers .
5 . If you 're using an AV receiver , be sure to turn on its video pass - through option to send your console 's signal along without any laggy preprocessing .
Some receivers do n't have this option , so be careful .
HDTV processing lag is a complicated issue that is widely swept under the rug .
This post is intended as a starting point to combat the general lack of knowledge about this subject .
If you 've got any other tips for reducing lag , please post them in the comments -- these are the solutions that have worked best for me , and I 'm sure there 's a great deal more to learn .

Escaping its growing reputation for religious intolerance and bigotry is going to be much harder than most devoted members of the Republican Party figured .
The party ’s two leading figures in Arkansas , the only avowed candidate for the U. S. Senate and the party ’s state chairman , went to local party gatherings and uttered such nonsense that it won them national attention , the kind of attention no party wants .
State Sen. Kim Hendren of Gravette , who is running for the Republican nomination for the Senate and is so far unopposed , was trying to win over the Pulaski County Republican Committee , which did not like his vote for the cigarette tax increase back in March , so he attacked Sen.
Charles Schumer of New York , a liberal Democrat whose unflattering mention he thought would certainly get a good response from the Republicans .
He could not think of Schumer ’s name , so he called him “ that Jew . ”
Committee members fed the remark to a Republican blogger , a former campaign worker for Mike Huckabee , and it went on the Internet .
Hendren said he was trying to make the point that he stood for traditional family values while the Jew did not .
The Arkansas Young Republicans denounced the “ anti-Semitic and derogatory personal attack . ”
Other Republicans put some distance between themselves and the maverick senator .
So Thursday Hendren apologized and said he never intended to derogate the senator ’s religion and that he had no antipathy for Jews .
Ever the gentleman , Sen .
Schumer said simply , “ apology accepted . ”
Hendren explained that he was prone to stick his foot in his mouth , which he has demonstrated from time to time .
His candor and independence sometimes are admirable .
But the loose remark about a senator who is many things -- a Democrat , usually a liberal , a decent and intelligent man -- but who happens also to be a Jew betrays something disturbing about Hendren .
He assumed that his audience would know the man primarily by his religion and would share his contempt for it .
He will have plenty of chances now to regain the esteem of tolerant people of all faiths in a party that actually does embrace different faiths , including Jews .
He has virtually assured opposition in his own party , so there will be abundant opportunities for him to show tolerance for different religious beliefs , ethnic and social backgrounds and points of view .
Doyle Webb , the state Republican chairman and a former state senator , has more to atone for .
While making the circuit of Lincoln Day Republican gatherings , Webb distinguished between himself and Democrats by saying he was for the Ten Commandments and the Democratic Party was not .
Webb ’s own career has not been a particularly good example , but Democrats against the Ten Commandments ?
He described the Democratic Party as the party of lesbians and people who were not as good Christians as he was .
Webb went further and attacked a state representative from Little Rock , Kathy Webb , who is unrelated .
In the Lincoln Day talks the Republican leader said there was a Democratic legislator who was a lesbian and , he implied , not a follower of the Ten Commandments or a devotee of family values .
The day might be coming , he warned , when a lesbian would be “ in charge of the state budget . ”
He was referring to Rep. Webb , who probably will be co-chair of the Legislative Joint Budget Committee in 2011 .
Doyle Webb apparently did not serve in the legislature long enough to learn that the chairs of the Budget Committee are not “ in charge of the state budget ” but happen to have a vote the same as other committee members and other legislators .
He may have merely been saying that lesbians are not good with arithmetic .
Ignorance and bigotry are a bad combination .
They are the weapons of the demagogue .
Ms. Webb took the attack in stride .
She said she would like to meet with Mr. Webb and share her own thoughts about family values .
Let her describe them :
“ First , my parents were happily married for 68 years , and my siblings and I get along very well .
My Dad is a retired United Methodist pastor .
I serve on the Missions Committee at First United Methodist Church , and chair the Green Team there .
Last year , I spoke from the pulpit during Lent to help raise money for hunger relief .
I am privileged to serve on both the Arkansas Foodbank Network and Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance boards ....
Today , I was one of 10 legislators honored by the Arkansas Kids Count Coalition as a Legislative Champion .
My parents raised me to help those who are less fortunate than I , that to whom much is given , much is expected , and to love my neighbors . ”
And Doyle Webb ’s values ?
Seven and a half years ago , the Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct rebuked and fined him for unethical conduct in his law practice .
He was the attorney for an 86 - year - old woman who was in the advanced stages of Parkinson ’s disease .
He arranged for a lawyer who practiced with him to change the sick woman ’s will to make Webb the beneficiary of $ 321,000 from her estate instead of her heirs .
Three judges in Saline County , who seem to have been outraged , sent the case to the ethics committee .
We like Kathy Webb ’s family values better than Doyle’s .
Most Republicans do , too .
They deserve leaders who share them both in word and deed .
Sure , Arkansas voters went overwhelmingly ( 638,017 to 422,310 ) for McCain over Obama , and yes , the state has two of the absolute worst and most reactionary Democratic senators , imbecile Mark Pryor and corrupt corporate pawn Blanche Lincoln .
Chances are , you read about or heard the Arkansas state Senate 's GOP whip and Republican Party U.S. Senate candidate , Kim Hendren last week .
It was a national story .
But you probably do n't know much about state Rep. Kathy Webb , a Democrat representing downtown Little Rock , her party 's whip , and the first ever openly gay elected official in Arkansas -- and the only one serving in the state legislature .
She got some of that same ole Arkansas Republican treatment , but for some reason the national media is n't picking up on the homophobia the way they picked right up on the anti-Semitism .
Once Hendren popped the cork on GOP bigotry last week , it all started gushing out .
Not only was Chuck Schumer " that Jew , " suddenly Kathy Webb was " that lesbian . "
An editorial in thetook it very seriously and urged its readers not to tolerate bigotry I hopeis correct about most Republicans liking Kathy 's family values better than Doyle's .
But I have no idea what they base that on .
All I read is about how Republican leaders are determined to use hatred and bigotry for political gain .
You 've got to admire the strength and convictions of a woman like Kathy Webb to follow a career in public service in the face of the systemic ugliness that is today 's Republican Party .
Let 's hope that when term limits ends her service in the Arkansas House in 2012 , she decides to keep right on serving .
Without men and women like Kathy Webb , we would all be at the mercy of people like Doyle Webb , Kim Hendren and Rush Limbaugh .
Labels : Arkansas , Doyle Webb , GOP homophobia , Kathy Webb , Kim Hendren , Republican hypocrisy
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The nation 's roads , bridges , power grid , water supply , schools and transit systems are all in a state of disrepair due to under - funding - and the proposed stimulus plan will not go far enough to solve the problem , according to a report released Wednesday .
The American Society of Civil Engineers , which represents 146,000 engineers across the country and grades the nation 's infrastructure every four years , assigned a " D " grade to the country 's infrastructure .
The group said the cost to repair crumbling public structures has risen to $ 2.2 trillion from $ 1.7 trillion in 2005 .
" The nation 's infrastructure crisis is endangering our future prosperity , " ASCE President Wayne Klotz said at a press conference .
" Crumbling infrastructure has a direct impact on our personal and economic health . "
The group rated 15 infrastructure categories , none of which received a grader higher than " C+. "
Drinking water , inland waterways , levees , roads and wastewater facilities all received a " D- , " the lowest grades on the 2009 report card .
Roads got a particularly poor grade , as Americans spend an estimated 4.2 billion hours a year stuck in traffic , which costs the economy about $ 78.2 billion a year , according to ASCE .
Highway construction is set to receive $ 30 billion from the stimulus plan - the largest portion of infrastructure spending in the bill .
The national power grid , another key project in the stimulus plan , got a " D+. " ASCE said public investment on the grid has not met rising demand for power and electric utility investment needs could rise to $ 1.5 trillion in 20 years .
President Obama has proposed updating the existing structure to a new " smart " grid .
But even if the federal government passes its economic stimulus plan , ASCE still estimates that infrastructure will be under - funded by $ 1.1 trillion .
State and federal spending will only amount to $ 903 billion in the next five years , according to the group 's estimates , and stimulus spending is expected to be less than $ 100 billion .
The group said the stimulus program would amount to a good start , but the country " clearly still has a long way to go . "
" By all accounts , infrastructure investment only represents a small percentage of the overall package , " said Klotz .
" Even with the stimulus package , there remains a still significant - some would say staggering - $ 1.1 trillion gap in funding . "
Still , Klotz supported the bill , calling government 's effort a historic level of leadership . "
He said that each billion dollars spent on infrastructure supports 35,000 jobs and is a key element of the economy 's recovery efforts .
The report also presented several broad solutions to the problem , including increasing infrastructure investment on a state and federal level , promoting a culture of sustainability and developing plans for future public works programs .
Last night Bill Moyers Journal had an excellent fact based expose on Single Payer Insurance .
Some clips are used to illustrate the realities behind why we must have such a system .
President Obama understands that the state of our health insurance system will bankrupt both the country and individuals within .
In fact he understood that single payer insurance was the only way out in 2003 .
If he does not use his ability to educate the masses as to what is at stake and support Single Payer Healthcare Insurance unnecessary deaths will continue .
It would be the equivalent of Health Insurance Sanctioned Manslaughter .

Fatty Diet Linked to Pancreatic Cancer
High Saturated Fat Levels Raise Risk of the Cancer by More Than a Third , Study Says
To the risk of obesity and heart attack , the government had added yet another reason to avoid eating lots of fat , especially from meat and dairy products : pancreatic cancer .
The National Institutes of Health has determined that people who indulge heavily in meat and dairy fats are likely more to develop this deadly disease , which will strike more than 42,000 Americans this year and kill more than 35,000 , according to the American Cancer Society .
Men and women who consumed large amounts of saturated fat were 36 percent more likely to suffer from pancreatic cancer , researchers reported online in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute .
The study found that the link between fat intake and cancer was strongest for saturated fat from animal food sources , which were associated with a 43 percent increase in cancer risk .
To reach their conclusion , NIH researchers analyzed records of more than 500,000 people enrolled in the National Institutes of Health - AARP Diet and Health Study .
Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire in 1995 and 1996 and were followed to track a variety of health issues , including pancreatic cancer .
Over an average follow - up of 6.3 years , 865 men and 472 women were diagnosed with exocrine pancreatic cancer .
Among the participants who consumed the highest amounts of total fats , the rate of cancer was 53 percent higher for men and 23 percent higher for women , compared to participants with the lowest fat diets .
Combining the data for men and women , the researchers found that total fat consumption was associated with 23 percent higher rates of pancreatic cancer , while high intake of monosaturated fats was associated with 22 percent higher cancer rates .
They theorized that the association between fat intake and pancreatic cancer could be related to the so - called exocrine function of the pancreas , which excretes enzymes such as those that help digest fat .
They also noted that studies have linked saturated fat to insulin resistance and that diabetes and insulin resistance have been associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk .
Diet Link to Pancreatic Cancer Needs More Study
In an accompanying editorial , two prominent cancer researchers praised the NIH team , although they noted that more research would be necessary to definitively prove a direct link between fat intake and pancreatic cancer .
Dr. Brian Wolpin of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and Dr. Meir Stampfer of the Harvard School of Public Health noted that pancreatic cancer kills 95 percent of its victims , and though it 's far less common than many other types , it 's the nation 's fourth leading cause of cancer deaths .
Overall , they called on scientists " to push our research efforts in novel directions and provide hope for meaningful progress in this highly lethal disease . "

In the last episode we saw that PLT Scheme performs much more instantiation and visiting of modules than other implementations .
The reason for such behaviour is that PLT Scheme aims to avoid cross - phase side effects .
In this episode I explain what cross - phase side effects are and why they are evil .

Mutating variables across modules
There are situations where it is handy to mutate a global variable or a data structure across modules , for instance to keep a counter or a registry of objects .
However , direct mutation of exported variables is forbidden by the R6RS standard .
Consider for instance a module exporting a variable x and a function incr-x with side effects affecting that variable :
# !r6rs ( library ( experimental mod1 ) ( export x incr - x ) ( import ( rnrs ) ) ( define x 0 ) ( define ( incr - x ) ( set ! x (+ 1 x ) ) x ) )
This kind of side effect is ruled out by the R6RS specification ( section 7.2 ) : exported variables must be immutable .
This is the reason why Ikarus , Ypsilon and Larceny reject the code with errors like attempt to export mutated variable or attempt to modify immutable variable .
The current SVN version PLT Scheme also raises an error , but the official version ( 4.1.5 at the time of this writing ) is buggy ( I submitted the bug report ) .
Mutating internal variables Consider now a module exporting a function with side effects affecting a non-exported variable : #!r6rs ( library ( experimental mod2 ) ( export get - x incr - x ) ( import ( rnrs ) ) ( define x 0 ) ( define ( get - x ) x ) ( define ( incr - x ) ( set ! x (+ 1 x ) ) x ) ( display " Instantiated mod2
" ) )
This is a valid library which compiles correctly .
The accessor function get-x gives access to the internal variable x .
We may import it at the REPL and we may experiment with it : $ ikarus > ( import ( experimental mod2 ) ) ; this does not instantiate mod2 immediately > ( get -x ) ; now mod2 must be instantiated Instantiated mod2 0 > ( incr - x ) 1 > ( incr - x ) 2 > ( get - x ) 2 Everything works as one would expect .
However , things are trickier when phase separation enters in the game .
Mutating variables across phases A Scheme implementation exhibits a cross - phase side effect if mutating a variable at expand time affects the value of the same variable at run-time .
All R6RS implementations - except PLT
Scheme which uses different instances for different phases - may have cross - phase side effects .
On the other hand , in all R6RS implementations cross - phase side effects can be avoided by using separated compilation .
In order to give a concrete example , consider the following script : $ cat use - mod2.ss ( import ( rnrs ) ( sweet - macros ) ( for ( experimental mod2 ) expand run ) ) ( def- syntax m ( lambda ( x ) ( display " At expand - time x= " ) ( display ( incr- x ) ) ( newline ) " m- expanded " ) ) ( m ) ( begin ( display " At run- time x= " ) ( display ( incr- x ) ) ( newline ) )
Here we formally import the module mod2 twice , both at run-time and at expand time .
In PLT Scheme ( which is the only implementation with explicit phasing and multiple instantiation ) there are two fully separated instances of the module , and running the script returns the following : $ plt - r6rs use - mod2.ss Instantiated mod2
At expand - time x=1 Instantiated mod2
At run-time x=1
The fact that x was incremented at compile - time has no effect at run-time , since the run-time variable x belongs to a completely different instance of the module .
In systems with single instantiation instead , there is only a single instance of the module for all phases , so that incrementing x at expand - time has effect at run-time : $ ikarus -- r6rs - script use - mod2.ss Instantiated mod2
At expand - time x=1
At run-time x=2
You would get the same with Ypsilon and Larceny ( Larceny has explicit phasing but single instantiation and if you import a module in more than one phase the variables are shared amongst the phases , so that cross - phase side effects may happen ) .
The phase crossing effect only happens because the script is executed immediately after compilation in the same process .
Having compile - time effects affecting run-time values is evil , since it breaks separate compilation .
If we turn the script into a library and we compile it separately , it is clear than the run-time value of x cannot be affected by the compile - time value of x ( maybe the code was compiled 10 years ago ! ) .
Cross - phase side effects and separate compilation
Let me explain in detail how separate compilation works in Ikarus , Ypsilon and PLT Scheme .
Suppose we turn the previous script into a library : $ cat mod3.ss #!r6rs ( library ( experimental mod3 ) ( export run ) ( import ( rnrs ) ( sweet - macros ) ( for ( experimental mod2 ) expand run ) ) ( def- syntax m ( lambda ( x ) ( display " At expand - time x= " ) ( display ( incr- x ) ) ( newline ) " m- expanded " ) ) ( define ( run ) ;; this is executed at runtime ( display " At run- time x= " ) ( display ( incr- x ) ) ( newline ) ) ( m ) ;; this is executed at expand time ) and let us invoke this library though a script use - mod3.ss : #!r6rs ( import ( rnrs ) ( experimental mod3 ) ) ( run )
If we use PLT Scheme , the value of x is the same as before : $ plt - r6rs use - mod3.ss Instantiated mod2
At expand - time x=1 Instantiated mod2 Instantiated mod2
At run-time x=1
This is expected : turning a script into a library did not make anything magic happens ( actually mod2 is being instantiated once more during the compilation of mod3 , but that should not be surprising ) .
On the other hand , things are very different if we run the same code under different implementations .
For instance in Ypsilon the first time the script is run it prints three lines : $ ypsilon -- r6rs use - mod3.ss Instantiated mod2
At expand - time x=1
At expand - time x=2
At run-time x=3
However , if we run the script again it prints just two lines : $ ypsilon -- r6rs use - mod3.ss Instantiated mod2
At run-time x=1
The reason is that the first time Ypsilon compiles the libraries , using the same module instance , so that there is a single x variable which is incremented twice at expand time and once at run-time .
The second time there is nothing to recompile , so only the run - time x variable is incremented , and there is no reference to the compile time instance .
The situation for Ikarus is slightly different .
If we use the -- r6rs - script flag we get the same output as before , when mod3 was just a script : $ ikarus -- r6rs - script use - mod3.ss Instantiated mod2
At expand - time x=1
At run-time x=2
However , this only happens because Ikarus is compiling all the libraries at the same time ( whole compilation ) .
If we use separate compilation we get : $ ikarus -- compile - dependencies use- mod3.ss Instantiated mod2
At expand - time x=1 Serializing " /home/micheles/gcode/scheme/experimental/mod3.sls.ikarus-fasl " ...
Serializing " /home/micheles/gcode/scheme/experimental/mod2.sls.ikarus-fasl " ...
As you see , the message At expand - time x=1 is printed when mod2 is compiled .
If we run the script use - mod3.ss now , we get just the run-time message : $ ikarus -- r6rs - script use - mod3.ss Instantiated mod2
At run-time x=1
In Ikarus , Ypsilon and Larceny , the same invocation of this script returns different results for the variable x , depending if the libraries have been precompiled or not .
This is ugly and error prone .
The multiple instantiation mechanism of PLT Scheme has been designed to avoid this problem : in PLT one consistently gets always the same result , which is the result one would get with separation compilation .
I must notice that you could get the same behavior in non-PLT implementations by spawning two separate processes , one after the other : the first to compile the script and its libraries , and the second to execute it .
That would make sure that incrementing x in the compilation phase would not influence the value of x at run-time .
Conclusion
This is the last episode of part IV .
You should have an idea of how the R6RS module system works , and you should be able to grasp the reasons behind the different implementation choices .
In particular , it should be clear that side effects are tricky , that you cannot rely on the compilation / visiting / instantiation procedure being the same in different implementations , that phase separation means different things in different Scheme systems .
Still , I have left out many relevant things .
In order to say everything there is to say about the subject , I should have at least doubled the number of episodes .
I did not want to get lost in excessive detail .
Instead , I have decided to continue my series with another block of episodes about macros , and to fill the remaining gaps about the module systems in future Adventures .
So , as always , stay tuned and keep reading !

Two luminous balls have fallen from the sky into a field near a village in Kazakhstan .
The Local Emergency Ministry is studying the objects , believed to be UFOs .
Residents of Razdolnoye village in Western Kazakhstan saw the UFOs at night .
“ This was around three o’clock in the morning , ” eyewitness Vladimir Bychkov told Interfax news agency Thursday .
“ I was near my tractor , and heard guys shouting : ‘ look , there are flying balls ! ’
They were big balls , and they had sparks falling off them – yellow , red , and green , ” Bychkov said .
The balls were reported to have fallen on agricultural lands .
“ We were afraid to approach them at first , but after they fell and cooled down , we came up to them and tried kicking them , ” another eyewitness , Viktor Dyakov , said .
He said the balls were made from a " weird " material .
“ We tried beating them with a chisel , but they did n’t give in , did n’t crease , only gave off sparks . ”
According to Dyakov , the balls are silvery in color and around 60 cm in diameter .
They also have a small hole on one side .
Emergency Ministry experts did not immediately give any comments .
I have been reading and listening to the anti-Ahmadinejad protests that have been going on in Iran for the past two weeks , and I had many things to say about it , but I would n’t want to write any of that now .
The BBC in particular is saying what I would have said about what is happening with the Basij fascists and the anti-establishment protesters .
So what follows is actually an analysis of the BBC ’s coverage .
The BBC is known as one of the most reputable news agencies in the world .
Yet it can be demonstrated that the BBC does not apply same amount of journalistic integrity to riots in countries that pass the liberal democracy test .
Consider two instances of rioting .
One , an anti-government protest in a nation belonging to the European Union , NATO , and the OECD .
The other , an anti-government protest in a nation labeled by the President of the Untied States as an “ axis of evil ” .
Consider two specific articles .
One was written during insurrected Greece in December and January of this year , Riots Push Greece to the Edge .
The other was written today about protest activity in corrupted Iran , Police Break Up New Tehran Rally .
Both articles are not taken out of context , and both adequately describe the media mood toward both situations .
The mood of the BBC , by the way , is the same that can be found in any other Western media outlet , CNN , the Economist , MSNBC , etc .
Western media can be shown to support the burning of police cars , the bombing of fascist headquarters , and will also take sides in election fraud accusations .
But they only support this activity when the situation is happening in an “ axis of evil ” country , like Iran .
Otherwise Western media take the side of “ history ” in the Fukuyaman sense .
I will use specific examples .
First consider this well - researched examination of 800 English and Afrikaans print articles during the Apartheid era in South Africa a good case in point .
Researchers Edward Bird and Zureida Garda found that the South African media was , as we would expect , helping the government suppress the black liberation movement using language that is very familiar today .
The same kind of language is used by Western media to put down anti-government activity originating in the West .
Bird and Garda found that whites were represented in the media as “ victims ” and blacks were reduced to “ unidentifiable ” masses .
For example , in 1976 blacks in the Soweto uprising / massacre were represented as “ mobs ” who were “ bent on anarchy , looting and arson . ”
Whites were there to keep the peace ( by murdering blacks . )
Bird and Garda say this ideology produced a psychosis motivated and encouraged by discourse in the South African media .
The representation of the threatening mob fed into the apartheid motivated discourse of a “ Swart gevaar ” where huge numbers of black people who could not be contained threatened the social , physical , and ideological space of white South Africans .
Specific examples :
The use of language such as “ tsotsis ” and “ drunken rioters ” added to the criminal image established …
The protest actions thus moved into the sphere of the criminal .
Whilst the police ’s actions in firing live ammunition at unarmed students ( ‘ Automatics used on rioting mobs ’ The Star 17/6/1976 ) , and their attempt to prevent wounded students being treated at Baragwanath ( ‘ … armed police refusing to admit a 14 year - old school boy who had been shot three times ’
Rand Daily Mail 18/6/1976 ) was not seen as being negative or unacceptable .
The police were instead represented as keepers of law and order .
The role of the police perpetuated the “ war psychosis , ” as they called it , where armed police were needed to hold the blacks at bay .
In the years after 1976 , the role of the media was the same , but the tactics of the media became more “ sophisticated ” as time went on .
Let ’s bring ourselves up to date .
2009 began as Greece suffered a sophisticated riot psychosis .
The BBC and other Western media referred to Greek demonstrators as “ self - styled anarchists ” ( NYTimes and FOX , but many more ) , “ half - educated to functionally literate , spoiled , aggressive ” ( The Economist ) , “ mobs of youth ” ( everyone ) , “ a small group of hardcore anarchists ” ( Reuters ) , and even “ extremists who take refuge in acts of extreme violence ” ( Associated Press ) .
These words were meant to establish the criminal image of the demonstrators , the factory occupiers , and motivate their repression by police .
The police were almost immediately forgiven by the media after the initial murdering of the young Athenian boy , which started the riots .
The real media demons were the anarchists , not the police , and anybody who participated in demonstrating was equivocated with the anarchist movement .
Police were portrayed as keepers of law and order , as in South Africa .
Yet demonstrators all along viewed the police as the “ straw which broke the camel ’s back ” sparking the demonstrations .
The article , Riots Push Greece to the Edge , starts like this :
“ Pulsating punk rock was stoking up the black - clad army of students outside the University of Athens … ”
Now , this is the BBC , one of the most “ reputable ” news agencies in the West .
I am not going to innumerate the many awards it has received for excellence in reporting over the years .
But notice that we are never told what kind of music the Iranian demonstrators are listening to .
The situation in Greece is treated as a joke , as a punk show festival .
But even a police helicopter flying over Tehran is treated as the most menacing sight you could imagine .
The BBC focuses , for example , on class dynamics in the European Union country riots .
The BBC described the Greek demonstrations as attracting only unemployed university graduates .
“ We know the protesters are not workers , ” Prime Minister Karamanlis was reported to have said , “ because the workers are at work . ”
The Czech news media used the same tactics during the Prague Spring in 1968 , in an attempt to pit lower class workers against snobby rich college students .
Ultimately that tactic was successful in Prague , as it was elsewhere .
This is how the BBC concealed this stereotype :
At present , the demonstrations across Greece are mainly attracting students , high - school pupils , veteran leftist campaigners and members of the so called 700 - euro generation – disenchanted graduates who are unable to break through the ceiling of this nation ’s minimum wage .
The working and middle classes are staying away , perhaps because of the petrol bombs and tear gas .
But who are the working and middle classes , and how does the BBC know who they are ?
All classes were in the street .
You might have heard : people all over Greece occupied workplaces and universities in dozens of cities and islands .
This was a generalized riot , an occupation movement .
The petty bourgeoisie , the upwardly mobile classes , were busy tending to their shops .
The BBC ’s description is wrong , and blatantly classist .
According to the BCC , “ responsible ” politicians , are ones who were
condemning the violence and exerting tight discipline over their protest rallies .
Catch that in the BBC ’s mouth .
Today Iranian authorities are exerting tight discipline over protest rallies .
Yet the BBC would shoot itself in the foot to call Ahmadinejad , the police , or the Basij “ responsible . ”
In Iran protests are broken up with tear gas , too , and Basij militia soldiers beat people down with clubs and stand in menacing rows on street corners .
Greece also had militiamen operating in the open against demonstrators , stabbing people , shooting at them , and kidnapping immigrants .
They were called the Golden Dawn .
This militia hardly got any attention from the press .
For its coverage of Iran the BBC presents itself as a champion of liberal democracy by condemning all force against the right to freedom of speech .
I have not seen the BBC talk about a riotous situation so favorably as they do in articles about insurrecting Iran , such as in Police Break Up New Tehran Rally .
Eyewitnesses said hundreds of riot police were used to drive the protesters from the square .
On Monday afternoon , a police helicopter could be seen circling above the centre of Tehran .
Notice that the eyewitnesses are trusted , not played down .
The article does n’t mention what the eyewitnesses were wearing , what they smelled like , what kind of music they listened to , or even , whether they were protesters .
Riot police are used to drive away , ( which seems accurate enough in Greece , too ) .
But typically the media will say something like , riot police cleared the area of protesters after warning them to stay clear of the square ( as in Athens with Stygmata Square , too ) but then the protesters started to use the barricades as WEAPONS !
( So the police were justified … )
In Iran , the BBC talks to protesters seriously .
Iranian protesters are victims , and the police are unidentifiable masses , just the reverse of the South African Apartheid press .
The masses of Iranian people , while they are burning things in the street , are not allegedly “ bent on anarchy … ”
In Greece the BBC talks to protesters to poke fun at them , and talks to politicians to get the real perspective on the situation in Greece .
In fact , the very fact that many of the protesters in Greece called themselves anarchists piqued the curiosity of the press , which began referring to them as “ self - styled anarchists , ” as if this was somehow like calling yourself a “ self - styled nigger ” in South Africa .
The BBC article about Iran continues ,
Some Basij militiamen , who are being used as street - level enforcers , stood in groups armed with clubs while others rode around on motorbikes .
BBC Persian TV received an e-mail from one person saying : “ There are lots of people but they are scattered , and lots of police guards .
They are firing bullets in the air and using tear gas against the crowds . ”
In side streets , young people set fire to rubbish skips in what they said was a protest but also an attempt to combat the tear gas .
Some claimed not to be scared by the large show of force and threats from the Revolutionary Guards .
Is the BBC defending that burning trash heap because it wards away tear gas ?
I have never seen the BBC write about a burning blockade so favorably , except here .
This situation seems so much more dire because of the way the BBC is writing about this .
Scenes from Iran look just like Moldova last month , like Strasbourg ’s NATO summit in April , like Greece this past January , and Thailand during the ASEAN Summit , and to a much lesser extent like the G20 in London .
Yet the only difference is the writing style .
The style of communication the BBC is using now is a familiar type of psychosis .
It ’s the same style reminiscent of descriptions of Nazi tyranny .
It gives you the feeling you ’re being closed in on from every side by armed stormtroopers .
It ’s a descriptively anti-fascist style of writing .
Instead of producing a “ war psychosis , ” where news consumers are lead to believe police are the keepers are law and order who are needed to keep the anti-government protesters at bay , the BBC is producing an anti-fascist psychosis where just the opposite is true .
The mood of the spectacle is the only difference .
Steve Fielding recently asked the Obama administration to reassure him on the science of man-made global warming .
When the administration proved unhelpful , Mr. Fielding decided to vote against climate - change legislation .
If you have n't heard of this politician , it 's because he 's a member of the Australian Senate .
As the U.S. House of Representatives prepares to pass a climate - change bill , the Australian Parliament is preparing to kill its own country 's carbon - emissions scheme .
Why ?
A growing number of Australian politicians , ...

Sunnyvale , California - based Advanced Micro Devices has some big plans for its fans , as the chipmaker will reportedly updated both of its CPU and GPU lineups with new products due out in the near future .
Aside from the already rumored 45 nm - based processors , the company also plans to add a new Radeon graphics card , which will be largely based on the GPU of its current Radeon HD 4830 ( RV770LE ) .
According to recent reports , AMD is planning the launch of the Radeon HD 4730 , which will be featured with the RV770CE GPU .
As indicated by a recent post on Expreview , the upcoming card will still take advantage of AMD 's latest 55nm manufacturing technology and be released as a shrunk version of the Radeon HD 4830 , which is based on the RV770LE graphics processing unit .
However , the Radeon 4730 is based on the new RV770CE GPU and will be paired with GDDR5 memory chips , for increased performance .
As far as technical specifications go , the card 's core and memory frequencies have been set to 700/900 Mhz respectively .
AMD will apparently launch said card as an alternative to NVIDIA 's low - power , mainstream GeForce 9600 GT 512MB video accelerator .
In addition , according to available reports , the new card will allow AMD to provide its fans with a solution to the shortages of Radeon HD 4830 GPUs .
As far as performance goes , we still have to wait for some of the early benchmarks .
PowerColor will be among the first to unveil the new card , as the company 's design has already been leaked on the Internet , featuring a red PCB and an AC L2 Pro cooler .
The card apparently requires a considerable amount of power , as it has been featured with a 6 - pin external power connector .
The card is expected to become available next week for a price of US$ 79 .
Making money in the music industry is n't always as simple as negotiating a salary and waiting for your paycheck to come in .
The pay structure of many music industry jobs is based on percentages for one - off deals and freelance - style work , but different music industry careers are paid in different ways .
For this reason , the music career you choose will have a big impact on how you make money in the music business .
Here , you 'll find a look at how several common music industry jobs are paid — but remember , as always , that this information is general , and the deal you agree to will dictate your circumstances .
There are lots of different ways to make money in the music business , and many of them come down to percentages and contracts .
For this reason , everyone needs to be on the same page about how payments will take place .
Also , you should always get it in writing .

' We were scared and crying , we did n't know where we were or what was happening ' [ Jun. 12th , 2009 | 05:44 pm ] 6 Degrees 6degreesaa
[ vangthidi ]
Where I come from is very isolated , there is nothing around here and I did n't have any knowledge .
I was out walking with my girlfriend one evening when we met two men - I knew one of them from the village , and they asked us if we wanted make some money , because if we did they , could take us to the border to work .
We were interested , I did n’t have a chance to make a lot of money , so this sounded a good chance .
They said they would take us to a local bar to talk about it further , and we agreed .
But instead of taking us to the local town , they took us to Hassam town , the central provincial town .
It was late by now , midnight , and they said that there was a place for us to stay over and they would take us home in the morning .
We had no money and there was no transport , so we had no choice .
In the morning we got on the bikes and they said they were taking us home , but they did n’t .
They took us to Cao Bang province , where we ended up at what they said was their sister in law ’s house .
We had no idea where we were - I had never been far from my own village before , and I did not recognise the countryside .
It was only later that I found out we were already in China - they had taken us over the border secretly .
The woman in the house was nice at first - she offered us breakfast , but we refused .
She said she was going shopping , but when she left she locked us in the room .
We were scared and crying , we did n’t know where we were or what was happening .
Another woman came to us and told us we were alone and no one was coming for us .
She said we were hundreds of miles into china , and if we tried to leave we would be robbed and hurt .
We were very scared .
We found out my friend and I had been sold to two different families , they separated us and I was taken to a family in Lang Soon border area .
They locked me in and told me I must sleep with Chinese men for them .
I was so shocked .
I did not agree .
I knew nothing of men .
But they beat me and beat me and gave me no food for a whole week .
I thought I was going to die , I was weak and could no longer fight .
So I agreed to do it .
They told me I get no money , but if I do n't do it , then I get no food .
It makes me very downhearted .
I am so dispirited , but I can not get out .
The owner of the brothel was a Vietnamese , married to a Chinese .
I was there for , I think , a month in the end .
My friend had managed to escape and get back to Vietnam .
The owner of my brothel made me call her house , because they wanted to know if she had gone back home so they could follow her .
But they did not speak my language , so they did not know that I did not call the house of my friend , instead I called Mai ( local women ’s union worker ) and I told hurriedly where I was and the name of the woman holding me , and Mai called the police .
I was so worried the brothel owner would know what I had done , but she had no way of knowing , so I waited and held my breath .
Three days later the police came knocking at the door .
I was so worried that they would not find me , but they did , and they took me back home .
I was so happy .
That is the only way I can describe it - so happy .
But then I got back to my village , and everyone criticised me .
They said I had brought disgrace on them .
It made me terribly distressed .
Everyone was criticising me , they would not let me get on with my life .
I thought I was home , but I was not .
I wanted to commit suicide .
I had brought a very bad name on my family and all my relations .
Then I got some counselling ( through Women ’s union ) , and began to feel better .
I met a man who was very kind to me at first , but he abused my circumstance .
I became pregnant and he left me .
( I now have a four - year old son ) .
When my step - mother found out , she sent me away from the house , I had nowhere to live .
So I had to do domestic work through my pregnancy , so that I could have a room at the house I worked at .
Then I started learning skills through the project set up by the Women 's Union .
I was paid 10,000VND a day to work on weaving ( a sort of training allowance ) , and now I have learned to sew , I make and sell cushion covers for $ 2 a time .
This is double what I could make otherwise .
I now have my own house and I grow and sell maize .
I feel much more confident about the future , for the first time in a long time I can live my own life and I can also be a good mother and provide for my son .
I see all around me that there are still girls here who think it good to go to China , but I tell them it is much better here .
There may be money in China , but here you have your freedom .
Girls need to be more careful to protect themselves .
They need to know this is a danger to them .
We need to do more awareness raising to stop this happening .
I felt hopeless , they told me that Vietnam was very far away , and I believed them .
I knew no better .
They also told me that I had to work very hard to earn enough money to pay them back the amount they had paid for me , so that then they could free me .
But I did not know how much that was .
And I got no earnings .
I did n’t know this was n’t true .
I felt absolutely hopeless .
I tried desperately to work hard for them so they would let me go .
If I ever cried , the owner would beat me .
I am now so much more confident about the future , now I have work that means I can provide for my child .
After all that has happened , I now feel happy to stay here .
This is my home , and I do n’t want to leave .

C’est le premier martyr d’Hadopi .
Cet homme de 31 ans , Jérôme Bourreau - Guggenheim , respon­sable du pôle innovation web de TF1 , a été , selon nos informations , licencié pour avoir critiqué le projet de loi Création et Internet ( Hadopi ) .
Allons bon .
Mais il y a mieux : si Jérôme Bourreau a été viré par la Une , c’est suite à une dénonciation du… ministère de la Culture dont l’hôte , Christine Albanel , est l’artisan de la fameuse loi qui doit réprimer le téléchargement illégal .
Et la chaîne qui a abouti au licenciement ne serait pas complète sans mentionner la députée UMP de Paris Françoise de Panafieu : c’est auprès d’elle que Jérôme Bourreau s’est ouvert de ses critiques envers Hadopi .
Critiques transmises au ministère de la Culture qui les a transmises à TF1 .
Résultat : à la porte .
L’histoire commence le 19 février .
Ce jour là , Jérôme Bourreau , qui habite le XVIIe arrondissement de Paris , décide d’écrire à sa députée , Françoise de Panafieu .
Le sujet : Hadopi .
« Je suivais ça avec beaucoup d’attention , raconte Jérôme Bourreau à Libération , j’avais beaucoup lu sur la question , c’est un sujet qui me touche , d’abord parce que c’est mon métier , et puis parce que je suis passionné par le Web . »
Le nouveau et rutilant site de TF1 , c’est lui .
Pourquoi Panafieu ?
« Mes parents m’ont toujours appris que quand on n’est pas d’accord , plutôt que de critiquer , il faut agir . »
Alors il écrit , par mail , à Françoise de Panafieu , tout le mal qu’il pense de Hadopi .
Ce mail , il l’envoie de son adresse personnelle , chez Gmail .
D’abord , il se présente : études à Dauphine ( où , badine - t - il , il a rencontré le neveu de Panafieu ) , « diverses responsabilités dans le secteur des nouveaux médias » et aujourd ’hui « responsable du pôle innovation web » de TF1 .
Puis il déroule en termes mesurés son argumentaire anti-Hadopi .
Qu’il conclut ainsi : « Madame la députée , je compte sur ­votre clairvoyance pour porter ma voix . »
Mais sa voix va porter beaucoup plus loin .
Le 4 mars , il est convoqué par Arnaud Bosom , président de eTF1 qui s’occupe des activités numériques de la Une .
« Et là , raconte Jérôme Bourreau , il me lit le mail mot à mot !
Et me dit qu’il ne peut pas laisser passer ça , que je n’ai pas le droit d’avoir cette opinion .
Mais moi , je ne me suis pas écrasé , mon opinion est libre , et surtout je l’avais exprimée à titre privé dans une correspondance privée !»
Comment le mail envoyé à Panafieu atterrit - il sur le bureau de Bosom ?
Il lui explique que c’est le ministère de la Culture qui l ’a transmis .
A Jean -Michel Counillon , directeur juridique de TF1 , même si aujourd ’hui , officiellement , la Une dit n’en rien savoir .
En avril , Bourreau est ­convoqué à un entretien préalable à une sanction pouvant aller jusqu ’au licenciement .
Et c’est jusqu ’au licenciement que TF1 va .
Le 16 avril , Jérôme Bourreau reçoit sa lettre de « licenciement pour divergence forte avec la stratégie » de TF1 .
Etonnante lettre , dont Libération a eu copie : le groupe y reproche à son salarié son mail à Panafieu « par lequel [ il ] fais [ ait ] valoir , en tant que salarié du groupe , [ son ] hostilité au projet de loi Création et Internet » .
Et TF1 l’écrit noir sur blanc :
« Cette correspondance nous est parvenue via le cabinet du ministre de la Culture qui l ’a adressée le jour même à la société TF1 . »
Mais le meilleur est à venir : « Nous considérons cette prise de position comme un acte d’opposition à la stratégie du groupe TF1 [ pour qui ] l’adoption de ce projet de loi est un enjeu fort » , écrit la DRH .
Avant de reprocher à Bourreau d’avoir « mis [ le ] groupe en difficulté , [ sa ] position faisant apparaître le défaut d’alignement d’un responsable “ web ” avec la position officielle défendue par la direction . »
On résume : en plus de la délation , on apprend que Hadopi est un enjeu fort de la stratégie de TF1 , qui défend officiellement la loi .
Ce qui laisse songeur quand on voit , sur le sujet , le manque d’objectivité des JT de la Une .
Interrogé par Libération , un porte - parole de TF1 tente de se rattraper aux branches et évoque des « prises de position anti-Hadopi publiques de Jérôme Bourreau à l’intérieur de l’entreprise » .
Ce qui n’est pourtant pas mentionné dans la lettre de licenciement .
Jérôme Bourreau lui est « dégoûté » : « La stratégie de TF1 , ironise t- il , c’est de gagner de l’argent , pas de soutenir une loi . »
Son avocat , Me Emmanuel Noirot , est en train de saisir les prud’hommes : « Pour licenciement injustifié dans la mesure où l’opinion de mon client est une opinion privée politique mais aussi technique sur Hadopi et que , selon le code du travail , un employé ne peut pas être discriminé en fonction de ses opinion politiques . »
Me Noirot saisit également la Halde : « C’est une discrimination , un délit d’opinion , c’est purement scandaleux » , assène - t- il .
Chez Françoise de Panafieu , où l’on se souvient du mail , on « tombe du platane » : « J’ai trouvé le mail intéressant , explique Marie - Christine Méchet , son attachée parlementaire , je l’ai transféré au cabinet du ministère pour obtenir un argumentaire . »
Méchet , à qui Libération a appris le licenciement de Jérôme Bourreau , se dit « hallucinée : c’est extrêmement grave » .
Au ministère de la ­Culture , on ne cache pas son embarras : « Nous sommes extrêmement surpris . »
Et si on se souvient du mail , on ne sait pas comment il a atterri à TF1 .
Evidemment : quand apparaissent au grand jour les liaisons dangereuses entre le ministère de la Culture de Nicolas Sarkozy et la chaîne privée détenue par son meilleur ami Martin Bouygues , ça fait désordre .

When it comes to treatment for sexual addiction , abuse , porn , or other behavioral concerns , What should I know ?
First , you are not alone .
Thousands of families are struggling with these same concerns .
While curiosity and experimentation are normal stages of adolescent development , the rapid expansion of technology and media has exposed teens to sexual content at an earlier and earlier age .
This early exposure to sexuality , as portrayed in the media , is impacting the fluid nature of young brain development .
Do you as a parent always seem to be in a game of “ Cops & Robbers ” with your teen ?
Has your teen been caught viewing pornography , even though you put blocks on the computer ?
Has your teen used his gaming system or other handheld devices to view porn ?
Has he been caught at a neighbor ’s house or grandparent ’s house viewing pornography ?
Does he have access to technology in his room ?
Does he get angry or threaten others when you put restrictions on his technology use ?
If you answered yes to any of these , the issue is n’t the porn use as much as it is the level of risk and the compulsive thought process driving the need for more porn .
British farmers have pledged to fight to the " bitter end " over EU plans for all sheep to be fitted with electronic ID tags as the UK government ruminates on how to implement the scheme .
The EU has long recognised that all sheep tend to look alike to humans , and is looking to RFID technology to ensure animals can be tracked throughout their lives , and beyond [ up to a point ] .
The EU insist that while farmers will have to shell out for the chips not to mention readers - it will bring savings in identification and data handling costs , and will enable better disease tracking .
The EU this month considered a report on a pilot of the scheme in France , which seemed to suggest acceptance of the idea , and envisioned compulsory EIDs next year .
The average cost is expected to be around € 0.80 per animal .
According to a report in 2007 , which the EU also considered this month , the cost of tagging each animal at as low as € 0.29 for a " slaughter lamb " with a holding tag , up to € 2.25 for an animal tagged with a " standard ruminal bolus and a conventional ear tag " .
Farmers will , of course have to shell out for readers , and presumably kit to " administer " the tags , including the frankly rather scary " boluses " .
The total cost to UK farmers - the biggest bloc of sheep keepers in the Union - is expected to be in the region of £ 65 m .
The UK government has kicked off a " consultation " on the program as it considers how to implement the scheme .
However , it seems clear what farmers think already , with angry ovine rearers rushing to give the farming rags and the Telegraph their unhappy view .
John Mercer , chief livestock adviser to the National Farmers ' Union , told the Telegraph : " It 's a crazy rule .
It 's not wanted .
It 's not needed .
And it could , potentially , devastate the sheep industry .
We really need political pressure now . "
John Hore , a farmer from Pilning , near Bristol , told the Telegraph : " We are prepared to fight this to the bitter end .
Mick Holder , chairman of the Forest of Dean Commoners Association told thisisgloucestershire .co.uk that the scheme had little chance of working .
" I do n't think it will solve anything , all it will do is create a mountain of paperwork and be really expensive to implement , " he said .
He added , " There are hundreds of sheep out in the Forest and before you can tag them you 've got to find them . "
Which suggests that the British sheep industry faces some more fundamental problems than we thought .
Unfortunately , for the farmers , not to mention the sheep and goats , the bitter end is exactly where things will end up , as they start " applying " the boluses from the end of this year . ®
But , not all fads translated well to Saturday mornings .
Below , the 10 worst Saturday morning cartoon translations , complete with symptomatic title sequences and probably too in - depth analysis of why they sucked .
In the '80s and '90s , it seemed like every cultural phenomenon was turned into a Saturday morning cartoon .
It was a simpler time when kids still wanted to be like their parents and older siblings , and these shows gave them time - traveling , crime - fighting versions of the stuff old people talked about ( when they were n't singing Huey Lewis songs or doing blow off the kitchen table ) .
10 Rambo and the Forces of Freedom

Based On :
The novel First Blood , as well as its film adaptation and its sequel Rambo : First Blood Part II .
Sucked Because :
Rambo was an expert in guerrilla warfare - - a man who was the best with guns , with knives and with his bare hands .
He was a man who had been trained to ignore pain , to ignore weather , to live off the land and to eat things that would make a billy goat puke .
In Vietnam , his job was to dispose of enemy personnel .
To kill !
Period !
Except in cartoon form , where Rambo was the leader of a multicultural , G.I. Joe - like squad of do - gooders , each with their own special backgrounds and talents .

Cartoon Rambo was a well - adjusted man , who never talked about his experiences in Vietnam as a prisoner of war or his lingering case of post - traumatic stress disorder .
A man who was nonviolent and overcame his enemies through clever thinking rather than an explosive arrow tip to the chest .
He was a man who could sustain a poorly - thought - out animated adaptation of source material wildly inappropriate for children for only one season before cancellation .
Evidence from the Title Sequence :
Here we have Rambo skiing down a snowy mountain and dodging flamethrowers , all in the name of protecting the innocent :

Nothing too outrageous there , right ?
Now check out the trailer for the upcoming John Rambo .
Go ahead and skip right to 1:13 where Rambo starts decapitating people and turning entire human bodies into hamburger meat .

We ’ve looked at a couple of religious based distributions such as Ubuntu : Christian Edition and Ubuntu : Muslim Edition .
But there ’s another version of Ubuntu…a dark and evil one .
A version so hideous and so terrible that it ’s name is only spoken in whispers among Linux users …
Ubuntu Satanic Edition 666.6 ( Jesus ’ Jugular )
Yep !
There really is a satanic version of Ubuntu and we ’ll take a look at it in this review .
Please note as always that ExtremeTech endorses no particular religion or any religion at all .
Nor do we endorse no religion .
We respect people of all faiths and people of no faith and people who are n’t sure if they have any faith as well as people who do n’t care about faith one way or the other .
Just wanted to clarify that for those who get upset about these kinds of things .
OMG , Satanic Hooters !
Before I go any further into this review I should note here that when you boot up the Live CD there is a pic of a semi- naked woman and you can see her boobies .
I want to note it here in case there ’s anybody out there that is offended at such things .
Do n’t download this distribution if satanic type hooters bother you okay ?
You ’ve been warned !
And a note to the Ubuntu Satanic Edition developers … please give the woman in the photo a sandwich .
I do n’t think seeing somebody ’s ribs is particularly attractive .
She looks like she just escaped from some kind of famine somewhere .
Thin is one thing but ribs sticking out is quite another .
If you need a voluptuous model for your distro ’s wallpaper please find one that eats regularly and perhaps you might want to try to find one that does n’t look like she has an adam ’s apple .
Just my two cents , take it as you will .

BrainGate , an investigational technology being developed to detect brain signals and to allow people with paralysis to use those signals to control assistive devices , is about to begin a second , larger clinical trial .
The system is based on neuroscience , engineering and computer science research at Brown University .
The BrainGate2 pilot clinical trial is taking place at Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) , in close collaboration with an interdisciplinary team of researchers from MGH and Brown University .
The study has been approved by the MGH Institutional Review Board to begin recruiting participants .
The trial extends prior safety and feasibility research of the BrainGate Neural Interface System , which consists of an implanted baby aspirin - size brain sensor that reads brain signals and computer technology that interprets these signals .
The BrainGate Neural System may allow people with paralysis to control assistive devices .
The new clinical trial is part of a larger BrainGate research effort , the ultimate goal of which is to help patients with spinal cord injury , stroke , muscular dystrophy , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) or limb loss turn their thoughts into actions , restoring independence , mobility , and communication .
The work to date with BrainGate trial participants has explored their ability to control robotic limbs , operate computer software and drive a wheelchair .
New research will help advance the pilot system .
( See also A BrainGate Timeline . )
BrainGate is based on research and technology developed in the laboratory of John Donoghue , the Henry Merritt Wriston Professor of Neuroscience at Brown and director of the Brown Institute for Brain Science .
Arto Nurmikko , professor of engineering , and Michael Black , professor of computer science , are also key research partners on this team .
More than a dozen Brown undergraduate and graduate students have helped advance the research and technology .
Two Brown faculty members are leading the research : Donoghue and Dr. Leigh Hochberg , associate professor of engineering at Brown and a vascular and critical care neurologist at MGH , Brigham and Women 's Hospital , and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital .
Hochberg is also affiliated with Harvard Medical School and the VA Medical Center in Providence .
The new trial is taking place at a time of great promise for neurotechnology research .
" We are entering a new age of neurotechnology .
Our fundamental understanding of the nervous system , combined with advances in engineering , may help people with brain and spinal cord injuries and diseases , " Donoghue said .
" We are working to develop and test new technologies that we hope will help patients with devastating illnesses that limit their ability to move or to speak , " Hochberg said .
" The goal of our research is to harness the brain signals that ordinarily accompany movement and to translate those signals into actions on a computer , like moving a cursor on the screen , or the movement of a robotic or prosthetic limb . "
A previous clinical trial run by Cyberkinetics Neurotechnology Systems Inc. , together with researchers at MGH and Brown , demonstrated that the neural signals associated with the intent to move a limb can be " decoded " by a computer in real time and used to operate external devices .
The BrainGate Neural Interface System involves a sensor placed on a part of a study participant 's brain called the motor cortex .
During earlier research sessions , a computer was connected to the sensor through a pedestal on the participant 's head , allowing the participants to control a computer cursor by simply thinking about the movement of their own paralyzed hand .
" We learned an incredible amount with the assistance of the first participants in the BrainGate trial , not only about how the motor cortex continues to work after paralyzing illness or injury , but also about how to harness these powerful intracortical signals for controlling computers and other assistive devices , " Hochberg said .
For financial reasons , Cyberkinetics stopped funding the trial and withdrew from the research .
Cyberkinetics had launched in 2001 , based on research and technology developed in Donoghue 's lab .
The clinical research continues through this multidisciplinary , multi-institutional effort .
A new academically based Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE ) application — BrainGate2 — was developed in 2008 to follow up on research previously published in peer - reviewed journals .
Hochberg will direct the BrainGate2 clinical trials through MGH in close collaboration with researchers at Brown University and Providence VA Medical Center .
The BrainGate2 trials will expand on previous research , honing the hardware and software that decode the brain signals used to move a cursor on a screen .
The IDE is part of a larger research effort , the goals of which include developing point - and - click capabilities on a computer screen , controlling a prosthetic limb or a robotic arm , controlling functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) of nerves disconnected from the brain due to paralysis , and further expanding the neuroscience underlying the field of intracortical neurotechnology .
The research is focused not only on the ability to operate a computer but also to assist people with ALS , spinal cord injury and brainstem stroke to control their environment .
" Through ongoing development and testing , it is hoped that these technologies will eventually help to improve the communication , mobility and independence of people with severe paralysis , " Hochberg said .
People with these types of paralysis have at least two characteristics in common : a brain that is capable of directing movement and a body that fails to respond .
Beyond the current clinical trial , the ultimate goal of the BrainGate research effort is to provide a new pathway for brain signals to control external devices such as computers or even one 's own limbs that have been " disconnected " from the brain due to paralysis or limb loss .

As my young friend Rebecca so wisely said in the previous post , " TWILIGHT is not just a book : it 's an experience . "
I entirely agree , which is why I need to register my five points of loathing below .
Precisely BECAUSE the TWILIGHT franchise is more than just a goofy boxed - set of romance novels , a la Barbara Cartland or Danielle Steele ( both of whom , no kidding , are far better writers than Meyer ) , The TWILIGHT Experience IS scary and people should be warned .
I 'm serious .
As far as I 'm concerned , the least scary parts of TWILIGHT concern blood - sucking vampires and / or unborn babies chomping on a - mom 's cervix to get free .
Those are the fun parts compared to the latent , covert lessons of feminine subjection , abjection , and erasure of self inherent in the novels .
Of course , that could just be my girlish way of looking at things .
Okay , ready ?
1 . The ONLY real reason young women like TWILIGHT is because of Edward .
That is sad .
Why ?
It 's sad because Edward is NOT who you want to end up with , especially for eternity .
Stuck with Edward 's family in a sunless , airless , dull mansion , having conversations that hint at the possibility of ancient patterns of potential incest now repressed , not having , and eating game meats ?
It would be like being married to an Englishman but without the cute accent or the trace amounts of .
2 . Let 's get back to the sex , or lack of it , which is what hooks girls on the first volume : female readers love that Edward sleeps besides Bella and apparently only wants to kiss her neck .
Why do they like that ?
Because most real live ( i.e. not - dead , not 100 year - old - plus ) guys who come within touching distance ( so to speak ) spend their time lunging almost randomly at breasts and buttocks .
The amateur kisses of actual boys taste of gum and burritos , and they breathe audibly through their noses while they slip their tongues down the girls ' throats like they 're lizards hunting for flies .
They are most decidedly not doing what Meyer 's Bat Boy does in the all - important thirteenth chapter of the first book , in the passage that makes girls gasp with delight and cross their legs even if they do n't know why : " he simply bent his face to mine , and brushed his lips slowly along my jaw , from my ear to my chin , back and forth .
I trembled . "
Actual boys are not models of aloof , self - contained ; they are like Labrador retrievers .
Girls should be aware of the fact that , when they encounter an immaculately groomed , perfectly manicured , impeccably dressed , polite , restrained young man who initially avoids their company when paired with them during science lab , what they have not met is the man of their .
What they have met is their new best gay male friend .
3 . We should be appalled by Edward because Edward takes away Bella 's keys to her very own car saying " You 're intoxicated by my very presence " whereupon she says - wait for it --" There was no way around it ; I could n't resist him in anything . "
Fifty years of the women 's movement and that 's what we get : " I could n't resist him in anything " ?
How nuts is this ?
Lucy Ricardo showed more backbone !
Lambchop the Puppet showed more backbone than this " Lamb " does !
How about if Bella kept her own keys -- and her own integrity -- and drove away from the bastard ?
How about getting this girl to ask herself the all - important question " What would Thelma and Louise have done in this situation ? "
( Okay , not in that last scene , but in any other ... )
By the way , the runner - up for this position was a line from an earlier chapter where Bella exclaims " I could n't imagine anything about me that could be in any way interesting to him . "
For all those folks who say we 're in a post - feminist generation : guess we still have a teensy bit of work on the whole - building business for our girls , yes ?
4 . Back to the self - description of the characters as specific members of the food chain : girls , remember that if you 're the lamb and he's the lion , you may lie down together , but if you 're bright , you wo n't exactly let yourself relax a whole lot .
5 . Drum roll , please , as we get to the finale : " About three things I was absolutely positive .
First , Edward was a vampire .
Second , there was a part of him - and I did n't know how potent that part may be - that thirsted for my blood .
And third , I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him . "
( That line is on page 195 -- although curiously enough , when the passage is quoted on the back cover of the trade paperback , " potent " is changed to " dominant " and I bet we can imagine why . )
So the BIG reason to loathe TWILIGHT ?
of your lover should not be an aphrodisiac .
Ever .
Let 's sum up , shall we ?
Why is TWILIGHT scarier for a grown - up woman than it is for a younger one ?
Because we know that even as a romantic , it 's a damaging one ; that even for a trashy book , it 's a lousy one ; and that even - or especially - as an for escape for a young woman who 's longing to break out of her everyday confinements , it 's a trap .
( P.S. : although it refers to the movie rather than the books , this is the funniest and most deft analysis of the - tragically -- unfatal flaws of TWILIGHT that I 've come across :

Forget the memory - boosting pills :
In the future , powers of recall could be boosted with programs on a handheld PDA .
Researchers have found a telltale mental signature that predicts whether an experience will be remembered .
Once deciphered , the signals could be used to help people know when their brains are primed to remember , perhaps using an iPhone app .
" Instead of looking at how the information is being processed , we 're looking at how the brain prepares to process the information , " said study co-author Emrah Duzel , a University College , London , neuroscientist .
" It may be that the state we look at prepares the memory system for a relevant event . "
Duzel 's team found the signal in the medial temporal lobe , a region of the brain associated with memory formation .
Exactly how medial temporal activation improves recall is n't understood , and researchers have only a vague idea of how memories are stored .
As with most of the brain , memory researchers are like Eastern European hackers during the latter stages of the Cold War , trying to connect the mysterious circuitry of western computers to their functions .
Some researchers have found activity in the medial temporal lobe and other memory - processing centers when events are encoded .
Other studies have found activation patterns that precede the formation of certain types of memories , such as verbal or visual .
But the new study , in Proceedings of the National Academies of Science on Monday , shows a signal that appears to precede the formation of any memory type .
It could be an all - purpose memory switch , determining when the brain enters a favorable encoding state , roughly akin to the overwrite tab on an old - fashioned floppy disk .
" We can't constantly be in a state that 's favorable to processing incoming information , " said Duzel .
" Maybe it 's because we need to switch our neural systems beteween incoming information , and information that 's already in the brain and needs to be processed further .
In that instance , trying to figure out incoming information would disrupt internal processing . "
Duzel 's team used a magnetoencephalograph to record magnetic fluctuation in the brains of 24 test subjects performing a battery of memory tests .
A fraction of a second before test subjects processed a prompt that was later recalled , they displayed heightened levels of so - called theta oscillations .
Theta waves are typically observed during REM sleep and moments of heightened alertness , and localized in the hippocampus — a center of navigational and short - term memory .
But Duzel 's team traced the oscillations to the medial temporal lobe .
" The fact that you can to some extent predict whether a person is going to remember a word before they 've even seen it is quite remarkable , " said University of Pennsylvania neuroscientist David Wolk , who was not involved in the study .
Some computer audio programs already offer to tweak brain rhythms , including theta oscillations , with sound .
These are unproven , said
Duzel , but a biofeedback approach , in which people can see their brain waves on a computer screen and learn how to control them , could work .
" We could measure the starting state , and then train subjects to enhance that particular amplitude , " said Duzel .
" When theta activation was high , they 'd be more likely to remember information . "
The hardware used to record electrophysiological signals is rapidly becoming more mobile , said Duzel .
" There 's no reason not to believe that this is possible , " he said .
" It could be part of a PDA . "

Some 40 % of the Dutch population agree with many of anti-Islam MP Geert Wilder ’s statements , according to research by TNS Nipo for magazine Vrij Nederland .
According to opinion polls , Wilders would take about 18 % of the vote if there was an election tomorrow .
But this research shows support for his ideas is much wider , Vrij Nederland says .
Some 42 % of those polled agreed with the statement that Wilders says ‘ what ordinary people believe and want ’ .
Some 35 % do not think Wilders goes too far in his comments about Islam and Muslims and 38 % agree with Wilders ’ statement that Muslims have come to the Netherlands ‘ to take things over ’ .
A large majority – 61 % – agree with Wilders ’ call for ‘ street terrorists ’ to be deported .
Wilders used the phrase to describe gangs of youths , mainly of Moroccan origin .
Although support for Wilders among people with a university education has increased slightly , his main support is still found among ‘ the ordinary man who does not feel that the established parties take him seriously , ’ said researcher Peter Kanne .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - News Corp ’s MySpace refused to comment on Thursday on a report the previous day that said the online social network will fire a “ massive ” number of employees .
A screenshot of MySpace.com , taken on June 11 , 2009 .
REUTERS/MySpace.com
The online social network is preparing to lay off as many as 500 of its 1,600 workers , the TechCrunch blog reported on Wednesday , as it cuts costs while trying to stay ahead of growing competition from rival Facebook .
MySpace is part of Fox Interactive Media , which houses some of News Corp ’s online properties .
News Corp last month ousted co-founder and Chief Executive Chris DeWolfe and has shaken up management elsewhere in its digital operations .
“ Like any company with new leadership , Fox Interactive Media is reviewing every aspect of our operations , performance and structure , ” a MySpace spokeswoman said in a statement .
“ It ’s no secret that we are looking for ways to improve our products , increase the value of our digital assets and enhance the overall financial strength of the company , ” the statement said .
The TechCrunch report comes after the Los Angeles Times reported on June 6 that Fox Interactive Media canceled a plan to move to a 420,000 square - foot office space in Playa Vista , California .
The company had committed to a 12 - year , roughly $ 350 million lease , the Times reported , adding that it was backing off the move because of its financial difficulties .
MySpace ’s statement to the Los Angeles Times about the Playa Vista building was the same statement that it sent to Reuters regarding the layoffs .
News Corp ’s $ 580 million purchase of MySpace ’s parent company in 2005 was considered among analysts and media experts as a brilliant move by Murdoch to enhance the media conglomerate ’s digital portfolio .
Since then , advertising revenue has deteriorated and Facebook and Twitter have surpassed MySpace in buzz and popularity in the technology and media worlds .
A search and advertising deal with Google Inc will expire in July 2010 , and it is unclear whether the two sides will renew .
MySpace derives $ 300 million a year from that deal , and most Wall Street analysts believe there is no chance that Google will forge a deal on similar terms .
News Corp shares rose 11 cents , or 1.05 percent , to $ 10.62 on Nasdaq at mid-afternoon .
Here ’s our Haskell Symposium paper about parallel profiling with GHC and ThreadScope :
Parallel Performance Tuning for Haskell ( Don Jones Jr. , Simon Marlow , Satnam Singh ) Haskell ’09 : Proceedings of the second ACM SIGPLAN symposium on Haskell , Edinburgh , Scotland , ACM , 2009
Abstract :
Parallel Haskell programming has entered the mainstream with support now included in GHC for multiple parallel programming models , along with multicore execution support in the runtime .
However , tuning programs for parallelism is still something of a black art .
Without much in the way of feedback provided by the runtime system , it is a matter of trial and error combined with experience to achieve good parallel speedups .
This paper describes an early prototype of a parallel profiling system for multicore programming with GHC .
The system comprises three parts : fast event tracing in the runtime , a Haskell library for reading the resulting trace files , and a number of tools built on this library for presenting the information to the programmer .
We focus on one tool in particular , a graphical timeline browser called ThreadScope .
The paper illustrates the use of ThreadScope through a number of case studies , and describes some useful methodologies for parallelizing Haskell programs .
goto
( PHP 5 >= 5.3.0 , PHP 7 )
Image courtesy of » xkcd
The goto operator can be used to jump to another section in the program .
The target point is specified by a label followed by a colon , and the instruction is given as goto followed by the desired target label .
This is not a full unrestricted goto .
The target label must be within the same file and context , meaning that you cannot jump out of a function or method , nor can you jump into one .
You also cannot jump into any sort of loop or switch structure .
You may jump out of these , and a common use is to use a goto in place of a multi - level break .
Example # 1 goto example <?
php
goto a ;
echo ' Foo ' ;
a :
echo ' Bar ' ;
?>
The above example will output : Bar
Example # 2 goto loop example <?
php
for ( $ i = 0 , $j = 50 ; $ i < 100 ; $ i ++ ) {
while ( $ j --) {
if ( $j == 17 ) goto end ;
}
}
echo " i = $ i " ;
end :
echo 'j hit 17 ' ;
?>
The above example will output : j hit 17
Example # 3
This will not work <?
php
goto loop ;
for ( $ i = 0 , $j = 50 ; $ i < 100 ; $ i ++ ) {
while ( $ j --) {
loop :
}
}
echo " $ i = $ i " ;
?>
The above example will output : Fatal error : ' goto ' into loop or switch statement is disallowed in script on line 2
SAN FRANCISCO 
As the newspaper industry and its classified advertising business wither , one company appears to be doing extraordinarily well : Craigslist .
The Internet classified ads company , which promotes its “ relatively noncommercial nature ” and “ service mission ” on its site , is projected to bring in more than $ 100 million in revenue this year , according to a new study from Classified Intelligence Report , a publication of AIM Group , a media and Web consultant firm in Orlando , Fla .
That is a 23 percent jump over the revenue the firm estimated for 2008 and a huge increase since 2004 , when the site was projected to bring in just $ 9 million .
“ This is a down - market for just about everyone else but Craigslist , ” said Jim Townsend , editorial director of AIM Group .
The firm counted the number of paid ads on the site for a month and extrapolated an annual figure .
It said its projections were conservative .
By contrast , classified advertising in newspapers in the United States declined by 29 percent last year , its worst drop in history , according to the Newspaper Association of America .

As the rock cooled , sweet brown liquid formed on its surface .
As time passed , aluminum formed itself into a can , a lid , and a tab .
Millions of years later , red and white paint fell from the sky , and formed itself into the words " Coca Cola 12 fluid ounces . "
Of course , my theory is an insult to your intellect , because you know that if the Coca Cola can is made , there must be a maker .
If it is designed , there must be a designer .
The alternative , that it happened by chance or accident , is to move into an intellectual free zone .
The banana - the atheist 's nightmare .
Note that the banana :
Is shaped for human hand Has non-slip surface Has outward indicators of inward content :
Green - too early ,
Yellow - just right ,
Black - too late .
Has a tab for removal of wrapper
Is perforated on wrapper Bio- degradable wrapper
Is shaped for human mouth Has a point at top for ease of entry
Is pleasing to taste buds
Is curved towards the face to make eating process easy
To say that the banana happened by accident is even more unintelligent than to say that no one designed the Coca Cola can .
TEST ONE
The person who thinks the Coca Cola can had no designer is :
___ A. Intelligent
___ B. A fool
___ C. Has an ulterior motive for denying the obvious
Did you know that the eye has 40,000,000 nerve endings , the focusing muscles move an estimated 100,000 times a day , and the retina contains 137,000,000 light sensitive cells ?
Charles Darwin said ,
" To suppose that the eye , with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances , for admitting different amounts of light , and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration , could have been formed by natural selection , seems , I freely confess , absurd in the highest possible degree . "
( The Origin of Species , Chapter 6 ) .
If man cannot begin to make a human eye , how could anyone in his right mind think that eyes formed by mere chance ?
In fact , man can not make anything from nothing .
We do n't know how to do it .
We can re-create , reform , develop . . . but we cannot create even one grain of sand from nothing .
Yet , the eye is only a small part of the most sophisticated part of creation - the human body .
George Gallup , the famous statistician , said ,
" I could prove God statistically ; take the human body alone ; the chance that all the functions of the individual would just happen , is a statistical monstrosity . "
Albert Einstein said ,
" Everyone who is seriously interested in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe — a spirit vastly superior to man , and one in the face of which our modest powers must feel humble . "
TEST TWO
A . Do you know of any building that did n't have a builder ?
___ YES ___ NO
B . Do you know of any painting that did n't have a painter ?
___ YES ___ NO
C. Do you know of any car that did n't have a maker ?
___ YES ___ NO
If you answered " YES " for any of the above , give details :

Could I convince you that I dropped 50 oranges onto the ground and they by chance fell into ten rows of five oranges ?
The logical conclusion is that someone with an intelligent mind put them there .
The odds that ten oranges would fall by accident into a straight line are mind - boggling , let alone ten rows of five .
TEST THREE
A . From the atom to the universe , is there order ?
___ YES ___ NO
B. Did it happen by accident ?
___ YES ___ NO
C. Or , must there have been an intelligent mind ?
___ YES ___ NO
D. What are the chances of 50 oranges falling by chance
into ten rows of five oranges ?

The declaration " There is no God " is what is known as an absolute statement .
For an absolute statement to be true , I must have absolute knowledge .
Here is another absolute statement : " There is no gold in China . "
TEST FOUR
What do I need to have for that statement to be true ?
A. No knowledge of China .
___ YES ___ NO
B. Partial knowledge of China .
___ YES ___ NO
C. Absolute knowledge of China .
___ YES ___ NO
" C " is the correct answer .
For the statement to be true , I must know that there is no gold in China , or the statement is incorrect .
To say " There is no God , " and to be correct in the statement , I must be omniscient .
I must know how many hairs are upon every head , every thought of every human heart , every detail of history , every atom within every rock ... nothing is hidden from my eyes ... I know the intimate details of the secret love - life of the fleas on the back of the black cat of Napoleon 's great - grandmother .
To make the absolute statement " There is no God . "
I must have absolute knowledge that there is n't one .
Let 's say that this circle represents all the knowledge in the entire universe , and let 's assume that you have an incredible 1 % of all that knowledge .
Is it possible , that in the knowledge you have n't yet come across , there is ample evidence to prove that God does indeed exist ?
If you are reasonable , you will have to say , " Having the limited knowledge that I have at present , I believe that there is no God . "
In other words , you do n't know if God exists , so you are not an " atheist , " you are what is commonly known as an " agnostic . "
You are like a man who looks at a building , and does n't know if there was a builder .
TEST FIVE
The man who sees a building and does n't know if there was a builder is :
___ A. Intelligent
___ B. A fool
___ C. Has an ulterior motive for denying the obvious
Perhaps you have questions that hold you back from faith .
First , almost every question you have about suffering humanity etc. , can be adequately answered .
Second , we have faith in plenty of things we do n't understand .
Did you understand the mechanics of television before you turned it on ?
Probably not .
You took a step of faith , turned it on , and after it worked , understanding how it worked was n't that important .
We accept that there are unseen television waves right in front of our eyes .
We can't see them because they are invisible .
For them to manifest , we need a receiver , then we can enjoy the experience of television .
God is not flesh and blood .
He is an eternal Spirit - immortal and invisible .
Like the television waves ,
He can not be experienced until the " receiver " is switched on .
Here is something you will find hard to believe : Jesus said , " He who has My commandments and keeps them , he it is who loves Me .
And he who loves
Me will be loved by My Father , and I will love him and manifest Myself to him " ( John 14:21 ) .
Either that is true or it is n't .
Jesus Christ says that He will manifest Himself to anyone who obeys Him .
Approach the subject the same way you approached your first television set .
Just take a small step of faith .
If it works , enjoy it , if it does n't , forget it .
Or have you an ulterior motive ?
Could it be that the " atheist " can't find God , for the same reason a thief can't find a policeman ?
Could it be that your love for sin is clouding your good judgment ?
If the Bible is true , and Jesus Christ has " abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel , " then you owe it to yourself just to check it out .
God will never let you down .

Yesterday , we ran a story talking about a new Nielsen report on gaming habits .
A few astute readers pointed out that it appeared as if the GameCube and PS3 lines had been switched somewhere along the way , and I promised to look into it .
Nielsen has gotten back to me today , and they have confirmed that yes , the graph is incorrect .
Check out the real data after the break .
Now the PS3 line has been correctly labeled , and you can see the difference .
There you go .
By January the PS3 is beating both the GameCube and the original Xbox , and Nintendo 's last - generation system is now in last place , not the PS3 .
I apologize for the confusion , we 'll update the post , and we appreciate Nielsen getting back to us with the correct data .

This is as disgusting as the South Carolina GOP activist comparing Michelle Obama to a gorilla .
Earlier today , a legislative staffer forwarded well - known West Tennessee blogger Newscomaa picture they had been sent from another staffer .
It 's supposed to be an " historical keepsake photo " of the Presidents .
But no picture of President Obama - - instead , just a " spook . "
The Republican Party is continuing to fall down a very long and narrow rabbit hole , one that will be hard to get out .
These types of images , statements are directly reflective of the people running around in the Republican Party .
If they think that many Americans share this disgusting view , think again , they do not .
After what happened at the Holocaust Museum , one would believe we need to step back , but no , the GOP is just ramping it up for all to see and listen to .
This is racism , hatred , pure and simple .

DNS - basierte Internetsperren kinderpornografischer Inhalte galten bislang als der einzig praktikable Weg , ohne Verfassungsänderung schnell ein symbolträchtiges Sperrgesetz auf den
Weg zu bringen : Befürworter des Gesetzes argumentieren , dass eine manipulierte Nameserver - Antwort noch in die Phase vor dem Kommunikationsaufbau fällt und deshalb keinen grundrechtsrelevanten Eingriff in die Kommunikation selbst darstellt .
Die Funktionsweise der im „ Gesetz zur Bekämpfung der Kinderpornografie in Kommunikationsnetzen “ geplanten Sperren ist am ehesten mit einer manipulierten Telefonauskunft zu vergleichen : Ruft ein Surfer eine Webseite auf , wird zunächst bei einem Nameserver die einem Hostnamen zugehörige IP - Adresse angefragt .
Bei den hierzulande geplanten und in einigen skandinavischen Ländern umgesetzten Sperren liefert der – auf staatliches Geheiß – manipulierte Nameserver des Internetproviders einfach die IP - Adresse des „ Stoppseitenservers “ , der entweder beim BKA oder beim Provider stehen wird .
Bislang konzentriert sich die Debatte lediglich auf die Sperrung von Webseiten , fast jeder Diskussionsbeitrag und jedes Rechtsgutachten geht davon aus , dass der Anfrage an einen Nameserver zwangsläufig ein HTTP - Aufruf , also die Abfrage einer Webseite folgt .
Doch was geschieht , wenn die Anfrage an den Nameserver vorgenommen wird , um in der Folge eine E - Mail zustellen zu können ?
Bei E-Mail folgt ein zweistufiges Auskunftsverfahren : Zunächst wird der Nameserver angefragt , welcher Host denn als Mail - Exchange zuständig ist.
Bei „ großen “ Domains ist das oft ein separater Server ( „ mail.domain.xyz “ , „ mx.domain.xyz “ o.ä. ; feste Regeln für den Namen existieren nicht ) , bei „ kleinen “ Domains häufig „ www.domain.xyz“.
In der zweiten Stufe – der Anfrage nach der IP - Adresse des so bekannt gewordenen Mail - Servers – wird folglich auch bei der Mail - Zustellung mit der IP - Adresse des „ Stoppseitenservers “ geantwortet :
Es folgt der Zustellversuch nicht an den eigentlichen Nameserver , sondern an den „ Stoppseitenserver “ .
An dieser Stelle wird spannend , wie der „ Stoppseitenserver “ mit den Zustellversuchen umgeht :
Die sauberste Konfiguration wäre wohl , einfach gar keine E - Mails anzunehmen oder durch die DNS - Sperren verursachte Fehlzustellungen korrekt als unzustellbar abzuweisen .
In diesem günstigsten Fall findet nur ein kurzer Dialog zwischen Sender - und Empfänger - Mailserver statt , in dem lediglich die Absenderadresse mitgeteilt wird : Der „ Stoppseitenserver “ erfährt nichts vom I nhalt der Nachricht .
Denkbar wäre jedoch auch eine weit perfidere Konfiguration , bei der das Mailsystem des „ Stoppseitenserver “ einfach alle Nachrichten an die Domain der Sperrliste als vermeintlich zustellbar annimmt , vielleicht weiterleitet , aber für die Analyse durch die Polizeibehörden speichert .
So gewonnene Informationen dürften für die Strafverfolger weit interessanter sein als die Webserverlogs der „ Stoppseite “ , aus denen bekanntlich nicht hervorgeht , ob ein Aufruf absichtlich oder zufällig erfolgt ( beispielsweise weil eine Spam - Mail eine Grafik auf einem auf der Liste verzeichneten Server einbindet ) .
Bereits der schwächere Fall der Abweisung einer Nachricht als unzustellbar greift in das Fernmeldegeheimnis ein , weil hier die „ näheren Umstände erfolgloser Verbindungsversuche “ bekannt werden .
Eingriffe der Strafverfolgungsbehörden in Telekommunikationsvorgänge sind jedoch nur auf richterliche Anordnung zulässig .
Doch gerade auf die richterliche Anordnung wird – vorgeblich aus Zeitgründen – verzichtet , lediglich ein verwaltungsrechtliches Einspruchsverfahren im Nachhinein ist vorgesehen .
Während der Gesetzentwurf im Detail die Sperrung auf Ebene der Auflösung in IP - Adressen fordert und sich auf Telemedienangebote konzentriert , trifft er keine Aussage darüber , was mit versehentlich „ fehlgeleiteter “ E - Mail passieren soll .
Wird das Gesetz in seiner derzeit diskutierten Form Realität , dürften sich Strafverfolger und Gefahrenabwehrer bald über die neuen , einfachen Möglichkeiten der E - Mail - Überwachung per Sperrlisteneintrag freuen .

California officials are considering significant cuts to major programs to close the state ’s budget deficit .
Among them : Healthy Families , which provides youth medical coverage ; CalWorks , which serves poor families with children ; and Cal Grants college loans .
Here are some of the people who would be hit by the cuts :

Wondering how to pay their son ’s medical bills
In the noisy atrium of the Eisner Pediatric and Family Medical Center on Friday , Ubaldo Tlatoa and his wife struggled to keep their arms around their rambunctious son Kevin , who was hopping up and down on the benches as they waited to see a doctor .
Advertisement
Kevin , 6 , was losing his hearing .
The state ’s Healthy Families insurance program for the working poor was covering most of the cost of the visit .
“ It ’s a blessing , ” Tlatoa , 37 , said in Spanish that was translated by a medical center staffer .
Tlatoa makes about $ 3,000 a month as a construction worker , but his company considers him an independent contractor and does not provide medical insurance .
He makes too much money to get coverage through Medi-Cal , but said he would struggle to pay for private insurance .
So he and his wife have no coverage , but at least with the state plan they can pay $ 27 a month , with $ 5 co-pays , to cover their three sons .
“ Not having insurance is a great fear that I live with every day , ” Tlatoa said .
Advertisement
Tlatoa shrugs and looks into the distance when he thinks about what he will do if the state eliminates the Healthy Families program .
Tlatoa does n’t like his choices : taking Kevin to a county emergency room that might not understand his medical history , or taking a lower - paying job to qualify for Medi-Cal .
In the exam room , Dr. Elizabeth Ford was direct with Kevin ’s parents .
“ He needs surgery , ” she said .

‘ It would be chaos ’
Eight months ago , Reina Isabel Martinez ’s contract job as a maintenance worker at a Studio City hotel ended .
Martinez , 39 , was used to going from job to job .
But as the economy shuddered , jobs dried up and she could n’t find another one .
Not unless she took a night job , which the single mother said she could n’t do with two teenage children at home .
Unable to make her $ 1,400 rent for a South Los Angeles apartment , Martinez was evicted and moved to El Sereno .
She lived on food stamps and $ 104 a week unemployment checks , which ended two months ago .
Her husband , who had left three years ago , provided no help .
Last month , she applied for welfare .
Advertisement
Through Cal Works , she got $ 723 a month for herself and two children , but went to a welfare office in Lincoln Heights on Friday after she said it was reduced to $ 237 .
Martinez said there was confusion about whether she was still getting unemployment .
Now she said she dreads that social service programs like these would be slashed entirely .
“ It would be chaos , ” she said .
Martinez said her 13 - year - old son , Christopher , was invited to a school trip to Santa Catalina Island for students who got good grades .
But she said she doubted that she could afford the $ 165 cost .
“ They take all the good students , the ones with the really good grades , and he ’s one of them , ” Martinez said proudly inside the Lincoln Heights welfare office .
“ He ’s a very smart boy .
But I ca n’t pay it . ”

Trying to make the numbers add up
Robin Chavarria ’s father works from sunrise to sundown as a landscaper .
His mother does odd jobs when she can find them , which lately has been never .
“ They work really hard to support us , feed us , clothe us , shelter us and send us to school to the extent that they can , ” said Robin , a senior at Eagle Rock High School , speaking for himself and his 10 - year - old brother .
He figures his parents , both legal immigrants from Central America , earn about $ 20,000 a year , or about $ 6,000 less than the cost of attending UC Santa Barbara , where Robin has been accepted this fall .
“ So obviously , ” he said , “ getting financial aid was a huge factor in my deciding to go to UC . ”
Advertisement
Robin , 17 , who wants to study political science and become a lawyer , recently got a letter offering him $ 5,000 a year in Cal Grant funding .
Along with a federal Pell Grant , some scholarship money from the University of California , loans and work - study income , Robin figured that he would be able to manage UC Santa Barbara .
Now he ’s not so sure .
“ For the Cal Grant to be taken away would represent a huge burden , ” he said .
He figures he would have three options : apply for more loans ; increase the number of hours he works while attending school ; or forget about UC and go to community college .
He still considers himself lucky , but is distressed by what he sees happening to California ’s budget .
“ I think in times of economic recession , education should be the safe haven , ” he said .
“ Because if you take away the Cal Grants , you ’re taking away people ’s dreams . ”

Scenes from the NUHW founding convention .
By Carl Finamore
May 1 , 2009 --
It ’s not every day that a new national union is formed in the United States .
But that ’s exactly what happened on April 25 in San Francisco .
If the National Union of Healthcare Workers ( NUHW ) turns out as planned , it ’s a date for the history books .
“ You will be able to tell your grandchildren in years to come ” , NUHW leader Sal Rosselli boldly predicted to 700 cheering delegates , “ that you attended the founding convention of a five - million member healthcare workers ’ union . ”
The convention approved a constitution and elected interim officers which are basic legal requirements for certification by the US federal government .
Provisions of the new constitution include the right to elect and recall officers and shop stewards , regular membership meetings and an extensive steward structure and training program .
The union is now off and running with its first scheduled election only a few weeks away .
At stake are 10,000 homecare workers employed by the California county of Fresno , four hours south of San Francisco .
It ’s a contest that pits the upstart NUHW directly against the powerful 2 million - member Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) , the bargaining representative of the Fresno group .
These public workers are very dissatisfied with SEIU ’s plan to place them in a separate local divided from other unionised healthcare workers at hospitals and clinics across California .
Displacing such a formidable opponent will test NUHW ’s capacities and viability .
It is arguably the most important union election in the country .
The new union is hoping to raise US $ 1 million to fund an all - out campaign to win the representation duel .
Lacking resources until it recruits dues - paying members , thousands of worker volunteers are undoubtedly the largest capital acquisition NUHW presently has in the bank .
As one 30 - year Fresno homecare worker told the convention : “ SEIU has lots of power but united we have more power . ”
There is something real behind this enthusiasm .
In only a few days , more than 25 % of the 10,000 eligible workers in Fresno signed valid signatures authorising NUHW ’s first election .
In fact , in the five weeks since the new union was first publicly announced in January 2009 , representation petitions covering 96,000 workers at more than 350 California healthcare facilities were filed with the appropriate state , local and national government agencies .
Despite numerous , frivolous legal challenges by the SEIU , Rosselli reported to the convention that he expected election victories would produce 56,000 members by early 2010 , even before the huge California Kaiser Hospitals ’ elections scheduled later that year .
Elected leaders ousted
Only a few months ago , NUHW supporters had been leaders of the Service Employees International Union , United Healthcare Workers - West ( SEIU UHW - West ) .
With 150,000 members , it was the second - largest unit of the powerful national SEIU union .
Now the two organisations are at war with one another .
Union democracy is at the centre of the dispute and certainly the most important rallying point that is prompting tens of thousands of members to leave the SEIU and to form a new union .
As an example , the SEIU refused to allow a vote of UHW - West members on international president Andy Stern ’s proposal to split off 65,000 homecare and nursing home workers .
This is an important issue because most homecare workers believe , as the Fresno example indicates , that their bargaining pressure increases by inclusion in the same unit with hospital and clinic workers .
Stern believes each craft should essentially be divided into separate units .
The overwhelming majority of UHW - West argued the opposite ; pointing out that combining the power of all crafts into one bargaining unit earned them the best contracts in the country .
Nonetheless , SEIU tops insisted on proceeding with the forced , massive reassignment into different mega- sized locals of tens of thousands of California healthcare workers .
Many workers also complained these centralised locals were too far away from the geographically scattered worksites , establishing obstacles to rank and file participation .
Rejecting efforts to narrow the dispute , Stern instead overreacted by removing UHW - West officers , representatives and even stewards who refused to go along with his edict .
He quickly followed up by taking over the union treasury , changing the locks on all union offices and placing UHW - West directly under control of his appointees .
This left the ousted former elected leaders of UHW - West very few options .
It was the very next day , on January 28 , 2009 , that the NUHW first came together .
The new union was immediately greeted with tremendous support by angry members who did not want to be lumped into newly established , unfamiliar and distant locals run by unelected acolytes of Stern .
This is an unprecedented response reminiscent of the massive outpouring of support for the Congress for Industrial Organizations ( CIO ) in the 1930s .
How members get involved
Thousands of workers mobilising to defend themselves cannot be explained away as simply a normal reaction against top - down , undemocratic policies .
Other bureaucratic - led unions , as the SEIU appears to be today , are guilty of similar heavy - handed intrusions .
None , however , have aroused such broad rank and file opposition .
In fact , most dissident forces within unions fold once their powerful international union exerts jurisdiction such as Stern has done .
Having personally experienced such a situation , I can report we dissidents licked our wounds and waited for a better day to unfurl our banner .
This is usually what happens .
We certainly did n’t imagine forming an alternative national union .
What makes the NUHW so different ?
Part of the difference is the large size of UHW - West .
But there is more to it .
Over 10 years ago , SEIU - UHW
West began making structural and political attempts to transform the union away from the typical staff - oriented , headquarters - based operation .
This is often referred as moving away from a “ service - oriented ” model , in which full - time union staff representatives perform most of the bargaining and contract enforcement tasks , and moving toward what is sometimes termed an “ organising model ” that empowers shop stewards elected at worksites to assume many of these same responsibilities .
Establishing a more direct relationship with members is exactly how unions traditionally wage successful new representation campaigns -- establishing in - house , rank and file committees to promote and lead the organising drive .
Hence the name , “ organising model ” .
Unfortunately , however , these local committees usually dissolve after the successful election of a new union .
The operation of the union reverts back to the traditional union apparatus that takes over bargaining and contract enforcement .
Potential new leaders are often discouraged from further participation after seeing their role significantly diminished by professional staff representatives .
Here is where SEIU UHW - West was different .
The Rosselli - leadership made a serious commitment to create more direct relationships to the members .
Democracy as militancy
As part of their efforts to expand the union power base , a massive steward training and education program was launched .
Individual worksite steward councils were formed and met regularly .
These formations are encoded in the NUHW constitution .
The combination of education , training and delegation of duties both inspired and prepared members to take more active responsibility for enforcing their rights .
Workers on the job obviously have a more direct relationship with the employer and potentially can collectively exert far more pressure than individual staff representatives .
It is a philosophy that believes the union apparatus should encourage and support members at the base where real union power lives rather than headquarters ’ staff viewing themselves as the primary source of power within the union .
Under this new approach , adopted some years ago by SEIU UHW - West , the union ’s extensive and experienced staff reinforced rather than substituted for the new worksite leadership .
As a result , members gained confidence and would not automatically defer to union officials .
In essence , these policies democratised the union and made it stronger .
Years of leadership training produced hundreds of informed , articulate and active unionists , many of whom were seen and heard at the founding convention of NUHW .
Kathy Lipscomb , lead field representative / organiser , SEIU UHW - West ( ret. ) , whispered with pride to me amidst the loud applause and enthusiasm of the convention : “ We got away from a rep - driven union some years ago and I believe it was a turning point .
We began intensive shop steward training and developing leadership at the base .
The meeting today would not have been possible without this . ”
The boldness to break away from one of the most powerful unions in the country and the confidence to build a credible alternative is a staggering commitment and could only be attempted by a rank and file movement that has consistently been mobilised and empowered over recent years .
“ The shop stewards were the closest to the day to day activities of the workers ” , Howard Wallace , field representative / community organiser ( ret. ) , SEIU - Local 250 Healthcare Workers Union , told me .
“ Very often they were the first to understand the issues .
These unpaid , volunteer leaders had a lot of respect from all of us . ”
There is much to think about from the dispute between the NUHW and the SEIU .
Lessons better learned if the rank and file revolt is actually successful .
They act for all of us by standing for militant and democratic unionism .
Let us wish them well .

Will former US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and other senior Bush administration officials end up in jail for crafting the policies that led to the torture of prisoners at Guantánamo ?
As of yet , no government prosecutor is targeting them in the United States .
But thousands of miles away , Spanish attorney Gonzalo Boyé is chasing after Gonzales and five other lawyers , and he has a chance — perhaps not a large one — of convincing his country ’s legal system to charge these former Bush aides with human rights violations .
For more than a decade , Spanish courts have been the terror of torturers and genocidaires the world over .
Operating under the principle of “ universal jurisdiction , ” the country has claimed the right to investigate and , if necessary , prosecute human rights cases that occurred beyond its borders if the countries in question fail to act .
Spain first invoked its status as the world ’s court of last resort in 1998 , when Judge Baltazar Garzón of the National Court in Madrid issued an arrest warrant for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet for his regime ’s torture and murder of Spanish citizens .
Pinochet ultimately escaped prosecution in Spain , but Garzón ’s move paved the way for more cases .
Sixteen are currently moving through Spanish courts , targeting perpetrators from Israel , China , Guatemala , Argentina , and El Salvador , among other countries .
Still , for all the shuffling of paper , Spain has produced only one conviction under the banner of universal jurisdiction : that of Adolfo Scilingo , an Argentinean convicted in 2005 of assassinating left - wing dissidents during the country ’s “ dirty war . ”
Most recently , Garzón has turned his attention to six former Bush administration figures accused of putting forth specious legal arguments to justify clear violations of the United Nations Convention Against Torture .
The so - called “ Bush Six ” case targets Gonzales ; John Yoo , former Justice Department attorney and lead author of the “ torture memos “ ; Douglas Feith , former deputy secretary of defense for policy ; William Haynes II , Pentagon general counsel ; Jay Bybee , former assistant attorney general ; and David Addington , former chief of staff and legal adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney .
The investigation is the handiwork of Boyé , a human rights lawyer who represents several former Guantánamo detainees .
According to their criminal complaint , they allege that the Bush Six “ participated actively and decisively in the creation , approval and execution of a judicial framework that allowed for the deprivation of fundamental rights to a large number of prisoners , ” and legitimized “ the implementation of new interrogation techniques including torture . ”
In March , Garzón took up Boyé ’s case and initiated an official investigation ; another National Court judge , Ismail Moreno , has since taken over the matter .
Theoretically , assuming investigators gather sufficient evidence , indictments and prosecutions could follow , though it ’s unlikely that any of the Bush administration lawyers would choose to show up in Spain for a trial .
Boyé himself is no stranger to terrorism cases .
He spent eight years in a Spanish prison for his involvement in the 1988 kidnapping of businessman Emiliano Revilla , who was held hostage for eight months by members of ETA , a Basque separatist group that appears on the US State Department ’s list of international terrorist organizations .
Boyé claims to only have lent the kidnappers his ID and characterizes his incarceration as the result of “ a very unfair trial . ”
Now , Boyé has become something of a de facto prosecutor .
But a recent resolution passed by the Spanish parliament could undermine his case .
Spain ’s two leading political parties — the Socialists and the People ’s Party — overwhelmingly passed a measure on May 19 calling for a law that would restrict the use of universal jurisdiction .
Will the measure quash the Bush Six investigation ?
Mother Jones discussed the case with Boyé .
Mother Jones :
How was it that you came to be involved with the Bush Six case ?
Gonzalo Boyé : I was concerned about the situation in Guantanamo and was searching for more information about it .
Then I found several books , including The Torture Team by Philippe Sands .
Reading it , I was sure that the key problem was the lawyers .
The lawyers who created the legal framework for Guantanamo are the basis for all that happened there .
Without the lawyers , the crime would never have been committed , or at least not in that form and with such a degree of impunity .
MJ : What are you hoping to accomplish ?
GB : To get a conviction against the people responsible for what happened in Guantánamo .
Accountability is the first step toward deterrence .
With criminal offenses like this , it is necessary to send a clear message :
No one is above the law , no matter their intentions .
The security of any country can only exist within the rule of law .
The war on terror is no exception .
Thanks to Guantánamo , no evidence obtained there can be used in any court of law .
Bush and his advisers have done a great favor for Islamic terrorists .
MJ : Are there any legal precedents for what you are attempting to do ?
GB : Yes , at the Nuremberg trials several lawyers and judges were convicted for actions similar to those of the Bush Six .
And in other countries , legal advisers and physicians have been convicted for taking part in torture .
I do not see any reason why this case should be different .
MJ : A similar case in Germany against the Bush administration failed .
Why ?
And what do you plan to do differently in order to optimize your chances of success ?
GB : Because in Germany only the state prosecutor can exercise criminal action .
In Spain , victims and civil society can do so themselves .
There is no political control over what can go to court .
According to the Spanish constitution , anyone can file criminal charges .
That is the main difference between Spain and any other legal system in which universal jurisdiction is recognized .
MJ : What would you characterize as success in this case ?
Indictments ?
GB : We are seeking more than just indictments .
These people will be convicted , either in Spain or in the United States .
I would prefer that the trial take place in North America , as that would be the best example of a legal system working for everyone .
MJ : The Spanish parliament passed a draft law on May 19 , setting additional restrictions on universal jurisdiction cases like yours , presumably with the intent of making them more difficult to file .
How might the new law affect the Bush Six case ?
Does it target your investigation specifically ?
GB : The Spanish parliament is in the process of approving new regulations , but that will have no effect on this case .
We represent Spanish victims , so there is sufficient relevance to Spain for the case to go forward .
The new regulations are being devised in order to obtain impunity for the Chinese and Israeli authorities involved in other universal jurisdiction cases .
They will not apply to people involved in torture committed at Guantánamo .
In the Bush Six case , we fulfill all the new requirements of the draft law , so there is no reason for the Bush Six to relax or celebrate .
MJ : How likely is it that this draft law will pass ?
When do you expect it will ?
GB : The law will be passed without a doubt , as it is in the interest of both major political parties .
For the first time in several years , they are in agreement on something .
They want to grant impunity to people who have committed the most serious criminal offences as defined under international treaties .
Sooner than later , the government will regret changing the law and its collaboration with the opposition .
The draft law would never have been written without political pressure exerted by both Israel and China .
MJ : Why do you think both major parties in Spain are so eager to weaken universal jurisdiction ?
GB : They are bending to pressure from abroad .
Politicians never considered changing the law until we brought criminal cases against some Israeli and Chinese officials .
At the end of the day , the new draft law was not planned in Madrid , but in Tel Aviv and Beijing .
Instead of keeping a dignified and independent position , Spanish politicians are running to meet the demands of these two foreign governments .
Spain does not have a long - standing democratic culture , so it feels the need to be friendly with everyone rather than only those countries that respect human rights .
In cases like this , a middle - of - the - road position is unacceptable : Either you are with the victims , or you are with the perpetrators .
Spain was to play a major role in a peaceful solution to the Israeli - Palestinian problem , but with decisions like this , its position will become unacceptable to the Palestinian side .
Politicians have a double standard when it comes to these types of crimes .
That is quite evident .
MJ : How far along is the investigation ?
Have you requested that Judge Moreno call any witnesses ?
Gather any documents ?
GB : We have requested a lot of documents and are waiting for US authorities to respond .
We have presented some expert reports to the court .
The next step will be to call witnesses .
MJ : Do you intend to urge the court to call members of the Bush Six to testify ?
GB : Yes , all of them will be called as defendants .
They are people responsible for serious criminal offences .
We will guarantee them due process , as that is the only way to achieve proper justice .
It 's estimated that publicity on the Oprah Winfrey show may have brought more than a million new users to Twitter .
The site 's sometimes - shaky servers survived the invasion , though some feel its ' trendy ' and ' cool ' status took a hit from a show associated with middle - aged ladies .
Winfrey joined the micro- blogging site last Friday and posted her first message ( known as a tweet ) during the show .
It capped a week of celebrity - led publicity about the site as Ashton Kutcher beat CNN in the race to be the first users on Twitter with more than one million followers .
There 's no way of telling exactly how many people joined Twitter as a result of Oprah Winfrey 's show .
Ryan Block , former editor of tech site Endgaget , estimates the figure at 1.2 million based on the user account numbers given to new members .
Guesstimates At Work
These numbers do n't go up sequentially , but there are some theories that with each new member , the number alternates by increasing by 1 and increasing by 10 .
Another site used this information to come up with a figure of 700,000 new members .
( Source : techcrunch.com )
It 's worth noting that Oprah Winfrey currently has 427,574 followers , making these estimates seem a little high .
You 'd expect most of the people who signed up after seeing the show to have followed her account , and some of her followers will already have been on the site before the show .
Either way , bringing in several hundred thousand new members to a site which is believed to have only had a million members a year ago is pretty impressive .
Fail Whale Fails To Surface
The ' Winfrey effect ' did n't , however , seem to cause Twitter any technical problems .
Regular users are all too familiar with the logo , commonly known as ' Fail Whale ' , which appears when the site is overloaded , but there are few reports of such problems in the past few days .
It 's not known if Twitter planned ahead and increased capacity , or simply got lucky .
The appearance of the new members is not going over well with some long - time users who fear the site will be spoiled by an influx of new , casual members .
That was n't helped by Winfrey 's first post being entirely in capitals , a breach of netiquette .

In a revealing letter to the Human Rights Campaign obtained by Queerty , a donor to the organization reveals he ’s withdrawing his financial support for one big reason : HRC ’s misguided strategy on letting elected officials off the hook on Do n’t Ask Do n’t Tell to push through other legislation .
Previous accusations claimed HRC’s Joe Solmonese was advising the White House and senior Democratic legislators to take a relaxed approach to DADT .
Now , irrefutable evidence HRC is throwing military personnel under the bus .
The donor , whose name was redacted in the letter forwarded to us ( we ’re opting to use the pronoun “ he ” for clarity ’s sake ) , has two major complaints about HRC : 1 ) It is advising the White House and legislators that they need more support in repealing the Military Readiness Enhancement Act , which has the effect of stymieing the ability to gain more support ; and 2 ) The funds HRC collects to battle against DADT are not actually being used to do so .
It ’s unlikely Solmonese & Co. make significant strategy decisions without without consulting HRC ’s inner circle — doing so would risk their cash faucets .
But it appears Solmonese has been advising legislators either without consulting its top tier of donors , or despite it .
The letter ’s author is among HRC ’s Federal Club , which requires annual donations of $ 1,200 to $ 4,999 .
Also : According to a date stamp on the email , the letter was forwarded around at least as early as May 9 , which if you do your math , is before the first report of HRC ’s punting on DADT surfaced from reporter Jason Bellini , who filed the report earlier this month .
That means HRC members have been aware of the org ’s strategy on repealing DADT before the rest of us .
And now , amidst renewed charges ( this time from the military newspaper Stars & Stripes ) that Solmonese has been telling legislators to hold off on DADT while legislation like ENDA goes through , comes our publishing of the donor letter , which offers pretty irrefutable evidence that HRC is telling Washington how to play with our rights — even if Solmonese denies it .
Dear [ Federal Club co-chairs ] [ Partner name ] and I are suspending our federal club membership due to HRC ’s opposition to moving H.R. 1283 ( the Military Readiness Enhancement Act ) forward in this Congress .
I am aware that HRC has recently discouraged several key Senate offices from introducing MREA , and am concerned that HRC may be similarly discouraging other members of Congress from co-sponsoring the legislation .
The White House is saying that MREA needs more support in Congress before the President can publically do anything ; many members of Congress are saying that the President needs to do more publically before they will come on board .
HRC ’s private , de - facto opposition to the current MREA effort is contributing to this catch - 22 .
HRC , in recently years , has raised a lot of money by fundraising on the DADT issue ( vis - à- vis Sgt. Eric Alva ) , but the funds raised are clearly not being used to repeal DADT , and – sadly – part of those funds appear to be used to functionally advocate the continuation of DADT , at least in the short term .
That HRC would refuse to invest resources to support the passage of MREA in this Congress is unsettling .
That HRC would actively work to undermine the efforts of those of us who are waging this critically important battle is offensive .
( I am attaching to this email a .pdf copy of a May 1 HRC Public Policy Committee email with minutes from its April meeting , and the agenda from its May meeting .
These documents conclusively evidence that DADT is not on the HRC legislative agenda ( despite 140 of our Congressional allies having the political courage to co-sponsor H.R. 1283 ) . )
[ Partner name ] and I donate a significant percentage of our income to organizations fighting for the rights of LGBT soldiers .
I am deeply troubled that our investment is being devalued by HRC .
We support HRC ’s efforts on hate crimes legislation , and other very important federal initiatives .
Indeed , we are grateful for those efforts .
And , we truly respect and appreciate each of you for your years of leadership to our community , locally and nationally .
But on this matter we must speak out .
We make this promise to you : we will immediately renew our federal club membership when HRC shows * by its actions * that it fully supports passage of MREA in this Congress .
Until then , we are diverting this $ 1,200 directly to those to want the ban to end now .
In your capacity as HRC fiduciaries , we ask that you please influence HRC to cease its efforts to undermine the repeal of DADT in this Congress .
Respectfully , [ Name of former HRC Federal Club member , outside Washington DC ]
We ’ve put a word in with HRC to see if we can ID the letter writer .
We ’ll let you know what we hear .
And let ’s be sure :
This donor is n’t the only one abandoning support .

When two total strangers married in a bizarre ceremony at a shopping mall , everyone assumed it would never last .
David and Elizabeth Weinlick had met for less than five seconds before they turned up at the altar in a stunt whipped up by a TV station .
Amazingly , 11 years and four children later , the couple , now both 39 , are still married - and madly in love .
" We live a charmed existence .
He 's a splendid man to be married to , " says Elizabeth , who was chosen as David 's ideal bride by a 55 - strong selection committee of his friends and family .
" We 've never regretted it .
It sounds like a crazy thing to do but there was instant chemistry - and we did our dating after we married . "
Spend any time with the couple and it's plain how suited they are .
They finish each other 's sentences , laugh nonstop and , when asked , can find very little they do n't like about the other .
David , then a pony - tailed anthropology student , set a countdown for his wedding day when he announced he intended to get married , aged 28 , on June 13 , 1998 .
But after a series of disastrous relationships his friends decided to choose a bride for him - then more than 300 women applied when the story made big news on a local TV station .
Elizabeth , now a nurse , ran into David handing out " bride wanted " flyers and , after talking to him for less than five seconds , decided to apply .
She filled in a questionnaire about her likes and dislikes before going in front of the selection committee at 10 am that Saturday .
By 3 pm , David 's friends had whittled the 36 main contenders down to three .
Then on the final vote , Elizabeth won hands down .
She said her first formal hello to David at 4 pm and an hour later was in a white dress saying " I do " at the shopping centre in Minneapolis , America .
The reception was a barbecue at a friend 's house and afterwards the newly - weds went back to Elizabeth 's apartment .
Ask what happened next , the pair giggle .
But they claim they consummated the marriage " within a day or two " .
Their daughter Emily was born seven years ago , quickly followed by son Charlie , now six , and three - year - old Zoe. Baby Zed Henry arrived in March .
The couple are now planning to renew their wedding vows .
David , who works for the Democratic Party , says : " It will show everyone who thought our wedding was just a publicity stunt we fell in love for real . "
DAN AYKROYD is in one of his favorite places : surrounded by ghosts , or at least ghost stories .
Just steps off Central Park in the Beaux - Arts town house of the American Society for Psychical Research , in a library lined with books like “ Gods From Outer Space ” and “ Wall Street and Witchcraft , ” Mr. Aykroyd is presenting his family ’s supernatural bona fides with the same earnest yet vaguely ironic delivery that has sustained his entire comic career .
Deadpan , he dares you to take him seriously even as he seems to wink at his own torrent of outlandishness .
“ My great - grandfather , Sam Aykroyd , was a dentist , and he basically was the local critic , the local reviewer for any psychic show or act that came through his hometown in Kingston , Ontario , in the 1920s , ” he said .
Referring to the young women who helped build the Spiritualist movement of the mid-1800s , he added : “ The people who came through his hometown were people like the Fox sisters from Rochester , N.Y. , who communicated with Mr. Splitfoot , the ghost of a person who was murdered and buried in the basement of their house .
And not only did they communicate with Mr. Splitfoot in the house , but they took him around the world on a tour with them .
So it was almost like they were traveling with the ghost who made them famous . ”
Continuing his tour through the Aykroyd family ’s cabinet of otherworldly curiosities , he said , quite off the cuff : “ My mother claims that when she was nursing me , a man and woman appeared at the foot of the bed , so she called to my dad , and they opened up the family album , and it was Sam and my great - grandmother Ellen Jane coming to welcome the new baby . ”
He waited just a moment for the perfect downbeat : “ Of course , my mother comes from the skeptical French - Canadian side of the family . ”
Who else could have invented the Ghostbusters , an interdimensional squad of Orkin men ?
Who else could have devised a supreme threat to humanity in the form of the colossal Stay Puft Marshmallow Man ?
If Congress fails to enact health care reform this year — or if it enacts a sham reform designed to bail out corporate medicine while excluding the “ public option ” — then the public will rightly blame Democrats , who have no excuse for failure except their own cowardice and corruption .
The punishment inflicted by angry voters is likely to be reduced majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives — or even the restoration of Republican rule on Capitol Hill .
Many of those now talking down President Obama ’s health care initiative were in Washington back in 1994 when Bill Clinton ’s proposals to achieve universal coverage were killed by members of the president ’s own party .
The Democrats lost control of Congress that November in a historic repudiation , largely because of public disillusionment with their policy failures .
Nearly every poll now shows the American people demanding change in the health care system , with majorities favoring universal coverage and , in many surveys , a government plan that competes with private insurance .
But powerful Democratic politicians , especially in the Senate , are pretending not to hear .
They adopt all sorts of positions , from bluntly opposing any substantive change this year to promoting bogus alternatives .
They claim to be trying to help Obama gather the votes he will need , or to assist him in attracting Republican votes .
They insist that the country can’t afford universal care , or that the public option wo n’t pass ( before debate has even begun ) .
Indeed , many of the most intransigent Democrats do n’t bother to make actual arguments to support their position .
Nor do they seem to worry that Democratic voters and the party ’s main constituencies overwhelmingly support the public option and universal coverage .
Sen . Mary Landrieu , D - La. , has simply stated , through her flack , that she refuses to support a public option .
Sen. Ron Wyden , D - Ore. , who has tried to fashion a plan that will entice Republicans , warns that the public option is a step toward single - payer health care — not much of an objection to a model that serves people in every other industrialized country with lower costs and superior outcomes .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , feebly protests that her state ’s mismanagement by a Republican governor must stall the progress of the rest of the country .
Sen. Kent Conrad , D - N.D. , says he has a better plan involving regional cooperatives , which would be unable to effectively compete with the insurance behemoths or bargain with pharmaceutical giants .
The excuses sound different , but all of these lawmakers have something in common — namely , their abject dependence on campaign contributions from the insurance and pharmaceutical corporations fighting against real reform .
Consider Landrieu , a senator from a very poor state whose working - class constituents badly need universal coverage ( and many of whom now depend on Medicare , a popular government program ) .
According to the Center for Responsive Politics , a nonpartisan watchdog outfit , she has received nearly $ 1.7 million from corporate medical interests , including hospitals , insurance companies , nursing homes and drug firms , during her political career .
The same kind of depressing figures can be found in the campaign filings of many of the Democrats now posing as obstacles to reform , notably including Sen .
Max Baucus , D - Mont. , the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , who has distinguished himself in the most appalling way .
The Montana Standard , a news outlet in his home state , found that Baucus has received more campaign money from health and insurance industry donors than any other member of Congress .
“ In the past six years , ” the Standard found , “ nearly one - fourth of every dime raised by the Montana senator and his political - action committee has come from groups and individuals associated with drug companies , insurers , hospitals , medical - supply firms , health - service companies and other health professionals . ”
Whenever Democratic politicians are confronted with this conflict between the public interest and their private fund - raising , they take offense at the implied insult .
They protest , as a spokesman for Sen .
Landrieu did , that they make policy decisions based on what is best for the people of their states , “ not campaign contributions . ”
But when health reform fails , or turns into a trough for their contributors , who will believe them ?
And who will vote for them ?
Joe Conason writes for The New York Observer .
TEL AVIV ( MarketWatch ) -- U.S. foreclosure filings in April rose to a record , affecting one in every 374 housing units , and bank repossessions in particular may spike in the next few months , Realty Trac reported .
Foreclosure filings -- defined as default notices , auction - sale notices , and bank repossessions -- were reported on 342,038 U.S. properties in April , up less than 1 % from March and up 32 % from April 2008 , the Irvine , Calif . , real - state consulting firm reported .
RealtyTrac began issuing its report on foreclosures in January 2005 .
" Much of this activity is at the initial stages of foreclosure -- the default and auction stages -- while bank repossessions ... were down on a monthly and annual basis to their lowest level since March 2008 , " Chief Executive James J. Saccacio said in a statement .
" This suggests that many lenders and servicers are beginning foreclosure proceedings on delinquent loans that had been delayed by legislative and industry moratoria . "
Bank repossessions are likely to spike in coming months as these loans move through the foreclosure process , he said .
Foreclosures in Nevada fell 18 % in April from March .
But Nevada continued to show the highest foreclosure rate among the states with one in every 68 housing units the subject of a foreclosure filing , more than five times the national average , Realty Trac reported .
In Florida , foreclosures leaped 37 % in April from March .
The state showed the second - highest foreclosure rate in the U.S. , as more than one of every 135 housing units there was targeted for foreclosure .
Foreclosures in California fell 10 % month over month , but the state 's rate of one in every 138 housing units targeted for foreclosure was the third - highest .
In absolute numbers , California had the most properties subject to foreclosure filings , 96,560 .
Following on were Florida at 64,588 , Nevada with 16,266 , and Arizona with 16,245 .
Deleveraging , Sooner or Later
Metals up .
Dollar down .
Stocks up .
That ’s more or less how the last 24 hours played out on the global economic stage .
After digesting
Act I of this week ’s financial melodrama – the World Bank ’s growth forecast downgrade from “ soft ” to “ limp ” – investors are bracing for Act II : Bernanke & Co. Will the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , who meet today and tomorrow to discuss the fate of the world ’s reserve currency , be able to stay investors ’ shaky hands ?
We have no idea , as usual , but it probably does n’t matter anyway .
The world will have to deleverage its house of cards one way or another .
Sooner would be easier in the long run ; later would be easier in the short term .
Either way , tens of trillions of dollars worth of mal - investments need to be wiped from the books .
That takes time .
That EZ - credit and over indebtedness are the root causes of the current debacle notwithstanding , most economists expect interest rates will stay put , in the “ free to 0.25 % ” range .
If you want to find the source of an idiot ’s problem , just look at the solution he keeps applying to try and solve it .
What might our elected and unelected public servants do differently to avoid sinking deeper into the same mess , we wonder .
For starters , they might try listening to people who actually got it RIGHT during the heady days prior to the collapse , rather than reenlisting the terminal inadequacy of those who got it so very , very WRONG .
A few months ago , two guys who saw all this coming appeared in front of a panel who did n’t .
The entire video can be found here , but here is an overview of how the discussion went down :
“ Even if we do everything right … ” Nouriel Roubini told a panel of scoffing neckties on CNBC back in February , “ we ’re still going to have a sever u-shape recession [ which will ] last two years . ”
“ Yeah , but that ’s not the end of the world , is it ? ” interjected one necktie from behind the safety of the studio desk .
“ No , in that case it ’s not the end of the world … but it ’s still a recession that is three times as long as the previous two and three times as deep as the previous two .
And , if you do n’t do everything right , and I think there ’s a large probability that ’s going to happen , then we may end up in a multi - year near - stagnation or near - depression like the one Japan had , meaning an L - shape recession … and that is ugly . ”
Next up , Nassim Nicholas Taleb , author of The Black Swan and another guy who “ got it right . ”
“ What I see here is the same symptom that caused me to worry about the system .
We have the same people in charge , who did not see the crisis coming who took humungous amounts of hidden risk , they ’re still around ; the bankers that got us here are still around , and we ’re giving them more money , so I do n’t see that we ’re doing something to get out of the crisis . ”
Mr. Taleb continued , “ I would like to see the responsible people [ for the crisis ] not just punished , but out of office .
Mr. Bernanke did not understand the risks the system was taking .
I want him out of there . ”
The “ doom and gloom ” tolerance level on the set must have been at fever pitch around this time , because they had to cut for a commercial break .
Before they did , however , Mr. Roubini and Mr. Taleb were asked whether they thought Timothy Geithner ’s plan might remedy the situation .
Mr. Taleb : “ I do n’t think much of all that class of people managing these plans in society .
They failed and they ’re going to fail again . ”
Mr. Roubini : “ I agree . ”
Was Mr. Bernanke flicking through the channels that morning ?
Did he happen to catch any of that ?
Again , it probably does n’t matter either way .
Federal reserves do what federal reserves do : enable unsustainable , government - sponsored currency thrashing .
It is infantile and delusional to think that the same ingredients will produce a different sausage .
And , in an environment where more of the same means more of the same fraud and deceit , the smart few will take their dwindling dollars elsewhere .
Many people have heard Pulitzer prize winning reporter Seymour Hersh 's claim that boys were sodomized at Abu Ghraib and that the Pentagon has video of the rapes .
Many people think that they 'll believe it when and if they ever see the video .
But we do n't need to wait for the military to release the videos .
There is already proof that Hersh is right .
For example , the Guardian wrote in 2004 :
The October 12 memorandum , reported in the Washington Post ... came to light as more details emerged of the extent of detainee abuse .
Formal statements by inmates published yesterday describe horrific treatment at the hands of guards , including the rape of a teenage Iraqi boy by an army translator ...
According to the leaked memorandum ... it also called for military intelligence officials to work more closely with the military police guards at the prison to " manipulate an internee 's emotions and weaknesses " ...
In the Washington Post report , one detainee , Kasim Hilas , describes the rape of an Iraqi boy by a man in uniform , whose name has been blacked out of the statement , but who appears to be a translator working for the army .
" I saw [ name blacked out ] f*cking a kid , his age would be about 15 - 18 years .
The kid was hurting very bad and they covered all the doors with sheets .
Then when I heard the screaming I climbed the door because on top it was n't covered and I saw [ blacked out ] , who was wearing the military uniform putting his dick in the little kid's ass , " Mr Hilas told military investigators .
" I could n't see the face of the kid because his face was n't in front of the door .
And the female soldier was taking pictures . "
It is not clear from the testimony whether the rapist described by Mr Hilas was working for a private contractor or was a US soldier ...
More convincingly , the Telegraph wrote in 2004 :
America was braced last night for new allegations of torture in Iraq after military officials said that photographs apparently showing US soldiers beating an Iraqi prisoner nearly to death and having sex with a female PoW were about to be released .
The officials told the US television network NBC that other images showed soldiers " acting inappropriately with a dead body " .
A videotape , apparently made by US personnel , is said to show Iraqi guards raping young boys .

Et si la guerre scolaire se rallumait ?
Le camp laïc est en ébullition depuis l’accord entre Paris et le Vatican sur la reconnaissance mutuelle des diplômes : après avoir vanté la supériorité du curé sur l'instituteur , Nicolas Sarkozy s’attaque maintenant à l’enseignement supérieur ...
Après celui des sénateurs socialistes , un deuxième recours en annulation vient d’être déposé au Conseil d’Etat .
C’est un procès en sorcellerie , se défend le gouvernement .
Rappelons les faits .
Le 18 décembre 2008 , le ministre des Affaires Etrangères Bernard Kouchner signe avec Mgr Dominique Mamberti , le Secrétaire du Vatican pour les Relations avec les Etats , un « Accord entre la République française et le Saint Siège sur la reconnaissance des grades et diplômes dans l’enseignement supérieur » ( texte en pdf ) .
D’emblée , cela inquiète .
Depuis la loi du 18 mars 1880 , seules les universités publiques ont le droit de délivrer des diplômes nationaux .
Pour que leurs étudiants aient des diplômes reconnus , les universités et les instituts catholiques - de Paris , Lille , Lyon , Angers et Toulouse - doivent signer des conventions avec elles .
Ou alors faire valider leurs examens par des jurys désignés par les Recteurs - les jurys rectoraux .
Cela veut - il dire que désormais les établissements catholiques vont pouvoir délivrer des diplômes reconnus sans passer par les universités , car visés par le Saint Siège ?
Si c’est le cas , cela implique deux quasi révolutions : la fin du monopole de « collation des grades et des diplômes » de l’université publique , et une sérieuse entorse au principe de laïcité - rappelé dans la loi de 1905 sur la séparation des Eglises et de l’Etat .
Avec le risque que les musulmans , les juifs , les bouddhistes , etc , réclament à leur tour le droit de délivrer des diplômes ...
Mais le débat à peine engagé retombe .
Les vacances de Noël arrivent .
La crise universitaire succède au mouvement lycéen .
Le 22 janvier 2009 , le discours de Nicolas Sarkozy sur la recherche met le feu aux poudres .
En même temps , les ministère de l’Enseignement supérieur et des Affaires Etrangères tentent de calmer le jeu .
Le 6 janvier , ils précisent dans un communiqué que seuls « les diplômes canoniques » ( théologie , philosophie et droit canon ) sont visés par l’accord .
Et non pas les « profanes » - droit , lettres , sciences , etc .
Or c’est faux , en tout cas pas clair du tout .
Le Protocole additionnel publié avec le décret au Journal Officiel le 19 avril 2009 ne fait pas de distingo entre les disciplines .
L’accord concerne ainsi potentiellement tous les diplômes délivrés par les établissements catholiques du supérieur .
C’est un accord on ne peut plus classique , se défend le gouvernement , qui entre dans le cadre du processus de Bologne , suite à la déclaration de Bologne du 19 juin 1999 .
Les 43 Etats signataires - le Saint Siège l’a paraphé en 2003 - s’engagent à harmoniser leurs systèmes d’enseignement supérieur , à les rendre plus lisibles .
Cela doit notamment permettre une plus grande mobilité des étudiants .
La France a déjà signé ce type d’accord avec l’Espagne , le Portugal , la Pologne , etc. , rappelle aussi le gouvernement .
C’est en effet pratique pour un étudiant espagnol qui veut venir poursuivre ses études en France .
Et vice - versa d’ailleurs .
Le problème est que le Saint Siège n’est pas un Etat comme un autre - c’est aussi et avant tout une autorité spirituelle .
Un évêque siège ainsi au conseil de direction de la « Catho » de Paris ou de Lille .
Actuellement il s’occupe surtout du contenu des études canoniques .
Mais demain est-ce qu’il ne pourrait pas être tenté de mettre son nez partout ?
Selon l’accord , le Vatican doit maintenant faire la liste des établissements et des diplômes qu’il veut habiliter .
Il a fait savoir qu’il ne se limiterait pas aux disciplines canoniques ( voir lemonde.fr ) .
Pourtant au gouvernement , on maintient que les profanes sont exclus .
Alors , info ou intox ?
Pour le camp laïc , c’est en tout cas un nouveau coup de Sarkozy contre la laïcité , après son discours prononcé le 20 décembre 2007 au Vatican ( voir les deux photos ) , au Palais de Latran où il célèbre les vertus du curé .
En visite le 14 janvier 2008 en Arabie Saoudite , il prononce un autre discours très religieux à Riyad .
Le 19 mai , les 115 sénateurs du groupe socialiste , puis le 5 juin , le tout nouveau Collectif pour la promotion de la Laïcité ont déposé chacun un recours devant le Conseil d’Etat réclamant l’annulation du décret .
Parmi leurs arguments , ils estiment qu’un tel texte aurait dû passer par le Parlement - l’article 53 de la Constitution en fait l’obligation dès qu’un traité international modifie la loi française .
Il n’est pas exclu que d’autres recours soient bientôt déposés .
Le Collectif pour la promotion de la Laïcité regroupe 15 parlementaires , 18 associations - le Grand Orient de France , La Grande Loge Féminine de France , l’Union des Familles Laïques , etc - , ainsi que de simples citoyens .
Il a aussi lancé une pétition qui a déjà recueilli plus de 12500 signatures .
On ne compte pas les déclarations de protestations de syndicats d’enseignants , comme Unsa-Education ou le Sgen - CFDT , d’étudiants , comme l’Unef , d’associations , comme la Ligue de l’enseignement , etc. La Conférence des Présidents d’Université ( CPU ) est aussi montée au créneau en janvier .
Enfin le 19 mai , sept députés de gauche ont déposé une proposition de loi « Promouvoir la laïcité et sauvegarder le monopole de la collation des grades universitaires » .
L’affaire est donc loin d’être close .
Prions pour qu’elle connaisse une fin heureuse ...

If you have n't passed your tolerance limit for the radical right 's vicious insanity , try this missive that went out only last week from from Scott Roeder 's pals at Operation Rescue .
Yet another connection between Pres. Obama and late - term abortionist George Tiller .
Gold Star Mother Betty Pulliam , who lost a son in Viet Nam , now works to take the lives of other women 's sons and daughters at George Tiller late - term abortion mill in Wichita , Kansas .
Yesterday , she breakfasted with President Obama and was honored in our nation 's capital as part of a Memorial Day observance .
Pulliam , at 83 , volunteers her time at Tiller 's clinic on busy abortion days .
She told the Wichita Eagle of her role as a Gold Star Mother , " You really do n't want to belong to this club because in order to belong to this club , you have to lose a child .
So nobody wants to belong to it . "
" How ironic that Pulliam could make such a statement when she has dedicated a large portion of her life to insuring that other women lose their children to abortion .
It is hypocrisy at best , and perhaps stems from some sick need to make sure that other women suffer as she has , " said Operation Rescue President Troy Newman .
Outline :
Message claims that Australia ’s General Peter Cosgrove made a remark about a female interviewer being “ equipped to be a prostitute ” during an interview on ABC radio .
Brief Analysis :
The claim in the message is untrue .
General Cosgrove has never made any such remark in any interview .
The message is a recycled version of earlier US and UK based versions that have circulated for a number of years .
Example :
Subject : FW : Worth thinking about Peter Cosgrove interview
For those that do n’t know him , Major General Peter Cosgrove is an “ Australian treasure ! ” General Cosgrove was interviewed on the radio recently .
You ’ll love his reply to the lady who interviewed him concerning guns and children .
Regardless of how you feel about gun laws you gotta love this !
This is one of the best comeback lines of all time .
It is a portion of an ABC interview between a female broadcaster and General Cosgrove who was about to sponsor a Boy Scout Troop visiting his military headquarters .
FEMALE INTERVIEWER :
So , General Cosgrove , what things are you going to teach these young boys when they visit your base ?
GENERAL COSGROVE :
We ’re going to teach them climbing , canoeing , archery and shooting .
FEMALE INTERVIEWER :
Shooting !
That ’s a bit irresponsible , is n’t it ?
GENERAL COSGROVE :
I do n’t see why , they ’ll be properly supervised on the rifle range .
FEMALE INTERVIEWER :
Do n’t you admit that this is a terribly dangerous activity to be teaching children ?
GENERAL COSGROVE :
I do n’t see how .
We will be teaching them proper rifle discipline before they even touch a firearm .
FEMALE INTERVIEWER :
But you ’re equipping them to become violent killers .
GENERAL COSGROVE :
Well , Ma’am , you ’re equipped to be a prostitute , but you ’re not one , are you ?
The radio went silent and the interview ended .
Detailed Analysis :
This message supposedly includes a transcript of an interview featuring General Peter Cosgrove broadcast on an ABC ( Australian Broadcasting Corporation ) radio program .
When taken to task by the female interviewer for plans to allow a group of visiting Scouts to participate in a shooting exercise , General Cosgrove supposedly delivers a caustically sexist comeback line that silences her criticism and terminates the interview .
In reality , no such interview ever took place nor did Cosgrove ever make such a remark .
The story is an Australianized version of an earlier US based story that had a certain “ General Reinwald ” of the US Marines as the one delivering the killer line .
The US version ( example included below ) claimed that General Reinwald made the remark during an interview with a female reporter broadcast on NPR ( National Public Radio ) .
However , NPR has denied that any such interview was ever broadcast and there are no records of a General Reinwald serving in the US armed forces .
“ General Reinwald ” is nothing more than a fictional character invented to give an American orientation to an even older version of the story .
Well before the “ General Reinwald ” story began circulating , a Welsh based version had already been posted online .
The Welsh version ( example included below ) simply featured “ Mr. Jones ” , a leader of a youth club , as the one who delivered the sexist remark and made no mention of Generals or Scouts .
In fact , incarnations of this old joke have been posted on innumerable websites , blogs and forums in several countries for a number of years .
Some versions mention other youth groups such as the Devil Pups rather than Scouts .
Unlike earlier versions of the joke , the Australian variant names a real person .
By falsely claiming that Peter Cosgrove made such an overtly sexist and inflammatory remark , the joke unfairly tarnishes the reputation of a highly respected and honourable man .
General Peter Cosgrove is a high - profile and much - admired member of the Australian community who had a distinguished army career that culminated in his appointment as Chief of the Defence Force in 2002 .
Cosgrove retired from the army in 2005 but has certainly not disappeared from public life .
He played a pivotal role as leader of the aid and recovery effort after Cyclone Larry devastated areas of far north Queensland in March 2006 .
And , he is the current Governor - General of Australia .
US “ General Reinwald ” Version :
Subject : Greatest comeback line Marine Corp ’s General Reinwald was interviewed on the radio the other day and you have to read his reply to the lady who interviewed him concerning guns and children .
Regardless of how you feel about gun laws you gotta love this !!!!
This is one of the best comeback lines of all time .
It is a portion of National Public Radio ( NPR ) interview between a female broadcaster and US Marine Corps General Reinwald who was about to sponsor a Boy Scout Troop visiting his military installation .
FEMALE INTERVIEWER :
So , General Reinwald , what things are you going to teach these young boys when they visit your base ?
GENERAL REINWALD :
We ’re going to teach them climbing , canoeing , archery , and shooting .
FEMALE INTERVIEWER :
Shooting !
That ’s a bit irresponsible , is n’t it ?
GENERAL REINWALD :
I do n’t see why , they ’ll be properly supervised on the rifle range .
FEMALE INTERVIEWER :
Do n’t you admit that this is a terribly dangerous activity to be teaching children ?
GENERAL REINWALD :
I do n’t see how .
We will be teaching them proper rifle discipline before they even touch a firearm .
FEMALE INTERVIEWER :
But you ’re equipping them to become violent killers .
GENERAL REINWALD :
Well , Ma’am , you ’re equipped to be a prostitute , but you ’re not one , are you ?
The radio went silent and the interview ended .
You gotta love the Marines !
Welsh youth club leader version :
Excerpt from a recent live radio interview on one of the regional Welsh stations :
A female newscaster is interviewing the leader of a Youth club :
Interviewer :- So , Mr. Jones , what are you going to do with these children on this adventure holiday ?
Jones :-
We ’re going to teach them climbing , abseiling , canoeing , archery , shooting …
Interviewer :- Shooting !
That ’s a bit irresponsible is n’t it ?
Jones :-
I do n’t see why , they ’ll be properly supervised on the range .
Interviewer :-
Do n’t you admit that this is a terribly dangerous activity to be teaching children ?
Jones :- I do n’t see how , we will be teaching them proper range discipline before they even touch a firearm .
Interviewer :-
But you ’re equipping them to become violent killers .
Jones :-
Well , you ’re equipped to be a prostitute but you ’re not one are you ?
Needless to say , the interview was terminated almost immediately ……

Angry Grandpa Ruins Christmas
[+]
Grandpa flips out after missing out on Christmas morning .
This Market Just Likes News
The US stock market is enjoying one of those delightful episodes when all news is good news .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 221 points yesterday to 8,721 – lifting the Blue Chip index to within a whisker of a positive year - to - date performance .
Let ’s give credit for the rally to good news … and also to bad news , because that ’s also good news .
In fact , let ’s just give credit to news in general .
Topping yesterday ’s headlines was the “ news ” that General Motors had formerly declared bankruptcy .
The automaker ’s de facto bankruptcy of the last several years finally yielded to the de jure variety .
That ’s good news , because now we taxpayers get the chance to increase our charitable giving .
We get the opportunity to write a $ 50 billion check to one of America ’s largest and most beloved nonprofit organizations .
But wait , GM ’s bankruptcy was n’t the only good news to cross the wires yesterday .
Stock market investors celebrated the following stories as well :
1 ) Treasury bond prices plummeted , exacerbating the bond market ’s worst January - through - May performance in 32 years .
2 ) The Dollar Index slipped to a fresh seven - month low .
3 ) Activity in the nation ’s factories fell for the 15th straight month .
Curiously , there were also a few news items yesterday that the stock market blithely ignored … like the news that our largest foreign creditor is becoming increasingly nervous about supplying fresh credit .
On the eve of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ’s goodwill mission to China ( OUR goodwill , not theirs ) , Yu Yongding , a former central bank adviser , remarked , “ I hope Geithner ’s visit can soothe our nerves .
The Chinese public is worried about the safety of its foreign - exchange reserves . ”
China is the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries – with almost $ 800 billion worth in its national piggy bank .
Understandably , therefore , the Chinese are not thrilled to see Treasury prices plummeting , while America ’s budget deficit is soaring .
Seventeen of twenty - three Chinese economists polled in connection with Geithner ’s visit said holdings of Treasuries were a “ great risk ” for their nation ’s economy .
“ It will be helpful if Geithner can show us some arithmetic , ” said Yu. Regrettably , basic arithmetic would produce more consternation than comfort .
No matter how you line up the numbers , the sum will always be an enormous , gigantic , colossal NEGATIVE number .
No , Geithner does not need arithmetic ; he needs a miracle …or a printing press .
Without some sort of miracle that converts liabilities into assets , America ’s debt is already larger than national cash flow would support .
We would be broke already , were it not for two convenient facts :
1 ) Our creditors keep lending us money ; 2 ) Even if they did n’t , we can print for ourselves the money with which we must re-pay our debts .
So it ’s probably safe to say that America will not default on its debt .
But it ’s also probably safe to say that the dollars our creditors receive in the future will be worth much less than the dollars they loaned us in the first place .
“ We are committed to bringing our fiscal deficits down over the medium term to a sustainable place , to a sustainable level , ” says Geithner .
“ We believe in a strong dollar .
A strong dollar is in the U.S. interest . ”
China ’s Yu Yongding does not seem to believe him .
Says Yu : “ I wish to tell the U.S. government : ‘ Do n’t be complacent and think there is n’t any alternative for China to buy your bills and bonds . ’
The euro is an alternative .
And there are lots of raw materials we can still buy . ’’
To sharpen the point , Yu continued , “ Some people say the euro is very weak .
Okay , weak is good , we ’ll buy very cheap . ’’
Geithner promises that America will keep its spending under control .
But the promise rings hollow from a leading member of an economic team that will produce a $ 2 tillion deficit in its very first effort to “ control spending . ”
The Obama Administration did not invent deficit spending , but it has quickly mastered the art .
“ The borrower should keep their promises , ” China ’s Yu insists .
“ The U.S. should be a responsible country . ”
It should be , but it ’s not .
The nearby chart , based on data provided by Shadow Stats , tracks the explosive growth of America ’s national indebtedness over the last few years .
This chart presents America ’s indebtedness in terms of both cash - based accounting and GAAP - based accrual accounting .
The latter of these two methods is the one that every corporation in America must use .
As such , GAAP is real - world accounting , which would include things like the present value of the Social Security liability and the Medicare liability .
At $ 12 trillion for year - end 2009 , the cash - based deficit is bad enough ; but at $ 74 trillion , the GAAP - based numbers are a catastrophe .
$ 74 trillion is about five times GDP , which is a ratio that would put America well within emerging market parameters .
The only problem is ; we are n’t emerging .
We are submerging …at least from the standpoint of national indebtedness .
These data points should frighten any student of financial history .
Therefore , these data points should terrify every holder of dollar - denominated assets .
The good news – and remember , it ’s all good news right now – is that Rome was n’t destroyed in a day .
There may be a way out of this mess – we certainly hope so – but America ’s current fiscal plight reminds us of General Motors .
For many , many years , General Motors survived on its reputation .
Despite the company ’s obvious financial distress and obvious inability to book a profit selling cars , investors continued to buy the company ’s bonds and to bid its shares higher .
Thus , GM racked up liabilities far in excess of what it could ever hope to repay .
Sound familiar ?
Converting a Black & White Picture to Color
Posted by tech master | at 2:14 PM
Photoshop Knowledge required : Medium
External Plug-ins required : None
( Before starting reset your workspace by Window ---> Workspace ---> Reset Palette Locations )
This could be an interesting tutorial .
Using this you can color almost any Black & White image .
Actually there are two ways to color an image .
You have to use them according to your needs .
The methods are sorted with simplicity .
I method : Simplest
Adobe Photoshop has a great blending mode called the color mode .
It can give fantastic effects !
Step 1 : Select the color you want to do to a specific part of image
Step 2 : Select " Brush Tool " { Size : Choose according to your needs --- Mode : " Overlay " or " Color " --- Opacity : 100 --- Flow : 100}
Step 3 : Go nuts !
Just paint the area of the picture you want to color
Pros : Easiest coloring possible , well for newbieâ€™s who do n't want the resultant image to be too realistic .
Cons :
Very time consuming , provides pretty cheap results , you can't adjust the colors because you 'll have to paint again ...
II method : Hardest
Remember that in this method you 'll have to work with objects that are in the front and then go to the objects in the background .
Here I 'm taking a picture that comes with Adobe Photoshop as a sample .
You can find it in [ Drive ] : \Program Files \Adobe \ Photoshop CS \Samples\RanchHouse.jpg
Step 1 : Change the image to color mode by Image --->
Mode ---> RGB Color ( !!!IMPORTANT !!!
Always check this )
Step 2 : Zoom to about 200 %
Step 3 : Select the magnetic lasso tool { Feather : 1px --- Anti-aliased : Yes --- Width : 10px --- Edge Contrast : 10 % --- Frequency : 100}
Step 4 : Now click on the edge of any object Coat , Boot , Hat , Door etc ...
( Not the wall or the floor )
Step 5 : Just move your mouse cursor around the edges of the object until you have a complete selection .
Like this
{ Tip :
If your magnetic lasso tool does n't go where you want it to , you can just click the points manually .
To remove the last point just press backspace .
Refer to Photoshop manual for more assistance}
Step 6 : Press Ctrl + J to do " Layer via Copy "
Step 7 : Go to Image -->
Adjustments -->
Hue / Saturation { Colorize : Yes}
Step 8 : Now adjust the Hue / Saturation and Lightness until your object looks realistic .
{ Tip :
The realism of the resulting image depends on the experimenting you have done .
And the amount of efforts put to small objects .
Always remember to experiment with the " Brightness / Contrast option to make your objects looks better}
Step 9 : Set the blending mode of the layer to " Color " .
You can experiment with others too ...
Step 10 : Do the same for every other object .
( Remember to click on the Background layer first )
{ Tip : Using " Magnetic Lasso " tool wo n't always do the work ...
It is difficult to select the images using this tool ...
So after using this tool ... select the " Rectangular Marquee " tool and select the " Add to selection button " ( Hold your mouse over the buttons to make the text appear " and then draw at the edges}
t
Step 11 : To color the background ( Ground , Wall ) you need not worry about the selection too much because you have already colored the objects and put them over the top of the background ...
So Click on the Background layer and just select the wall including the objects and directly apply " Hue / Saturation " to it ...
Step 12 : Layer --->
Flatten Image
Step 13 : Image --->
Adjustments ---> Auto Levels & Auto Contrast & Auto Color
This should make you able to color most of the B&W images to color ...

Revolution # 169 , June 28 , 2009
CPI ( MLM ) communiqué no 6 :
" People Beware !
Mousavi is not your brother and he is not on your side ! "
June 2 , 2009 .
A World to Win News Service .
Following are excerpts from Communiqué no. 6 of the Communist Party of Iran ( Marxist - Leninist - Maoist ) , put out on the morning of June 20 .
These words might sound unpleasant for many of you engaged in bloody battle with the enemy , but open your eyes and ears !
Mir Hossein Mousavi called on you to " consider the Basiji your brothers . "
This means you should consider your brothers those who used knives and machetes on the bodies of your dearest sons and daughters .
Mousavi told you " not to consider the army to be against you . "
This means considering to be your friends those who under the orders of Khamenei are trying to smash your uprising and are shooting our youth in many corners of the country .
Young people , be alert !
Mousavi claims that " the genuine call of Islamic revolution " is what has moved you .
This is a blatant lie .
He knows very well that what has moved you is a burning desire to change this world .
It 's impossible to change the existing order without overthrowing the Islamic Republic .
Mousavi claimed that " the heritage of the far - sighted Imam [ Khomeini ] " is what has inspired you .
This is also a blatant lie .
Khomeini 's first measures after taking power were to slice women 's faces with knives , force them to cover their heads , and take away their basic rights .
He sent the army to suppress the people of Kurdistan , Khoozistan , and Turkmen Sahra .
Is that what has inspired you ?
Brave young women and men , pay attention to Mousavi 's real demands !
He calls you to " the Islamic revolution as it was and the Islamic Republic as it should be . "
He tells you , " You are not against the sacred Islamic Republic system and its legal structures . "
He tells you that you must seek reform , " a reform with a return to the pure principles of the Islamic Revolution .... "
Look at this society drowning in corruption , destruction , superstition , dark religious ignorance , drug addiction , and prostitution .
These are the fruits of those pure principles .
Principles against which you have courageously risen .
Mousavi says , " Many of our problems are the consequence of lies . "
But he himself is lying ...
One of Mousavi 's big lies in 1981 was to slander the Sarbedaran uprising in Iran as " inspired by the Shah . "
The Sarbedaran uprising was waged to overthrow the Islamic Republic and save the people 's revolution , but it was defeated .
These are facts that you all must know .
In these decisive days , besides bravery and perseverance in the battlefield , you must arm and strengthen your mind with the truths of the last 30 years .
These truths light up our road and further strengthen us .
Mousavi , with his religious preaching , wants to numb your searching brains .
If you know the truth — that the quarrel between Mousavi , Rafsanjani , and [ opposition figure Mehdi ] Karoubi on the one hand , and Khamenei and Ahmadinejad on the other , is a quarrel between two power - and money - hungry Mafia gangs and has nothing to do with your interests — then you can find the real liberating road and dare to scale the heights for your liberation .
Young women and men— fight !
But fight with open eyes and lofty goals !
Mousavi 's trademarks are the slogan " God is great " and the [ Islamic ] color green .
Many of you think that these symbols are important for your unity .
But they are first and foremost the symbols of the society that Mousavi promises to build — nothing but the same Islamic Republic with minor reforms to make it stronger .
Is this really the kind of society you want ?
Is it worth so much sacrifice ?
Why can't we make sacrifices for much higher and loftier goals ?
Why not struggle for a fundamentally different society and future ?
A society free of all oppression and exploitation .
A society where everyone shares and cooperates .
Where the equality of women and men is a fundamental and self - evident principle .
Where the beautiful scenes of collaboration , mutual help , and consideration we are witnessing in our common battles today would be institutionalized .
A society that is rid of boredom and stagnation , and always lively and active .
Should n't we think about these things and debate them even in the midst of the battle ?
In fact it is decisive for the future of our uprising to know what kind of society we want and how we can bring it about .
This view , perspective , and commitment must be linked up broadly with your anger and struggle today against this bigoted and fraudulent rule .
This is the only way to prevent our efforts in this historical juncture from going to waste and prevent us from confusing friends and enemies .
Let 's raise our level of consciousness !
And widely stir debate among the masses !
Form revolutionary cells of the most advanced young women and men in each neighborhood , factory , and university to widely distribute leaflets , do exposures and raise consciousness among the masses and bring more people into the various militant struggles .
A World to Win News Service is put out by A World to Win magazine ( aworldtowin.org ) , a political and theoretical review inspired by the formation of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement , the embryonic center of the world ’s Marxist - Leninist - Maoist parties and organizations .

We live in a world surrounded by Times New Roman , Arial and Helvetica , typefaces so functional that they have long since become boring .
It ’s a shame that we rarely come into contact with the wealth of endlessly creative typefaces out there , relying instead on the tried and tested .
I have scoured the web to bring you 20 of the most creative typefaces available , many of which have been designed by amateur typographers .
Most of them are free to download and use ( some for non-commercial purposes only ) , so please make the most of them .
Together , we can push for a more diverse , interesting and ultimately creative typeface landscape .
With that in mind , here they are : twenty seriously creative typefaces .
1. Laurent HW
Characters in this typeface appear as though they have been written in fountain pen onto slightly absorbent paper .
This gives the nostalgic impression of a school child ’s scrawl in an exercise book .
2. Skinographie
Skinographie is a typeface constructed solely from clothes pegs and skin .
Pegs are applied to a human canvas in order to form an alphabet of lowercase letters .
It ’s certainly not the most attractive typeface in this list , in fact it ’s rather disgusting , but never let it be said it ’s not creative !
While some letters like ‘ I ’ , for example , can easily be recreated at home , others like ‘ E ’ can only be reproduced on people with high pain thresholds and exceptionally saggy skin .
I ’m not sure whether it ’s possible to create punctuation marks using this method , but the very thought of it brings tears to my eyes .
3. Origram
Inspired by origami , Origram is a simple , but very effective typeface with an obvious Asian influence .
The strokes within each character end at a sharp point , as with folded paper .
4. Adry of Hanabi
This typeface is very reminiscent of European street art .
Most of the characters incorporate a relaxed , spiral motif , which has a certain graffiti - like quality .
Most types of ink contain high levels of volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) , hazardous air pollutants ( HAPs ) and heavy metals , which are all environmentally degrading .
Typographer Collin Willems has designed a typeface called Ecofont , which he hopes will reduce the amount of ink used in the printing industry and make it more sustainable .
Each Ecofont character contains a row of tiny circles , reducing its ‘ weight ’ and the amount of ink required to print it .
Although Ecofont is not suitable for every application , it ’s perfect for ‘ throw - away printing ’ , which comprises the majority of printed output .
This cute typeface , which looks like its been based on a 13 - year - old girl ’s doodle , is both eye - catching and very fun .
Its ‘ messiness ’ adds to its charm , but does not detract from its legibility .
Each letter in this typeface has been designed as a pyramid , viewed from above .
Not every character is as legible as it could or should be , but the design is extremely creative nonetheless .
Designed by French font factory SMeltery , this bold typeface has some extremely creative ligatures .
It ’s at its best when it ’s big and looks particularly striking when used on posters .
9. MOD
MOD is a font family consisting of variations on a theme of proportional , chunky , block characters .
Some of these lack clarity , which is a shame , but the ones made from spilt milk and smoke spirals are highly imaginative .
10 . Exus Pilot
This typeface is similar to MOD in many ways and is just as attractive .
Unlike MOD however , it is a serif font , which really adds clarity and aids legibility .
11 . Cube
Cube is a gorgeous , 3 - dimensional typeface , available in a range of vivid colours .
It ’s crisp , clear - cut and looks as though it ’s been shaped from folded cardboard boxes .
LDJ Crafty is a fun , hand - drawn typeface that would be perfect for use in media aimed at kids .
13 . Plasti Puzzle Font
Plasti Puzzle was designed by Rodier - Kid , an extremely talented Argentinean graphic designer and typographer .
Words written in this typeface are immediately intelligible , despite the cartoon - like , bubbly style .
14 . Cinderella Decorative
This beautifully embellished typeface is reminiscent of the illuminated calligraphy of the Middle Ages .
Each character could be the first in an antique book of fairytales .
Sausage is an elongated , elegant typeface , which is inventive but comprehensible .
The overlaying of ‘ sausages ’ to build characters creates an intriguing 3D effect .
16 . Getting Blocky
This highly original typeface looks great , but does suffer somewhat at the hands of its own stylisation .
Some letters , particularly ‘ R’ , ‘ N’ , and ‘ X ’ , look confusing on their own , although they do tend to work in sentence form .
This cool typeface looks great on flyers for club night and other events .
Each minimalist character has a rounded structure , while some end in a point , like Origram .
Contemporary is modern , lightweight and oozes style .
The overlapping of characters is highly effective in this instance , although I personally think it would look more fluid if the ‘ A ’ and ‘ V ’ were less slanted .
19 . Renaissance
Like Cinderella Decorative , this ornamental typeface owes much to illuminated calligraphy .
Its detailed characters are interspersed with wildlife and angelic figures .
Dora is an example of how easy it is to make your own typeface .
Michael Slevin simply scanned his friend Dora ’s handwriting into a computer and made some minor adjustments .
It looks slightly sketchy , but this could be his first step on the road to typographic greatness .

The Temptation of Saint Anthony : The Zahir
The Zahir
Jorge Luis Borges
I had arrived in Uruguay on a tramp steamer from Cuba and had tried to work my way down the country to the Argentina , where I would stay with Borges .
But my money was nearly exhausted when I reached the Fray Bentos and I used the last of it to send a message to Borges , begging him to come help me .
But he was detained by the press of his librarianship , and could not take enough time off at such short notice to come and get me .
And so it happened that I lived for two weeks in a small town in Argentina with an insane cripple named Ireneo Funes .
I kept his cottage tidy and cooked for him and assisted him in all things , in return for sleeping in his corner and eating some of what I cooked .
The woman who normally took care of him , Maria Fuente , was eager for a vacation , even a brief one .
Funes was an irritating roommate .
He spoke little , and when he did it did not make any sense .
He would spend hours staring at a single object : his hand , a crack in the plaster , the tobacco in the end of his cigarette .
I learned , as the days passed with no word from my friends , that he had become crippled in a riding accident some time before and that he was dying of tuberculosis , a frequent affliction of the bedridden .
Eventually I realized the cause of Funes ' peculiar abstraction .
His accident had left him physically helpless , but endowed with a memory perfect in its accuracy and perfect in its detail .
He could remember everything he had ever seen , or heard , or thought .
He remembered in detail not only every experience he had ever had , but all the times that he had remembered each experience , and the memories were as distinct and different to him as the beads of a rosary .
The leaves of a tree were not leaves to him ; he could remember each leaf in detail and compare it in his mind with each other , or with a leaf on another tree , a leaf of the same tree on another day , with a spray of water from the river that wetted him as a child .
I heard him mention those leaves once .
He said that a certain leaf was curled like the curve of Pedro Althazar 's horse 's rump on the twenty - third day of March , only more graceful .
`` At the moment it shook off that fly , '' he added , seeing my perplexity .
`` Which fly ? ''
I asked .
`` It was the eleventh one I saw , '' he elucidated , ``but perhaps you saw some that I did not , since I did not rise from my bed to look out the window . ''
After a week of living with Funes , I feared that a malady of the mind had begun to overtake me also , and at first I ascribed it to the stress of having to live with this superhuman cripple .
It was a simple thing , and yet it disturbed me , for I could find no explanation for it , and it seemed so small , so arbitrary , as to be completely removed from all rhyme or reason .
The nature of the malady was this :
On one wall of the cottage was a shelf on which I stored the containers of spices and seasonings with which I flavored Funes ' food , and one of these jars of seasoning was a pepper - mill .
Even after all these years I remember it : it was about six inches tall , cylindrical , made of a dark brown - stained wood with six longitudinal burnt scars .
The handle was too small and was made of dull steel .
At the time I was completely unable to remember it .
Meal after meal I cooked and would want to add mustard , and immediately my mind would fix on the mustard - pot and I would know where the mustard - pot was .
I would look for the cilantro , and reach out my hand without even thinking , and there it would be .
But when I wanted the pepper - mill , I could not remember whether we even had one .
I would feel sure that we did , that we must , although I could not remember for certain , and would be unable to call its image or its location to my mind .
Finally I would search the cabinet and the shelves , and come across the pepper - mill by chance .
I would look at it stupidly , feeling sure that this was indeed a pepper - mill ( for it looked just like a pepper - mill ) but being unable to recollect it .
Finally I would use the pepper and put the mill back on the shelf , resolving to remember it the next time .
After this had happened three times , I was distraught .
I knew that the last three times I had wanted the pepper I had been unable to remember the pepper - mill and had had to search for it .
And even though I remembered doing this , I could not be sure that we really had one and try as I might I simply could not remember what it looked like or where it was .
I had nightmares that somehow Funes was devouring my mnemonic capability to feed his own .
I went to speak to Maria Fuente , but she only said that he was the spawn of the devil , and that was no help .
Finally one day I burnt Funes ' dinner by tarrying too long in searching for the pepper -mill .
This brought sharp words from Funes , who , as you may imagine , had no patience with the memory lapses of others .
I did not want to tell him of my fears and my persistently failing memory ; I had a half - formed idea that Funes was deliberately causing my weird forgetfulness , and I was afraid of what I might find out .
I would have told him that it was the first time I had forgotten the pepper - mill , only I could not remember what it was I had been looking for .
But for some reason , he demanded to know what it was , and I bleakly wandered around the cottage , opened the cabinet and searched the shelves , until I found the pepper - mill , and then I remembered .
`` Ah , '' said I , ``it was the pepper - mill . ''
At this , he almost sat up .
``Pepper - mill ?'' he said .
`` What pepper - mill ? ''
`` The brown wooden one , '' said I. ``So long , '' holding my hands about six inches apart , ``and about this big around . ''
``I have never seen this pepper - mill , '' he said .
`` Is it Maria's ?
Did she bring it while I was asleep ? ''
I said that as far as I knew it had been in the cottage longer than I had .
`` Let me see it , '' he commanded , and I brought the pepper -mill .
Funes examined it closely , even minutely .
` `I have never seen it before .
Indeed , I did not even know I possessed such a thing .
Speak to me no more of it , '' and he sank back onto the bed , quiet .
He seemed profoundly disturbed for the rest of the evening , and he did not speak again before I went to sleep .
But I was awakened in the middle of the night .
Funes was standing over me , in itself a cause for alarm , as he never arose from his bed except in the direst of emergencies .
``Dominus , '' he said , shaking me and almost losing his unsteady footing , ``Dominus !
That ... thing you showed me this evening .
What was it ?
I have forgotten it . ''
I could not remember , but I was able to get him to go back to bed while I hunted it up .
He was trembling , and there was a wild light in his eyes .
Finally I found the pepper -mill .
`` Here , '' I said at last , tossing it to him .
`` Here it is . ''
He caught it , and as he examined it , he grew more and more perplexed and even wilder than before .
``I thought that I would know it when I saw it again , '' he cried .
`` But I am sure I have never seen this before in my life !''
``So you said this afternoon , '' I reminded him .
``I know I said it this afternoon !'' he screamed .
``I remember saying it this afternoon .
But of the pepper - mill I have no recollection whatsoever .
Where was it ? ''
`` It was on the little shelf , '' I said .
He made me hold him up as he came to examine the shelf .
`` Where ? '' he asked .
`` Here ? ''
I assented .
He leaned against me and studied the shelf , and then , satisfied at last , hobbled painfully back to bed .
But He did not sleep .
Of that I am sure .
He lay awake , smoking and biting his nails , until morning .
When I awoke he looked haggard and there was cigarette ash on the floor beside his cot .
He never spilt his cigarette ash ; he found the details of the random patterns of the ash on the floor distracting and irritating , and they disturbed and excited him so that he could not rest .
He was mumbling to himself .
``Salt shaker , '' he said .
``Garlic press .
Large head of garlic .
Fourteen dead flies .
Small head of garlic .
Jug of oil . ''
He saw that I was awake .
`` There were seven hundred and fourteen distinct entities on that shelf last night , '' he said instantly .
``Counting small chili peppers , spilled grains of rice , fragments of garlic and onion skin , and flecks of soil .
I can remember all but one of them .
What is the missing object ? ''
I could not remember .
I went to the shelf and enumerated the large objects aloud .
When I came to that abominable pepper - mill we were both surprised .
` `A pepper - mill , '' mused Funes , gazing at it .
``I thought perhaps it might have been a pepper - mill , but I then thought it might have been many things . ''
And he turned over and went to sleep with the pepper - mill under his pillow .
I went out walking on the pampas , leaving a lunch by Funes ' bed ..
That evening when I returned Funes was in a state again .
He could not remember the whatever - it - was , and this time we could not find it .
Half an our of searching finally turned it up under his pillow , and again Funes and I examined it interestedly , wondering how we could forget such a commonplace object .
I was careful to put the pepper - mill back on the shelf , in view of Funes ' bed , to prevent this sort of farce from happening again .
I had a limited success with this effort , since Funes forgot the pepper - mill whenever he averted his eyes from it .
I eventually suspended it from the ceiling over his bed , so that it would be obvious to him as much of the time as possible , although this availed him nothing when he had his eyes shut , or when he slept on his belly .
Later I went to Maria Fuentes to ask for a less troublesome pepper - mill .
She forwned , and said ``I was so sure that there was one there already , '' , but could not recollect it , and so lent me another .
As I left , I heard her wonder to herself about how she could have cooked so long for Funes without having a pepper - mill .
This stopped me from worrying so much about my own sanity , since I realized that nobody , not even Funes , could remember the accursed pepper - mill , and as long as Funes was quiet I was able to forget about it ( forget about the mysterious forgetting , I mean --- forgetting the pepper - mill itself was easy ) and pass the time calmly .
Funes occasionally awoke in the middle of the night , and , being unable to see the pepper - mill hanging suspended in front of his face in the dark , would rustle and talk to himself and finally strike a light , before he caught sight of the pepper - mill and was able to get back to sleep .
Thus I did not sleep too well at night , but my days were idle and peaceful and so I got enough rest .
I eventually received a letter from Borges saying that he would come for me in a few days , and I passed those days pleasantly .
I took in fresh air and wrestled with the young men of the village .
The days were carefree and happy , and I dreaded returning to the cottage to cook for Funes , who would stare at the pepper - mill , looking quite deranged , and mutter to himself in different languages , describing it over and over again , for hours on end , and then suddenly shut his eyes and try to remember it .
He never succeeded .
Borges arrived a few days later to take me away , and I left that madhouse gratefully and went with him to Buenos Aires .
I have ever since been struck by the irony of the situation in Fray Bentos .
Funes alone would have been immune to the Zahir , for the quantity and detail of his memory alone would have been beyond the coin 's power to compass .
But an Anti-Zahir , a thing which nobody could remember at all , no matter how often they saw it , was , for a man with an otherwise perfect memory , the thing that most stuck in his mind .

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) , which helped usher in the Kyoto Agreement that was intended to limit emissions of greenhouse gasses , is now gearing up for the next major round of climate talks , which will take place in December , hosted by Copenhagen , Denmark .
Many are hoping that the successor to Kyoto will provide comprehensive targets for emissions , and involve many more nations in the framework .
But the national scientific academies of 70 nations have issued a statement warning that the exclusive focus on climate change may result in plans that ignore an equally significant risk : ocean acidification .
The statement was organized by the Interacademy Panel , which is an international umbrella group that coordinates the activities of national and regional science organizations .
In this case , the IAP has gotten 70 academies to sign on , including some from nations that will be pivotal in the Copenhagen negotiations , such as the US , China , India , and Japan , although Russia appears to be absent .
The sense that scientific issues transcend political disputes is reinforced by some of the strange bedfellows among the signatories .
It 's not often you see national organizations from the US , Cuba , and Venezuela signing on to the same document , or Iran , Israel , and the Palestinians endorsing a single position .
To avoid the worst of the consequences , the statement argues that we need to cut global CO2 emissions in half by the century 's midpoint ; that 's significantly more aggressive than many of the plans that have been proposed to address climate change , which focus on goals for the century 's end .
The document emphasizes that the oceans , by acting as a sink for carbon dioxide emissions , are both an inseparable part of the climate change equation , and pose some distinct risks that should not be ignored .
The scale of the oceans and their ability to absorb carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , both by dissolving it and by hosting organisms that metabolize it , make them a key part of the atmospheric carbon cycle .
The statement cites estimates that about a quarter of humanity 's CO 2 emissions over the past 200 years have wound up in the oceans ; without that , climate change would have been more dramatic .
But , when dissolving in water , CO 2 forms a weak acid and , in the process , changes the chemistry of the oceans .
Just as the current atmospheric levels of CO 2 have n't been seen in over 800,000 years , there are changes in the ocean chemistry that have n't been seen for a similar length of time .
Since preindustrial times , the statement notes , pH levels have dropped by 0.1 unit , which may not sound like much until you consider that pH is measured on a logarithmic scale ( the authors conveniently rephrase this as " a 30 percent increase in hydrogen ion activity " ) .
The excess dissolved CO 2 is likely to affect the oxygen / CO 2 exchange of metabolically active species — the statement cites squid as being especially vulnerable .
But the key impact is on carbonate ions , as many organisms use carbonate compounds to build structures that range from the microscopic , though the shells of mollusks , and up to geographic features like coral reefs .
" Carbonate ion concentrations are now lower than at any other time during the last 800,000 years , " the authors note , and we 're on track for even bigger changes : " projections suggest that by mid-century CO 2 concentrations will be more than double preindustrial levels and the oceans will be more acidic than they have been for tens of millions of years .
The current rate of change is much more rapid than during any event over the last 65 million years .
These changes in ocean chemistry are irreversible for many thousands of years , and the biological consequences could last much longer . "
The authors state that , at current rates of CO 2 emissions , ecosystems in polar waters will be under severe stress within the next 50 years .
They recognize that some species will do well in the changed conditions ; for example , a recent study shows that a species of sea star likes warm , acidic water , even though it results in a reduction of the organism 's calcified structures .
Still , it will be difficult to avoid a generalized disruption of oceanic ecosystems , with obvious consequences for cultures that rely on the sea as a food source .
To avoid the worst of the consequences , the statement argues that we need to cut global CO 2 emissions in half by the century 's midpoint ; that 's significantly more aggressive than many of the plans that have been proposed to address climate change , which focus on goals for the century 's end .
It calls on the Copenhagen negotiators to set this as a goal .
The authors also highlight the fact that reducing carbon dioxide emissions is the only way to tackle the problem ; various geoengineering proposals would avert rising temperatures by limiting incident sunlight , but those wo n't slow the drop in oceanic pH .
And , finally , the statement calls upon other measures to reduce the stress on oceanic ecosystems , such as further efforts to limit overfishing .
The release of the statement was announced by the Chinese Minister of Health , Chen Zu , and Howard Alper , the president of Canada 's Science , Technology and Innovation Council .
" The implications of ocean acidification cannot be overstated , " the duo said .
" There has been much talk among the science community over the past few years about ocean acidification and its potentially catastrophic consequences , but it has failed to receive the political attention it demands .
Its absence from discussions to - date is of immense concern , and we call for its immediate inclusion as a vital part of the climate change agenda . "
Although this statement is addressed towards policy makers , realistically , it seems that many of them are already convinced action is necessary , but are constrained by economic and political concerns .
The key factor may be whether the process of ocean acidification and its consequences are accessible enough to register with the public that establishes these constraints .

Updates for Saturday , June 13 and Sunday , June 14 .
As our colleagues in Iran , Robert Worth and Nazila Fathi , continue to update their news article with the latest developments on the aftermath of Friday ’s disputed Iranian presidential election , The Lede is tracking the debate unfolding on the Web this weekend as to what the election results mean .
We will bring you updates and encourage Iranian readers to share their thoughts and experiences with us .
Readers can add their comments to the active debate in the thread we opened on Friday or use the space beneath this post to share information or views about the outcome that was announced on Saturday .
Sunday ’s updates
A report from Iran ’s Press TV says that the country ’s most senior cleric , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , said that the country ’s election was a great success and “ has once again approved its result . ”
Since Ayatollah Khamenei is the ultimate authority in Iran ’s complex governing structure , it seems clear that the regime is digging in against the protests by the opposition .
Press TV added that Ayatollah Khamenei said that “ psychological warfare aimed at discouraging people from voting failed . ”
My colleagues Robert Worth and Nazila Fathi report from Tehran that the opposition ’s calls for the election results to be rejected were joined on Sunday by some clerics :
A moderate clerical body , the Association of Combatant Clergy , issued a statement posted on reformist Web sites saying the election was rigged and calling for it to be canceled , warning that “ if this process becomes the norm , the republican aspect of the regime will be damaged and people will lose confidence in the system . ”
That call seems to have been rejected though , since more than 100 prominent opposition members have been detained and Mir Hussein Moussavi reportedly “ remained at home Sunday with the police closely monitoring his movements . ”
The Lede will return with updates early Monday morning to follow developments on a day when the opposition has called for rallies across Iran .
At a small protest outside the United Nations in New York on Sunday , about 150 supporters of the Iranian opposition denounced the official results of Friday ’s presidential election in Iran and waved signs calling it a “ coup . ”
Many of the protesters wore green , the color of opposition candidate Mir Hussein Moussavi ’s movement and chanted “ Where is my vote ? ”
One interesting moment at the demonstration involved a handful of royalists who showed up waving a flag from the era of Shah .
They were quickly intercepted and chased away by the supporters of Mr. Moussavi who made up the vast majority of the crowd .
After the incident , one of Mr. Moussavi ’s green - clad supporters told your Lede blogger that the group gathered today does not oppose the Islamic Republic , but simply wants the votes cast last Friday to be counted fairly .
The Lede is off to observe the protest outside the United Nations , but we will file more updates later today .
Here is a report from The A.P. which includes footage of Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s press conference on Sunday :
By way of contrast , here ’s a video posted on YouTube by a member of the Facebook group Ahmadinejad is NOT my president !
One sign of how effective the disruption of the Internet inside Iran has been is that Iranian Flickr accounts , which were flooded with images of opposition rallies in the days before the election , have , with rare exceptions , remain static since Friday .
One British - Iranian blogger we pointed to on Friday , did manage to post this single image of Saturday ’s protests on his account , along with this comment :
I ’ve missed too many good photos , it ’s tricky when you ’re on the run from police on bikes with batons .
This was really only the beginning though .
Things got a lot worse after this .
In the shot I ’m ahead of most of the rioting .
Getting to close means a more distressing run when the weird shot like sounds accompany the revs of the bikes get close .
He added :
Tehran has had a dramatic change in mood from last week to now , between which we ’ve voted for our next president .
It was always going to be a tight race that many suspected we lead to a second round of voting .
The two favourites being the incumbent Ahmadinejad and the so called reformer candidate , Mir Hossein Mousavi .
It was also expected that the voter turnout would be high with these two candidates pitched against one another .
What was n’t expected was a “ landslide victory ” for Ahmadinejad in the first round .
He ’s much loved in rural Iran and could just have taken it , but the result just read like fiction .
Another Flickr account , Mousavi1388 , which may be maintained from outside Iran , posted a few images that look like they were taken on a mobile phone camera earlier today , including this one , from Tehran ’s Vali Asr Boulevard , where the victory rally for Mr. Ahmadinejad was held :
Tehran Bureau reports that their Web site , which is based in the U.S. but is taking in feeds from Iran , is back up .
Here is a brief text report they have just psoted from an anonymous correspondent in the Iranian city of Isfahan :
From Isfahan , where there was a massive crackdown on a university dormitory ( along with arrests ) : I am safe , yet in desperate need for sleep .
Not only did they steal the vote but they are rubbing it in our faces , Ahmadinejad is holding “ Thank You Ceremonies ” !!!
all over the country , they are giving away ice cream and cakes … Isfahan is almost quiet today , but in Tehran & Ahwaz unrest continues , the people have devised a clever method of hit & run , although I am against destruction and anarchy , but that ’s the only way left to voice an opposition .
The protests have become localized , in the neighborhoods small contingents of protestors gather , chant , throw stones and before the police can react they retreat to their houses only to emerge when the police is gone .
In response security forces have deployed thousands of motor riding forces , one drives the other one slings his club right & left , a sort of quick response task force .
Today I witnessed a motorcade of at least 30 of such odd couples !!!!
That report is followed by another sobering thought on how disillusioned many reformist voters are today :
you know the worst thing about all of this is that now there is no refuge left for the people , if someone from within the government does any wrong doing , there will be no higher authority to go to , if you are beaten up , and want to press charges , they will imprison you instead .
I am very angry at myself for being fooled so easily , they got us to vote , which gave them legitimacy , and then they manipulated the results , many are vowing never to vote again .
Earlier on Sunday one Iranian Twitter user , using the name Change_For_Iran , tweeted : “ according to rumor mousavi requested all people to gather near his office at 12:30 pm today . ”
That was quickly shot down by the Tehran Bureau ’s Twitter feed which replied : “ @Change_for_ Iran this is a trap !
if you dont believe me then check with mousavi sites .
order is to hold back till word .
pls RT ” The sign - off “ pls RT ” is Twitter lingo for “ please re-tweet ” or pass on the message .
For all the reported power of the Internet and social - networking tools to mobilize support for political movements , the regime in Iran may be counting on the fact that the opposition ’s “ green wave ” will have trouble emulating the success of the “ orange revolution ” in Ukraine if the Internet and text messaging continues to be disrupted inside Iran .
Protests on Sunday and Monday are being scheduled via Facebook by Iranian opposition supporters in other countries .
The Lede is heading up to observe a protest outside the United Nations in New York at 2 p.m.
Information on other events is being posted at a site called Where Is My Vote ?
A new post on the Tehran Bureau Twitter feed , reports a slightly earlier time for Monday ’s opposition rallies across Iran :
Mousavi ’s wife today called for a united , peaceful demonstration across 20 cities from 4 pm tomorrow Monday , and a national strike on Tuesday .
The late afternoon timing of the rallies may be an indication that Mr. Moussavi ’s campaign wants to show its strength during daylight hours in the United States and Europe .
The BBC has video of the large victory rally for Mr. Ahmadinejad on Sunday in Tehran .
Earlier , Tehran Bureau ’s Twitter feed objected that Western media organizations were giving too much air time to these officially - sanctioned video images from Iranian state television : “ It ’s too bad CNN ’s cameras are focused on the staged sham , while protesters being brutally beaten ( and God knows what ) elsewhere . ”
Press TV , Iran ’s state - supported satellite news channel , confirms the report that Mr. Moussavi is calling for rallies across Iran on Monday :
In a statement , defeated candidate Mir-Hossein Moussavi says he has asked Iranian authorities to issue a permit for staging rallies in cities around the country .
“ These rallies will give the Iranian people an opportunity to express their opposition to election process and its result , ” Moussavi said in a statement on Sunday .
He added that he has asked the Guardian Council , the body that supervises elections , to cancel the result of the Friday ’s poll in which President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared victor by a landslide .
In his statement , the former prime minister said that Iranian authorities have made no response to the request for rallies .
“ If the officials agree with the request , it will be the best way to control the current sentiments , ” he added .
Moussavi also criticized communication disruption in Iran over the past two days and said , “ This will provoke reaction .
It is concerning that it will turn into blind moves . ”
The Telecommunication Company of Iran ( TCI ) earlier confirmed that text message ( SMS ) services had been shut down just hours before the opening of the 10th presidential election on Friday .
Before the site went down , Tehran Bureau reported that the opposition candidate Mir Hussein Moussavi has called for rallies across Iran to protest the results on Monday and a general strike on Tuesday .
Here is the last update we read on Tehran Bureau this morning before the site went down :
Just in from Tehran ( 9:32 am EST ) Zahra Rahnavard gave a speech at Tehran University today , Sunday , June 14 .
To a large audience of students , Ms. Rahnavard announced the latest official statement issued by Mir Hossein Mousavi , who has pledged he will not back down from contesting the fraudulent 22 Khordad election results .
Mousavi calls on all Reformist supporters to take part in a PEACEFUL MARCH & MASS DEMONSTRATION in 20 cities across Iran on Monday , June 15 ( doshanbeh , 25 Khordad ) at 17:00 to denounce the election results as fraud .
He has applied for a license to protect the safety of protestors .
The Tehran location is Valiasr Avenue , from Valiasr Square to Tajrish Square .
The locations in other cities are listed below .
Mousavi has also called for a NATIONAL STRIKE on Tuesday , June 16 ( Khordad 26 ) and asked all those who contest the results to close their shops , businesses , etc. and for employees to not go to work that day .
Communication is critical to success for a large turnout , so please forward this to every Iranian you know .
The statement is verified on Ghalam News ( ghalamnews.ir ) , the official site of the Mousavi campaign ( site rasmi setad ) .
UPDATES : – Ghalamnews , Mousavi ’s official setad site , has officially confirmed the march along Valiasr tomorrow ( Monday ) and a national strike on Tuesday .
PLEASE FWD THIS NEWS TO ALL .
Also , pls post on Facebook – it is blocked , but many can bypass filter and access it .
–
There is another rumor going around that the basij has stationed SNIPERS on valiasr … this may be a scare tactic rumor , but it is not unlikely … which makes things so much more deadly .
This should also be warned so people see how brutal the regime is prepared to be – worse than the Shah ’s army .
Here is a quick update of what we know of events on Sunday .
As my colleagues Robert Worth and Nazila Fathi report in their latest dispatch from Tehran , Iran ’s President held a press conference on Sunday in which he dismissed protests by opposition supporters and accusations that the election had been stolen :
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran on Sunday likened the protests disputing his election victory , the most intense disturbances in Tehran in a decade , as well as the possible arrests of his opponents to the passions of soccer .
Dozens of reformist politicians were said to have been arrested at their homes overnight , according to news reports on Sunday and a witness who worked with the politicians .
There were also reports of politicians and clerics being placed under house arrest .
In a wide - ranging news conference with domestic and foreign correspondents , Mr. Ahmadinejad said that his re-election was “ real and free ” and accused foreign media of launching a “ psychological war ” against Iran .
The Associated Press reports that communications remain disrupted inside the country :
Iran restored cell phone service that had been down in the capital since Saturday .
But Iranians could not send text messages from their phones , and the government increased its Internet filtering in an apparent attempt to undercut liberal voices .
Social networking sites including Facebook and Twitter were also not working .
The restrictions were likely intended to prevent Mousavi ’s supporters from organizing large - scale protests .
But smaller groups assembled around the city .
About 300 Mousavi supporters gathered outside Sharif University , chanting ” Where are our votes ? ”
It appears that direct attacks on Web sites passing on messages from the opposition have continued .
The Iranian - American Web site Tehran Bureau reports on its Twitter feed : “ tehranbureau.com down .
we got hacked and have to repair . ”

Saturday ’s Updates
We ’re signing off for the evening .
Please check the home page of NYTimes.com for any developments that may take place overnight .
The New York Times Op - Ed columnist Roger Cohen has filed a video report from Tehran , discussing the election and Saturday ’s protests .
Here is an unlikely but good source of photographs and video of protests in Iran earlier on Saturday : a discussion board on the Web site Big Soccer.com .
Thanks to the reader who pointed it out .
Time magazine ’s Nahid Siamdoust reports that the protests continued late into the night :
It ’s way past midnight in Tehran , but this city is not sleeping .
Outside on the streets , people are honking their horns in protest and stretching their hands out of cars making peace signs — a sign of support for Mir- Hossein Mousavi , the opposition candidate apparently defeated by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Iran ’s presidential election on Friday .
In neighborhoods across north and central Tehran , shouts of “ Death to dictator ! ” fill the air , mostly in female voices , coming from house windows .
There are also shouts of “ Allah - o Akbar ! ” — reminiscent of the revolution — on the urging of a communique from Mousavi ’s office .
Some of Tehran ’s main streets have been turned into urban battlegrounds .
Groups of mostly young men have set large garbage bins on fire in the middle of streets , torn out street signs and fences , broken the windows and ATM machines of state banks , and burnt at least five large buses in the middle of streets .
“ They have totally fooled us , ” said one sad man , a 32 - year - old state employee , standing by the roadside .
“ This time they went too far .
They just want to eliminate ‘ republic ’ and turn this into an Islamic dictatorship , ” he said with a sigh .
On Ghaem - Magham Street , a lone chadori woman stood by the roadside , making a peace sign with her index finger wrapped in a green ribbon , saying “ Mousavi ” to every passing car .
Out of 50 cars that passed , all but 5 either honked , rolled down their windows to shout their support , or made peace signs in solidarity . [… ]
Then a man in a car moving in the other direction rolled down his window and shouted at her in anger , “ You whore !
Why are you creating conflict between people ? ”
A basiji ( a member of the volunteer paramilitary aligned with Ahmadinejad ) charged at her from nowhere with a metal rod and was about to beat her when he was held down and beaten himself by five or six men streaming out of nearby cars .
“ I mean , just look at this !
If Ahmadinejad won 25 million votes , which they claim , we should be celebrating , right ? ” an onlooker commented .
The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran reports that the Iranian filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf said on Saturday that officials from Iran ’s Interior Ministry had contacted Mir Hussein Moussavi ’s campaign after the polls closed on Friday night , saying that he had won the election , but asking that he not make any announcement .
Mr. Makhmalbaf , who is currently in Paris , said , “ After security forces attacked and shut down the press offices of Moussavi ’s campaign in Gheitarieh yesterday , I was asked to act as their spokesperson abroad . ”
He added that he was asked to spread the word that “ last night Interior Ministry officials told Moussavi and his staff that he has won the elections but they should not make it public yet .
Moussavi ’s campaign , accordingly , began preparations for a public celebration on Sunday . ”
Of course Mr. Moussavi ignored the Interior Ministry request and did announce that he had won .
Soon after that , the Interior Ministry made what even Iranian state media reported was a “ surprise ” early declaration that Mr. Ahmadinejad had won , after less than 20 % of the ballots had been counted .
In what looks suspiciously like a related incident , Mr. Makhmalbaf ’s personal Web site seems to have been attacked .
A Google search for “ Makhmalbaf Film House , ” leads to a warning saying that within the past 24 hours Google had spotted “ malicious software being downloaded and installed without user consent ” from the filmmaker ’s Web site .
As Google ’s warning explains : “ In some cases , third parties can add malicious code to legitimate sites , which would cause us to show the warning message . ”
Your Lede blogger has visited the Web site Makhmalbaf.com many times in the past and never come across any such warning .
Before we sign off for the day , it is worth noting that the reader who claimed that Iranians in Boston had voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Ahmadinejad appears to have been wildly off the mark .
According to a report for the Global Post from Shirin Jaafari :
Mir Hossein Mousavi won the vote of Iranians in Boston with 89.5 percent of the votes cast at polling stations in Boston and Cambridge .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad got 3.3 percent , while Mehdi Karoubi took 6.6 percent and Mohsen Rezai got 0.33 percent .
The Tehran Bureau Web site has posted what it says is a letter from Mir Hussein Moussavi , in the Farsi original and English translation .
Unfortunately , they make no mention of how they got it , or why they believe it to be authentic , but it does track closely to the statement from Mr. Moussavi Channel 4 News quoted from earlier on Saturday .
If the letter is authentic , it is evidence that Mr. Moussavi has no intention of giving in .
The letter reads , in part :
I am obliged , due to my religious and national duties , to expose this dangerous plot and to explain its devastating effects on the future of Iran .
I am concerned that the continuation of the current situation will transform all key members of this regime into fabulists in confrontation with the nation and seriously jeopardize them in this world and the next .
Nate Silver , on his blog FiveThirty Eight.com , pours a lot of cold water on the statistical analysis we mentioned earlier , in this post .
Mr. Silver makes a clear case against the idea that a consistent two to one margin is evidence of fraud , leading to this observation :
I am not suggesting that any and all statistical analysis purporting to show tampering in Iran ’s election results will turn out to be fruitless .
I am merely suggesting that this particular analysis is dubious ; it is not a smoking gun .
Although it has nothing to do with statistics , this comment from an Iranian named Darius on FiveThirty Eight.com suggests how much the Internet has been disrupted in Iran :
I ’m sitting in my grandparents ’ house in Tehran right now and I ’m hearing mini-explosions , there ’s helicopters flying around , it smells like smoke , and it took fifteen minutes for this website to load because they ’ve slowed down the internet so much here .
On top of that they ’ve basically blocked parts of Iran from the international phone network so I ca n’t even call my mother .
80 % of the Iranian people did not enthusiastically turn out in order to re-elect someone who has ruined this country both economically and culturally .
The Iranian people know that this election was rigged .
How could it have been possible for Moussavi to lose Tabriz when he is from Iranian Azerbaijan and Ahmadinejad has abysmal approval ratings amongst Turkic speaking Iranians ? [… ]
Facebook does not work , YouTube does not work , basically all communications are down .
You tell me sir , if they did not rig the elections where are all the people who supported Ahmadinejad ?
Why are n’t they celebrating ?
Why is the mood in Tehran , even southern Tehran so gloomy ?
Why is the government so scared ?
Al Jazeera reports that a speech by Mr. Ahmadinejad earlier today seems to have done little to quell the uproar at his election :
The protests intensified following a televised speech by Ahmadinejad in which he said the vote had been “ completely free ” and the outcome was “ a great victory ” for Iran . ”
“ Today , the people of Iran have inspired other nations and disappointed their ill - wishers , ” he said .
“ This is a great victory at a time when the … propaganda facilities outside Iran and sometimes inside Iran were totally mobilized against our people . ”
Ahmadinejad praised the country ’s youth , but made no direct mention of the protests .
The National , an Abu Dhabi newspaper , reports that a statement on Mr. Moussavi ’s
Web site said that he wrote to senior clerics asking them to intervene , arguing that not doing so could harm the regime :
“ With all ways to secure their rights blocked , the innocent people are confronted with the silence of the clerics and this will bring more damage than a change in votes , ” he said in a statement on his website .
My colleagues in Tehran , Robert Worth and Nazila Fathi , report that those hopes seem to be have been dashed :
Ayatollah Khamenei closed the door to any appeals for intervention in a statement issued on state television on Saturday afternoon , congratulating Mr. Ahmadinejad on his victory and urging the other candidates to throw in the towel .
“ Our respected president is the president of all the people , including those who were his rivals yesterday , and they should all help and support him , ” he said .
Al Jazerra also reports that “ with each updated count , Ahmadinjad ’s lead did not waver from a very stable range of 66 - 69 per cent , irrespective of which districts were reporting . ”
A reader writes that people are still on the streets in Iran :
We lost our hopes today .
The fraud election 2009 has made ppl disappointed and hopeless that any change could happen under the current regime .
Ppl are on the streets chanting “ death to the petite dictator ” and riot police is firing gun shots and beating them up with batons , but how long could this go on ?
— Yoones
My colleagues in Tehran , Robert Worth and Nazila Fathi , note that Mr. Moussavi is not the only candidate to dispute the results :
“ The results of the 10th presidential election are so ridiculous and so unbelievable that one cannot write or talk about it in a statement , ” said Mehdi Karroubi , a reformist cleric and candidate .
He came in last with 300,000 votes — much fewer than analysts had predicted .
“ It is amazing that the people ’s vote has turned into an instrument for the government to stabilize itself . ”
Reports posted on the Web site of the Tehran Times , an English - language newspaper , seem to support the mathematical analysis of the results we mentioned earlier — it looks like Mr. Ahmadinejad , maintained a roughly two to one lead over Mr. Moussavi throughout the vote counting .
Several readers have pointed to this mathematical analysis charting the share of the vote for Mr. Ahmadinejad and Mr. Moussavi as it was reportedly announced by the interior ministry .
It is not clear who made this chart , or if it is accurate , but it is informing the debate online at the moment .
We are trying to find out more about it and will let you know what we discover .
Tehran Bureau attributes the analysis to an Iranian Web site , JameJamonline.ir .
Muhammas Sahmi argues on the Tehran Bureau
Web site that it is fishy :
The best evidence for the validity of the arguments of the three opponents of the President for rejecting the results declared by the Interior Ministry is the data the Ministry itself has issued .
In the chart below , compiled based on the data released by the Ministry and announced by Iran ’s national television , a perfect linear relation between the votes received by the President and Mir Hossein Mousavi has been maintained , and the President ’s vote is always half of the President’s .
One of our readers comments :
If one reads the specifics of the vote results ( i.e. Ahmadinejad supposedly won in Tehran and Tabriz ) , how the count progressed and combine it with what people on the ground are saying , there is no way you would believe that this election was fair and square .
There was blatant fraud .
They did n’t even try to hide the fact that they were rigging the election .
They did n’t even try to make the numbers look believable .

The updates from Iran on the Tehran Bureau Web site can also be followed on this Facebook wall , which now includes video of protests in Shiraz as well as Tehran .
Under the headline “ Congratulation Messages Pour In , ” Iran ’s state news agency reports , with an apparent lack of irony , that Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s victory has been hailed abroad — by the leaders of three groups of Islamic fundamentalists and the government of Syria :
Tehran , June 13 , IRNA – Following President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s landslide victory in the 10th Presidential Elections , Syrian , Egyptian and Palestinian leaders cabled messages of congratulation on Saturday on his re-election .
Syrian President Bashar al - Assad , Leader of Egyptian Ikhwan al - Muslimin Mohammad - Mehdi Akef , Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) , and Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement in separate messages congratulated President Ahmadinejad on his victory .
They wished him success and prosperity .
That Iran ’s President is basking in the glow of support from the Muslim Brotherhood , Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad suggests that we may be waiting a long time for the “ new greeting to the world ” Mr. Moussavi promised on his campaign posters .
Lindsey Hilsum of Britain ’s Channel 4
News filed this video report from Tehran , in which she said “ I feel like I went to sleep in one country and woke up in another , ” as the peaceful rallies staged by opposition supporters in the last week gave way to violent suppression of dissent on Saturday .
Her report includes footage of Mr. Moussavi ’s defiant press conference on Friday night , and the text of his statement on Saturday , in which he said : “ The result of what I see from such a performance by dishonest people is shaking the pillars of the Islamic Republic and the rule of deception and dictatorship . ”
Here is the full report from Iran ’s IRNA news agency of what the country ’s ruler had to say about the election :
Tehran , June 13 , IRNA — Supreme Leader of Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said Saturday that the voter turnout of over 80 percent and the 24 million votes cast in favor of the president calls for real celebration .
In an important message , issued after the 10th Presidential Elections on June 12 , Ayatollah Khamenei said that the enemies are creating provocations out of ill - wish in order not to let the Iranian nation be joyful and happy about the election results .
The Supreme Leader thanked the public for their heroic and powerful turnout in the elections and congratulated them on the big victory .
“ I congratulate … the people on this massive success and urge everyone to be grateful for this divine blessing , ” declared the Ayatollah .
Ayatollah Khamenei said that the Iranian people at large , especially dear youth , and supporters of the elected candidate and of other candidates should be fully alert and avoid any provocative and suspicious actions and speech .
If you have n’t already seen it on the home page of NYTimes.com , you should have a look at this slide show of the protests , and celebrations , in Tehran on Saturday :
A reader using the Web alias “ Iranian Voter ” reminds us that the repeated warnings from Iran ’s intelligence service that opposition movements in favor of reform in Iran are nothing more than foreign government plots are believed by some Iranians :
Color revolutions were masterminded by the West to turn former Soviet states into western satellite states , thus encircling Russia with hostile pro-Western states .
Iran is of course the missing gap , the vulnerable underbelly of Russia .
Yet , is that all you westerners conceive of us , your stooges ?
You have not learned the historical lessons then .
A few days before the election the Moussavi camp turned green , made human chain , simulated 1978 street clashes , their puppet masters at CIA headquarters & MI6 in rapture .
Soft green - colored coup turned to be a putsch and a grief to its organizers .
For a longer discussion of this theory , see an earlier post on The Lede , which includes a link to a remarkable public service announcement from Iranian television warning that opponents of the regime are all murderous stooges of the American government .
A colleague at The Times asks if any readers in Iran might be able to explain how it is that Mr. Moussavi ’s campaign came to use the color green as its symbol .
The British - Iranian blogger at Going Green offered this explanation earlier this week :
Mousavi is a Sayed , meaning via his male lineage , he ’s related to the prophet Mohammad .
To symbolise this , Sayeds use a certain shade of green , also shown in the national flag .
Establishing this within his identity was great strategy , but also total luck , for each candidate was assigned a colour by which the state broadcasting group selected at random .
The Tehran Bureau ’s live blog on events in Iran ’s capital has several clips of videos uploaded to YouTube on Saturday , showing some of the protests by opposition supporters — including these clashes with riot police in Vanak Square this afternoon :
Reuters reports that one of its reporters was injured in these clashes :
A Reuters reporter said she and others were beaten by police with batons as police chased and arrested demonstrators staging a sit-in at Tehran ’s Vanak Square , one of the capital ’s busiest intersections .
At least three people were injured in the clash , which broke out after the Interior Ministry announced the hardline incumbent ’s resounding victory in Friday ’s vote .
Reuters adds :
Up to 2,000 of his supporters staged a sit -in protest in the middle of the road , clapping hands and chanting : “ Moussavi take back our vote !
What happened to our vote ? ”
They also chanted at security forces : “ Police , brother , you ’re one of us . ”
Tehran Bureau also has a remarkable live blog with updates from inside Iran .
The report includes a lot of video of protests on Saturday in Tehran and these interesting observations :
After election results were announced , the election committee must wait for three days to accept any grievances for any irregularity before certify the results .
The results of election needs to be certified by the Council of Experts before it goes to the Leader for final approval Today neither of these two rules were followed and the Leader in his speech approved the results of the election and asked all parties involved to work with Ahmadinejad .
BTW , according to the news only 173000 Iranians voted outside of Iran and Mousavi got most of the votes ( around 83000 votes ) .
On the Web site Tehran Bureau , which is based outside Iran , but relies on bilingual journalists to help make sense of what is happening inside the country , Mea Cyrus argues on Saturday that “ What happened at the polls today was sadly predictable .
One strong indication right from the start was that the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made his decision to put all his power behind President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . ”
Ms. Cyrus points out that the fact that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad felt comfortable attacking a former President , and senior cleric , was a sign that he had the support of the unelected Ayatollah Khamenei , who really runs Iran ’s government :
Ahmadinejad continued his highly controversial verbal attacks on former president Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , even though some claim Khamenei blasted him in public after a particularly heated televised debate between him and former prime minister Mir Hossein Mousavi .
While some believed the supreme leader has called on all the candidates to tone down the attacks on one another — for instance , he was crystal clear when he chided Mousavi for saying Iran ’s image has been tarnished in the world by Ahmadinejad — Mr. Khamenei did not use his authority to show he meant business .
One of the supreme leader ’s favorite channels of communication with other politicians , apart from his sharp speeches , is Kayhan newspaper .
It is widely known in Iran that Hossein Shariatmadari , Khamenei ’s representative at Kayhan Press Institute , has not only the Ayatollah ’s ears , but also serves as his mouthpiece .
When Kayhan , in its first edition after the debate , criticized only Mousavi for his comments during the debate , and afforded Ahmadinejad the right to defend himself , it was a clear signal that the controversial attacks would continue .
Here are more perspectives from the streets of Tehran , in an article written by Bill Keller , the executive editor of The New York Times , just published on our Web site :
Iranians who hoped for a bit more freedom , a better managed economy and a less reviled image in the world wavered between protest and despair on Saturday .
On the streets around Fatemi Square , near the headquarters of the leading opposition candidate , Mir Hussein Moussavi , riot police officers dressed in Robocop gear roared down the sidewalks on motorcycles to disperse and intimidate the clots of pedestrians who gathered to share rumors and dismay .
“ Another four years of dictatorship , ” a voter muttered , and “ this is a coup d’état . ”
Several others agreed .
Some women wept openly .
Some talked of “ mutiny . ”
Others were more cynical .
“ It was just a movie , ” said Hussein Gharibi , a 54 - year - old juice vendor , scoffing at those who got their hopes up .
“ They were all just players in a movie . ”
Voters were obliged to chose a candidate and fill in a code .
Though Mr. Moussavi was Candidate No. 4 , the code No. 44 signified Mr. Ahmadinejad .
One man who worked in the Ministry of Interior , which carried out the vote count , said the government had been preparing its fraud for weeks , purging anyone of doubtful loyalty and importing pliable staff members from around the country .
“ They did n’t rig the vote , ” claimed this man , who showed his ministry identification card but pleaded not to be named .
“ They did n’t even look at the vote .
They just wrote the name and put the number in front of it . ”
Mr. Keller also reports that there is discussion in Iran ’s capital today of how the vote may have been rigged , including the suggestion that “ the ballots seemed designed to lead opposition voters astray . ”
Mr. Keller also reports that the authorities seem to have prevented Mr. Moussavi from even appearing on Saturday to rally the opposition :
Mr. Moussavi , who disappeared from view amid rumors that he was under house arrest or worse , sent word that there would be no turning back , but he did not say how he or his followers should challenge the outcome .
The text - messaging that is the nervous system of the opposition was shut down , along with universities , Web sites and newspapers the government regarded as hostile .
Mr. Moussavi was not allowed a platform on Saturday , and barely managed to get out a communiqué calling the election “ a magic show . ”
Another reader in Iran shares her frustration :
None of the people I know have voted for Ahmadinejad .
He wildly cheated and Khamenei , the leader of Iran , supports this scenario fully .
They just wanted to show us that no matter what we do and what we think , they will do whatever they want to do .
They just want people to know that their votes just do n’t count . … I just feel terrible .
I saw police force attack people brutally .
I ’m going to streets and I do n’t know if I ’m gonna come back home safely but I just ca n’t bear this anymore .
— Anahita
A reader writes to scold us for even considering the possibility that the election results are genuine — though , to be clear , we are not saying that Mr. Ahmadinejad did win fairly , or that the interior ministry he controls did count the votes accurately .
We are just pointing to one possible explanation offered by some observers , that media reports of the opposition ’s strength could have been wrong .
Here is the counter - argument , that what we are seeing unfold in Iran today is more like the crushing of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 than like the New Hampshire primary in 2008 :
No one with the slightest trace of active brain in his head would believe the outcome of the elections .
The pseudo - realism of Western media is quite a shame , as they try to still balance whether or not the elections were rigged .
Every independent poll suggested a landslide victory for Mousavi the day before the elections .
It is also not true that Mousavi had his support base only in Tehran .
Commentators from small and large cities and also many rural areas indicated overwhelming support for Mousavi .
Even the claim that the Iranian poor supports Ahmadinejad is a lie .
Four years of his government has made the life only more difficult for the poor .
We should n’t forget that the continuing labor strikes in Haft Tappe , Assalouye and the sugar factories , just to mention a few .
Far from the wishful thinking of the Iranian elite , it is absolutely evident that the votes were rigged and what is happening now is nothing less than a coup .

More video of the protests by supporters of the opposition in Tehran on Saturday , in a report on the Web site of Radio Liberty , which is financed by the U.S. government .
The BBC has posted some dramatic footage of clashes today on the streets of Tehran between opposition supporters and riot police .
As the BBC notes , scenes of the police beating demonstrators are disturbing .
A live blog set up by the National Iranian American Council has posted these translations of recent comments from the Farsi- language Twitter feed of Gholamhossein Karbaschi , the campaign manger for Mehdi Karroubi , the other reformist candidate who took part in the elections .
As Nazila Fathia noted in The Times in March , Mr. Karbaschi “ was instrumental in Mohammad Khatami ’s victory in 1997 . ”
Here are some of his recent tweets :
“ Karoubi ’s camp believes that if there is no resistance this time , people ’s help can never be expected again . ”
“ Making any decision is very difficult and we are in a very difficult situation , any protest must very carefully calculated . ”
“ Karbaschi asks people to follow the news through satellite , facebook and internet and ignore rumors . ”
“ Karoubi will never be silent .
He is present in the scene and never left it .
Solutions are being considered . ”
A video report from The Associated Press includes amateur footage of some of Mir Hussein Moussavi ’s supporters on the streets of Tehran today :
A reader reminds us that support for Iran ’s incumbent President exists even among Iranians living in the United States :
I can confidently say a vast majority of Iranians in Boston favored and most probably voted for Doctor Ahmadinejad .
All my friends overseas as well as inside Iran favored the President .
… — Faramarz Fathi
Another reader , in Iran , echoes that sentiment and mentions that soliciting opinion in English from Iranians could well skew our perspective :
I did n’t vote for Ahmadinejad , but I think that Ahmadinejad does have many supporters .
But his supporters are mainly conservative people who do n’t know English and are not Web users .
Please do n’t assume that the Iranian Web users are representative of all the voters .
The same false assumption is made by many upper - class Iranians who only see their friends and relatives in northern Tehran and foreign countries and assume that all people are against Ahmadinejad .
Ahmadinejad did very well in the debates .
He also publicly criticized some very influential officials which boosted his popularity , even among people who had n’t voted before .
Btw , my impression is that Ahmadinejad ’s supporters are more shy than than Mousavi ’s supporters .
Mousavi ’s are very loud and held massive rallies in Tehran and big cities ( many people were annoyed by such lavish gatherings ) .
Ahmadinejad often fear being ridiculed by others and do n’t express themselves much .
This has contributed to the delusion that everybody is pro-Mousavi . — Mohammad
Did n’t we have a similar discussion in the United States after the Democratic party ’s New Hampshire primary last year , when all reports focused on the large rallies of enthusiastic Obama supporters in town centers before the vote ?
Writing on The Guardian ’s Web site Abbas Barzegar , a graduate student in religious studies at Emory University , says that the election result only proves that residents of the wealthier parts of Tehran and the Western media engaged in “ wishful thinking ” in the days leading up to the vote .
Mr. Barzegar writes :
I have been in Iran for exactly one week covering the 2009 Iranian election carnival .
Since I arrived , few here doubted that the incumbent firebrand President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad would win .
My airport cab driver reminded me that the president had visited every province twice in the last four years – “ Iran is n’t Tehran , ” he said .
Even when I asked Mousavi supporters if their man could really carry more than capital , their responses were filled with an Obamasque provisional optimism – “ Yes we can ” , “ I hope so ” , “ If you vote . ”
So the question occupying the international media , “ How did Mousavi lose ? ” seems to be less a problem of the Iranian election commission and more a matter of bad perception rooted in the stubborn refusal to understand the role of religion in Iran .
Of course , the rather real possibility of voter fraud exists and one must wait in the coming weeks to see how these allegations unfold .
But one should recall that in three decades of presidential elections , the accusations of rigging have rarely been levied against the vote count .
Elections here are typically controlled by banning candidates from the start or closing opposition newspapers in advance . [… ]
As far as international media coverage is concerned , it seems that wishful thinking got the better of credible reporting .
It is true that Mousavi supporters jammed Tehran traffic for hours every night over the last week , though it was rarely mentioned that they did so only in the northern well - to - do neighborhoods of the capital .
Women did relax their head covers and young men did dance in the street .
On Monday night at least 100,000 of the former prime minister ’s supporters set up a human chain across Tehran .
But , hours before I had attended a mass rally for the incumbent president that got little to no coverage in the western press because , on account of the crowds , he never made it inside the hall to give his speech .
Minimal estimates from that gathering have been placed at 600,000 ( enthusiasts say a million ) .
From the roof I watched as the veiled women and bearded men of all ages poured like lava .
According to this theory , all that happened is that observers , and reformists , misinterpreted the massive rallies for Mr. Moussavi this week and failed to understand that his support was not as broad as it seemed from Tehran .
What observers like Mr. Barzegar are saying is that just as reporters from other countries trying to gauge the popular mood in the United States would be wrong to base their reports on what people on Manhattan ’s Upper West Side told them , reporters visiting Tehran this week failed to understand that support for Mr. Moussavi was perhaps not as broad as it seemed from the leafier parts of the capital .
That said , there are some obvious anomalies .
As The Guardian ’s Ian Black reported on Saturday : “ in Mousavi ’s hometown province of Tabriz in north - west Iran , the ministry claimed Ahmadinejad received more than 60 % of the vote . ”
Mr. Black adds that the authorities worked hard to suppress reports that Mr. Moussavi ’s campaign disputed the official results :
Early editions of Mousavi ’s paper Kalemeh Sabz , or the Green Word , and other reformist dailies declared Mousavi the victor but were ordered to change their headlines , local journalists said .
The papers had blank spots where articles were removed .
Another of our Iranian readers endorses the theory aired elsewhere today — that the official vote totals are correct , but have simply been reversed to give Mr. Ahmadinejad rather than Mr. Moussavi a landslide victory :
There are nothing special to say , to talk about , to think about … .
They stole the vote results and reversed the final result .
Mir Hossein is in our hearts .
— Hasan from Iran
One of our Iranian readers writes to tell us that the election has convinced him that it is better not to vote in Iran ’s elections :
After four years the silent non-voters became convinced that if they vote this time round the difference between reformist votes with conservative ones would be so great that the regime would not dare to cheat .
Alas , they were wrong ( including myself who voted for the first time in the last 30 years ) .
This regime has decided to continue ruling without any change .
In Iran , despite what I read in some comments , there is not democracy .
There is only HOPE for democracy and this HOPE brought people to cast balots .
The political structure is so that all such hopes are only illusions .
The regime use democratic tools ( elections ) as a means to show off its legitimacy .
It does not believe at all to democracy .
It says democracy is a Western and not Islamic value and in fact it fight all western values .
In this respect I am sure that this time millions of people will join those who believed that voting only further strengthen the regime and will not vote any more as long as this regime is in power .

Reuters reports that the man who is the ultimate authority in Iran ’s theocratic system of government , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei “ told all Iranians to respect Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s victory in a presidential election that his closest challenger described as a ‘ dangerous charade . ' ”
Reuters adds that there has been some violence in Tehran but on a relatively small scale :
Trouble erupted on the streets when Ahmadinejad partisans clashed with about 2,000 supporters of moderate former prime minister Mirhossein Mousavi who had been staging a protest against the result of Friday ’s vote , a Reuters witness said .
The scale of Ahmadinejad ’s triumph upset widespread expectations that the race would at least go to a second round , and his victory is unlikely to help unblock a standoff with the West over Iran ’s nuclear programme .
Khamenei , Iran ’s top authority , told defeated candidates and their supporters to avoid “ provocative behaviour ” as police with batons moved in to disperse stone - throwing Mousavi supporters , from Vanak Square in the capital .
Some protesters were arrested and two men were carried away from the scene .
“ The chosen and respected president is the president of all the Iranian nation and everyone , including yesterday ’s competitors , must unanimously support and help him , ” Khamenei said in a statement read on state television .
Earlier on Saturday , one of our readers in Iran sent us this comment warning that there could be trouble :
I am a student living in Tehran .
My Family lives in Shiraz .
At the present time that I ’m witting to you people has gathered in front of Ministry of Interior Affairs to protest against the results which are announced early this morning .
Mousavi just announced a statement declaring that people do NOT obey the fraudulent government and these people are not afraid to burn these pietist ’s house .

Iran ’s state - supported satellite channel , Press TV , reports on Saturday that Iran ’s interior minister , Sadeq Mahsouli , has rejected claims that the election officials in his ministry failed to spot , or took part in , voter fraud , as the opposition has claimed .
According to Press TV ’s report :
Iranian Interior Minister Sadeq Mahsouli has declared that the 10th presidential elections were conducted in a manner that ruled out the possibility of voter fraud .
In a press conference at the Interior Ministry on Saturday , Mahsouli put the number of the total votes cast in the elections at 39,165,191 , suggesting the heavy turnout to be a victory for the nation and not for a specific candidate .
The figures bring to around 85 percent the total participation in the elections .
The total number of people eligible to vote had been estimated to be over 46 million .
While officially pronouncing Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as the winner of the presidential elections with a whopping 24,527,516 votes , Mahsouli dismissed claims that the elections were rigged .
“ No violations that may have influenced the vote have been reported , and we have received no written complaint , ” he said in response to a question posed by an Italian reporter .
At the moment , there are two comments , posted anonymously , beneath this report on the Press TV Web site .
They read :

Mr Mousavi should with dignity accept that he lost the election .
The way he campaigned with his loud supporters , he actually encouraged and motivated millions of ordinary Iranians go to vote , just to make sure all the hard work of the last 30 years to keep the WEST out of Iran politics is not wasted and the elected president represents them .
Lets us move together supporting the president to sort out the economic , social , legal and other problems in IRAN .
God Bless IRAN .
Another thread on the Press TV site , of comments on an article declaring that Mr. Ahmadinejad had won a “ Landside ” [ sic ] victory , showed the tensions between supporters of the two main candidates , visible on the streets of Tehran earlier this week , continuing online today :

Mozilla 's Firefox
Web browser has made impressive market share gains in Europe over the past few years .
In the latest marketshare report released by StatCounter , Firefox 3 has finally surpassed Internet Explorer 7 as the most popular browser in Europe in a breakdown by version number .
Firefox 3 holds 35 percent and IE 7 has 34 percent in that region .
The recent decline of IE 7 in the past week can largely be attributed to the release of IE 8 , Microsoft 's new browser .
According to StatCounter , IE 8 has grown to 2.3 percent in Europe , with most of those users upgrading from IE 7 .
This change was enough to put Firefox 3 on top .
IE 6 , however , still has 11 percent marketshare , which means that all users of Microsoft 's browser across all versions still outnumber the total number of Firefox users .
" The move is partly explained by a small switch from IE 7.0 usage to IE 8.0 but also by growing market share overall by Firefox 3.0 , " said StatCounter CEO Aodhan Cullen in a statement .
" The data shows that Firefox is closing the gap and is now just 10 percent behind all IE versions in Europe . "
When all versions are considered , IE has higher market share than Firefox
StatCounter 's total scores for Europe put IE marketshare at 48 percent and Firefox at 38 percent .
Opera is listed as the next most popular browser in the region with 7 percent .
Safari and Chrome both rank lower than 3 percent , according to StatCounter .
StatCounter 's total worldwide numbers show IE at 62 percent and Firefox at 29 percent .
Worldwide , Opera , Chrome , and Safari all have less than 3 percent .
The numbers for North America are roughly similar to the global scores , but put Safari at 5 percent and Opera at less than 1 percent .
Firefox market share has already exceeded Internet Explorer in several European countries .
For example , Poland has Firefox at 51 percent and IE at 36 percent , followed by Opera at 10 percent .
Opera has a very large presence in several European countries , such as Russia where it ranks higher than IE at 37 percent .
StatCounter also supplies statistics about mobile browser popularity .
Opera and the iPhone browser are tied this week at 22 percent .
The next most popular is Nokia 's browser at 18 percent and then the iPod touch at 15 percent and Android at roughly 2 percent .
The mobile numbers are very different for North America , where the iPhone and iPod touch dominate and Opera barely has any presence at all .
The situation is reversed in Asia , where Opera dominates on mobile devices at 45 percent and the iPhone has only 5 percent .
With the emergence of Mozilla 's Fennec project , it 's likely that Mozilla will make an appearance on these charts within the next few years .
Obviously , the manner in which these market share statistics are collected is not entirely scientific .
According to StatCounter , their numbers are based on aggregate data from their own network of users , which includes 3 million websites and 4 billion page views per month .
The extremely high popularity of Firefox in Europe raises some questions about the validity of the European Commission 's ongoing investigation of Microsoft 's browser bundling tactics .
Microsoft 's browser is clearly not intractably entrenched in Europe , and Mozilla 's success in the region demonstrates that third - party browsers can gain a strong position in the market .

Microsoft 's first attempt revolved around the Windows Live OneCare service that did not succeed in turning many customers away from rivals such as Symantec and McAfee .
Microsoft plans to discontinue Live OneCare once the Morro software is ready .
No specific date has been given for when Morro will be released , but in the past Microsoft has said it would be out by the end of 2009 at the latest .
Microsoft said Morro would tackle viruses , spyware , rootkits and trojans .
Janice Chaffin , Symantec 's president of consumer products , said customers wanted more than just basic protection .
" A full internet security suite is what consumers require today to stay fully protected , " she said .
Security software for home PCs typically cost around £ 30 - 40 and often allow users to install protections on more than one computer .
Other companies , such as AVG and Alwil already produce and distribute free anti-virus products .
Fake help
In its latest update , Microsoft added code that detects and deletes the widespread Internet Antivirus Pro family of fake security software programs .
Such programs , also known as scareware , have been proving more popular with hi-tech criminals in recent months .
The Anti-Phishing Working Group estimated that there were 9,287 bogus anti-malware program in circulation in December 2008 - a rise of 225 % since January 2008 .
The US government has moved to shut down some companies peddling the programs that falsely claim to find malicious software on PCs and then charge for the non-existent threats to be removed .
In addition , the Internet Antivirus Pro software displays fake Windows security messages to try and trick people into thinking the product is legitimate .
The software also contains a password stealer that watches where people go online and grabs login data .

The British National Party has dismissed threats of legal action over its membership policies by the Equality and Human Rights Commission .
The commission said it had written to the party over possible breaches of the law in the BNP 's constitution , membership rules and recruitment .
It asked the BNP to pledge to comply with the Race Relations Act by 20 July or face a potential legal injunction .
But BNP leader Nick Griffin said the party 's rules were " entirely legal " .
Mr Griffin - who was elected as an MEP for the North West on 4 June - said the BNP was an exempted organisation under Section 25 and Section 26 of the Race Relations Act .
He said this meant " ethnic groups who need special protection such as the English in their own country , who are now second class citizens " were " entitled to discriminate on that basis and not on the grounds of colour " .
He added : " We are not discriminating on grounds of colour . "
On 4 June , the BNP won their first two MEPs in the European Parliament elections .
' Deliberate omission '
In a statement , the commission said the BNP 's constitution and membership criteria appeared to discriminate on the grounds of race and colour , in breach of the Race Relations Act .
The party 's rules appeared to restrict membership to those within what the BNP regarded as particular " ethnic groups " , the commission added .
It also said the party 's website asked job applicants to supply a membership number , which appeared to be in breach of legislation banning the " refusal or deliberate omission to offer employment on the basis of non-membership of an organisation " .
The statement added : " The commission is therefore concerned that the BNP may have acted , and be acting , illegally . "
John Wadham , the commission 's legal director , insisted it had a duty to take action against possible breaches of anti-discrimination laws .
He said : " The legal advice we have received indicates that the British National Party 's constitution and membership criteria , employment practices and provision of services to constituents and the public may breach discrimination laws which all political parties are legally obliged to uphold . "
The commission said it had received around 50 recent calls from members of the public about the membership policy of the BNP , although it is understood it was already investigating the party .
Teachers
The BNP's Deputy press officer John Walker said the party would not be making a formal response to the commission at this stage as it wanted to " wait until the Equalities Bill has gone through " .
" We are not going to respond to threats like this .
We will look at it , but it is an entirely politically - motivated attack , " he told BBC News .
The Equalities Bill , currently making its way through Parliament , is expected to include a move to outlaw the BNP 's membership policy , which is limited to various groups it defines as " indigenous Caucasian " .
Mr Walker said the BNP would be prepared to change its membership rules " to remain within the law " .
But he added : " I do n't think we should be bullied by outside forces .
They are asking us to change our whole political ideology . "
On Monday , the Department for Children , Schools and Families said it was considering banning teachers in England from joining the BNP .
In its constitution , the BNP says it exists to represent the " collective National , Environmental , Political , Racial , Folkish , Social , Cultural , Religious and Economic interests of the indigenous Anglo - Saxon , Celtic and Norse folk communities of Britain and those we regard as closely related and ethnically assimilated or assimilable aboriginal members of the European race also resident in Britain " .
It says membership of the BNP is " strictly defined within the terms of , and our members also self define themselves within , the legal ambit of a defined ' racial group ' this being ' Indigenous Caucasian ' and defined ' ethnic groups ' emanating from that Race " .

The name 's ridiculous , but " Jaunty Jackalope , " the next release of the popular Linux distribution Ubuntu , is seriously focused on the user experience .
Dig what 's new and improved in the beta of Ubuntu 9.04 , released today .
Advertisement
We 've covered bits and pieces of what 's coming up for Ubuntu 9.04 in the past few months , such as Mac / Growl - like notifications ( that you can grab now , if you want ) , some stylish community themes , and the speedier ext4 filesystem .
Advertisement
One feature I could n't show in the screenshots was the improved boot time in Jaunty .
Having lived in it for about a week and installed a few apps , it took 24.9 seconds from choosing my OS to boot in Grub to a login window , and about 19 seconds more to get to a fully - loaded desktop ( about 43 total ) .
What 's below are screenshots taken from the last alpha version before it .
If Jaunty 's release schedule holds ( and it almost always does ) , a final release is just a month off .
Ubuntu 's beta releases are usually pretty close to the final thing , though , and it 's easy enough to download an ISO file , then live - boot and test it without harm using UNetbootin from Windows or Linux .
Yada yada technical geekery .
Here 's how Ubuntu 9.04 looks and works different from before ; click on a thumbnail for a bigger view and description :
For a thoroughly detailed screenshot tour of the KDE and Xfce - based variants of Ubuntu 9.04 , Kubuntu and Xubuntu , check out Softpedia 's review of Ubuntu 9.04 Alpha 6 .

A Canberra Magistrate has described the actions of a man who tied up his five - year - old stepson with sticky tape as bizarre .
The 41 - year - old man has been charged with neglecting a child .
A statement of facts tendered to the court says he picked his stepson up from school in March because he had been naughty in class .
It is alleged that when they got home , the man hit his stepson on the face with a stick , then put sticky tape around his legs , arms , eyes and mouth , and left the house .
His mother arrived home to find her son bound and on the floor .
It is alleged he had been left alone for more than four hours .
When she confronted her partner , he allegedly told her that he had had important things to do .
The matter was adjourned until tomorrow .

Justin Reed , 22 , a Corporal in the United States Marine Corps , has been arrested at Logan International Airport in Boston , Massachusetts after security personnel found a gun along with bomb - making material inside his checked - in luggage .
United States Marine Corps logo .
According to Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) , Reed had traveled on a flight from Las Vegas , Nevada and was on a layover before he continued on to Charlotte , North Carolina .
The discovery was made after his luggage was mistakenly routed to the baggage claim instead of his plane to N.C .
Inside his checked - in luggage , authorities found a semi-automatic handgun , a loaded magazine with extra ammunition , a hand grenade fuse assembly , bomb - making materials which included military fuses , electronic boxes and switches , and model rocket engines .
The TSA says that passengers are allowed to have a firearm in their checked baggage , so long as it is declared at the gate before checking it in , which Reed failed to do .
Reed was arrested for possession of an infernal machine and possession of a concealed weapon in a secure area of an airport , says the Boston Globe .
He is being held on US $ 50,000 bail and will be in court on Tuesday .
It is not yet known why Reed was in possession of the items and an investigation is ongoing .
Reed is stationed at Camp Lejeune , located in N.C. .

Sleek , streamlined wind turbines have become the icons of the green movement , but for all the
growth in wind power — it accounted for 42 % of all new electricity generation added to the U.S. grid last year — wind still makes up less than 3 % of America 's total electricity generation [ Time ] .
Its marginal role has led many to wonder whether the technology is worth investing in , and whether wind power is capable of supplying enough electricity to meet our needs .
To answer those questions , researchers analyzed wind patterns around the world and found that wind power could theoretically supply the entire world with energy , and then some .
The study , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ,
is n't being presented as a realistic plan to achieve a renewable energy nirvana ; it 's simply an attempt to provide a sense of what 's possible [ Ars Technica ] .
But the researchers ' reckoning of what 's possible is quite impressive :
maxing out deployment of current - generation technology could produce five times the total energy used in the world today , and 40 times the electricity [ Ars Technica ] .
The research group first sectioned the globe into areas of about 1,300 square miles each , and then analyzed NASA data about wind speeds in the
non-urban , non-forested and non-ice covered areas where turbines could realistically be built [ Boston Globe ] .
They assumed the use of 2.5 megawatt turbines on land and larger 3.6 megawatt turbines off shore , and conservatively estimated that the wind would blow hard enough for the turbines to reach their maximum capacity only 20 percent of the time .
Under these constraints they still found that in the United States , scattering turbines across the Great Plains would produce more than 16 times the energy the nation now consumes , and off shore turbines could add considerably to that tally .
While the study is a helpful thought experiment , no one expects the world to adopt wind power on such a large scale .
That ’s because wind still faces a slew of obstacles .
It ’s still more expensive than traditional energy sources .
It is intermittent and is at its lowest often in the U.S. during the summer when we hit peak demand in part from all the air conditioners switching on .
And many of the greatest wind resources are far away from where people live – meaning we need to develop more transmission lines and a smarter grid to be able to tap into the wind at the right time [ Boston Globe ] .
Finally , researchers note that building a massive number of wind turbines could disrupt wind patterns in ways that are impossible to predict .

Before the mid 1950s , there was no " retirement " as we use the term today .
A 1950 poll showed most workers aspired to work for as long as possible .
Quitting was for the disabled .
Life did not offer " twilight years , " two decades of uninterrupted leisure courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer .
Just since 1960 , the percentage of men over 65 still working has dropped by half .
And the average retirement age keeps falling .
It ’s down to 62 , which gives the average man 18 years to be retired in its current meaning .
It is not unusual to see people ending their careers in their mid-fifties .
This is one of the monumental changes in the fabric of society wrought by the government , that has so altered the integrity of the people .
As someone on a payroll until the age of 79 , and now employed on a non-compensated basis , I came to see that I was regarded as something of a freak .
Was I trying to set some sort of record ?
Had I failed to accumulate a large enough estate ?
There seemed to be some feelings too that I was somehow un-American , and a poor reflection on a generation that is supposed to be enjoying the good life .
Observing my generation opt for leisure , I see all sorts of adaptations .
One described his life in Florida as meeting the same three golfers on the first tee at the same time each day for nine holes , then lunch in the club house , nine holes after lunch , shower , gin and tonic , and then back to the condo to dress for dinner .
When asked if this was the routine for every day , he said , " No , I help my wife clean on Tuesday . "
This is what I ’m supposed to aspire to ?
Another friend , in answer , said " I sleep as late as I can because I do n’t know what to do when I get up . "
The remark heard most frequently is " I ’ve been so busy since I retired , I do n’t know how I ever had time for my job " or " Retirement is so wonderful , I should have retired sooner . "
At this point it might be in order to ask  " Busy doing what ? "
Many of those who retire at 55 , 60 , 65 , or 70 are some of the most experienced , knowledgeable , and capable people in the workforce .
Rather than occupying positions that might be available to younger people , they could be creating and expanding job opportunities for others .

As this fatally flawed scheme proceeds toward disaster , the beneficiaries are so insistent that their benefits be maintained and are such a strong political force , that few congressmen have the temerity to say publicly what everyone knows : payments can not be sustained .
Those who are working are paying benefits that will not be available to themselves .
Buddha on his deathbed admonished his followers to , above all , observe strenuousness .
How strange that sounds in today ’s world .
Our culture denies this essential virtue to our seniors , who have become dilettantes .
As we observe able - bodied citizens hiking the malls or sampling the midnight buffets on the cruise ships , we are struck by their purposelessness , and the overwhelming boredom they manifest .
There is no need to arise in the morning , or any necessity to go to bed on time .
Their reason for existence has ceased .
They have lost the respect of those who support them , and lost their self - respect in the process .
A story is told of one who had led a long and eventful life .
When the time came to cross the deep lake , he was pleased with the skiff and the oarsman as well as his welcome and the accommodations furnished him .
The surroundings were beautiful , the weather pleasant , and the food more than adequate .
After a few weeks , he wanted to try his hand at gardening again , but that could not be arranged .
After repeated requests to work in the dining hall or on the grounds , he cried in exasperation , " This is no better than Hell . "
The reply came from above , " Where did you think you were ? "
Irving Babbitt reflected on the nature of work , how it was seen in the past as a God - given calling , and indeed served to define a person .
With the loss of vocation has come a loss of identification .
To remedy this loss does not require legislation or public awareness .
The solution is within the grasp of everyone who has decided to continue to be productive .
It often means a change in occupation .
It may mean giving up benefits and accepting a lower wage , or no wage at all .
But a reason for living , and a retention of identity , are surely sufficient remuneration .

The reason why I said what I said is because the fundamental goal of our endeavors in Iraq and Afghanistan is supposed to be to protect us .
That ’s why we call the Defense Department the Defense Department , because it ’s supposed to defend America .
And whatever the perceived threat may be , whether it ’s al - Qaeda or the Taliban or otherwise , only by the most incredibly convoluted Bushian logic could you possibly get to the point where you conclude that as a result of that threat we should spend $ 100 billion a year and send over 100,000 of our young men and women abroad , 8,000 miles away , and that that is an effective way to accomplish that goal .
It does n’t make any sense .
Life does not consist of a Risk board game , where you try to occupy every space on the planet .
There ’s no other country that does this , there ’s no other country that seeks to occupy foreign countries 8,000 miles from their own border , and believe that that somehow accomplishes anything useful .
It does n’t .
If in fact it ’s important to our national security to keep al - Qaeda or the Taliban under control , there are far more effective ways of accomplishing that goal , if that is in fact the goal , than to extend this kind of money and this kind of blood .
This is something that Democrats said when they were in the opposition repeatedly , and that truth has n’t changed at all just because we elected a president .
You can always find some kind of excuse to do what you want to do anyway , but I have to wonder why a new Democratic president wants to do something like this .
This is a president who has recognized the immorality of torture , and I ’m waiting for him to recognize the immorality of war and foreign occupation .
I think that we have to get out .
I think that we should have left both these countries a long time ago .
In the case of Iraq , the reasons that we were given at the time the war began were all lies , and we all know it , and as a country we should have been willing to learn from that mistake a long time ago .
We have conducted wars without paying for them for the past seven years , and the result of that is that we have come close to destroying our national economy .
At this point I ’m really not terribly concerned about the well - being of the Shiites , the Sunnis , or the Kurds .
What I care about is our surviving these difficult economic times , and when I ’m asked to vote for $ 100 billion to extend occupations that fundamentally served no purpose that could not be accomplished any other way — in lieu of spending for the things that human beings need , at a time when we have schools closing in Orlando , at a time when we are laying off firefighters and police officers -- I have to say , “ No , there ’s a better use for that money . ”
Blue America has helped channel nearly two million dollars into congressional campaigns .
And , of course , the results have been mixed .
We lost some and we won some .
Themeasured the effectiveness of the Inside the Beltway political action committees and did n't include us because , proudly , we 're 100 % Outside the Beltway .
However we helped People For the American Way put together their own endorsement list and we joint fundraised for the candidates .
The primary difference was that they included some a few candidates on their list that they have special relationships with .
None of those candidates won .
And People For the American Way came in # 1 in thesurvey .
If you read that paragraph carefully , you realize that Blue America outperformed -- in terms of picking winning candidates -- every single Inside the Beltway PAC .
But , like I said , our results were mixed .
We lost some important races -- like Darcy Burner 's , John Laesch 's , Charlie Brown 's and Dennis Shulman 's -- as well as helping 26 men and women win House and Senate seats .
A few of the ones we helped have been disappointing and a few even went over to the reactionary Blue Dogs .
Only one , though , Chris Carney ( Blue Dog - PA ) , was a disaster .
Most , on the other hand , have been excellent members of Congress , from Donna Edwards ( D - MD ) , Gary Peters ( D - MI ) , Jared Polis ( D - CO ) and Jeff Merkley ( D - OR ) to Carol Shea - Porter ( D - NH ) , Steve Cohen ( D - TN ) and Ben Cardin ( D - MD ) .
None of our winners , though , have done better than one of our most unlikely successes : Orlando progressive Alan Grayson .
When we first endorsed him , no insiders thought he had even an outside chance to win the primary , let alone beat an entrenched , well - financed Republican incumbent .
But almost immediately we realized that Alan was anything but a run of the mill Democrat .
Tireless , brilliant , idealistic and down to earth , the more we got to know of Alan through the primary and general campaigns , the more we realized he could be a rare leader in Congress who could make an outsized difference .
I remember him telling me one day after a meeting with central Florida labor unions how he had told them that if he were elected he would start the ball rolling towards passing a law to guarantee paid vacations .
That sounded as crazy as ... well , as weekends must have sounded when they were first proposed .
Or Social Security .
Tomorrow Alan is introducing a bill , the first in ( American ) history , that guarantees paid vacations .
( France guarantees a month of paid vacation per year . )
The bill 's provisions , which are expected to meet stiff opposition from Republicans and Blue Dogs poll exceedingly well among average Americans .
Nearly 70 % of Americans support the idea .
This is what Grayson 's legislation would accomplish :
Oddly , it was n't even Grayson 's dedication to the betterment and security of working families that first attracted us to him .
It was afeature on his astounding work bringing war profiteers to justice .
And this weekis back with another powerful piece of the Alan Grayson story : Freshman Democrat Alan Grayson Attacks Obama 's War Policy wanted to follow up on Grayson 's statement to thelast week that he would -- as he did -- vote against Obama 's request for funding to make war in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Only 59 other members of Congress joined him .
wanted him to elaborate .
He was happy to : But it has been Grayson 's harsh interrogation methods ( at the Financial Services Committee ) directed at crooked banksters , clueless bureaucrats , and other stalwarts of the notion that the public purse is there for the plucking , that has most enraged the Republicans .
Grayson , ever the champion of working families , treads where few other members of Congress dares go -- right on the toes of Congress ' biggest campaign contributors .
That 's earned him a huge target on his back and the GOP vows to defeat him in 2010 .
Given the demographic shifts in this district and the enthusiasm for their tough new Representative from voters in central Florida , it will be an uphill battle .
If you 'd like to help Alan Grayson keep his seat , our Blue America ActBlue kitty for him is still open .

If you look up the word sanction , the definition that occupies pride of place in most dictionaries is permission or approval for a specific course of action .
But , one of those words that gives English a bad rap , sanction ’s got two other meanings that are the exact opposite .
To wit : a penalty to ensure compliance and coercion to stop a nation from violating international law .
Even then , perhaps because it ’s too close to sanctuary , the worst sanctions seems to bode is a slap on the wrist .
In fact , all too often , that ’s its effect on its intended targets in a state ’s government , while the public suffers instead .
As if to confirm this , while visiting Japan and Indonesia in February , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton admitted that 14 years of U.S. sanctions on Burma have made little impact on its ruling junta .
Not only has there been no improvement in its human rights record , but the Burmese people have made little economic progress .
Meanwhile , companies from South Korea , Thailand , Singapore , China , and India have rushed into the vacuum left by U.S. economic abstention .
First , the United States passed the Free Burma Act in 1995 to impose economic and trade sanctions on Burma for its wretched human - rights record .
Next , in 1997 , Bill Clinton issued a ban on most new investment in Myanmar .
Then , in 2003 , George W. Bush signed the Burma Freedom and Democracy Act , which ended the importation of all Burmese products .
Incorporated in this bill were smart sanctions — like smart bombs , meant to zero in on a target — which barred Burmese government officials from access to their funds in U.S. banks and investment houses , as well as denied them or their families visas .
More targeted sanctions followed in 2006 and , in 2008 , the late California congressman who co-chaired the Congressional Human Rights Caucus , Holocaust survivor Tom Lantos , shepherded into law the JADE Act , which blocked the import of jade and other gems from Burma .
Also , the European Union just extended its sanctions , which mirror those of the United States , for one year .
If none of this has yet proven effective , the question arises :
Do sanctions ever work ?
Sanctions ’ biggest success story thus far has been South Africa , where they were credited with helping to end apartheid .
Also , freezing 25 million dollars of North Korean funds brought Pyongyang back to the nuclear negotiating table , at least for a while .
On the other hand , a series of sanctions on Iran have failed to persuade it to abandon its uranium enrichment program .
Nor have they weakened Fidel Castro ’s grip on power .
Then , of course , there ’s they ’re most appalling failure : Hundreds of thousands of children in Iraq died for lack of access to antibiotics and other drugs due to sanctions .
As for the net effect of sanctions on the Burmese , the case can be made that they ’re not hurting them economically — because the people could n’t have been much worse off than they already were .
In fact , unless the regime surrenders control of oil , gas , gems , and agriculture , the development of a middle class is likely impossible .
In light of that , the head of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Asia , Senator Jim Webb ( D - VA ) , has called for a more “ constructive ” policy on Burma .
To accomplish the twin tasks of improving conditions for the Burmese people and opening up Burma to U.S. corporations , he favors confidence - building measures to expedite the repeal of sanctions .
Others , such as Chevron , one of the few American companies allowed to do business in Burma , call for rescinding the ban on new investments , while retaining the other smart sanctions .
Interviewed for a 2008 Voice of America article , Gary Hufbauer , a sanctions expert , explains this line of thinking : “. . . if you can somehow deprive the elite of their bank accounts , of their schools in Switzerland [ and ] their travel .
. . at least you do n’t penalize ordinary people [ with ] widespread ill - health or malnourishment . ”
Whoever came up with the term “ smart sanctions ” might have thought it was clever .
But he or she forgot that , however designed to minimize civilian casualties , smart bombs gang aft aglay .
Smart sanctions , too , court unintended fallout , such as junta members with suddenly depleted bank accounts rooting around for new and exciting ways to loot the Burmese people .
What about them ?
How do the people feel about sanctions imposed by other nations ?
In 2001 , before smart sanctions were instituted , a survey by Burmese exile publication Irrawaddy found that , concerned with economic development though they were , almost 80 percent of 200 Burmese workers , editors , journalists and lawyers polled favored keeping the sanctions in place .
But in 2007 , the BBC reported :
“ Sanctions do n’t work — they ’re not the solution , ” one elderly man said . …
“ We would like to have democracy , but the most important thing for us is to have peace , and enough food on our plates , ” one woman said .
Then Anand Gopal of the Christian Science Monitor recently told us : “ When I was in Burma last year I asked a lot of people what they thought of the sanctions and they mostly were against it . ”
He also reminds us of an inescapable truth about sanctions in general — that they ’re basically a “ way to punish the Burmese people for having such an awful leadership . ”
Many Burma watchers do n’t expect a change soon .
For example , Vice President Joe Biden , they note , was a key player in the JADE Act ’s passage .
Also , just last week , Agence France Presse reported , an assistant secretary for legislative affairs , Richard Verma , wrote a letter to Rep. Peter King ( R - NY ) asserting that sanctions would remain in place .
But the first definite indicator of the Obama administration ’s intentions towards Burma comes May 15 , when it decides whether to extend Clinton ’s New Investment Ban .
We ’ll allow Irrawaddy the final word on sanctions :
“ The most significant ‘ sanctioner ’ on Burma is none other than the country ’s ruling regime itself , which has created an environment in which genuine transformative economic activity is scarcely possible , let alone similarly efficacious foreign investment or trade . ”

If you want to tell whether someone is conservative or liberal , what are a couple of completely nonpolitical questions that will give a good clue ?
How ’s this :
Would you be willing to slap your father in the face , with his permission , as part of a comedy skit ?
And , second : Does it disgust you to touch the faucet in a public restroom ?
Studies suggest that conservatives are more often distressed by actions that seem disrespectful of authority , such as slapping Dad .
Liberals do n’t worry as long as Dad has given permission .
Likewise , conservatives are more likely than liberals to sense contamination or perceive disgust .
People who would be disgusted to find that they had accidentally sipped from an acquaintance ’s drink are more likely to identify as conservatives .

A poll released Monday showed 72 percent of Americans favor an insurance health care plan with a public option .
So why do only 36 senators support it ?
Sure , the Senate is supposed to be a more deliberative body and not be swayed by public opinion to the same extent as the House .
But , if there ’s widespread backing for this concept , and it ’s getting a renewed push from President Obama , why so much resistance in the Senate ?
Is it because senators are standing on good old - fashioned apple pie principles ?
Maybe not .
Here ’s an analysis that suggests insurance company PAC money is having the greatest impact on middle - of - the road Democratic senators .
According to the report :
“ Liberal Democrats are likely to hold firm to the public option unless they receive a lot of remuneration from health care PACs .
Conservative Democrats may not support the public option in the first place for ideological reasons , although money can certainly push them more firmly against it .
“ But the impact on mainline Democrats appears to be quite large : if a mainline Democrat has received $ 60,000 from insurance PACs over the past six years , his likelihood of supporting the public option is cut roughly in half from 80 percent to 40 percent . ”
As I ’ve said , there may well be legitimate philosophical reasons to oppose this type of national health care plan , or any other approach , for that matter .
An umbilical cord flowing with ready cash from major insurers is n’t one of them .
To his credit , Obama finally put pressure on health care companies , and opponents of the public option , in a news conference Tuesday .
As he correctly pointed out : “ If private insurers say that the marketplace provides the best quality health care … then why is it that the government , which they say ca n’t run anything , suddenly is going to drive them out of business ?
That ’s not logical . ”
It ’s only logical if you understand that cash is the conduit through which public policy decisions are often made .
Money does n’t talk , Dylan said , it swears .

A conservative faction of the Republican National Committee is urging the GOP to take a harder line against both Democrats and wayward Republicans , drafting a resolution to rename the opposition the “ Democrat Socialist Party ” and moving to rebuke the three Republican senators who supported the stimulus package .
In an e-mail sent Wednesday to the 168 voting members of the committee , RNC member James Bopp , Jr. accused President Obama of wanting “ to restructure American society along socialist ideals . ”

“ The proposed resolution acknowledges that and calls upon the Democrats to be truthful and honest with the American people by renaming themselves the Democrat Socialist Party , ” wrote Bopp , the Republican committeeman from Indiana .
“ Just as President Reagan ’s identification of the Soviet Union as the ‘ evil empire ’ galvanized opposition to communism , we hope that the accurate depiction of the Democrats as a Socialist Party will galvanize opposition to their march to socialism . ”
The resolution , proposed by a committeeman from Washington state , was agreed upon by 16 RNC members from 16 different states and is part of a petition asking RNC Chairman Michael Steele to set a special committee meeting next month when the state chairs meet in Washington , D.C .
An RNC member said that Bopp , one of the most conservative and outspoken individuals on the committee , had pulled together a group of his fellow conservatives to agree to the resolution .
In an interview , Bopp said he thought Steele would set the special meeting .
“ He has always told us that he was supportive of and agreed with the substance of these resolutions , ” said Bopp , a lawyer known for his advocacy against campaign finance reform .
An RNC official said Steele would prefer to see the matter taken up at the committee ’s regular summer meeting in July .
This official declined to elaborate on where the chairman stands on the resolution .
But an April 8 memo from Steele to the RNC indicates that while he shares the view of the hard - liners that Obama is leading the country toward socialism , he ’s not inclined to support making it party policy .
“ The Democrats are indeed marching America toward European - style socialism , and I will continue to criticize their dangerous policies in that regard , ” Steele wrote .
“ But I believe these proposed resolutions will accomplish little than to give the media and our opponents the opportunity to mischaracterize Republicans . ”
The paper resolutions of a minority party have little consequence on actual elections or policies , but the push by Bopp is a reflection of the deep concern many grass - roots Republicans have for the policies of Obama and their unhappiness toward those GOP elected officials they see as capitulating to his agenda .
" There is nothing more important for our party than bringing the truth to bear on the Democrats ' march to socialism , ” said Jeff Kent , the Washington state committeeman who proposed the resolution .
“ Just like Ronald Reagan identifying the U.S.S.R. as the evil empire was the beginning of the end to Soviet domination , we believe the American people will reject socialism when they hear the truth about how the Democrats are bankrupting our country and destroying our freedom and liberties . "
The “ socialist ” label was frequently thrown around during last year ’s campaign , and its usage has become increasingly commonplace among GOP activists .
Rep. Spencer Bachus ( R - Ala . ) even said recently that there were 17 socialists in Congress .
At stake , wrote Bopp in the e-mail , is nothing less than “ the preservation of our Constitutional Republic and our way of life . ”
In addition to the effort to refer to Democrats as " Socialists , " the conservative RNC members are also proposing resolutions urging Republican members of Congress to stop accepting earmarks and praising those in the party who have opposed the bailouts and Obama ’s spending plans .
The latter resolution is something of a compromise , only coming about after a heated conference call earlier this month between the conservatives and some of the more pragmatic members of the committee .
Bopp ’s members wanted a resolution that would have specifically criticized the three centrist Republican senators who supported Obama ’s stimulus plan earlier this year , Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) and Maine Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins .
Specter and another wayward Republican , Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) have already drawn conservative primary opponents — and more challenges from the right may be on the way .
Two GOP sources familiar with the conference call said that Pennsylvania Republican Chairman Robert A. Gleason Jr. made it clear that he was not pleased about fellow committee members trying to meddle in other states ’ politics .
Gleason pointed out , according to one source , that he did n’t have any plans to go into Indiana and tell them how to run their party , and he did n’t expect Republicans to come into Pennsylvania to tell him how to run his .
Bopp confirmed Gleason ’s intervention and the fact that the original resolution , as drafted , singled out individual senators .
While he and his fellow conservatives ultimately deferred , choosing to praise the widespread GOP opposition to Obama ’s spending rather than criticize the Senate trio , Bopp said he still disagrees with Gleason .
“ It ’s a national party , ” Bopp said .
“ And their being the critical votes to pass the stimulus bill could not be more contrary to the Republican platform .
It made a mockery that any of them were fiscal conservatives . ”
The intra-party squabbling and push to paint Democrats as Socialists comes as Steele has begun to tamp down criticism about his early performance .
The party posted solid fundraising numbers for the first quarter , and Steele has largely avoided the foot - in - mouth gaffes that plagued his first weeks at the helm .
To make the “ Socialist ” designation something approximating official party policy is plainly not the direction preferred by Steele or other top Republican officials — and it ’s spurring grumbling toward Bopp ’s band of conservatives .
“ This was engineered by a bunch of people who ought to be involved in College Republicans , not the RNC , ” complained a well - connected Republican sympathetic to Steele .
“ It ’s not that they ’re not well - intentioned , but it ’s just juvenile . ”
Bopp , in response , said : “ What they are doing is socialism .
Why should we not describe it that way ? ”
As for Democrats , they did n’t exactly embrace the label , either .
" I 'm going to pass on marketing advice from folks who had n't fully thought out the implications of using tea bags as a brand , " said Democratic National Committee spokesman Hari Sevugan .
" But what 's clear is that when you 're devoid of leadership , devoid of ideas and your only answer is to say ' no ' to change , it 's not surprising that angry , fringe elements take center stage at the Republican Party . "
A Phoenix liquor store clerk shot a would - be robber Saturday afternoon , after the robber pulled a knife on the clerk , police said .
Phoenix police gave this account :
About 12:30 p.m. two men went to a liquor store , near 23rd and Northern avenues after having been there two hours before .
During the second trip to the store , one of the men stayed outside .
The other asked the clerk for a piece of paper .
As the clerk was waiting on other customers , the 29 - year - old suspect wrote something on the paper .
After the other customers left , the suspect handed a robbery note to the clerk .
The clerk acted as though he could n't read .
That 's when the suspect came towards the clerk and opened a gate , which separates the clerk from the customers , and pulled out a knife .
Seeing this , the clerk grabbed a gun and shot the suspect .
The suspect ran out of the store and across the street to a friend 's apartment .
He knocked on the door and collapsed .
The friend called 911 .
Police arrived and the suspect was taken to a local hospital where he remains in critical condition .

Every human endeavor has a bittersweet taste .
“ A cup of honey no one has yet drunk , without mixing it with a cup of gall ” , said a Montenegrin nineteenth century bishop , warrior and poet in one of his epics on the struggle of his people against the mighty Ottoman Empire ( admittedly , the original reads much better , but then I am a physicist , not a linguist ) .
So it is with science .
Last week ’s issue of Nature contains a beautiful paper by David Wineland ’s group at NIST in Boulder Colorado , who managed to create the first form of a mechanical entanglement between vibrating pairs of ions .
But the same issue of Nature , in another article , reports on the announcement of IARPA ( Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency , according to Wired “ It ’s like DARPA for Spies ” ) to cut funding for Wineland ’s experiments .
Wineland is among a number of other illustrious US scientists , such as William Phillips , the Nobel Prize Winner for laser cooling , who suffered the same fate .
The said paper by Wineland ’s group is significant in that it shows entanglement between mechanical vibrational degrees of freedom of two ion pairs .
Vibrational entanglement has , of course , been analyzed theoretically many times , but it has never been achieved experimentally before in such a clear and conclusive manner .
Wineland ’s is a very involved and sophisticated experiment , where entanglement is first created between energies of two pairs of ions ( which itself is an achievement , though done a number of times before ) .
This is then transferred onto the vibrations , so that ion pairs oscillate in unison , but their degree of correlated motion is higher than anything that can be done by classical oscillators ( such as two pendulums ) .
All manipulations are achieved by shining laser pulses of appropriate frequency .
Once vibrational entanglement is achieved , its presence is confirmed by the reverse actions .
Suitable laser pulses transfer entanglement to the energy degrees of freedom and this is then measured .
Experiments of this type and level of sophistication take decades to achieve .
During this time , it is very important to have a sustained level of funding not only for equipment , but also for staff ( typically between 5 and 10 physicists are continuously needed to realize something like this ) .
A typical grant lasts for 3 to 5 years and this means constantly fighting for renewals and extensions in order to achieve a goal that might take 20 years or so ( like ion- trapping Bose condensation etc ) .
The decision of US government to cut funding for Wineland is doubly ironic .
Firstly because of its bad timing : the cut is announced in the same week as his latest groundbreaking experiment is published in Nature .
Secondly –and this is the irony — that very experiment might provide a way of doing something that is crucial to military intelligence .
Military activity is all about tracking the movement of the enemy .
This can be accomplished in many different ways , but one of them is detecting a very low vibrational level of noise caused by the movement of nearby objects .
Vibrations are , of course , all around us , but the trick is to detect the meaningful ones ( the so called “ signal ” ) from the background ones ( known as the “ noise ” ) .
Classical physics has a limit , called the shot - noise limit , but this limit can be overcome and much improved by quantum mechanics .
Such techniques form a basis of the subject called quantum metrology ; Wineland is one of the world ’s leaders in this particular activity .
Therefore , Wineland ’s experiments may pave a way to efficient detection of very weak vibrations using quantum entanglement .
Regarding the funding cuts , the point is that academics these days ( in the US possibly more than anywhere else ) have to live in the real world and compete for its limited resources .
Grant application writing forms a significant part of a ( senior ) scientist ’s time .
Here in UK , for instance , the success rate for governmental funding is almost as small as 10 percent .
This means having to write on average 10 proposals ( each requiring a substantial investment of time and effort ) in order to be granted funding for just one of them .
The US conforms to similar statistics .
Having a year or two of a gap in one ’s grant income could be enough to terminate experimental activity for good ( and I definitely know of cases where this has happened ) .
Academics are therefore continuously faced with very uncertain futures that are more typical for business and industry .
The decision of US military to cut funding is probably not a big surprise for my colleagues in America — they are used to it ( by now , so are we in UK ) .
However , it is always a big question if the short term thinking that pervades business and industry ( for a good reason ) is really appropriate when it comes to achieving academic excellence ( which is almost always based on long term projects and far reaching ideas that take decades to mature and painstaking research to realize ) .
But enough of the politics behind science .
Let ’s be forward - looking and finish on a positive note .
An important future experiment would be to increase the mass of the entangled oscillators ( as entanglement is meant to decrease with mass and there could indeed be some critical size of the system beyond which entanglement is impossible ) .
This I think can be achieved fairly straightforwardly by Wineland ’s group .
The other is to have more than two entangled oscillators .
This could be a much harder experiment to execute ( as decoherence could prevent the creation of entanglement ) , but it ’s very important since it is ultimately linked with two very fundamental and related issues : the universality of quantum physics and the possibility of large scale quantum computation .
I believe that the confirmation of the second type of entanglement is also just a matter of time , especially given the rate of progress of groups such as Wineland ’s .
The exciting thing , of course , is that ( despite my optimism ) there is always a chance of failure , which is then usually followed by a discovery of another important physical principle hitherto unknown to us .
Either way , it is crucial to push the limits of science forward .
My firm belief is that Wineland will overcome the setbacks caused by the recent funding cuts and get there in the end .
And who knows , maybe the military will realize the error of their ways and reverse the decision to cut .
Lately I ’ve been exploring ways to improve the performance of some areas of code where embedded python calls are made from C ++.
A common and obvious ( and often effective ) approach for increasing performance in these areas is to forgo python and rewrite performance - critical areas in C / C ++.
However , I got curious about other , less invasive ideas , and that led me to thinking about how python methods can be accessed from C ++.
A reasonable way to call a python function from C++ might look like this ( using boost .
python ) :
// import the module object obj = import ( " my_module " ) .
attr ( " MyClass " ) ( ) ; // call the function obj.attr ( " some_method " ) ( ) ;
This works just fine .
But what if you need to call some_method repeatedly , say , 100000 times ?
In many embedded python scenarios , maybe most , you can identify some collection of python methods that are called many times from C ++.
This raises the question of whether you can lower the cost of these calls .
One approach to lowering the cost - per - call that I experimented with provided some useful results .
In the code above , you ’ll notice that each call to some_method requires a call to obj.attr ( ) just to access the method object .
What if we “ cached ” that method object and called it directly rather that refetching it ?
For example :
// import the module object obj = import ( " my_module " ) .
attr ( " MyClass " ) ( ) ; // cache the method object object method = obj.attr ( " some_method " ) ; // call the method object a bunch of times for ( int i = 0 ; i < 1000000 ; ++i ) method ( ) ;
This not very invasive or onerous , requiring no change to the python code and very little change to the C++ code .
The question is , what does it buy you in terms of performance ?
To try and measure this , I wrote a C++ program that makes repeated calls to a python method using first the “ standard ” access method ( going to through attribute lookup for each call ) and then the “ interned ” access method ( caching the method object ) .
In the basic experiment , the python method simple called pass and did no real work , so the measured time for the calls is purely the call overhead .
This graph shows the results :
As you can see , it takes about twice as long to call a function using attribute access as it does to make the interned call .
Of course , the “ slow ” method access takes something like 0.001 milliseconds per call , but nevertheless , double the performance is nothing to sneeze at .
The next obvious question is when does this kind of method caching pay off ?
In other words , how much work does a function have to do before the cost of method access becomes irrelevant ?
Clearly , if a function takes 10 minutes to run , then saving a fraction of a millisecond on call overhead is not likely to be something you want to optimize .
To get a handle on this , I modified the called python method to perform some amount of “ real ” work .
In the case of the following graph , each call to the python method included 100 multiplications :
I decreased the number of sample points because , of course , this experiment took much longer per sample than the previous one .
In this case , the overhead per call , while still apparent , is dwarfed by the work of the function .
So the question of whether this kind of optimization is fruitful would seem to depend largely on two factors :
How often the method is called How much work the method itself does
If the method itself does very little and it ’s called many times , then caching the method object might be a great idea .
If it does a lot of work and is only called a few time , you will still see a minor performance improvement , but it ’s hard to argue that the extra complexity and brittleness is worth it .
Speaking of brittleness , it ’s worth noting that caching a method like this does introduce a new kind of dependency between the C++ and python code .
In general , a call to attr ( ) to get a method object does not need to return the same or even roughly equivalent object each time .
The return value could be any callable and could result from any arbitrary calculation that the python code wants to make .
In other words , to use this caching optimization you need to be certain that a cached method reference is semantically equivalent to repeated calls to attr ( ) .
Very often , it ’s safe to make this assumption , but of course it ’s also possible for the semantics of a particular attribute access to change silently when the python code changes , so you need to be aware and vigilant if you use this approach .
Finally , you ’ll notice that you can equally easily use this approach in a purely python program .
Nothing prevents you from caching a method object in python to try to get the same performance benefits as described here .
I have n’t done any tests to see how this might pan out , but it ’s probably worth experimenting with .

First you have to optimize for correctness , then you can optimize for speed .
At the moment I 'm working on a project where I do a lot of serialization , and to ensure that I could debug the correctness I have chosen an easy readable serialization format : YAML .
But running Devel : : NYTProf on my code showed that an awful lot of time was spend in the YAML code .
Changing a few lines to use Storable instead showed an improvement in speed going from 1000s to 200s for my test data .
This is a significant win even while developing , but of course I should n't have used the old YAML - implementation to begin with .
Mentioning this to the local Perl Mongers group I got referred to a benchmark of different serialization modules by Christian Hansen ( I think ) .
I 've updated the script and the interesting part is that JSON : :XS outruns Storable on both tests .
Thank you Devel : : NYTProf for showing me that 80 % of my run time was spent in old pure perl serialization code .
Peak Oil : What 's Next ?
Is n’t that a question , though …
The Peak Oil story was never about running out of oil .
It was about the collapse of complex systems in a world economy faced by the prospect of no further oil - fueled growth .
It was something of a shock to many that the first complex system to fail would be banking , but the process is obvious : no more growth means no more ability to pay interest on credit … end of story , as Tony Soprano used to say .
There was a popular theory among Peak Oilers the last decade that the world would enter a “ bumpy plateau ” period when the global economy would get beaten down by Peak Oil , would then revive as “ demand destruction ” drove down oil prices , and would be beaten down again as oil prices shot up in response — with serial repetitions of the cycle , each beat - down taking economies lower — the only imaginable outcome being some sort of quiet homeostasis .
This scenario did not play out as expected .
It was predicated on a mistaken assumption that all systems would retain some kind of operational resilience while ratcheting down .
Anyway , the banking system was mortally wounded in the first go - round and the behemoth is dying hard .
The last desperate act of the banking system in the face of Peak Oil ’s no -more - growth equation was to engineer species of tradable securities that could produce wealth out of thin air rather than productive activity .
This was the alphabet soup of algorithm - derived frauds with vague and confounding names such as credit default swaps ( CDSs ) , collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) , structured investment vehicles ( SIVs ) , and , of course , the basic filler , mortgage backed securities .
The banking system is now choking to death on these delicacies .
The trouble is that the EMT squad brought in to rescue the banking system — that is , governments — can’t remove these obstructions from the patient ’s craw .
They do n’t want to drown in a mighty upchuck of the alphabet soup .
The collapse of complex systems is actually predicated on the idea that the systems would mutually reinforce each other ’s failures .
This is now plain to see as the collapse of banking ( that is , of both lending and debt service ) , has led to the collapse of commerce and manufacturing .
The next systems to go will probably be farming , transportation , and the oil markets themselves ( which constitute the system for allocating and distributing world energy resources ) .
As these things seize up , the final system to go will be governance , at least at the highest levels .
If we ’re really lucky , human affairs will eventually reorganize at a lower scale of activity , governance , civility , and economy .
Every week , the failure to recognize the nature of our predicament thrusts us further into the uncharted territory of hardship .
The task of government right now is not to prop up doomed systems at their current scales of failure , but to prepare the public to rebuild our systems at smaller scales .
The net effect of the failures in banking is that a lot of people have less money than they expected they would have a year ago .
This is bad enough , given our habits and practices of modern life .
But what happens when farming collapses ?
The prospect for that is closer than most of us might realize .
The way we produce our food has been organized at a scale that has ruinous consequences , not least its addiction to capital .
Now that banking is in collapse , capital will be extremely scarce .
Nobody in the cities reads farm news , or listens to farm reports on the radio .
Guess what , though : we are entering the planting season .
It will be interesting to learn how many farmers “ out there ” in the Cheez Doodle belt are not able to secure loans for this year ’s crop .
My guess is that the disorder in agriculture will be pretty severe this year , especially since some of the world ’s most productive places — California , northern China , Argentina , the Australian grain belt — are caught in extremes of drought on top of capital shortages .
If the U.S. government is going to try to make remedial policy for anything , it better start with agriculture , to promote local , smaller - scaled farming using methods that are much less dependent on oil byproducts and capital injections .
This will , of course , require a re-allocation of lands suitable for growing food .
Our real estate market mechanisms could conceivably enable this to happen , but not without a coherent consensus that it is imperative to do so .
If agribusiness as currently practiced does n’t founder on capital shortages , it will surely collapse on disruptions in the oil markets .
President Obama at least made a start in the right direction by proposing to eliminate further subsidies to farmers above the $ 250,000 level .
But the situation is really more acute .
Surely the US Department of Agriculture already knows about it , but the public may not be interested until the shelves in the Piggly - Wiggly are bare — and then , of course , they ’ll go crazy .
The recent huge drop in oil prices has left the public once again convinced that the world is drowning in oil — if only the scoundrelly oil companies were forced to deliver it at reasonable prices .
The public has been consistently deluded about this for decades .
What ’s missing so far is for the president of the United States to lay out the reality of the situation in a dedicated TV address .
I know a lot of you think that Jimmy Carter already tried this and failed to make an impression ( and ruined his presidency in the process ) .
I guarantee you that Mr. Obama will have to do this sometime in the next few years whether he likes or not , and he’d be well - advised to get it done sooner rather than later .
And by this I do n’t mean just vague allusions to “ energy independence ” or “ renewables ” in speeches devoted to many other issues .
I mean telling the public the plain truth that we ’ll never offset oil depletion and the intelligent response is to do everything possible to transition to walkable towns and public transit , not to sustain the unsustainable .
The alternatives — i.e. what we ’re trying now — is to further delude ourselves into thinking that we can run Wal - Mart and the suburbs by some other means than oil .
Despite all our investments in these things , we wo n’t be able to run them by other means , and the news about this had better get out before enormous disappointment turns into titanic rage .
If Americans think they ’ve been grifted by Goldman Sachs and Bernie Madoff , wait until they find out what a swindle the so - called “ American Dream ” of suburban life turns out to be .
This week , in the power centers of America , attention is fixed on the never - ending fiasco of AIG — a company whose main product turned out to be credit default swaps , and is now choking on them .
Kibitzers on the sidelines of finance are forecasting a king - hell bear market suckers ’ rally in the stock markets followed by a belly flop to Dow 4000 or lower .
I myself called for Dow 4000 two years ago — and was obviously a bit off on my timing .
All this is surely trouble enough .
But while your attention is focused on Rick Santelli in the Chicago trader ’s pit , or Larry Kudlow desperately seeking “ mustard seeds ” of new growth in financials , try to let one eye stray to the horizon where these other complex systems are working out their next moves .
Farming .
The oil markets .
These are the coming theaters of alarm and distress .
30 - stone mother admits to feeding triplets junk food ... and to giving them their first McDonald 's at just SIX MONTHS
She made history as the fattest ever mother of triplets , weighing in at 40 stone .
But far from ensuring her babies do n't go the same way she did , Leanne Salt is happy to admit feeding them junk food , including fish and chips and McDonald 's meals .
Yesterday the 24 - year - old - still dangerously overweight at 30 stone - told of her approach to motherhood which doctors say is certain to leave them facing health problems .
Big girl :
The 24 - year - old , who blames her obesity on a thyroid problem , fell pregnant after seeing her then - boyfriend for just four weeks
' They were six months old when they had their first McDonald 's , ' she said .
' They had chicken nuggets and chips and loved it .
' They like fish and chips too , but I take the batter off the fish , so I guess that 's healthy . '
Miss Salt 's immense weight meant the safe delivery of her triplets - daughters Deanna and Daisy , and son Finlee - last August was a major challenge for medics .
It took a 68 - strong team and a bill for the NHS of £ 200,000 , including a specially - built operating table for her Caesarean section .
Now back home in Coventry and living on benefits , she says she is too busy to prepare proper meals for her triplets or do much in the way of housework .
Miss Salt , who blames her obesity on a thyroid problem , fell pregnant after seeing her then boyfriend for just four weeks .
They split up halfway through her pregnancy , and she now lives with her mother Jane , 46 , and brother Blane , neither of whom is overweight .
The babies each consume around 1,249 calories a day , nearly double the recommended 765 for their 17lb weight at the age of eight months .
Danger diet : Leanne Salt , who weighs 30 stone , happily admits feeding her triplets junk food , including fish and chips and McDonald 's meals
But their mother denies they are suffering as a result .
' Babies are always hungry , ' she said .
' Sometimes it 's easier to give them food that 's already prepared .
' Anyway , they do n't always have junk food - sometimes I cook a microwave meal for them .
My babies are healthy . '
She receives total benefits of £ 227 a week - £ 140 tax credit , £ 42 child benefit and £ 45 family allowance - which she spends on her ten - a - day cigarette habit and food .
Health risk : Leanne is happy to feed her eight - month - olds junk food , such as chicken nuggets , once or twice a week
On an average day the triplets each have an 8 oz bottle of milk at around 5.30 am , another at 8 am , and a crumpet with butter for breakfast .
Lunch could be scrambled eggs on toast , instant mashed potato with spaghetti hoops , or a jar of baby food , followed by a packet of Wotsits each at about 2 pm .
Dinner at around 4 pm could be a microwave lasagne or pie which their mother chews so they can manage it , and they sometimes have another bottle of milk before bed , although their mother says they 're often too full .
' I'm happy to give them fish and chips or chicken nuggets and chips as a treat once or twice a week , ' she explained .
' I feed my babies vegetables every Sunday , and a lot of the baby food I give them has fruit in it .
The health visitor told me off for giving them Smash because it has too much salt in , but it 's difficult to know what to feed them sometimes . '
The full feature appears in this week 's Closer magazine , on sale now
She is not alone - earlier this month a survey by the Infant and Toddler Forum found 29 per cent of children under the age of three ate a takeaway at least once a week , while 23 per cent eat crisps and 16 per cent drink fizzy drinks almost every day .
While the triplets ' weight is currently normal for their age , they were born five weeks premature so have had a lot of catching up to do , and doctors say their diet is totally unsuitable .
' Although babies should be weaned from six months onwards , they should be given a balanced diet , ' said Dr Pyusha Kapila of St John and St Elizabeth Hospital , London .
' Foods high in salt and fat can lead to diarrhoea , hyperactivity , diabetes and , in extreme cases , fitting and fatal heart attacks .
' These children are at extreme risk of becoming overweight in the near future if their diet continues in this way . '
The house is full of unwashed laundry and piles of toys , and Miss Salt says she and her babies only get dressed and go out once a week to collect her benefits .
But they are seen regularly by a health visitor and have weekly visits from a trained helper from the Government 's Sure Start scheme .
Her own mother says she buys in salads , but as she has to go out for work as a carer and is the only one in the house who cooks , they never get eaten .
However Miss Salt - who herself consumes 50 per cent more calories than a woman 's recommended daily diet , snacking on cakes , crisps and chocolate - is convinced , bizarrely , that watching what you eat could lead to anorexia .
' I do worry my kids could get picked on if they get fat , but I 'd tell them that big is beautiful . '
And she now wants her own council house : ' I know how to microwave a meal and make up instant mash , so I think we 'd all manage . '

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Americans saw $ 1.3 trillion of wealth vaporize in the first quarter of 2009 , as the stock market and home values continued to decline , according to a government report released Thursday .
Household net worth fell to $ 50.4 trillion , according to the flow of funds report by the Federal Reserve .
Americans ' stock holdings plunged 5.8 % to $ 5.2 trillion and mutual funds holdings slid 4.1 % to $ 3.3 trillion , while their home value dropped 2.4 % to $ 17.9 trillion .
The nation 's households have now seen their net worth shrink for seven straight quarters .
Family net worth had hit an all - time high of $ 64.4 trillion in the second quarter of 2007 , thanks to the housing bubble and a strong stock market .
" It 's more of what we saw late last year , " said Scott Hoyt , senior director of consumer economics at Moody 's economy.com .
" Consumers are cutting back on their borrowing to some extent , but the decline in value of assets is swamping that . "
The results are not surprising .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 index dropped 11.7 % in the quarter , while home values fell 14.2 % from the prior - year period , according to Zillow.com .
Though Americans are getting poorer , the rate of decline is slowing .
Last year , households ' net worth dropped by a record $ 10.9 trillion , or 17.4 % .
It ended the year at $ 51.7 trillion .
The fourth - quarter loss of $ 4.9 trillion , or 8.6 % , was the largest quarterly plunge since the Fed started keeping records in 1951 .
Americans also continued to pull back on their borrowing .
Household debt fell at an annual rate of 1.1 % to $ 13.8 trillion for the first quarter , after contracting 2 % in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
That was the first time household debt shrank .
During the white - hot housing boom , Americans piled on debt .
Between 2002 and 2006 , annual household borrowing grew at double - digit rates .
Such debt levels are unsustainable and had to come down to restore Americans ' household financial health , said Amir Sufi , finance professor at the University of Chicago .
This contraction is a major factor behind the recession .
" Household deleveraging has to happen even though it 's painful , " Sufi said .
Mortgage borrowing remained flat , after falling for the previous three quarters .
Consumer credit , however , dropped at an annual rate of 3.5 % , the largest dip in at least 35 years , as people slowed their use of credit cards and auto loans .
The plunge in consumer credit concerns Paul Wachtel , economics professor at New York University 's Stern School of Business .
It shows that either consumers are not able or willing to borrow .
" The ability of the consumer sector to start spending again is what will pull the economy out of the recession , " he said .
Homeowners ' equity also fell to a record low 41.4 % as values continued their plunge .
More than one in five homeowners now owe more than their houses are worth , according to Zillow.com .
Businesses also decreased their borrowing for the first time since 1992 , slipping 0.3 % for the quarter .
The federal government , however , pumped up its borrowing by 22.6 % in an attempt to stabilize the economy .
Federal debt grew by 39.2 % in the third quarter of 2008 and 37 % in the fourth quarter .
If the stock market comeback continues , though , Americans will likely see their net worth increase in the second quarter , said Michael Englund , chief economist at Action Economics .
Financial assets , including stock holdings , account for 80 % of a household 's wealth .
The S&P 500 is up 17.7 % so far this quarter .
" The gains in this quarter should more than reverse the declines of the first quarter , " Englund said .

Falken
Tire has been hitting the motorsports scene hard these past few years .
The company is now entering their second year in American LeMans Series ( ALMS ) competing in the GT2 class running a Porsche 911 GT3 RSR with drivers Dominic Cicero and Bryan Sellers .
And Falken has a very strong presence in Formula Drift after spending the last 6 years helping grassroots drivers move up to the pros .
Team Falken has been consistently outperforming its competitors led by Vaughn Gittin , Jr. , who is now one of the most recognized drivers on the drift circuit .
So , if you have top cars and top drivers , why not have top models as well ?
And that seems to be Falken ’s perogative , as their spokesmodels travel to all of the ALMS and Formula Drift events now as well .
We caught up with them at the Formula Drift season opener , the coverage of which can be seen via the link .
Shown here are the official Falken Tire model images which are now available on the Falken website where there is an extensive collection of wallpapers as well .
So , definitely go and check out Lindsey Hanson , Randyl Dawn , Mary J. Castillo , Candace Pittman , CJ Gibson and Eri Moriyama who are all stellar .

The HTC Snap will be available in Q2 of this year , though the price has yet to be announced .
[ HTC on Giz ]
HTC Snap™ makes staying in touch with more people less complicated HTC 's newest QWERTY smartphone features " Inner Circle " to automatically prioritize email from life 's most important people LAS VEGAS – April 1 , 2009 - HTC Corporation today debuted its newest QWERTY smartphone , the HTC Snap™ .
Designed with a set of features selected to deliver everything customers need without overwhelming them with things they do n't , the HTC Snap makes it easier than ever to stay in contact with life 's most important people .
A recent study conducted by Harris Interactive® and commissioned by HTC * found that 44 % of US adults are often overwhelmed by the amount of email they receive , and over half ( 55 % ) of US adults prioritize five or fewer people with whom they communicate via email .
In response to these issues , HTC 's innovative Inner Circle feature allows HTC Snap users to press a dedicated Inner Circle key to bring emails from a preselected group of people to the top of their inbox , enabling important messages to be acted upon immediately .
" Recognizing that people are being overwhelmed by an avalanche of email , the HTC Snap introduces Inner Circle , an HTC innovation that makes it easy for people to prioritize messages from the most important people in their lives at the press of a button , " said John Wang , Chief Marketing Officer , HTC Corporation .
" The HTC Snap represents the latest step in HTC 's mission to create a range of innovative smartphones , each with specific benefits designed to both surprise and delight our customers . "
With a slim , sleek profile designed to fit perfectly in the hand , the HTC Snap measures less than a half - inch thick ( 12 mm ) , yet it can deliver up to eight and a half hours of talk time with the standard 1500 mAh battery .
The full QWERTY keyboard is ergonomically designed with extra-large domed keys and responsive tactile feedback to make typing emails and text messages fast , accurate and comfortable .
High - speed 3G HSPA connectivity makes it quick and easy to send pictures to friends , access favorite social networking sites , or download large files while on the go .
The HTC Snap is powerful enough for experienced business users looking for an affordable , straightforward choice for remotely synchronizing email , calendar and contacts with their Microsoft Exchange server .
However , the flexible Microsoft Windows Mobile® 6.1 Standard platform allows the HTC Snap to also be simple enough for first - time smartphone users wanting to keep their family life organized .
The HTC Snap is expected to be available in select channels during the second quarter of 2009 , rolling out in markets around the world throughout the second half of the year .
Additionally , an unlocked version supporting HSDPA at 850/1900M
Hz for the US market will be made available under the name HTC S522 during the summer .
Remember when DHS put out a report on the rise of right winged home grown terrorism ?
Remember ?
And remember it was the Republicans who were angry about that report and slammed Secretary Napolitano and DHS ?
The push back made DHS retract some of the intial findings , remember ?
Well , DHS was RIGHT .
Since the planned , blantant murder of Dr. Tiller in Witchita , Kansas and now the event today with an elderly white supremist shooting and killing at least one guard at the U.S. Holocaust Museum , brings everything to the front .
These are domestic terrorist acts .
Purposefully planned , scripted to get the maximum effect by killing large number of persons or famous / controversial individuals .
Republicans and all the Republican chatter boxes , shut the f*ck up on this one , you were wrong .
What happened today at the Holocaust Musuem was horrific , plain and simple .
Maybe you need to realize that fighting every single thing that the Obama Administration releases is not for your own good , especially information on home grown terrorist groups .
On a recent Saturday afternoon , hate was on the march in St. Louis .
About 85 members of the National Socialist Movement ( NSM ) , the nation ’s largest neo -Nazi group , gathered in the shadow of the famed Gateway Arch for a march and rally celebrating its 35th anniversary .
Clad in all black , with their pants tucked into tightly laced combat boots , the group carried swastika flags and signs urging immigrants to leave the country .
They chanted “ Sieg Heil , ” a popular rallying cry in World War II Germany , accompanied by a Nazi salute : one arm outstretched , fingers tightly joined , palms facing down .
Their critics say that groups like NSM are the faces of homegrown hate , something the NSM denies .
They instead call themselves a “ white civil rights organization . ”
Its ultimate goal is to whitewash America .
If they had their way , U.S. citizenship would be limited to “ those of pure white blood ” ; minorities would live in the country as guests .
All Jewish people and gays would be forced to leave and immigration would be prohibited .
As shocking as those views are , groups like this are more popular than ever .
read more here ...
If the DHS puts a damn report out with information for the public , especially about the influx and increase of domestic terrorist groups , it would be wise to listen and take this information for what it is .
The totally irresponsible pushback from the right was not only wrong , but makes them look increasingly out of touch with what is really happening out there .
And for that alone , they need to take a swallow of STFU and let DHS do its job .
What does it take to arrest these people ?
Another domestic attack ?
A CMS in Ruby on Rails , and Why I Stopped Last updated on 06 Apr 2009
For the last couple of months I have been writing a series of posts describing a personal Ruby on Rails based CMS .
I have been writing tutorial style posts outlining what I was doing , and why I was doing it .
Do n’t bother trying to look for those posts , because I ’ve archived them .
This decision was pretty easy after I slowed down and reviewed the situation objectively for a few minutes .
That clarity , coupled with a few truths that hit home while reading the source of a few other Rails applications pretty much sealed the deal .
The next post in the series was going to be an overview of another Ruby CMS project , BrowserCMS .
I saw a video from RailsConf about this project , and recognised a lot of their goals as coinciding with mine .
So I was going to poke through their code , see how they ’ve done things , compare it to how I did the same things , or was planning to do them .
While I was reading through their source , it occurred to me just how much I do n’t get Rails .
I have a bit of a poke around with scaffolding and get familiar enough with the generators and I decide that I ’m ready to tell people how do create a CMS in Ruby , because I ’ve nearly finished creating a CMS in ASP .
NET .
It ’s clear to me , now , how silly that was .
Rails is n’t just a framework for Ruby , it ’s a whole change in paradigm .
Intellectually , I know Rails is “ opinionated software ” , however I do n’t think I understood what that really means .
I tried to make my code as flexible and configurable as possible , and I was struggling with all but the most basic CRUD tasks .
So , first I realised I was n’t ready to tell anyone how to do anything in Rails .
But I have a series of about 5 posts doing just that .
What do I do with those ?
Do I continue on , plugging away at learning while trying to instruct ?
I decided the answer to that depended on what I had achieved with my posts .
What was the value of them ?
Then I realised that I had covered very little other than simple CRUD .
Sure , I had some unusual object relations , like trees and self referential comments , and I implemented some business logic like compiling pages into templates , however the total sum of the non-CRUD related content could have fit into 1 post .
So I spent 4 posts blathering away at how to achieve the same task as running script / scaffold .
What ’s worse is that I realised I was back in the rut of creating a CMS .
How on earth did I do that again , after stating loudly and proudly that I do n’t even like programming websites .?
Well , I told myself , you are planning on using this on your own sites , your many , many online business ideas .
Sometimes you have to do the same old thing to earn money .
Which is true , if I had done anything of worth , but I had n’t , I was a long winded scaffold script .
I got carried away in the joy of learning a new language / framework ( which is n’t a bad thing ) , and fell into the familiar territory of doing what I always do ( which is a bad thing ) .
So , now I realise that I ’m not only trying to teach people something I do n’t understand , I ’m trying to teach them how to do something I do n’t even like doing .
That ’s stupid .
I ’ve archived the posts .
I may revisit , as I still have grand ideas of what a CMS should be , but for now I ’m shelving the whole thing .
Luckily I have such a small readership ( read : none ) at this stage , nobody will be affected .
For that I ’m grateful .
And yet , through all this stupidity , I have learnt a few things of value .
I ’ve learnt that Ruby on Rails is more complex than I thought , and will hit the books again to pick up some more advanced techniques .
I ’ve learnt that I ’m scared to push myself in programming .
This revelation is a pointy one .
I love programming , it ’s my job , it ’s my hobby and it ’s my passion .
The fact that I ’m scared to push myself to innovate , hiding behind the excuse that I ’m not smart enough or I ’m not creative enough is double edged .
On one hand , it ’s sad that I ’m not as ambitious as I thought .
On the other , it ’s great that I know now , so that I can get stuck into remedying that .
I ’ve also learnt a lot about blogging .
Those posts of mine were n’t really providing much value .
I do n’t have many readers because I ’m not saying anything new , and I ’m not showing anybody cool things they can’t find in a hundred other blogs .
I also did n’t have much of a personal voice , and was writing them like I would a textbook , which is missing the point of a blog .
It ’s supposed to be informal , and I ’m supposed to show my personality .
So , I ’ve found my voice , while realising that I ’m not providing value .
Another pointy idea , but ultimately good , because that too is something I can work on .
So , inevitably , I have to question the value of this post .
What could this post provide to someone who stumbles across this website ?
Well , a few things .
Firstly , self awareness is a great thing to possess as a programmer .
If you know where your weaknesses are , you can train in them , and get better .
But that ’s not enough , you also need to know what you ’re afraid of , so you can recognise that you do n’t even know that it ’s a weakness .
That fear hides the existence of the things you ’re not good of , and that ’s a major roadblock to improving .
And lastly , if you do n’t have anything to add to the conversation , do n’t say anything .
The whole internet is a conversation , and I ’ve just been babbling to myself in a corner the whole time .
If you want to contribute , add your own thoughts , your own interpretation on subjects that are well known .
Go into new levels of detail on old ideas and technologies .
Introduce new ideas or technology , or modify existing ones .
Contribute , do n’t just talk for the sake of talking .
The indignant Sally Kern , a Republican state representative in Oklahoma , is no stranger to Queerty readers .
She was 2008 ’s runner - up to our Homophobe Of The Year award , thanks to her noted bigotry , out of touch logic , anti-gay obsession , and her public shunning of her own gay son Jesse .
So why mention her name again ?
Because she just opened a one - woman show called “ I ’m Batshit Crazytown ! ”
Actually , we mistook her comments at a press conference hosted by Americans For Truth About Homosexuality ( yes , that ’s the org ’s real name ) to be an off - Broadway comedy .
It was not .
Kern regularly calls gays a blight on American society , insists they have no place among morally just heterosexuals , and often invokes God when opining on how this country should be run .
Throw in some Barack Obama and you ’re gonna want to buy tickets to see the show .
The homosexual agenda is only one symptom of the real problem in America .
The problem is that we have forsaken the Judeo - Christian values upon which this nation was founded .
Noah Webster declared : “ The principles of genuine liberty and of wise laws and administrations are to be drawn from the Bible . ”
There are two conflicting worldviews vying for power .
The secular humanist worldview versus the Judeo - Christian or Biblical worldview .
Humanism sees the world as impersonal matter shaped by chance with man just another animal .
There is no basis for values or laws .
The Biblical worldview recognizes a Creator who established moral laws and absolute truth as revealed in the Bible .
Man , made in God ’s image , is priceless .
Our founding fathers established this nation upon the Biblical worldview as evidenced by John Adam ’s statement , “ Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people . ”
Or James Madison ’s statement : “ We have staked the whole future of American civilization , not upon the power of government … but upon the capacity of mankind for self - government , upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves , to control ourselves , to sustain ourselves according to the 10 Commandments of God . ”
For the first time in America ’s history , we have a president who has no understanding of the Biblical worldview and who has even less understanding of the truths of the Bible .
This is evident when he says that support for homosexual “ marriage ” [ unions ] can be found in the Sermon on the Mount or that certain passages in Romans are just obscure passages .
Whereas George Washington expelled from his military those who practiced sodomy , President Obama honors sodomites by proclaiming an entire month as Gay Pride Month , but he wo n’t acknowledge one day for our National Day of Prayer .
We have a president who does n’t know the difference between God - given rights and sinful , perverted behavior .
The Biblical worldview teaches that all are created equal and worthy of respect but it also teaches that some behaviors , such as homosexuality , are wrong because they violate God ’s moral law .
Today many in our churches and even many ministers have forsaken belief in absolute truth and are instead reinterpreting the Bible to justify their behavior .
This leads to acceptance of anything and everything .
While conservatives attack the symptoms , like homosexuality or abortion , and these behaviors should be exposed and attacked ; however , we should love the people involved in these behaviors and tell them God has a better way .
While conservatives attack the symptoms , those who do n’t believe in or appreciate the uniqueness of America , our president included , are attacking the foundation of absolute truth , seeking to destroy it through teaching evolution and tolerance for deviant behaviors .
Our founding fathers understood that if a nation is to provide safety and the pursuit of happiness for its citizens , the Judeo - Christian worldview must be maintained .
George Washington said , “ Of all the habits and dispositions that lead to political prosperity religion and morality are indispensable supports . ”

SPARK released as FLOSS ( Free / Libre / Open Source Software ) !
The SPARK toolsuite has just been released as FLOSS ( Free / Libre / Open Source Software ) by Praxis ( its creator ) .
This is great news for those who want to make software safer , more reliable , and more secure .
In particular , this means that Tokeneer is now an open proof .
If you have n’t been following this , here ’s some background .
Software is now a part of really critical systems ( ones that need “ high assurance ” ) , yet often that software is not as safe , reliable , or secure as it needs to be .
I believe that in the long term , we will need to start proving that our very important programs are correct .
Testing by itself is n’t enough ; completely testing the trivial “ add three 64 - bit integers ” program would take far longer than the age of the universe ( it would take about 2x10^39 years ) .
The basic idea of using mathematics to prove that programs are correct — aka “ formal methods ” — has been around for decades .
There are a number of cases where formal methods have been applied successfully , and I ’m glad about that .
And yet , applying formal methods is still relatively rare .
There are many reasons for this , such as inadequate maturation and capabilities of many formal methods tools , and the fact that relatively few people know how to apply formal methods when developing real programs .
But what , in turn , is causing those problems ?
It ’s true that applying formal methods is a hard problem that has n’t received the level of funding it needs , but still , it ’s been decades !
I believe one problem hindering the maturation and spread of formal methods is a “ culture of secrecy ” .
Details of formal method use are often unpublished ( e.g. , because the implementations are proprietary or classified ) .
Similarly , details about formal methods tools are often unshared and lost ( or have to constantly re-invented ) .
Biere ’s “ The Evolution from LIMMAT to NANOSAT ” ( Apr 2004 ) gives an example : “ From the publications alone , without access to the source code , various details were still unclear …
Only [ when CHAFF ’s source code became available did ] our unfortunate design decision became clear …
The lesson learned is , that important details are often omitted in publications and can only be extracted from source code .
It can be argued , that making source code of SAT solvers available is as important to the advancement of the field as publications ”
This “ culture of secrecy ” means that researchers / toolmakers often do n’t receive adequate feedback , researchers / toolmakers waste time and money rebuilding tools , educators have difficulty explaining formal methods ( they have no examples to show ! ) , developers do n’t understand how to apply it ( and it has an uncertain value to them ) , and evaluators / end - users do n’t know what to look for .
I believe that a way to break through this “ culture of secrecy ” is to develop “ open proofs ” .
But what are they ?
An “ open proof ” is software or a system where all of the following are free - libre / open source software ( FLOSS ) :
the entire implementation
automatically - verifiable proof(s ) of at least one key property , and
required tools ( for use and modification )
Imagine if we had a number of open proofs available .
There could be small open proofs that could be used for learning ( e.g. , as examples and use in class exercises ) .
There could be proofs of various useful functions and small applications , so developers could see how to scale up these techniques , directly reuse them as components , or use them as starting points but add additional ( proven ) capabilities to them .
When problems come up ( and they will ! ) , toolmakers and developers could work together to find ways to mature the tools and technology so that they ’d be easier to use ( e.g. , so more could be automated ) .
In short , imagine there was a working ecosystem where researchers / toolmakers / educators , developers of implementations to be proved , and evaluators / end-users could work together by sharing information .
I believe that would greatly speed up the maturing of formal methods , resulting in more reliable and secure software .
In this context , Praxis has just released the SPARK GPL Edition .
This is their SPARK toolsuite ( a formal methods tool ) released under the GNU General Public License aka GPL ( the most common FLOSS license ) .
So , what ’s that ?
SPARK is a variant of the Ada programming language , designed to enable proofs about programs ( by adding and removing some features of Ada ) .
The additions are in special comments , so SPARK programs can be compiled by a normal Ada compiler like GNAT ( which is part of gcc ) .
The Open Proofs page on SPARK has some information on SPARK .
The page What is Special About SPARK Contracts ?
gives a nice quick introduction to SPARK , which I will quote here .
It points out that the Ada line :
procedure Inc ( X : in out Integer ) ;
procedure Inc ( X : in out Integer ) ; --# global in out CallCount ; --# pre X < Integer ' Last and --# CallCount < Integer ' Last ; --# post X = X~ + 1 and --# CallCount = CallCount~ + 1 ;
X and global variable CallCount must be read by at least one path and must be updated by at least one path through the procedure
Inc can only called when both X and CallCount are less than Integer ’Last .
The “ pre ” means “ precondition ” .
After Inc runs , both X and CallCount will always be incremented by one ( X ~ refers to the initial value of X ) .
The “ post ” means “ postcondition ” .
You can learn more about SPARK from the book High Integrity Software : The SPARK Approach to Safety and Security ” by John Barnes .
Sample text of Barnes ’ book is available online .
The open proofs page on SPARK has more information .
This means that the “ Tokeneer ” program is now an open proof .
Remember , to be an open proof , a program ’s implementation , proofs , and required tools have to be open source software .
Tokeneer was a sample program written to show how to apply these kinds of techniques to actual systems ( instead of trivial 5 - line programs ) .
The Tokeneer program itself , and its proofs , have already been released as open source software .
Many of the tools it required are already FLOSS ( e.g. , fuzz and LaTeX for its formal specifications , and an Ada compiler to compile it ) .
Now that SPARK has been released as FLOSS , people can examine this entire stack of software to make improvements in all the technologies , as well as learn from them and create improved implementations .
No , this does n’t suddenly make it trivial to make proofs about complex programs , but it ’s a step forward .
If you are interested in making future software better , please help the open proofs project .
You do n’t need to be a math whiz .
For example , if you know how to do shell scripting , please help us package some promising formal methods tools ( like SPARK ) so they are easy to install .
It ’s hard to get people to try out these tools ( and give feedback ) if they ’re too hard to install .
If you know of formal methods software that is rotting in some warehouse , try to get it released as FLOSS .
I think all government - funded unclassified research software should be released as FLOSS by default , since “ we the people ” paid for it !
If you ’re interested in the latest software technology , try out a few of these formal methods tools , and release as FLOSS any small programs and proofs you develop with them .
Send the toolmakers feedback , or write down their strengths and weaknesses to help others understand them .
SPARK is a tool that can be used , right now , in certain circumstances .
I have no illusions that today ’s formal methods tools are ready for arbitrary 20 million line programs .
But if we want future software to be better than today , we need to figure out how to mature formal methods technology and make it better - understood so that it can mature and scale .
I think making top - to - bottom worked examples and starting points can help us get there .

BURR TALKS UP BANK RUNS ….
I ’d hoped someone who ’s been helping write federal law for more than 14 years would know better than to say things like this in public .
( via Christopher Orr )
Sen. Richard Burr ( R - N.C. ) says when the financial crisis began he encouraged his wife to withdraw all the cash she possibly could from their local bank .
During a speech on the economy [ Monday ] night , Burr related his immediate reaction the week the crisis began .
“ On Friday night , I called my wife and I said , ‘ Brooke , I am not coming home this weekend .
I will call you on Monday .
Tonight , I want you to go to the ATM machine , and I want you to draw out everything it will let you take , ” Burr said , according to the Hendersonville Times - News .
“ And I want you to tomorrow , and I want you to go Sunday . ’
I was convinced on Friday night that if you put a plastic card in an ATM machine the last thing you were going to get was cash . ”
Now , maybe Burr was trying to be funny , but his comments do n’t make any sense .
Since the advent of FDIC , Burr ’s family money was safe , right where it was .
Calling home in a panic , and withdrawing the maximum , only serves to make a bad situation worse .
But even worse is hearing Burr talk like this publicly to voters who may be inclined to think he knows what he ’s talking about .
The senator was n’t just describing a bank run , he was suggesting bank runs might be a good idea in the midst of a crisis .
As Matt Yglesias explained , “ Burr ’s effort to whip people into a panic could lead to runs and bank failures .
That , in turn , will lead to people losing jobs .
People could even lose their business through no fault of their own other than having customers who chose to take the words of a United States Senator seriously .
I ’m having a hard to imagining what Burr could have been thinking . ”
Burr is a vulnerable Republican incumbent , willing to throw around irresponsible rhetoric during an economic crisis .
I seriously doubt he was thinking at all .
Now in a sane world , this would be front page news in every paper , even if the gravy train ended at the door to Baucus ' office .
Unfortunately , it does n't end there at all .
Baucus has managed to , in the parlance of our times , spread the wealth around quite a bit .
Baucus has mastered the art of getting special interests to donate to his Glacier leadership political action committee , which he has used to help out colleagues .
Of the $ 1.4 million collected in the 2007 - 08 cycle , Glacier PAC handed out $ 196,000 to federal candidates , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
But why stop there ?
Obviously feeling no pressure from the press or from constituents as the dollars roll in , Baucus has taken things to levels approaching parody , hosting a summer camp for lobbyists .
At " Camp Baucus , " he collects checks from his lobbyist friends , in return for access to ...uh... you know , some really great fly fishing .
Lobbyists and political supporters will get their chance to cast fishing lines and drive golf balls with the Senate 's top tax writer at his Fly - Fishing & Golfing in Big Sky event .
The cost is $ 2,500 per person , $ 5,000 for a political action committee .
And for the same price , more fun lies ahead at Camp Baucus , the summer camp he holds for friends and their families in his home state between July 31 and Aug .
2 .
Sounds like a blast !
Nevermind the fact that the decisions Baucus makes as head of the Finance Committee will affect millions of Americans on matters of life and death .
Baucus ' explanations for all of this are pure comedy ( emphasis mine ) :
Baucus brushed aside the criticism .
" There 's no problem .
I 've been doing these events for more than 10 years , " he said .
Baucus said he did not know how many contributors would be attending .
And on the donations in general :
Baucus , who chairs the Senate Finance Committee , which is drafting a major health care reform bill this month , insists that this cascade of money is not unduly influencing his work .
Of course , it might be unfair to single out Baucus .
Earlier I wrote a diary on the extent to which Tom Daschle , former Senate majority leader and the Dem " point man " on health care reform , has traveled the country giving speeches and collecting millions from the industry .
And of course , Daschle 's partner in bipartisanship ?
Former Viagra spokesman Bob Dole .
A recent AP article examined recently released records in which Senators disclosed their financial interests and those of their spouses , and found numerous ties to the health care industry among both Dems and Repubs .
Members of both parties have industry connections , including Democrats Jay Rockefeller and Tom Harkin , in addition to Dodd , and Republicans Tom Coburn , Judd Gregg , John Kyl and Orrin Hatch , financial reports showed Friday .
It 's nice to see Senators still making use of the time - tested practice of using your wife as a proxy for pay offs , as Chris Dodd has seemingly done :
Jackie Clegg Dodd , wife of the Connecticut Democrat , is on the boards of Javelin Pharmaceuticals Inc. , Cardiome Pharma Corp. , Brookdale Senior Living and Pear Tree Pharmaceuticals .
Other publicly available documents show Mrs. Dodd last year was one of the most highly compensated non-employee members of the Javelin Pharmaceuticals Inc. board , on which she has served since 2004 .
She earned $ 32,000 in fees and $ 109,587 in stock option awards last year , according to the company 's SEC filings .
When called out on this , Dodd offers us more comedy , albeit not quite at the Baucus level :
Bryan DeAngelis , Dodd 's spokesman , said , " Jackie Clegg Dodd 's career is her own ; absolutely independent of Senator Dodd , as it was when they married 10 years ago .
The senator has worked to reform our health care system for decades , and nothing about his wife 's career is relevant at all to his leadership of that effort . "
Among other highlights from the AP report :
Rockefeller , D - W.Va. , reported $ 15,001 to $ 50,000 in capital gains for his wife from the sale of a stake in Athenahealth Inc. , a business services company that helps medical providers with billing and clinical operations .
...
Gregg , R - N.H. , disclosed $ 250,001 to $ 500,000 in drug maker Bristol - Myers Squibb Co. stock and $ 1,000 to $ 15,000 each in stock in pharmaceutical companies Merck & Co. and Pfizer , the Johnson & Johnson health care products company and Agilent Technologies , which is involved in the biomedical industry .
The takeaway from all of this to me is that arguing the health care debate on ideological grounds is a red herring .
You can argue ideology , make calls and point to polls , but at the end of the day it 's all going to be meaningless next to a ( daily ) $ 1500 check .
Independent / libertarian - leaning talk show host Dan Carlin absolutely nails this issue in his latest show , " A Conflict of Interest . "
He points out that what we are dealing with in terms of Baucus , Grassley , Dodd and others , is n't just " special interest influence . "
It 's corruption , pure and simple .
And we would clearly not tolerate it in , say , a Supreme Court case , where a Justice who had ANY financial ties to a case would be forced to recuse themselves .
Why then do we tolerate this from our legislative representatives , who play a much more direct role in creating the regulations that shape peoples ' lives ?
And more importantly , how can we expect to get any kind of decent outcome , when these incentives are in place ?
News America Marketing , a unit of the News Corporation that produces coupon inserts and sells advertising in supermarkets , settled a lawsuit this week with a competitor that had accused it of anticompetitive behavior and corporate spying .
On Wednesday , News America bought the company , Floorgraphics , outright for an undisclosed sum .
The lawsuit was settled after witnesses began testifying in the trial in federal court in New Jersey .
The original lawsuit was filed in 2004 .
In a brief statement , a spokeswoman for News America confirmed the acquisition , saying , “ We ’re pleased to be expanding our network of stores to better serve our customers and we ’re very excited to incorporate the quality network so ably developed by Floorgraphics . ”
In a court filing , Floorgraphics , which also markets in - store advertising , said that News America had “ illegally accessed plaintiff ’s computer system and obtained proprietary information from the computer system ; disseminated false , misleading and malicious information about the plaintiff ; and incorrect information about themselves to plaintiff ’s existing and prospective clients , in an effort to induce retailers and clients to avoid doing further business with plaintiff . ”

We at OTB are in mourning for the death of Tits McGee and Tanfastic Andre .
If there was ever a more homogenised celebrity Mc- couple , it was Jordan and Pete and if we have to give them credit for something , we ’d give them credit for that .
In our over emotional state we have even taken to writing poetry , strumming our guitars and getting a bit emo .
Read on….
An Ode To The Doomed Gogglebox Romance
Oh why oh why did you do this to me ?
You stole my heart on reality TV
Now we ’ve made a few quid but my reputation ’s shot
A few more interviews in Heat and that ’s my lot
I must say I had suspected you would cheat on me
Now our kids will grow up needing pyschotherapy
What hurts the most is that I thought it was forever
In three months time can we just get back together ?
It may be too late but I love you honey
Nah , it ’s time to ‘ fess up – it was all about the money …
PHIL AND KATE – THE APPRENTICE
Oh it ’s all going so well is n’t it ?
Now , there ’s publicity photos , gushing over that first kiss and even , gasp , talk of marriage .
But , at the end of the day , we all know it ’s b******s.
In a few week , there will be screaming , tears , taking sides and those public displays of affection will quickly turn into a barrage of vicious manipulation .
Lorraine Kelly will jump on the bandwagon and inevitably slag the pair of them off , then Phil will stumble out of Boujis with Jordan ’s left t*t in one hand and a Treasure Chest cocktail in the other before he vomits on a pap and collapses in a heap of his own misery ( and probably p*ss ) .
Think twice chaps , get out whilst you still can .
DIANA VICKERS AND EOGHAN QUINN - THE X FACTOR
I ’ve heard of puppy love , but Eoghan Quinn is as runty as they come .
Oh you may call him baby - faced now , but what about four years down the line when he still has n’t grown facial hair , and his voice still rivals that kid who sang The Snowman .
He skinny boyish body wo n’t continue to appeal when you get past age twenty Diana , and you know it .
It ’s like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button all over again .
Whilst you are out practicing “ The Claw ” and making Sinead O’Connor look bad , he ’ll be regressing even further until one day you ’ll come home and he ’ll be a whimpering tot .
Get a real man Diana !
You need one .
NIKKI AND PETE – BIG BROTHER
How could the most loved Big Brother contestant fall for a girl who can out - tantrum a five year old ?
Well , I suppose there were slim pickings that year – it was Princess Nikki or Ghetto Aisleyne …
Sources state that Nikki was not best pleased about slumming it at shabby Brighton flats on the party scene with Pete .
To be fair , it would have never worked – to damn one couple with Tourette ’s ( on Pete ’s side ) , anorexia , suicidal tendencies and OCD ( all Nikki ) would have just been too much .
Seriously , could you imagine the children ?!
NATASHA KAPLINSKY AND BRENDAN COLE
Behind Natasha Kaplinsky ’s plastic smile and blindingly shiny veneer is a putrid soul , so poisonous she makes Satan quake with fear .
Poor Camilla Dallerup did n’t know what hit her .
If anyone attempted to get their claws into my fiancee , I would have planted a razor sharp pair of shears in her dressing room , secretly hidden in some kind of congratulatory bouquet ( oh the ironic twist of fate ) .
Carefully place this in close proximity to a slippery , surface that will cause any dance - shoe to disintegrate and watch the carnage unfold .
Try presenting the news for Channel Five with a giant pair of scissors slicing your jugular , biatch .
CERYS MATTHEWS AND MARC BANNERMAN – I ’M A CELEBRITY …
She puts horses heads in people ’s beds , he had a short - stint in an Italian family on Eastenders – the mob connection clearly brought them together .
Well … that and the intense musk that celebrities inherit after three weeks in the jungle , sucking on some kangaroo testicles and chowing down on a fish eye .
Even Ant and Dec were captivated by this illicit romance .
Surely there can be nothing more romantic than wiping the blood from a gorilla penis from your loved one ’s cheek ?
Since then it ’s been off again , on again , off again , oh dear .. oh … no …wait … Turn off the lights we ’re having a fit …
CHANTELLE AND PRESTON – CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER
Even I was sucked in by this one .
They were just so sweet , it was like the TV version of gorging oneself on candyfloss - covered toffee apples .
Great at the time , but highly likely to result in choking on one ’s own vomit .
By the wedding I was suffering from a mild case of malaise .
When The Ordinary Boys released “ I Luv U ” I started to break out in a mild sweat and by the time Simon Amstell was mocking Chantelle ’s autobiography , causing Preston to walk off Never Mind The Buzzcocks I was beyond caring .
Just in time for the divorce !
How fickle celebrity love is .
Occasionally I get pangs of guilt for the couple and dream about what might have been .
Then I usually slap myself and get on with my day .
I recently saw Preston in a Brighton Blockbusters and realised that , in the flesh , he was just a cocky little s*** with poor taste in films .
And that , my friends , is what we call “ closure ” .
ULRIKA JONSSON AND LANCE GERARD WRIGHT – MR RIGHT
In a shameful publicity stunt , after the winning contestant rejected Mr ( Lance Gerrard W ) Right , it was n’t long before Ulrika got her polished , Swedish claws in .
Ah Ulrika , what a paragon of misery – why the hell did she win Celebrity Big Brother ?
Did the voting public keep her in the house as some kind of long , drawn - out attempt at punishment for her Sven affair and sex addict documentary ?
That seems like the only plausible explanation …
If Jodie Marsh classed herself up a bit , she could definitely follow in Ms Jonsson ’s footsteps .
All she needs to do is pop out a few kids from a smorgasbord of different Neanderthals and she ’d be halfway there .
JORDAN AND PETER – I ’M A CELEBRITY …
For me , the turning point was clearly A Whole New World .
The only couple that have ever released a credible song together is Beyonce and Jay Z , even Sonny and Cher broke up – and I Got You Babe is a classic .
I do n’t believe this break up is in any way real .
I think it ’s a shameless attempt to out - rubbish Kerry Katona .
We know that celebrities are suffering in the credit crunch too , look how much Posh and Becks lost in The Sunday Times Rich List , it ’s understandable that they ’d want to distract us all from our hatred of MP ’s with their tear - jerker parting .
Yet I remain sceptical .
Perhaps Jordan is just jealous that Jade Goody has been heralded as a new , dearly - departed , “ People ’s Princess ” – thereby taking the attention away from Mrs Andre ’s most recent corrective surgery or inappropriately named child .
How is anyone meant to crack America when their home country is obsessed with another faddy fame - seeker ?
Do n’t worry Katie , we get it .
Hopefully one day your fans will wake up and smell the roses , but until then , fair play to you .
DENISE VAN OUTEN AND LEE MEAD – ANY DREAM WILL DO
Ok so the jury ’s still out on this one ( mainly because we feel uncharacteristically cruel at damning their relationship after just over two weeks of marriage ) but we worry for our little Den .
The poor girl has n’t exactly had the best dating record – and I do n’t just mean her disastrous relationship with hat - wearing funk Badger Jay Kay .
Rumour has it that Miss VO also had a short - lived teen romance with the grotesquely perverse Grandad of Glam Rock – Gary Glitter .
Pass me the bucket .
We really , really hope this relationship is destined for great things but with a big age difference ( not to mention the fact that the Ulrika / Lance comparisons are plentiful ) the obsequious demons of reality TV coupledom are waiting patiently to claw the very heart out of the lovely pair .
Let ’s hope they do n’t get too close .
Eeek !
JODIE MARSH AND MATT PEACOCK – TOTALLY JODIE MARSH : WHO’LL TAKE HER UP THE AISLE
Well , if there ’s one thing you can say for Jodie Marsh , it ’s that she ’s honest .
If there was ever a more obvious attempt at making money and boring a few thousand idle chavs of an evening , it was Jodie ’s desperate TV marriage campaign .
It was no surprise that she eventually ended up tying the knot with one of Jordan ’s cast offs ( watch out Mr Andre ) , resulting in a three month marriage and damning rumours that Jodie is positively obsessed with Katie Price ’s alter ego .
The question remains , what new lows can Jodie sink to now that she ’s flouted the most sacred of all loving institutions ?
Errr , she can start a lesbian affair with her hairdresser and make a public appeal for a sperm donor , obviously .
Anything for a few column inches and some tainted cash .

As the amount of data at Google 's disposal grows , the opportunities to exploit it multiply .
In the midst of financial apocalypse , the gadflies and gurus of the global marketplace are gathered at the San Francisco Hilton for the annual meeting of the American Economics Association .
The mood is similar to a seismologist convention in the wake of the Big One .
Yet surprisingly , one of the most popular sessions has nothing to do with toxic assets , derivatives , or unemployment curves .
" I 'm going to talk about online auctions , " says Hal Varian , the session 's first speaker .
Varian is a lanky 62 - year - old professor at UC Berkeley 's Haas School of Business and School of Information , but these days he 's best known as Google 's chief economist .
This morning 's crowd has n't come for predictions about the credit market ; they want to hear about Google 's secret sauce .
Varian is an expert on what may be the most successful business idea in history : AdWords , Google 's unique method for selling online advertising .
AdWords analyzes every Google search to determine which advertisers get each of up to 11 " sponsored links " on every results page .
It 's the world 's biggest , fastest auction , a never - ending , automated , self - service version of Tokyo's boisterous Tsukiji fish market , and it takes place , Varian says , " every time you search . "
He never mentions how much revenue advertising brings in .
But Google is a public company , so anyone can find the number :
It was $ 21 billion last year .
His talk quickly becomes technical .
There 's the difference between the Generalized Second Price auction model and the Vickrey - Clark - Groves alternative .
Game theory takes a turn ; so does the Nash Equilibrium .
Terms involving the c- word — as in clicks — get tossed around like beach balls at a summer rock festival .
Clickthrough rate .
Cost per click .
Supply curve of clicks .
The audience is enthralled .
During the question - and - answer period , a man wearing a camel - colored corduroy blazer raises his hand .
" Let me understand this , " he begins , half skeptical , half unsure .
" You say that an auction happens every time a search takes place ?
That would mean millions of times a day ! "
Varian smiles .
" Millions , " he says , " is actually quite an understatement . "
Why does Google even need a chief economist ?
The simplest reason is that the company is an economy unto itself .
The ad auction , marinated in that special sauce , is a seething laboratory of fiduciary forensics , with customers ranging from giant multinationals to dorm - room entrepreneurs , all billed by the world 's largest micropayment system .
Google depends on economic principles to hone what has become the search engine of choice for more than 60 percent of all Internet surfers , and the company uses auction theory to grease the skids of its own operations .
All these calculations require an army of math geeks , algorithms of Ramanujanian complexity , and a sales force more comfortable with whiteboard markers than fairway irons .
Varian , an upbeat , avuncular presence at the Googleplex in Mountain View , California , serves as the Adam Smith of the new discipline of Googlenomics .
His job is to provide a theoretical framework for Google 's business practices while leading a team of quants to enforce bottom - line discipline , reining in the more propellerhead propensities of the company 's dominant engineering culture .
Googlenomics actually comes in two flavors : macro and micro .
The macroeconomic side involves some of the company 's seemingly altruistic behavior , which often baffles observers .
Why does Google give away products like its browser , its apps , and the Android operating system for mobile phones ?
Anything that increases Internet use ultimately enriches Google , Varian says .
And since using the Web without using Google is like dining at In - N - Out without ordering a hamburger , more eyeballs on the Web lead inexorably to more ad sales for Google .
The microeconomics of Google is more complicated .
Selling ads does n't generate only profits ; it also generates torrents of data about users ' tastes and habits , data that Google then sifts and processes in order to predict future consumer behavior , find ways to improve its products , and sell more ads .
This is the heart and soul of Googlenomics .
It 's a system of constant self - analysis : a data - fueled feedback loop that defines not only Google 's future but the future of anyone who does business online .
When the American Economics Association meets next year , the financial crisis may still be topic A .
But one of the keynote speakers has already been chosen : Googlenomist Hal Varian .
Ironically , economics was a distant focus in the first days of Google .
After Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded the company in 1998 , they channeled their energy into its free search product and left much of the business planning to a 22 - year - old Stanford graduate named Salar Kamangar , Google 's ninth employee .
The early assumption was that although ads would be an important source of revenue , licensing search technology and selling servers would be just as lucrative .
Page and Brin also believed that ads should be useful and welcome — not annoying intrusions .
Kamangar and another early Googler , Eric Veach , set out to implement that ideal .
Neither had a background in business or economics .
Kamangar had been a biology major , and Veach 's field of study was computer science .
Hal Varian , high priest of Googlenomics .
Photo : Joe Pugliese Google 's ads were always plain blocks of text relevant to the search query .
But at first , there were two kinds .
Ads at the top of the page were sold the old - fashioned way , by a crew of human beings headquartered largely in New York City .
Salespeople wooed big customers over dinner , explaining what keywords meant and what the prices were .
Advertisers were then billed by the number of user views , or impressions , regardless of whether anyone clicked on the ad .
Down the right side were other ads that smaller businesses could buy directly online .
The first of these , for live mail - order lobsters , was sold in 2000 , just minutes after Google deployed a link reading see your ad here .
But as the business grew , Kamangar and Veach decided to price the slots on the side of the page by means of an auction .
Not an eBay - style auction that unfolds over days or minutes as bids are raised or abandoned , but a huge marketplace of virtual auctions in which sealed bids are submitted in advance and winners are determined algorithmically in fractions of a second .
Google hoped that millions of small and medium companies would take part in the market , so it was essential that the process be self - service .
Advertisers bid on search terms , or keywords , but instead of bidding on the price per impression , they were bidding on a price they were willing to pay each time a user clicked on the ad .
( The bid would be accompanied by a budget of how many clicks the advertiser was willing to pay for . )
The new system was called AdWords Select , while the ads at the top of the page , with prices still set by humans , was renamed AdWords Premium .
One key innovation was that all the sidebar slots on the results page were sold off in a single auction .
( Compare that to an early pioneer of auction - driven search ads , Overture , which held a separate auction for each slot . )
The problem with an all - at - once auction , however , was that advertisers might be inclined to lowball their bids to avoid the sucker 's trap of paying a huge amount more than the guy just below them on the page .
So the Googlers decided that the winner of each auction would pay the amount ( plus a penny ) of the bid from the advertiser with the next - highest offer .
( If Joe bids $ 10 , Alice bids $ 9 , and Sue bids $ 6 , Joe gets the top slot and pays $ 9.01 .
Alice gets the next slot for $ 6.01 , and so on . )
Since competitors did n't have to worry about costly overbidding errors , the paradoxical result was that it encouraged higher bids .
" Eric Veach did the math independently , " Kamangar says .
" We found out along the way that second - price auctions had existed in other forms in the past and were used at one time in Treasury auctions . "
( Another crucial innovation had to do with ad quality , but more on that later . )
Google 's homemade solution to its ad problem impressed even Paul Milgrom , the Stanford economist who is to auction theory what Letitia Baldridge is to etiquette .
" I 've begun to realize that Google somehow stumbled on a level of simplification in ad auctions that was not included before , " he says .
And applying a variation on second - price auctions was n't just a theoretical advance .
" Google immediately started getting higher prices for advertising than Overture was getting . "
Google hired Varian in May 2002 , a few months after implementing the auction - based version of AdWords .
The offer came about when Google 's then - new CEO , Eric Schmidt , ran into Varian at the Aspen Institute and they struck up a conversation about Internet issues .
Schmidt was with Larry Page , who was pushing his own notions about how some of the big problems in business and science could be solved by using computation and analysis on an unprecedented scale .
Varian remembers thinking , " Why did Eric bring his high - school nephew ? "
Schmidt , whose father was an economist , invited Varian to spend a day or two a week at Google .
On his first visit , Varian asked Schmidt what he should do .
" Why do n't you take a look at the ad auction ? " Schmidt said .
Google had already developed the basics of AdWords , but there was still plenty of tweaking to do , and Varian was uniquely qualified to " take a look . "
As head of the information school at UC Berkeley and coauthor ( with Carl Shapiro ) of a popular book called Information Rules : A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy , he was already the go - to economist on ecommerce .
At the time , most online companies were still selling advertising the way it was done in the days of Mad Men .
But Varian saw immediately that Google 's ad business was less like buying traditional spots and more like computer dating .
" The theory was Google as yenta — matchmaker , " he says .
He also realized there was another old idea underlying the new approach : A 1983 paper by Harvard economist Herman Leonard described using marketplace mechanisms to assign job candidates to slots in a corporation , or students to dorm rooms .
It was called a two - sided matching market .
" The mathematical structure of the Google auction , " Varian says , " is the same as those two - sided matching markets . "
Varian tried to understand the process better by applying game theory .
" I think I was the first person to do that , " he says .
After just a few weeks at Google , he went back to Schmidt .
" It 's amazing ! " Varian said .
" You 've managed to design an auction perfectly . "
To Schmidt , who had been at Google barely a year , this was an incredible relief .
" Remember , this was when the company had 200 employees and no cash , " he says .
" All of a sudden we realized we were in the auction business . "
It was n't long before the success of AdWords Select began to dwarf that of its sister system , the more traditional AdWords Premium .
Inevitably , Veach and Kamangar argued that all the ad slots should be auctioned off .
In search , Google had already used scale , power , and clever algorithms to change the way people accessed information .
By turning over its sales process entirely to an auction - based system , the company could similarly upend the world of advertising , removing human guesswork from the equation .
The move was risky .
Going ahead with the phaseout — nicknamed Premium Sunset — meant giving up campaigns that were selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars , for the unproven possibility that the auction process would generate even bigger sums .
" We were going to erase a huge part of the company 's revenue , " says Tim Armstrong , then head of direct sales in the US .
( This March , Armstrong left Google to become AOL 's new chair and CEO . )
" Ninety - nine percent of companies would have said , ' Hold on , do n't make that change . '
But we had Larry , Sergey , and Eric saying , ' Let 's go for it . ' "
News of the switch jacked up the Maalox consumption among Google 's salespeople .
Instead of selling to corporate giants , their job would now be to get them to place bids in an auction ?
" We thought it was a little half - cocked , " says Jeff Levick , an early leader of the Google sales team .
The young company was n't getting rid of its sales force ( though the system certainly helped Google run with far fewer salespeople than a traditional media company ) but was asking them to get geekier , helping big customers shape online strategies as opposed to simply selling ad space .
Levick tells a story of visiting three big customers to inform them of the new system :
" The guy in California almost threw us out of his office and told us to fuck ourselves .
The guy in Chicago said , ' This is going to be the worst business move you ever made . '
But the guy in Massachusetts said , ' I trust you . ' "
That client knew math , says Levick , whose secret weapon was the numbers .
When the data was crunched — and Google worked hard to give clients the tools needed to run the numbers themselves — advertisers saw that the new system paid off for them , too .
AdWords was such a hit that Google went auction - crazy .
The company used auctions to place ads on other Web sites ( that program was dubbed AdSense ) .
" But the really gutsy move , " Varian says , " was using it in the IPO . "
In 2004 , Google used a variation of a Dutch auction for its IPO ; Brin and Page loved that the process leveled the playing field between small investors and powerful brokerage houses .
And in 2008 , the company could n't resist participating in the FCC 's auction to reallocate portions of the radio spectrum .
Google even uses auctions for internal operations , like allocating servers among its various business units .
Since moving a product 's storage and computation to a new data center is disruptive , engineers often put it off .
" I suggested we run an auction similar to what the airlines do when they oversell a flight .
They keep offering bigger vouchers until enough customers give up their seats , " Varian says .
" In our case , we offer more machines in exchange for moving to new servers .
One group might do it for 50 new ones , another for 100 , and another wo n't move unless we give them 300 .
So we give them to the lowest bidder — they get their extra capacity , and we get computation shifted to the new data center . "
The transition to an all - auction sales model was a milestone for Google , ensuring that its entire revenue engine would run with the same computer - science fervor as its search operation .
Now , when Google recruits alpha geeks , it is just as likely to have them focus on AdWords as on search or apps .
The across - the - board emphasis on engineering , mathematical formulas , and data - mining has made Google a new kind of company .
But to fully understand why , you have to go back and look under AdWords ' hood .
Most people think of the Google ad auction as a straightforward affair .
In fact , there 's a key component that few users know about and even sophisticated advertisers do n't fully understand .
The bids themselves are only a part of what ultimately determines the auction winners .
The other major determinant is something called the quality score .
This metric strives to ensure that the ads Google shows on its results page are true , high - caliber matches for what users are querying .
If they are n't , the whole system suffers and Google makes less money .
Google determines quality scores by calculating multiple factors , including the relevance of the ad to the specific keyword or keywords , the quality of the landing page the ad is linked to , and , above all , the percentage of times users actually click on a given ad when it appears on a results page .
( Other factors , Google wo n't even discuss . )
There 's also a penalty invoked when the ad quality is too low — in such cases , the company slaps a minimum bid on the advertiser .
Google explains that this practice — reviled by many companies affected by it — protects users from being exposed to irrelevant or annoying ads that would sour people on sponsored links in general .
Several lawsuits have been filed by would - be advertisers who claim that they are victims of an arbitrary process by a quasi monopoly .
You can argue about fairness , but arbitrary it ain't .
To figure out the quality score , Google needs to estimate in advance how many users will click on an ad .
That 's very tricky , especially since we 're talking about billions of auctions .
But since the ad model depends on predicting clickthroughs as perfectly as possible , the company must quantify and analyze every twist and turn of the data .
Susan Wojcicki , who oversees Google 's advertising , refers to it as " the physics of clicks . "
During Varian 's second summer in Mountain View , when he was still coming in only a day or two a week , he asked a recently hired computer scientist from Stanford named Diane Tang to create the Google equivalent of the Consumer Price Index , called the Keyword Pricing Index .
" Instead of a basket of goods like diapers and beer and doughnuts , we have keywords , " says Tang , who is known internally as the Queen of Clicks .
The Keyword Pricing Index is a reality check .
It alerts Google to any anomalous price bubbles , a sure sign that an auction is n't working properly .
Categories are ranked by the cost per click that advertisers generally have to pay , weighted by distribution , and then separated into three bundles : high cap , mid cap , and low cap .
" The high caps are very competitive keywords , like ' flowers ' and ' hotels , ' " Tang says .
In the mid-cap realm you have keywords that may vary seasonally — the price to place ads alongside results for " snowboarding " skyrockets during the winter .
Low caps like " Massachusetts buggy whips " are the stuff of long tails .
Tang 's index is just one example of a much broader effort .
As the amount of data at the company 's disposal grows , the opportunities to exploit it multiply , which ends up further extending the range and scope of the Google economy .
So it 's utterly essential to calculate correctly the quality scores that prop up AdWords .
" The people working for me are generally econometricians — sort of a cross between statisticians and economists , " says Varian , who moved to Google full - time in 2007 ( he's on leave from Berkeley ) and leads two teams , one of them focused on analysis .
" Google needs mathematical types that have a rich tool set for looking for signals in noise , " says statistician Daryl Pregibon , who joined Google in 2003 after 23 years as a top scientist at Bell Labs and AT&T Labs .
" The rough rule of thumb is one statistician for every 100 computer scientists . "
Keywords and click rates are their bread and butter .
" We are trying to understand the mechanisms behind the metrics , " says Qing Wu , one of Varian 's minions .
His specialty is forecasting , so now he predicts patterns of queries based on the season , the climate , international holidays , even the time of day .
" We have temperature data , weather data , and queries data , so we can do correlation and statistical modeling , " Wu says .
The results all feed into Google 's backend system , helping advertisers devise more - efficient campaigns .
To track and test their predictions ,
Wu and his colleagues use dozens of onscreen dashboards that continuously stream information , a sort of Bloomberg terminal for the Googlesphere .
Wu checks obsessively to see whether reality is matching the forecasts : " With a dashboard , you can monitor the queries , the amount of money you make , how many advertisers you have , how many keywords they 're bidding on , what the rate of return is for each advertiser . "
Wu calls Google " the barometer of the world . "
Indeed , studying the clicks is like looking through a window with a panoramic view of everything .
You can see the change of seasons — clicks gravitating toward skiing and heavy clothes in winter , bikinis and sunscreen in summer — and you can track who 's up and down in pop culture .
Most of us remember news events from television or newspapers ; Googlers recall them as spikes in their graphs .
" One of the big things a few years ago was the SARS epidemic , " Tang says .
Wu did n't even have to read the papers to know about the financial meltdown — he saw the jump in people Googling for gold .
And since prediction and analysis are so crucial to AdWords , every bit of data , no matter how seemingly trivial , has potential value .
Since Google hired Varian , other companies , like Yahoo , have decided that they , too , must have a chief economist heading a division that scrutinizes auctions , dashboards , and econometric models to fine - tune their business plan .
In 2007 , Harvard economist Susan Athey was surprised to get a summons to Redmond to meet with Steve Ballmer .
" That 's a call you take , " she says .
Athey spent last year working in Microsoft 's Cambridge , Massachusetts , office .
Can the rest of the world be far behind ?
Although Eric Schmidt does n't think it will happen as quickly as some believe , he does think that Google - style auctions are applicable to all sorts of transactions .
The solution to the glut in auto inventory ?
Put the entire supply of unsold cars up for bid .
That 'll clear out the lot .
Housing , too : " People use auctions now in cases of distress , like auctioning a house when there are no buyers , " Schmidt says .
" But you can imagine a situation in which it was a normal and routine way of doing things . "
Varian believes that a new era is dawning for what you might call the datarati — and it's all about harnessing supply and demand .
" What 's ubiquitous and cheap ? " Varian asks .
" Data . "
And what is scarce ?
The analytic ability to utilize that data .
As a result , he believes that the kind of technical person who once would have wound up working for a hedge fund on Wall Street will now work at a firm whose business hinges on making smart , daring choices — decisions based on surprising results gleaned from algorithmic spelunking and executed with the confidence that comes from really doing the math .
It 's a satisfying development for Varian , a guy whose career as an economist was inspired by a sci - fi novel he read in junior high .
" In Isaac Asimov 's first Foundation Trilogy , there was a character who basically constructed mathematical models of society , and I thought this was a really exciting idea .
When I went to college , I looked around for that subject .
It turned out to be economics . "
Varian is telling this story from his pied - è0 - Plex , where he sometimes stays during the week to avoid driving the 40 - some miles from Google headquarters to his home in the East Bay .
It happens to be the ranch - style house , which Google now owns , where Brin and Page started the company .
There 's a wild contrast between this sparsely furnished residence and what it has spawned — dozens of millionaire geeks , billions of auctions , and new ground rules for businesses in a data - driven society that is far weirder than the one Asimov envisioned nearly 60 years ago .
What could be more baffling than a capitalist corporation that gives away its best services , does n't set the prices for the ads that support it , and turns away customers because their ads do n't measure up to its complex formulas ?
Varian , of course , knows that his employer 's success is not the result of inspired craziness but of an early recognition that the Internet rewards fanatical focus on scale , speed , data analysis , and customer satisfaction .
( A bit of auction theory does n't hurt , either . )
Today we have a name for those rules : Googlenomics .
Learn them , or pay the price .

Chris Kramer decided to do something different during summer holidays and what he ended up was building an Egyptian themed computer mod .
He used some really specialized jewelry metal working , lapidary skills which involve gemstone cutting and polishing , stone working , several dozen pounds of limestone tiles and a stuffed dog in order to create an authentic Egyptian themed case mod that transports us back to the days of pharaohs and hieroglyphics .
The idea was not to create something highly technical but something that is artistic and drool worthy , and hence the only geek components that went into the project were some components and a computer system board .
He recreated partially the Tutankhamen chariot scene and in order to get some authentic hieroglyphic text , he used several passages from E. A. Wallis Budge ’s “ The Egyptian book of the Dead ” .
With some amazing LED lights , jewelry , Egyptian art and painting , the case looks almost like Queen Cleopatra ’s armoire and the computer that sits within it is almost a juxtaposition of cultures .
The stuffed dog sits regally over the case as if it is guarding a new kind tomb .
He used an i945 GTm - VHL Core Solo / Duo 479 ATX Motherboard , a low - power Mobile Intel Core Solo or Core Duo socket 479 CPU , two 1GB DDR2 SO - DIMM memory modules , and runs on Windows XP Media Center Edition .
His case mod would make your gaming computer fit enough for a pharaoh to play if he were to be brought back to life from the ancient tombs of Egypt , in the burning deserts of a mysterious and magical land .
If you are not interested in glorious histories and cultures , you could indulge in base
thoughts by checking out the French Maid Case Mod .

This is a shot of German troops surrendering to Americans during World War Two .
At the end of that war , German soldiers were so desperate to surrender to the Americans or the British that they actually fought to break out of areas on the Eastern Front just so they would n’t have to surrender to the Russians .
They knew that inhumane treatment , a long train ride to Siberia , and a likely miserable death awaited them if they did n’t make it .
This also worked out well for us , because it meant that we , as Americans , had a much easier time in Germany than the Russians did .
The Russians -- battling men who were literally fighting for their lives during the push to Berlin - - suffered 80,000 troops killed .
On the Western Front , however , U.S. forces never faced that level of resistance .
Once upon a time , America was known around the world for its powerful , benevolent nature when handling captured enemy fighters .
Even our adversaries knew they could hoist the white flag and expect to be treated humanely .
In turn , this made them more likely to give up sooner .
And it not only kept American soldiers out of countless bloody fights , but it made victory and success all that much easier for our troops .
For years , rank and file soldiers and insurgents around the world viewed surrender to the Americans as a reasonable option when finding themselves outgunned .
And then we went and did this :
Now , our opponents wo n’t feel secure in surrendering to U.S. forces .
In fact , I would n’t expect to see images like those of the surrendering soldiers above for decades .
It ’s just not going to happen anymore .
If a hot war breaks out in Iran , North Korea , Pakistan , or anywhere else , we can expect to face an enemy that simply wo n’t accept surrender .
No Taliban fighter , no starving North Korean soldier in his right mind will surrender willingly if he thinks he ’s going to be tortured or beaten to death .
Instead , he ’ll prefer a fight to the death , even as he becomes cornered .
And this will get Americans killed .
This is what Bush administration torture policies have wrought .
We no longer hold the moral high ground .
We borrowed against it in an effort to get a few false confessions from Khalid Sheikh Mohamed , Abu Zubaydah , and others .
And the next time we face an organized fighting force in the field , the cost of doing so will become readily apparent .
Not only does torture not work , but it directly endangers our troops fighting now .

In Section 7.9.2 of Real - Time Rendering , we discussed deferred rendering approaches , including “ partially - deferred ” methods where some subset of shader properties are written to buffers .
Since publication , a particular type of partially - deferred method has gained some popularity .
There are a few different variants of this approach that are worth discussing ; more details “ under the fold ” .
First , I ’ll briefly discuss the “ classic ” or “ full ” deferred shading approach .
For this discussion , I will assume a shading equation which looks like this :
The equation uses the notation from our book .
It means that the output radiance from a surface point in the view direction ( in other words , the pixel color ) is equal to a sum over n point / directional light sources .
For each light source , the summed quantity is the result of a shading function which depends on ( in order of appearance ) the light intensity / color at that surface point , the light direction vector , the view vector , the normal vector , the diffuse surface color , the specular surface color , and a specular spread factor such as a Blinn - Phong cosine power .
This equation does not include any ambient or environmental lighting terms – those are handled separately in deferred shading systems .
The two quantities that vary per light are the direction vector l and the intensity / color B L .
In game engine terms , B L is equal to the light color times its intensity times the distance attenuation factor at the shaded point ( in the book , we use E L ; the two are related thus : B L =E L /π ) .
B L is an RGB - valued , HDR quantity ( as opposed to RGB - valued quantities like c diff or c spec whose values are restricted to lie between 0 and 1 ) .
Given this shading equation , deferred shading is typically applied in the following phases :
Render opaque scene geometry , writing normal vector , diffuse color , specular color , and specular spread factor into a deep frame buffer or G - Buffer .
Since these will not fit into a single render target , this requires multi-render - target ( MRT ) support .
Write ambient or environment lighting results into an additional accumulation buffer .
Apply the effects of light sources by rendering 2D or 3D shapes covering each light ’s area of effect ( this relies on lights having a finite area of effect – true for most lights used in real - time applications , although not strictly physically correct ) .
Non-local light sources such as the Sun are applied in full - screen passes .
When rendering each “ light shape ” , evaluate the shading equation for that light , reading the G - Buffer channels as textures .
Accumulate the results of the shading equation into the accumulation buffer , using additive blending .
The depth - buffer from phase # 1 is typically used to find the world - or view - space position of each shaded point .
This position is used to compute light distance attenuation and to lookup any shadow maps .
Render any semitransparent geometry using non-deferred shading .
The results are in principle equivalent to the traditional , non-deferred shading approach ( in practice buffer range and precision issues may cause artifacts ) .
Notably , full deferred shading is used in Killzone 2 as well as the upcoming Starcraft II .
There are several downsides to this approach – the G - Buffer consumes a lot of storage and bandwidth , and the application is restricted to the same shading equation everywhere on the screen .
Handling multi-sample anti-aliasing ( MSAA ) can also be difficult .
However , deferred shading also has significant advantages ; it solves the light combinatorial problem , and most importantly , it reduces light computation to the absolute minimum ( each light is only computed for those pixels that it actually affects ) .
By generalizing the idea of deferred rendering , storage and bandwidth usage can be considerably reduced .
Any sub-expression of a shading equation can be rendered into a buffer and used in a later pass .
One of the most common approaches utilizes the fact that many shading equations have separate diffuse and specular terms , each modulated by a color :
The symbol that looks like an “ x ” inside a circle is another bit of notation from our book ; it denotes a piecewise vector ( in this case , RGB ) multiplication .
This structure is utilized by a partial deferred shading approach which is most commonly called deferred lighting .
Deferred lighting is applied in the following phases :
Render opaque scene geometry , writing normal vector n and specular spread factor m into a buffer .
This “ n /m buffer ” is similar to a G - Buffer but contains less information .
The values fit into a single output color buffer , so MRT support is not needed .
Render “ light shapes ” , evaluating diffuse and specular shading equations and writing the results into separate specular and diffuse accumulation buffers .
This can be done in a single pass ( using MRT ) , or in two separate passes .
Environment and ambient lighting can be accumulated in this phase with a full - screen pass .
Render opaque scene geometry a second time , reading the diffuse and specular accumulation buffers from textures , modulating them with the diffuse and specular colors and writing the end result into the final color buffer .
If not accumulated in the previous phase , environment and ambient lighting are applied in this phase .
Render any semitransparent geometry using non-deferred shading .
This is equivalent to refactoring the shading equation thus :
Or , looking separately at the accumulation phase :
and the reconstruction phase :
This technique was first described in a GDC 2004 presentation by Rich Geldreich , Matt Pritchard , and John Brooks .
It was used in Naughty Dog ‘s Uncharted : Drake ’s Fortune , and Insomniac ‘s Resistance 2 .
Insomniac detailed their development in an internal presentation , and described the final system in a recent GDC talk .
Crytek also adopted this approach in CryEngine 3 .
Compared to a full deferred shading approach , this has some advantages .
It can be used on older hardware that does not support MRT , the processing for each light is cheaper , and bandwidth and storage requirements are much reduced .
Some variation in shading equations is also possible , by replacing c diff or c spec with various expressions .
A variant on this technique renders a full G - Buffer in phase # 1 , and then applies the specular and diffuse colors to the accumulation buffers in a full - screen pass in phase # 3 instead of rendering the opaque geometry a second time .
I believe S.T.A.L.K.E.R. : Clear
Sky uses this variant .
Storage and bandwidth requirements can be further reduced by compacting the separate diffuse and specular RGB accumulation buffers into a single RGBA buffer ( reducing the number of distinct color channels used from 6 to 4 ) .
The CryEngine 3 presentation also discusses this approach .
They accumulate the full RGB diffuse term , but only the luminance of the specular term ( into the alpha channel ) .
The specular chromaticity information is discarded , and the chromaticity of the diffuse term is used to approximate that of the specular term .
This is plausible , but not 100 % correct – imagine a red light source and a green light source shining onto a surface from different directions .
The diffuse term will be yellow , but the specular term should have two separate highlights – one red and one green .
With this approximation , both highlights will be yellow .
This can be seen in one of the images from the CryEngine 3 presentation , used here with Crytek ‘s kind permission :
In an appendix at the end of this post , I give some details on a possible implementation of 4 - channel deferred lighting .
Deferred lighting ( especially the 4 - channel variant ) is somewhat like the light pre-pass approach developed by Wolfgang Engel ( described on his blog and in two chapters of the recently released ShaderX7 book ) .
The idea of a light pre-pass has helped inspire much of the recent work on deferred lighting , and the two techniques are broadly similar .
However , the details show some significant differences .
The basic “ G - Buffer ” given in ShaderX7 contains only the surface normal n .
Since the specular spread m is not available during the accumulation phase , some other specular spread value ( either fixed or derived from the light source ) is used , and the value of m is applied in the reconstruction phase .
Since there is no way to do this correctly ( specular terms have nonlinear dependence on m ) , a number of variant shading models are given to approximate the desired result .
These are ad hoc and each has drawbacks ; for example , at least one ( equation 8.5.6 ) has lights affecting each other ’s attenuated intensity contribution , instead of each light having its own independent , additive effect .
In my opinion , the deferred lighting approach that also stores the specular spread in the initial pass is vastly preferable , especially since m adds only a byte to each pixel in the G - Buffer .
The shading controls have a physical basis , control is straightforward , and the algorithm is efficient and compact .
Appendix A – Four - Channel Deferred Lighting Implementation
The Crytek presentation does not explain exactly how the specular is reconstructed .
The most correct method would probably be to transform the accumulated diffuse lighting into a space like CIELUV , apply the diffuse chromaticity to the accumulated specular luminance , and transform the result into RGB .
That would be quite expensive ; a cheaper method would be to divide the accumulated RGB diffuse term by its luminance and multiply by the accumulated specular luminance .
Again looking separately at the accumulation phase :
and the reconstruction phase :
The epsilon in the denominator is a very small value put there to avoid divides by zero .
The function lum ( ) converts an RGB value into its luminance ; it computes a simple weighted average of the R , G and B channels .
If the RGB quantity is in linear space , and the RGB primaries are those used in standard monitors and televisions , then the equation is :
This method of reconstructing specular should produce the correct result with one light , and will preserve the correct specular luminance with multiple lights .
Appendix B – Deferred Lighting with Example Shading Model
It is interesting to see how this discussion applies to a specific shading model .
I will use a physically based model from Chapter 7 of our book :
The half - vector h is a vector halfway between the light vector l and the view vector v ; to compute it , just add the two and normalize the result .
The underlined dot notation is not from RTR3 , it ’s something I just made up to concisely express the commonly - used “ clamped dot product ” , which is a dot product with negative values clamped to 0 .
R F is the Fresnel reflectance function ; it modifies the material ’s characteristic specular color c spec towards white as the dot product of l and h goes from 1 to 0 .
Unfortunately , this shading equation is not in the right form for deferred lighting , due to the Fresnel function modifying the specular color for each light .
A solution to this is to use a different dot product in the Fresnel function ; the dot product of v and n instead of that of l and h .
This is not strictly correct , but it is a reasonable approximation ( the two dot products are equal in the middle of the specular highlight ) and it makes the specular color invariant over light sources , which lets us refactor this equation into the form needed for deferred lighting :
( here I ’ve used the Schlick approximation to R F to compute a modified specular color )
Although a Fresnel term results in more realistic shading than a constant specular color , it does have one downside for deferred lighting .
It requires accessing the n/m buffer in phase # 3 , slightly increasing bandwidth usage and restricting opportunities for reusing the buffer .
If this is a concern , the Fresnel function can be replaced with a constant specular color .
The North American anime distributor Funimation has issued a new statement in regards to the leak of One Piece episode 403 :
As anime fans know , FUNimation Entertainment and Toei Animation had planned for the first ever online simulcast of the series ‘ One Piece ’ tonight at 9:00 pm CDT . , just one hour after its premiere on Japan 's Fuji Television .
Unfortunately , in the last 24 hours we have determined that the FUNimation servers were compromised , even though we employ strict security standards .
An unknown individual accessed and posted episode 403 online and as a direct result of this illegal act , all U.S. and Canadian fans will be deprived of access to this great anime series for the immediate future .
We will make every effort to locate and prosecute the perpetrator (s ) to the fullest extent of the law and will provide updates regarding this most serious matter .
Funimation has also replaced the original statement on its website — which less specifically stated that One Piece was not available due to technical issues — with the above statement .
At this time there is no further information as to if , or when , the One Piece simulcast will start .
Update : One Piece has also been removed from Hulu ( Google Cache ) .
Hulu was set to offer subtitled One Piece episodes seven days after the Japanese broadcast ( Funimation 's simulcast was to be delayed by only 1 hour ) .
Hulu had acquired One Piece from Toei , not Funimation .
Update 2 : One Piece has also been removed from Joost ( cached ) .
Although Joost has not removed it 's One Piece page , the episodes have been removed and replaced with the message " Sorry , this channel is not available in your country . "
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz gave its reporters the day off and asked novelists and poets to report the news for a special edition in honor of Hebrew Book Week .
The results were lovely :
Among those articles were gems like the stock market summary , by author Avri Herling .
It went like this : " Everything 's okay .
Everything 's like usual .
Yesterday trading ended .
Everything 's okay .
The economists went to their homes , the laundry is drying on the lines , dinners are waiting in place …
Dow Jones traded steadily and closed with 8,761 points , Nasdaq added 0.9 % to a level of 1,860 points … .
The guy from the shakshuka [ an Israeli egg - and - tomato dish ] shop raised his prices again … . "
The TV review by Eshkol Nevo opened with these words : " I did n't watch TV yesterday . "
And the weather report was a poem by Roni Somek , titled " Summer Sonnet . "
( " Summer is the pencil / that is least sharp / in the seasons ' pencil case . " )
News junkies might call this a postmodern farce , but considering that the stock market wo n't be soaring anytime soon , and that " hot " is really the only weather forecast there is during Israeli summers , who 's to say these articles are n't factual ?

( CNN ) --
The Republican Party is in need of a leader and boost in its self - esteem , a new poll suggests .
A new poll indicates there is no clear leader of the Republican Party .
Nearly half ( 47 percent ) of Republicans and Republican - leaning independents surveyed in a USA Today / Gallup Poll failed to come up with a single name when asked who is the party 's spokesperson .
Of the names that were mentioned , radio host Rush Limbaugh and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich received the most nods .
Each was named by 10 percent of Republicans as the voice of their party .
Former Vice President Dick Cheney was close behind , at 9 percent .
Among Democrats and Democratic - leaning independents surveyed , just 17 failed to identify a party spokesperson .
Sixty - seven percent of Democrats surveyed named President Obama as main person who speaks for their party .
Republicans have been forced to rebuild after suffering demoralizing losses in 2006 and 2008 .
Democrats control the White House , both chambers of Congress and also hold more gubernatorial seats .
The blows seem to have taken a toll on the party .
A third of Republicans surveyed said they have an unfavorable view of the GOP .
The Democrats , on the other hand , see themselves in a better light .
Just 4 percent of Democrats said they have an unfavorable view of their party .
While the numbers sound bad for Republicans , Republican consultant and former executive director of the Republican Governors Association Phil Musser said such polling is natural coming off eight years in the White House .
" Does it stress me out that polling today suggests that Rush Limbaugh or Newt Gingrich or Dick Cheney are kind of the leaders of the GOP ?
Not really .
At the end of the day , none of them are going to be the Republican nominee for president , " Musser said .
A national leader for the GOP likely wo n't emerge until Republicans cross the bridge of 2010 , he said .
" But the good news is , there are a lot of really bright stars in the Republican Party , " he said .
" What we need to do tactically now is figure out how we unite the constellation of Republican leaders around the country to help promote a more coherent and ideas - oriented , positive vision for the future of our country . "
Without the megaphone of the White House , that 's a challenge , Musser said , but he said he has hope in the next generation of Republican leadership .
Mark Preston , CNN 's political editor , said the new polling indicates that the Republican Party could face some bumps in the road as they try to move forward .
" These numbers are troubling for Republicans , who are engaged in a civil war right over the ideological direction of the party , " said CNN Political Editor Mark Preston .
" When one - third of Republicans hold an unfavorable view of the party , it makes it difficult to establish a united front to promote GOP policies at the same time opposing President Obama 's agenda . "
Musser agreed that these numbers are more problematic for the GOP , and he said the party must do three things to regroup :
Change the tone to be more welcoming and positive , especially toward the Latino community and African American community
Get the younger voters excited about the Republican Party 's message
Change the way they communicate and invest more in technology
" We need to be smarter about how we deliver our message and adopt the playbook essentially that 's has been owned by the left -- about how we build grassroots movements using new and innovative technology standards , " he said .
" The bottom line is , most of this is just a hangover from the Bush years .
As the saying goes , time heals all wounds , " he added .

All About Republican Party • Rush Limbaugh • Newt Gingrich • Dick Cheney
Howard Hughes , whose acumen outside certain areas of expertise ( aeronautics and the acquisition of beautiful actresses ) was rarely sound , once said something intelligent about the relative merits of two movie directors .
The remark was delivered in early 1939 , when George Cukor had been shooting “ Gone with the Wind ” for about three weeks .
An adaptation of Margaret Mitchell ’s thousand - page blockbuster novel , from 1936 , about the Old South , the Civil War , and Reconstruction , the movie was the largest and most expensive production in Hollywood up to that time , with a huge cast , massive sets ( the city of Atlanta was burned down and then rebuilt ) , and hundreds of unshaven and bandaged extras trudging across the landscape .
As half of Hollywood maliciously cheered , the production slipped into disaster .
The script could be kindly described as a mess , and the star — Clark Gable — was in turmoil .
The initial rushes displeased David O. Selznick , the legendary , manic producer who dominated every aspect of the film , and he suddenly fired Cukor , who , he later said , could n’t have handled the more spectacular elements of the movie .
In Cukor ’s place , Selznick hired Victor Fleming , who was then directing the other big picture in town , “ The Wizard of Oz . ” Fleming was a vigorous and resourceful man , but few people considered him an artist .
The change pleased Gable but distressed the two female leads — the young stage and film actress Vivien Leigh , just arrived from England and not yet a star , and Olivia de Havilland , who was then Howard Hughes ’s girlfriend .
Both women depended on Cukor , who was known as a “ woman ’s director , ” and de Havilland brought her troubles to Hughes , who advised : “ Do n’t worry , everything is going to be all right — with George and Victor , it ’s the same talent , only Victor ’s is strained through a coarser sieve . ”
Hughes was almost correct .
Fleming ’s talent was not “ the same ” as Cukor ’s , yet he was definitely the right man for “ Gone with the Wind , ” and he did inventive and powerful work on “ Oz . ”
But in the seventy years since the release of those films , Fleming , whose talent flowed not smoothly or subtly , but roughly , in surges of energy and feeling , has been largely forgotten .
The auteur - theory critics who , in the nineteen - sixties and seventies , went wild over Cukor , Hitchcock , Preminger , John Ford , Howard Hawks , Ernst Lubitsch , Josef von Sternberg , Frank Capra , and many other directors of the late silent and early sound periods , ignored Fleming , though he had made a number of entertaining movies in the nineteen - twenties and thirties and his two super - productions of 1939 are very likely the most widely seen movies in American film history — not just good pictures but films that have entered the unconscious of generations of moviegoers .
“ Gone with the Wind , ” with its happy plantation slaves — emblems of Noble Toil — posed against reddening skies , has its enraging and embarrassing moments ; the racist kitsch is , regrettably , part of the nation ’s collective past .
What remains remarkably modern in the film is the central combat of wills between Leigh ’s Scarlett O’Hara and Gable ’s Rhett Butler , each seeking the upper hand in and out of bed .
Margaret Mitchell set up the conflict , but it was Fleming who got the two actors to embody it .
As for “ The Wizard of Oz , ” the movie ’s version of the magical land of Oz , in its combined freedom and unease , happiness and fear , has become a universally shared vision of the imagination itself .
Since Fleming was the element common to both movies , it ’s time for his contribution to be lifted out of the shadows .
The seventieth anniversary of these two classics has seen deluxe new ( and expensive ) versions on DVD , and the appearance of two good books : “ Victor Fleming : An American Movie Master ” ( Pantheon ; $ 40 ) , a full - scale biography that shines up the director ’s reputation , by Michael Sragow , the film critic of the Baltimore Sun , who has written for this magazine ; and “ Frankly , My Dear : ‘ Gone with the Wind ’ Revisited ” ( Yale ; $ 24 ) , by Molly Haskell , whose 1973 study “ From Reverence to Rape ” remains a standard text on women in movies .
Haskell has lived in Manhattan for more than forty years , but she grew up in Richmond , Virginia , and as a girl she became obsessed with Margaret Mitchell ’s rebellious Southern belle , Scarlett , as personified in the movie by Leigh — a selfish , greedy , flirtatious yet sex- hating , intractable green - eyed demon who is every inch and flounce a heroine .
When summoned by Selznick , Fleming had n’t read Mitchell ’s novel , but he took a look at the screenplay and immediately told the producer , “ Your fucking script is no fucking good . ”
Selznick had owned the property since the book ’s publication , and in 1936 he had hired the East Coast playwright and screenwriter Sidney Howard to do an adaptation .
Howard turned in a faithful but overlong version , and Selznick began fiddling .
At one time or another , as many as fifteen writers worked on the movie , until finally , in early 1939 , as production stalled and hundreds of salaried people sat around idle , Selznick turned to Ben Hecht , the greatest and most cynical of Hollywood screenwriters .
Hecht agreed to work on the script as long as he did n’t have to read the book .
Selznick told him the plot , but he could n’t make any sense of it , so Selznick retrieved Howard ’s version , and , as Hecht listened , Selznick and Fleming read it aloud , Selznick taking the role of Scarlett , Fleming reading Rhett .
In this manner , the three men worked eighteen or twenty hours a day , sustained by Dexedrine , peanuts , and bananas , a combination that Selznick believed would stimulate the creative process .
On the fourth day , according to Hecht , a blood vessel burst in Fleming ’s eye .
On the fifth , Selznick , eating a banana , swooned , and had to be revived by a doctor .
Many good Hollywood movies have been saved by last - minute revisions , but this ill - fed , hazardous , all - male acting - and - writing marathon must be the strangest of all interventions .
Oddly , it may also provide a key to the movie ’s success : Selznick , an epic ( and often hapless ) Hollywood womanizer , nevertheless had , Molly Haskell claims , genuine and delicate insights into women ’s feelings , and , in some crucial way ( strengthened , perhaps , by his reading her part ) , he identified with Scarlett .
Fleming , tall , strong , and startlingly handsome —
Selznick ruefully called him “ the most attractive man , in my opinion , who ever came to Hollywood ” — did not chase women ; they chased him .
The director was considered by everyone to be a “ man ’s man ” — shrewd , funny , but bluff and demanding — and he was close in temperament to the hard - nosed character of Rhett Butler .
It ’s possible that the extraordinary balance between Scarlett and Rhett was sealed at this moment .
Gable had been worried all along about his ability to play Rhett , an emotionally demanding role , and he yearned for Fleming ’s support .
He had worked with him before , in 1932 — in the deliciously entertaining sex - in - the - jungle romantic drama “ Red Dust , ” in which he co-starred with Jean Harlow — and he had taken a lot from Fleming ’s manner of brusque masculine humor .
Cukor , however , as people noted at the time , made Gable nervous and angry .
Gable was afraid that Cukor might swing the movie toward its actresses , especially Vivien Leigh .
In recent years , a more piquant speculation has surfaced : that Gable , in his early days in Hollywood , had been a gigolo and had had a few gay encounters .
In this telling , someone in Cukor ’s circle had been gossiping about Gable ’s past , and Gable , jealous of his reputation as the hetero “ king ” of Hollywood , grew alarmed .
Fleming ’s presence restored the star ’s self - assurance .
After Hecht edited Sidney Howard ’s script ( in the end , Howard got sole credit ) , the production got under way again , and Gable , once more imitating Fleming ’s manner ( Sragow calls the director “ the real Rhett Butler ” ) , wound up doing the best , most expressive acting of his career .
The actresses did well , too .
De Havilland provided the movie with a moral center , and Leigh , though hardly fond of Fleming , gave one of the most electrifying performances in the history of movies .
As Fleming pulled together Selznick ’s monster production during the day , he supervised the editing of “ The Wizard of Oz ” at night .
He may have been an artist after all .
Victor Fleming ’s mother was of Pennsylvania Dutch extraction ( the longtime Hollywood rumor that Fleming was part Cherokee is nothing more than that ) ; his father was from Missouri .
The family went west , and Fleming was born , in 1889 , near Pasadena , then a hamlet so primitive that his father , a citrus rancher , helped lay the public water - supply system .
He died of a heart attack , in a familymanaged orange orchard , when Fleming was four .
Years later , the director wrote , “ There is little room in my life for sentiment and soft words , ” which is the kind of statement that tough American men in the nineteen - twenties and thirties often made to cover a deeper current of feeling .
Dropping out of school in his mid-teens , Fleming became fascinated by speed and by the new machines that produced it , cars and airplanes , as well as by the new machine that captured it , the motion - picture camera .
In his early twenties , he briefly tried his hand at car - racing , but wound up a chauffeur in Santa Barbara , where he fell in with the pioneer movie director Allan Dwan .
Taking over as a cameraman on Dwan ’s films , Fleming found a trade .
A photograph of him from this period reveals an almost unnervingly forceful young man with hostile eyes and a wedged pompadour .
He looks less like a movie person than like a young officer out of uniform .
By 1915 , he was shooting the films that Dwan made with Douglas Fairbanks , and , four years later , Fleming became Fairbanks ’s director .
They made just three movies together —
“ When the Clouds Roll By ” ( 1919 ) , “ The Mollycoddle ” ( 1920 ) , and the mock documentary “ Around the World in Eighty Minutes ” ( 1931 ) — but they became lifelong friends .
Fairbanks ’s movies often had a satirical bent : the smiling young man , throwing himself around the set and showing off his skills as a gymnast , outraged the boors and the stuffed shirts .
Off the set , the two men carried on in the same way .
They jumped over chairs and couches in hotel lobbies , swung through trains by holding onto overhead racks ; they leaped from a twelve - foot height ( in one version of the story , from a burning hayloft ) , first Fleming and then Fairbanks , and each broke an ankle .
In the early twenties , Fleming became close to Howard Hawks , and , in the same spirit of macho competitiveness , they took up aviation , building and flying ramshackle planes that smashed their landing gear on hitting the ground .
The risk - taking shenanigans , the strenuous , dangerous fun , were an essential part of the carefree ethos that found its way into countless movies and that formed , for better or worse , a good part of the American masculine ideal in the twentieth century .
Sragow is immensely attentive to Fleming ’s films , and he traces in detail the fortunes of all the people connected to them , but his book is held together by what can only be called the romance of movie - making in the studio era — the large , free , hard - drinking life that the men ( but rarely the women ) enjoyed when movies were still made quickly and relatively cheaply , craft was spoken of with respect , and art was barely mentioned .
Some of the episodes in Fleming ’s life play like scenes from the movies of the time — for instance , his killing a charging rhinoceros in East Africa an instant before it slammed into one of his friends .
Or his showing up with a case of Scotch after the alcoholic Spencer Tracy had gone on a bender and had failed to report to the set of Fleming ’s 1937 film “ Captains Courageous . ”
According to Tracy , Fleming told him to drink up the entire case — he was through with worrying about him .
Abashed , Tracy sobered up and got back to work .
Fleming , in effect , administered the reviving smack that figured in so many movies of the period ( including his own ) — the slap across the kisser that brought people to their senses .
As Sragow points out , Fleming had learned something essential from his capering association with Douglas Fairbanks — how to position a performer within the frame and time his performance in such a way that the camera brought out his temperament and his strength .
This would seem an essential skill for any filmmaker , yet a surprising number of directors , obsessed with visual expressiveness , are inattentive to it .
Fleming did n’t give detailed instructions to his actors ; rather , he talked about the character , and located and enlarged a set of defining traits — a strain of feeling or humor — in whomever he was working with .
Then the actors , working intimately for the camera , performed what in effect were idealized versions of themselves , creating a persona that connected with a widespread public fantasy .
Fleming , along with such directors as Ford and William Wyler , had the star - making skill that Hollywood has now lost .
It was Fleming , directing the canonical Western “ The Virginian ” ( 1929 ) , who shifted Gary Cooper ’s minimalist stoicism into a subtly but steadily revealing undercurrent of emotion .
In “ Captains Courageous , ” he helped Tracy focus his threatening manner into a single strong shaft of feeling with the slightly off - center rhythm that became Tracy ’s signature .
Gable , Cooper , and Tracy all produced variations on the ideal of a courageous , goodhumored American male , and they all borrowed , to some degree , from Fleming .
What they found in him was ease and authority .
What women found in him , apart from good looks , fun , and romance ( he had affairs with many of his actresses , including Clara Bow and Norma Shearer ) , was a current of self - confidence that they could draw on .
“ Despite his later reputation as a ‘ man ’s director , ’ ” Sragow says , “ Fleming launched or cannily revamped a host of female stars from the 1920s on . ”
The hot - wired Bow did her sexiest , best work for him , in “ Mantrap ” ( 1926 ) , and he got sensationally funny performances out of Jean Harlow in “ Red Dust , ” “ Bombshell ” ( 1933 ) , and “ Reckless ” ( 1935 ) .
The sacred male companionships of seventy years ago did not have the effect of downgrading women — anything but .
Fleming , along with his friend
Hawks , created women onscreen who were resourceful , strong - willed , and sexual — the kind of women they wanted to hang out with , partners and equals who gave as good as they got .
For a while , they , too , were an American ideal .

The auteurist critics look for recurring patterns , the incandescent joining of visual style and idea .
You ca n’t find such patterns , or even a consistent visual motif , in Fleming ’s movies .
But you can find a powerful grasp of fable — the emotional progression of a small number of clearly drawn characters through a decisively shaped tale , leading to a series of wrenching encounters and a satisfying climax .
In “ Captains Courageous , ” a brilliant but snotty American rich kid ( Freddie Bartholomew ) falls off an ocean liner .
Tracy ’s Portuguese fisherman pulls him out of the sea and throws him in with the crew of his trawler , who knock him into shape .
As Sragow points out , what the boy becomes is not a decent jolly fellow but the superior young man he was bred to become .
The movie is less sentimental than it at first appears , as was Fleming ’s “ Treasure Island ” ( 1934 ) , starring Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper , which caught the scariness and the strangeness felt by a boy cast among thieves and scoundrels .
In these two movies , growing up is a trial — a passage through fear , a test of character .
In retrospect , it seems hard to imagine anyone but Fleming directing “ The Wizard of Oz , ” the greatest childcentered movie of all .
Yet he was n’t the first choice on this film , either .
In October , 1938 , the film began shooting at M - G - M under Richard Thorpe , a journeyman who had directed a Tarzan picture in 1936 .
Thorpe ’s footage was flat , and the producer , Mervyn LeRoy , threw it out .
( Bizarrely , Cukor also briefly worked on “ Oz . ” After Thorpe was fired , Cukor dropped in , changed Judy Garland ’s makeup and hair style , and fled ; the material did n’t interest him . )
LeRoy then turned to Fleming , who initially said no , as much of the production , including the screenplay and the sets , was already in place .
By this time , however , Fleming had got married — to Lu Rosson , who had been the wife of a close friend — and he was the father of two little girls , whom he adored .
He left few memos or letters , but , from what he wrote about “ Oz ” for an internal M - G - M publication , one gets the impression that he changed his mind because he wanted to make an entertainment that both adults and children could see .
The screenwriters Noel Langley , Florence Ryerson , and Edgar Allan Woolf adapted “ The Wonderful Wizard of Oz , ” L. Frank Baum ’s classic 1900 novel , and they made two momentous changes .
In Baum ’s book , Oz is a wondrous place , but it ’s real — Dorothy , still in her house , is carried there by a raging cyclone .
In the movie , Dorothy ( Judy Garland ) , conked on the head during the storm , spins into Oz in a dream , and Oz becomes the blossoming of her unconscious , populated by strikingly familiar faces joined to weird bodies : her intimidating neighbor Miss Gulch shows up as the lime - green Wicked Witch of the West , and the farmhands employed by Dorothy ’s stern Auntie Em become her sweetly despondent companions with missing parts — the Scarecrow ( Ray Bolger ) and the Tin Man ( Jack Haley ) .
Fleming , working with his favorite screenwriter , John Lee Mahin , added a third farmhand , Zeke , who became the Cowardly Lion ( Bert Lahr ) .
He also reconceived the Kansas scenes , giving them a sharper edge .
He changed what had become ( unbelievably ) yellow ovals in Thorpe ’s production back to the immortal yellow bricks , and commissioned the signature song “ Follow the Yellow Brick Road ” from Yip Harburg and Harold Arlen .
Fleming did not direct the Kansas scenes , which were shot in black and white .
They were scheduled for the end of the shoot ; by that time , he had gone off to work on “ Gone with the Wind , ” and they were done by the director King Vidor .
But the main body of the movie , from the moment that Dorothy opens the door to Oz and the screen turns to brilliant Technicolor — a stunner in 1939 , and still exciting today — belongs to Fleming .
Dorothy ’s immortality , in the person of Judy Garland , was not easily achieved .
Garland , who had been fussed over and bullied by M - G - M since she had signed with the studio , in 1935 , was a very self - conscious , uncertain , but blazingly talented sixteen - year - old , playing a girl of about twelve .
Her eagerness and tenderness are still touching , as an idealized portrait of a child , but Fleming wanted Dorothy to be tough as well , and the neurotic star gave him fits .
In one scene , Garland bops Lahr ’s Cowardly Lion on the snout , and Lahr ’s blubbering was so funny that Garland cracked up , and then lost control of herself , laughing hysterically through take after take .
She stood behind a synthetic tree , saying to herself , “ I will not laugh .
I will not laugh , ” but , when she ruined yet another take , Fleming slapped her across the face and said , “ All right , now .
Go back to your dressing room . ”
( The slap was something of a Fleming trademark , onscreen and off . )
She came out some time later and got on with the rest of the movie .
In the end , her Dorothy , an orphan raised by a Depression - era aunt ( her uncle hardly exists ) , turns out to be surprisingly strong .
The way Fleming directs her , Dorothy has a clumpy farm girl ’s grit — she ’s a literal - minded kid fiercely clinging to her hopes and desires among witches , blue - faced flying monkeys , and squeaking little people .
She undergoes a journey of epic proportions , only to arrive back in Kansas , where she finds that her true self was there all along .
It ’s an ending that Salman Rushdie , in an affectionate short book he wrote about the movie , deplores : Dorothy , he says , no longer needs the inadequate adults in her life ; she ’s ready to go out on her own .
Yet we assume — do n’t we ? — that Dorothy , though she stays home , has been changed by what she has imagined .
In her dreams , she has faced down demons , overcome a loss of faith — she has been tested , just like Fleming ’s child heroes in “ Treasure Island ” and “ Captains Courageous . ”
Apart from the scenes with the hoodoos and the winged monkeys , Fleming ’s direction is earthbound , and that ’s the way it should be .
The picture ’s veteran music - hall stars — Bolger , Haley , and Lahr — need to work on the ground ; indeed , they have an intimate , virtuosic relation to the ground .
When Lahr lands on his rump , his legs shoot up like a moving swing suddenly emptied of its child .
Bolger does flailing , rubber - legged collapses and recoveries — he teases the ground , engaging it and then taking off from it .
And Haley , in his rusting metal case , leans perilously , like a telephone pole in a storm .
Academics have told me that “ Oz ” is a mythic structure , a descendant of the Odyssey or the Aeneid , but they look at me blankly when I say that the movie is also a summa of nineteen - thirties show business .
Fleming framed his vaudevillians and musical - comedy performers as he had framed Cooper and Tracy — he brought out their individual genius as performers .
He might have moved the camera more , or done some point - of - view shooting , but his square , stable , front - and - center view is essentially the right directorial strategy for this performance - dominated fantasy .
Many talented people worked on “ Oz , ” but , as Sragow says , without Fleming ’s enthusiasm and discipline “ the movie would have collapsed into campy chaos . ”
Fleming combined the elements into an emotionally overwhelming fable , which was always his supreme gift .
Judged as an example of storytelling ( if not for the story it tells ) , “ Gone with the Wind ” ca n’t be much faulted , either .
The Civil War begins , crests , and reaches a disastrous conclusion with the destruction of Atlanta , and mournfulness holds sway through the middle of the epic .
Yet , if keening over the Old South had been the movie ’s sole thematic line , “ Gone with the Wind , ” as Molly Haskell notes , would have been forgotten , along with many mossy plantation novels and films of the period .
Barbarous Rhett and Scarlett push the gracious - plantation nostalgia out of the way .
A Southern - born war profiteer , Rhett does n’t believe in “ the cause ” of secession , while Scarlett finds the war merely tiresome ( the foolish young men run away to get killed , spoiling the parties ) .
For all its fustian , the picture offers an enchanting idiosyncrasy : a saga of a broken nation is told from the point of view of a vain and restless girl .
At the beginning , in one of the cinema ’s indelible images , Leigh ’s sixteen - year - old Scarlett floats rapidly across the grass and through the trees in a virgin - white layered dress .
Pauline Kael once compared Leigh to a Dresden - china shepherdess , an image that captures the delicacy of her features and her body but not their mobility .
As the small mouth puckers , the lynx - eyed glance , with head slightly turned , appears to see around corners .
The quickness of her responses is almost frightening .
Wariness and avidity , coquetry and rage , preening and despair — unrelenting egotism plays on her face like sunlight on a fast - moving stream .
Amid the terrible events of the war , her Scarlett , the implacable “ me , ” is obsessed with nothing but her own affairs , and Fleming urged Leigh to give Scarlett ’s bitchiness full rein .
Introducing his couple , Fleming gave Gable perhaps the most glamorous entrance that any movie actor has ever enjoyed .
As Leigh looks down while ascending a grand staircase , Gable , broad across the shoulders and pulled in ( actually girdled ) at the waist , stands at the bottom and brazenly gazes up at her .
She says to a friend , “ He looks as if — as if he knows what I look like without my shimmy . ”
Gable ’s appreciative stare was usually enough to make the women in his movies tumble , but Scarlett resists for a long time , marrying two men , both nonentities , before marrying Rhett , and then she does so mostly for his money .
Her resistance to him even after marriage — her choice of power over sex and romantic love — fascinates Haskell .
“ Inside the tinkling charms of a Southern - belle saga , ” she writes , “ are the rumblings of a feminist manifesto . ”
After the war , Scarlett not only takes over America ’s most famous fictional turf , the ruined plantation Tara , but scandalizes Atlanta society by becoming a hard - driving lumber entrepreneur — apparently the first female capitalist of the New South .
Margaret Mitchell had enjoyed a brief fling as a flapper , and Haskell maintains that she transposed the rebellious spirit of women of the nineteen - twenties into the heart and body of a nineteenth - century social butterfly .
This compositional strategy not only retrieved Scarlett from the past but projected her into the future , and Leigh , abetted by Fleming , sustained Scarlett as a perverse , good - bad heroine for our times , a shrew who wo n’t be tamed .
For seventy years , ever since teen - age girls started reading the novel with a flashlight under the covers , this romantic misalliance has remained a subject of speculation and debate — a pop-culture obsession serving as a template for a nation ’s romantic dreams and regrets .
In the famous “ rape ” scene , Gable , with an unwilling Leigh in his arms , surges up a crimson stairway to the bedroom , and after that point the movie , as Haskell says , astonishingly lurches from bodice - ripper to something like tragic drama .
Tracking the stages of the struggle between husband and wife , Haskell discovers a conflict in her own responses : she loves Scarlett ’s ambition but finds the marital disaster , which is partly produced by it , almost heartbreaking , especially since Rhett is n’t the usual villain of feminist critique — a dominating husband who wants to crush his spirited wife .
On the contrary , he loves his wife for exactly what she is .
Looking at the movie again , one can glean the truth from certain shadings in Leigh ’s performance : her rage at Gable contains more than a hint of panic , a suggestion by the actress that , for Scarlett , sexual happiness might lead to an intolerable loss of will .
In all , as a portrait of a couple at war , there ’s nothing quite so intense and sustained in American movies , and Fleming sharpened it to the point of violence .
No surprise : on a much smaller scale , and largely as comedy , he had done something similar in the rowdy give - and - take between Gable and Harlow in “ Red Dust , ” a romance in which each partner is initially too proud to admit to loving the other .
On the “ Gone with the Wind ” set , Fleming teased and cajoled Leigh ; at times , they battled as much as Rhett and Scarlett .
Walking off after a bad day , he said , “ Miss Leigh , you can stick this script up your royal British ass , ” a not particularly elegant variant of “ Frankly , my dear , I do n’t give a damn . ”
But their dislike for each other may have kept the movie dramatically alive .
In one of the scenes in which Rhett moves in on Scarlett , Fleming instructed her , “ Resist but do n’t resist too much . ”
Yet , as Gable reached for her , she slapped him .
This particular blow , one imagines , may have been a retaliatory act aimed as much at Fleming as at Rhett .
In any case , Fleming was very pleased with the scene ( “ That ’s swell ! ” ) , and it stayed in the movie .
The ethos of toughness was applied to Gable , too , and with unprecedented results .
If Gable began the project afraid that episodes from his past life might make him look effeminate , he nevertheless gave way , under his mentor ’s insistent prodding , to “ feminine ” emotions he had never shown before ( nor after ) , including bafflement when a beautiful woman does n’t want him , increasing despair , and even , at times , tearful grief .
All through the shoot , Fleming took vitamin shots to keep up his energy , and downers at the end of the day , and he became so jangled and tired , and so enraged by Selznick ’s daily memos about virtually every shot , that he retreated , under a doctor ’s orders , to his beach house , in Balboa .
For eighteen days , the M - G - M staff director Sam Wood took over .
But Fleming came back and , muttering mildly anti-Semitic remarks to friends , reshot scenes as Selznick requested , and assisted in the editing .
He directed , by common estimate , about sixty per cent of the film .
A few of the scenes that Cukor shot ( none with Gable and Leigh alone ) survived the final cut , and , after he was dismissed , on days off from shooting , Cukor coached both Leigh and de Havilland at his house , so he may be responsible for some of the nuances in those two performances .
Yet it was Fleming who saved the project from dissolution and got the man - woman struggle at the heart of it down right , and he deserves a good part of the credit for the movie ’s becoming the cultural monument that millions still adore .
The best movie Fleming made after his exhausting labors of 1939 was a new version of “ Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ” ( 1941 ) , with Spencer Tracy in the title roles and , as Hyde ’s victim , a startlingly sexual Ingrid Bergman , who was Fleming ’s last movie - star girlfriend .
He died eight years later , of heart failure , in the arms of his wife , Lu , at the age of fifty - nine , and immediately slipped into obscurity .
What should history make of him ?
He did n’t direct the entirety of either of his two classics , and he was n’t , by definition , an auteur .
But this absence from the list of the blessed suggests a fault in auteur theory and not in Fleming — a prejudice against the generalists , the non-obsessed , the “ chameleons , ” as Steven Spielberg called them , who re-created themselves for each project and made good movies in many different styles .
Talent , when poured through “ a coarser sieve , ” can assert itself in rough - and - ready humor , resilience , and all - around hardiness and strength .
Cinema ’s historians should celebrate , as audiences always have , not only the obsessed geniuses but also the adaptable ruffians who made many of the most entertaining movies ever to come out of Hollywood . ♦
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In two indications of continuing job market weakness , a drop in the government 's weekly reading of initial unemployment claim filings failed to match the surge of the prior week , and the number of people filing on an ongoing basis rose to a record high for the 16th straight week .
A total of 631,000 people filed new claims for jobless benefits in the week ended May 16 , the Labor Department said .
That 's a decrease of 12,000 from an upwardly revised 643,000 in the previous week .
The total was less than expected .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast 625,000 initial claims , according to a consensus estimate .
The 4 - week moving average , which smoothes out volatility in the labor market reading , was 628,500 , a decline of 3,500 from the previous week 's revised average of 632,000 .
Initial jobless claims surged by 38,000 the previous week in the wake of the Chrysler bankruptcy and General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) restructuring proposal .
Last week 's easing did not make up for that gain .
" The uncomfortable suggestion must be that the underlying pace of claims is not slowing as much as appeared to be the case a few weeks ago , though the volatility of the numbers means we need to see more data to be sure , " said Ian Shepherdson , Chief U.S. Economist at High Frequency Economics , in a research note .
While the pace of initial claim filings does not signal an imminent recovery , Shepherdson also does not see the measure getting significantly weaker .
" We 'd be very surprised if the underlying trend in claims were to start rising again , but these latest numbers do not encourage the idea that the pace of layoffs is dropping sharply , " he said .
Unable to get back in the market : Continuing claims have remained at a record high , even as initial jobless claims dipped on a weekly basis , because unemployed workers are having a hard time finding a new job once they lose their job .
In the week ended May 9 , the most recent data available , 6.66 million continuing claims were filed .
That 's the highest number since the Labor Department started tracking the data in 1967 and an increase of 75,000 from the revised level for the previous week .
The 4 - week moving average for continuing claims was 6.48 million , an increase of 131,000 from the previous week 's revised average of 6.35 million .
The Labor Department 's monthly jobs report for April , released May 8 , showed the unemployment rate at 8.9 % , a 25 - year high .
The report showed that 27 % of 13.7 million unemployed Americans have been out of work for more than six months .
That marks the highest percentage of long - term unemployed compared to the overall pool of in the 61 years that reading has been tracked .

This A Colorado man who works for Evangelical group Focus on the Family has been arrested after he solicited sex online from an investigator posing as a teenage girl , police have said .
" Juan Alberto Ovalle , 42 , thought he was corresponding with a girl under the age of 15 , but instead it was undercover officers with the Jefferson County district attorney 's office , according to court documents , " reported the Denver Post .
" ... Ovalle was arrested on April 3rd when he drove to an undisclosed location in Lakewood to meet the person he believed to be a teen for sexual purposes , " reported Colorado 's News Channel 13 .
" Between April 2 and April 3 Ovalle is alleged to have made sexually graphic statements in a chat room to a person he believed to be an underage teen , police report , " the channel continued .
" According to court documents Ovalles also told the teen about the sexual things that he wanted to do to her and ultimately drove from Colorado Springs on April 3 to meet her with the intention of having sexual contact . "
" He 's scheduled to be formally charged Thursday with two felony counts of criminal attempt sexual assault on a minor and Internet luring of a child , " reported the Colorado Springs Gazette .
" He is being held in Jefferson County Detention Center in Golden on a $ 25,000 bond . "
" We are all shocked to hear of these allegations and just beginning to look into them , " said Focus on the Family spokesman Gary Schneeberger on Monday .
Focus on the Family was an influential group during the Bush - era and its president , Dr. James Dobson , frequently met with President George W. Bush to lay strategy on how best to rally American Christians behind terror war policies .
Similarly , after Justice Samuel Alito 's confirmation to the Supreme Court , Dobson received a personal note of thanks from the conservative judge .

Hoo boy , we have n't seen a corporate case of Hatfield vs. McCoy like NVIDIA vs.
Intel since , well , last month 's little Apple vs.
Palm tiff .
While these two makers of all things silicon have rarely been on the best of terms , things have been rather testy lately with Intel slamming NVIDIA 's Ion platform , complaints to which the company summarily dismissed .
But , the GPU maker with big aspirations apparently was n't done there , continuing the rebuttal by pledging to attack the core of Intel 's business : the x86 processor .
This verbal salvo was fired by Michael Hara , NVIDIA 's VP in charge of investor and public relations , who indicated the company would start making CPUs for integrated devices like MIDs and netbooks sometime in the next two to three years .
We can't say as we blame NVIDIA for wanting a piece of Intel 's delectable Atom pie , but given how long we 've been hearing rumors of an NVIDIA x86 CPU , we 'll believe it when we see it .
Maybe these two should just go ahead and set up the PR cage match already ?
[ Thanks , Alex ]
And as publicity stunts go , that was minor league stuff .

Ah , the art of the staged publicity stunt .
Even after it came out that the whole thing was planned with Eminem 's cooperation , you could still find comment threads full of people defending it as real .

6 Mel Gibson and The Passion of the Christ " Controversy "
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Mel Gibson 's movie , The Passion of the Christ , was a Bible movie with no stars and not a word of English directed by a guy who was on the verge of wearing a special helmet that would keep the Jews from reading his thoughts .
Needless to say , it was a tough sell .
But through a careful campaign that involved screening the film to Christian and conservative audiences in advance , Passion was hugely successful , grossing $ 370 million in the U.S .
Then a month after it opened in February of 2004 , it was set to open internationally , where they would n't have the same network of evangelical churches telling members it was their godly duty to buy a ticket .

So how do you build buzz in that situation ?
Well , nothing sells like controversy ...
The Publicity Stunt :
Around the first of March , stories came out that no distributors in France would carry the film because it was too controversial .
According to these reports , French film distributors were concerned that a Mel Gibson movie , that had already grossed enough to build a yacht - shitting Death Star , was too much for the sensitive tastes of the French public .
Some major French newspapers devoted two full pages to the controversy surrounding the movie .
And as always happens with censorship , it only served to make people want to see it more .
Once a French distributor purchased the rights to the film , they called a press conference to celebrate that they alone were the brave souls who would bring this banned work to light .

Why it Was Bullshit :
It turns out the " this film is TOO HOT for France ! ! " rumors were invented by Icon , Mel Gibson 's production company .
In reality , the French were more than happy to be bored while watching Jesus get whipped for six hours .
The head of the company that wound up distributing it said , " We have been tracking this film since its inception and were hoping to be in business with Mel ... "
Still , this controversy and the free publicity helped the film gross another $ 240 million internationally .
We 're not sure what Mel 's master plan was behind his breakdown and drunk driving arrest afterward , but we 're sure he had one .

Suppose we want to monitor memory and time usage of a child process .
Frequently .
On MacOS X . With an unprivileged user .
I did not find anywhere a description of how to achieve this .
This articles pulls together some of the needed information .
MacOS X's Mach kernel surely does not make it straight - forward , but the biggest showstopper is the lack of documentation on how the low - level operations are supposed to be used together .
Apple 's stance appears to be that they do not like these interfaces to be used .
It was even suggested to parse the output of the ps utility which is not such a hot idea if the monitoring has to be done frequently enough .
Adequate high - level interfaces are not provided either .
The Big Picture
Note : much of the following was learned by reading random ( undocumented ) source code and guess work .
Please let me know about any inaccuracies .
Not very long ago , Tim Becker wrote an article on Determining memory usage in process on OSX .
The function to use is task_info( ) , which takes a task port as parameter .
We can obtain a task port for our own process via mach_task_self ( ) .
For arbitrary processes , the first function that comes to mind is task_for_pid( ) , which , given a pid_t , returns its task port .
But , since we can do a lot of nasty things with task ports , it is a privileged operation , at least on newer versions of OS X ( for Intel Macs ) .
So , we need a different way to get at the task port of a process .
In Mach , we have to ask the other process nicely whether it grants us this right .
For fork ( ) ed processes , we can establish a communication channel between parent and child , on which the child sends its own task port back to the parent .
The parent process is then free to use it in the call to task_info ( ) to obtain information about its child .
Fork (1 ) It !
There is one small problem , though .
In contrast to , e.g. , Unix file descriptors , task ports are not inherited across a fork ( ) .
Hence the parent process must set up a special bootstrap port to get things off the ground .
Since the parent is at the receiving end , the port must be created with MACH_PORT_RIGHT_RECEIVE .
Furthermore , the parent process must explicitly grant its child the right to send back messages via this port .
This is done in function setup_recv_port ( ) below .
static int setup_recv_port ( mach_port_t * recv_port ) { kern_return_t err ; mach_port_t port = MACH_PORT_NULL ; err = mach_port_allocate ( mach_task_self ( ) , MACH_PORT_RIGHT_RECEIVE , &port ) ; CHECK_MACH_ERROR
( err , " mach_port_allocate failed : " ) ; err = mach_port_insert_right ( mach_task_self ( ) , port , port , MACH_MSG_TYPE_MAKE_SEND ) ; CHECK_MACH_ERROR
( err , " mach_port_insert_right failed : " ) ; * recv_port = port ; return 0 ; }
Subsequently , the newly created port is set as bootstrap port in the parent .
It is the only port that is inherited by child processes .
kern_return_t err ; mach_port_t parent_recv_port = MACH_PORT_NULL ; if ( setup_recv_port ( &parent_recv_port ) !=
0 ) return - 1 ; err = task_set_bootstrap_port ( mach_task_self ( ) , parent_recv_port ) ; CHECK_MACH_ERROR
( err , " task_set_bootstrap_port failed : " ) ;
For the child process to send a message back to its parent process it first asks for the bootstrap port .
Then we create a message which contains the task port we want to send back ( the magic constants may or may not be completely correct , but they appear to work ) and send it ( function send_port ( ) ) :
static int send_port ( mach_port_t remote_port , mach_port_t port ) { kern_return_t err ; struct { mach_msg_header_t header ; mach_msg_body_t body ; mach_msg_port_descriptor_t task_port ; } msg ; msg.header.msgh_remote_port = remote_port ; msg.header.msgh_local_port = MACH_PORT_NULL ; msg.header.msgh_bits = MACH_MSGH_BITS ( MACH_MSG_TYPE_COPY_SEND , 0 ) | MACH_MSGH_BITS_COMPLEX ; msg.header.msgh_size = sizeof msg ; msg.body.msgh_descriptor_count = 1 ; msg.task_port.name = port ; msg.task_port.disposition = MACH_MSG_TYPE_COPY_SEND ; msg.task_port.type = MACH_MSG_PORT_DESCRIPTOR
; err = mach_msg_send ( &msg.header ) ; CHECK_MACH_ERROR
( err , " mach_msg_send failed : " ) ; return 0 ; }
On the parent side , we prepare to receive the same message ( with a some trailing information tacked on for whatever reason ) .
And voilà , we have the child 's task port .
It can later be used as first parameter to a task_info ( ) call .
static int recv_port ( mach_port_t recv_port , mach_port_t * port ) { kern_return_t err ; struct { mach_msg_header_t header ; mach_msg_body_t body ; mach_msg_port_descriptor_t task_port ; mach_msg_trailer_t trailer ; } msg ; err = mach_msg ( &msg.header , MACH_RCV_MSG , 0 , sizeof msg , recv_port , MACH_MSG_TIMEOUT_NONE , MACH_PORT_NULL ) ; CHECK_MACH_ERROR
( err , " mach_msg failed : " ) ; * port = msg.task_port.name ; return 0 ; }
The parent process now has access to the child 's task .
Now we need to do some cleanup work .
We need to restore the original bootstrap port both in parent and child process .
This is so that both have access to the Mach bootstrap daemon again .
This can be done by having the child process create another port with the above functions , and send it to the parent .
Through this , the parent process then sends back its original bootstrap port to the child .
( There is probably a simpler way to achieve this .
I would gladly like to know . )
Here 's the code :
static task_t child_task = MACH_PORT_NULL ; pid_t sampling_fork ( ) { kern_return_t err ; mach_port_t parent_recv_port = MACH_PORT_NULL ; mach_port_t child_recv_port = MACH_PORT_NULL ; if ( setup_recv_port ( &parent_recv_port ) !=
0 ) return - 1 ; err = task_set_bootstrap_port ( mach_task_self ( ) , parent_recv_port ) ; CHECK_MACH_ERROR
( err , " task_set_bootstrap_port failed : " ) ; pid_t pid ; switch ( pid = fork ( ) ) { case - 1 : err = mach_port_deallocate ( mach_task_self ( ) , parent_recv_port ) ; CHECK_MACH_ERROR
( err , " mach_port_deallocate failed : " ) ; return pid ; case 0 : err = task_get_bootstrap_port ( mach_task_self ( ) , & parent_recv_port ) ; CHECK_MACH_ERROR
( err , " task_get_bootstrap_port failed : " ) ; if ( setup_recv_port ( &child_recv_port ) !=
0 ) return - 1 ; if ( send_port ( parent_recv_port , mach_task_self ( ) ) !=
0 ) return - 1 ; if ( send_port ( parent_recv_port , child_recv_port ) !=
0 ) return - 1 ; if ( recv_port ( child_recv_port , &bootstrap_port ) !=
0 ) return - 1 ; err = task_set_bootstrap_port ( mach_task_self ( ) , bootstrap_port ) ; CHECK_MACH_ERROR
( err , " task_set_bootstrap_port failed : " ) ; break ; default : err = task_set_bootstrap_port ( mach_task_self ( ) , bootstrap_port ) ; CHECK_MACH_ERROR
( err , " task_set_bootstrap_port failed : " ) ; if ( recv_port ( parent_recv_port , &child_task ) !=
0 ) return - 1 ; if ( recv_port ( parent_recv_port , &child_recv_port ) !=
0 ) return - 1 ; if ( send_port ( child_recv_port , bootstrap_port ) !=
0 ) return - 1 ; err = mach_port_deallocate ( mach_task_self ( ) , parent_recv_port ) ; CHECK_MACH_ERROR
( err , " mach_port_deallocate failed : " ) ; break ; } return pid ; }
Documentation about the Mach IPC Interface is available .
In principle , I like how port rights ( capabilities ) are handled in Mach , compared to the Unix way of sharing almost everything across a fork ( ) .
If only it would have been made easier to discover the details .
( On Linux , all this would have been done by reading the information we are interested in from the / proc or /sys file systems .
A MacFUSE based procfs filesystem for OS X exists as well , but that is unlikely to be installed , and perhaps too cumbersome to set up for most users . )
From the ' more fun with numbers ' files :
The open source Firefox web browser from Mozilla now has some 270 million users .
That 's the figure that Mozilla staffer Aza Dotzler is now claiming , and it 's not an easy number to calculate .
How do you count users for an open source application that does not require registrations ?
Downloads are n't accurate , since downloads include the same users that could have updated and / or downloaded revisions .
What Mozilla does is they use their Application Update Service ( AUS ) -- the service whereby Firefox automatically calls home once a day looking for updates -- as a method .
The number of users that hit AUS on a daily basis are called the Active Daily Users .
Dotzler notes that there are now 90 million active daily users .
As part of a mathematical computation , Mozilla multiplies the number of daily users by 3 ( hence the 270 million ) to try and gauge how many total users they have -- since not all user are active every day ( or so the theorem goes ) .
Personally , I like the way that Fedora Linux tracks its user numbers which is a similiar approach .
They also measure how manys servers ' call home ' looking for updates , though Fedora adds in the measure of checking by unique IP address ( which presents its own issues ) .
Talking about Linux , Mozilla 's numbers for Firefox do not include the majority of Linux users .
That 's because Linux users typically do not get Firefox from Mozilla directly but rather by way of their own distributions update repositories ( so they do n't check Mozilla 's AUS ) .
If we take Fedora 's number of users to be 13 million , Ubuntu Linux 's to be another 8 million , then roll in Debian , SUSE , Mandriva and Gentoo users , I do n't think it would be unfair to say that Firefox easily has over 100 million active daily users and nearly 300 million users total ( but that 's my own calcuation ) .
No matter how you slice it , Firefox is likely the most popular open source application in history ( in terms of usage ) and it continues to grow .
ROCHDALE , England , June 8 ( UPI ) --
The British Ministry of Justice is warning the country 's prisons that prisoners have taken to using a 16th - century slang to hide talk about drug deals .
The 500 - year - old dialect , which is known as thieves ' cant or rogues ' cant , was believed to have been developed by medieval gypsies and adopted by a handful of scoundrels across England .
Officials at Buckley Hall Prison in Rochdale said the dialect has resurfaced as a code for drug trafficking , the Daily Mail reported Monday .

Officials said they determined that " chat " and " onick " are being used as code for heroin , while " cawbe " denotes crack cocaine and " inick " is code for a cell phone or a SIM card .
" This is the most ingenious use of a secret code we have ever come across , " an official at the 381 - prisoner facility said .
" Elizabethan cant was only used by a tiny number of people and it is quite amazing that is has been resurrected in order to buy drugs .
Some inmates will try anything to get contraband into jail . "
The Ministry of Justice sent a security alert to officials at prisons in England and Wales warning them to be aware of the code .
It ’s not working .
The Bush - Obama strategy of throwing trillions at the banks to solve the mortgage crisis is a huge bust .
The financial moguls , while tickled pink to have $ 1.25 trillion in toxic assets covered by the feds , along with hundreds of billions in direct handouts , are not using that money to turn around the free fall in housing foreclosures .
As The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday , “ The Mortgage Bankers Association cut its forecast of home - mortgage lending this year by 27 % amid deflating hopes for a boom in refinancing . ”
The same association said that the total refinancing under the administration ’s much ballyhooed Home Affordable Refinance Program is “ very low . ”
Aside from a tight mortgage market , the problem in preventing foreclosures has to do with homeowners losing their jobs .
Here again the administration , continuing the Bush strategy , is working the wrong end of the problem .
Although President Obama was wise enough to at least launch a job stimulus program , a far greater amount of federal funding benefits Wall Street as opposed to Main Street .
State and local governments have been forced into draconian budget cuts , firing workers who are among the most reliable in making their mortgage payments — when they have jobs .
Yet the Obama administration wo n’t spend even a small fraction of what it has wasted on the banks to cover state shortfalls .
California could n’t get the White House to guarantee $ 5.5 billion in short - term notes to avert severe cuts in state and local payrolls , from prison guards to schoolteachers .
Compare that with the $ 50 billion already given to Citigroup , plus an astounding $ 300 billion to guarantee that institution ’s toxic assets .
Citigroup benefits from being a bank “ too big to fail , ” although through its irresponsible actions to get that large it did as much as any company to cause this mess .
How big a mess ?
According to the Federal Reserve ’s most recent report , seven straight quarters of declining household wealth have left Americans $ 14 trillion poorer .
Many who thought they were middle class have now joined the ranks of the poor .
Food banks are strapped and welfare rolls are dramatically on the rise , as the WSJ reports , with a 27 percent year - to - year increase in Oregon , 23 percent in South Carolina and 10 percent in California .
And you have to be very poor to get on welfare , thanks to President Clinton ’s so - called welfare reform , which he signed into law before he ramped up the radical deregulation of the financial services industry , enabling our economic downturn .
Citigroup , the prime mover for ending the sensible restraints of the Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 , is now a pathetic ward of the state .
But back in the day President Clinton would tour the country with Citigroup founder Sandy Weill touting the wonderful work that Weill and other moguls were doing to invest in economically depressed communities .
It was n’t really happening then , and now millions of folks in those communities have seen their houses snatched from them as if they were just pieces in a game of Monopoly that Clinton and his fat - cat buddy were playing .
Once Weill got the radical deregulation law he wanted , he issued a statement giving credit : “ In particular , we congratulate President Clinton , Treasury Secretary Larry Summers , NEC [ National Economic Council ] Chairman Gene Sperling , Under Secretary of the Treasury Gary Gensler , Assistant Treasury Secretaries Linda Robertson and Greg Baer . ”
Summers is now Obama ’s top economic adviser , Sperling has been appointed legal counselor at Treasury , and Gensler , a former partner in Goldman Sachs , is head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which he once attempted to prevent from regulating derivatives when it was run by Brooksley Born .
Robertson worked for Summers in pushing through the Commodity Futures Modernization Act , which freed the derivatives market from adult supervision and contained the “ Enron Loophole , ” permitting that company to go wild .
Robertson then became the top Washington lobbyist for Enron and was recently appointed senior adviser to Fed Chair Ben S. Bernanke .
Baer went to work as a corporate counsel for Bank of America , which announced his appointment with a press release crediting him with having “ coordinated Treasury policy ” during the Clinton years in getting Glass - Steagall repealed .
As a result of deregulation , B of A too spiraled out of control and ended up as a beneficiary of the Treasury ’s welfare program .
Why was I so naive as to have expected this Democratic president to not do the bidding of the banks when the last president from that party joined the Republicans in giving the moguls everything they wanted ?
Please , Obama , prove me wrong .
Walking a Fine Line : Living in Balance
What is more important : living a balanced life or doing everything you can to strive for your goals ?
Of course it depends on your own personal definitions of a balanced life and striving for goals .
Defining these will help you make an informed decision .
Sacrificing to Succeed
In the past I asked if you were willing to sacrifice to succeed .
The following day I listed out the things we were going to do to sacrifice in order to hit our goals :
cut our individual spending money in half
cut eating out in half
cut trips from our budget ( since we have the next two trips paid for )
applying all extra money to our second mortgage
adding in blogging income to pay off second mortgage
That was back in April .
We made changes in late April when we did our budget for May .
And it is working thus far .
We ’ve been able to keep our spending down and will have extra money to apply toward our second mortgage at the end of the month .
Can Sacrificing Go Too Far ?
The obvious answer to this is yes .
Of course you can cut too much .
You can live like a hermit .
You can live a miserable life now in hopes that the future will be much better .
Is it worth it ?
It would depend on how far you take it .
I would never recommend that anyone live like a hermit .
Life ’s too short for that .
I personally think that most Americans are not on the hermit side of the fence .
They ’ve been living a free wheeling , free spending , and luxury filled life .
Big homes full of financed furniture and big screen TVs .
Sacrificing is Hard
This is what we ’re running into right now .
It is n’t easy .
It is n’t a cake walk .
( That ’s why it is called sacrificing . )
When is it okay to lighten up a little bit ?
When should you press on and stick to your budgetary guns ?
I ’m not sure .
We ’ll keep moving forward and see if we can make these changes stick .
For now , it ’s hard .
An iPhone application designed to remotely - control the Transmission BitTorrent client has been rejected by the Apple App Store .
Apple told the developer that this type of application is often used to infringe copyrights , so therefore the company has decided not to allow such software on the App store .
Drivetrain is an iPhone application to remotely control the multi-platform Transmission BitTorrent client via the Internet .
According to developer , Maza Digital , Drivetrain “ provides all the details of the web interface in a native iPhone app that ’s easy to use . ”
Maza Digital submitted Drivetrain to Apple for approval back in April , and resubmitted the App after he made a few small UI changes .
He then received an email in return saying that the review would take longer than expected .
This was followed up by a second email in which Apple rejected the application for inclusion in the App Store , telling Maza Digital ;
We ’ve reviewed Drivetrain and determined that we cannot post this version of your application to the App Store at this time because this category of applications is often used for the purpose of infringing third party rights .
We have chosen to not publish this type of application to the App Store .
Of course , not only are all BitTorrent clients absolutely legal ( people infringe copyright , not software ) but Drivetrain is just an application to control a torrent client and as such goes absolutely nowhere near any copyright infringing material .
“ By now I am very disillusioned with the whole AppStore process , Maza Digital told TorrentFreak in a response , adding “ I find it rather ridiculous that they have rejected an app that does not do anything that may be ‘ often used for the purpose of infringing third party rights ’. ”
However , it seems that Apple has decided that everything BitTorrent related is a no go for the AppStore .
A ridiculous move by Apple and a step too far .
Quick , ban Safari so no - one can use Transmission Web Interface .

It ’s pretty clear to computer science geeks that Directed Edge is supposed to be doing groovy things with graphs .
In fact our recommendation engine , and some of the things that are unique about our approach to recommendations , are built on our super - fast graph database .
When we went live yesterday with the latest version of our recommendations web services , another , much bigger thing happened behind the scenes for us : we cut over to the new version of our graph database .
Every time that Directed Edge gets mentioned in nerdier circles we get a lot of questions about this fabled graph - engine , so we thought we ’d indulge our techie friends with some background info .
When we first decided to build the Directed Edge engine , we ’d built some in - memory and RDF - store based prototypes to start hashing out the recommendations algorithms , but the RDF stores could n’t keep up performance - wise and staying memory - based obviously was n’t an option for persistent data .
So we tried porting things over to SQL - based databases … and got a working version , but it was so painfully slow that we knew we needed to keep looking .
The initial version of our web services were built on simply serializing data objects to disk and reading records from index files that we loaded up into memory .
This worked and was both fast and memory efficient , but ignored most of the harder problems of a true database .
What are those performance characteristics , exactly ?
Well , it ’s fuzzy where the cut - off is , but we ’re now able to import a graph with 2.5 million nodes and 60 million edges in 12 minutes on a MacBook .
Query times for finding related items on a similarly large graph with warm disk - buffers average under 5 ms .
With the latest version of our web services and database , we ’ve gone from having a graph - store to having a proper graph database .
We now use straight memory - mapped I /O , disk - based linear - hashing , have mechanisms to address data fragmentation , thread - safe read / write locking and logging / log replaying .
Before we jump into the computer - science -y core of what we ’re doing , I ’ll throw down some nerd - cred , and give some perspective to the design decisions made .
The design was done by me , Directed Edge ’s CTO , and I ’ve been looking at algorithms for graph - based similarity for around 5 years now .
During the earlier half of the decade I did a series of talks on “ contextual webs ” to our crew in the Linux world .
While I have no academic background in database design , I ’ve been doing low level bit - wrangling for most of the last decade and Directed Edge ’s data backend is the third key - value store that I ’ve written from the ground up .
So , what I ’m trying to say is : some of these ideas may be original , many are not , some fly in the face of traditional database design which is likely some mix of novel and naive .
Be that as it may , the closest that we ’ve gotten to our performance using off the shelf databases was with BDB with 5 % of the throughput of our database .
So , on to geekery .
Let ’s start at the top level of abstraction and work our way down .
The impatient may feel free to turn the page at any time since the juicer bits are in the lower levels .
We ’ve tried to bold the highlights .
The Store : Items , Links , References , Tags and Whathaveyou .
Sitting up on top of the architecture is a C++ class called “ Store ” .
Like the rest of the things that sit below the web services ( which are in Java ) , it ’s written in C ++.
This is the API that we use to deal with a database .
To our recommendations code , this is the database .
Things are pretty simple there , and the API is flexible enough that it ’s let us swap out the implementation below it to compare other backends .
Basically it ’s this :
The store is a big collection of items , which can be anything — a user , a product , a web page .
, which can be anything — a user , a product , a web page .
Items are identified by a string unique identifier which maps to an integer index .
which maps to an integer index .
We can look up an item ’s index by name really quickly .
Items have links and references , which are basically a list of things they ’re connected to and things that connect to them .
These are symmetrical — so creating a link from item A to item B , creates a reference from item B to item A .
, which are basically a list of things they ’re connected to and things that connect to them .
These are symmetrical — so creating a link from item A to item B , creates a reference from item B to item A. Items can also have tags , e.g. “ user ” , “ product ” , “ musician ” , “ film ” and so on .
Tags are non-exclusive , so an item can have as many tags as appropriate .
, e.g. “ user ” , “ product ” , “ musician ” , “ film ” and so on .
Tags are non-exclusive , so an item can have as many tags as appropriate .
Links and references can have weights of 1 to 10 or be unweighted .
We use that for ratings .
So a rating is just a link from user A to product B with weight of 1 to 10 .
.
We use that for ratings .
So a rating is just a link from user A to product B with weight of 1 to 10 .
We can also store arbitrary other fields along with these like “ text ” .
Really , the only limitations on what can be associated with an item are what we choose to expose in the API here .
The lower levels are flexible .
So that ’s the top level .
That ’s what makes things look like a nice , clean graph architecture without mucking with all of the lower - level storage details .
At this level everything ’s thread - safe too , so the map - reduce pattern that we use when generating recommendations does n’t leave a trail of destruction and SIGBADTHINGSs in its wake .
Things Start Looking Databasey : Rows and Columns
Like traditional databases , our database is organized into rows and columns .
An item is just a row .
Unlike most databases , there ’s only one set of rows ( only a small lie , which we ’ll ignore for convenience ) , and the primary things contained in rows are lists .
There are really no huge surprises here :
A database has a list of columns , a stack of deleted rows ( to recycle indexes ) and a row count .
, a stack of deleted rows ( to recycle indexes ) and a row count .
Adding a row to the database adds a row to all columns .
There ’s a flag for if a column is hashed or not , which enables fast lookups and requires unique data values .
, which enables fast lookups and requires unique data values .
There ’s a basic column type that just stores byte arrays and a bunch built on top of it for storing things like link and reference vectors , string lists , strings and so on .
and a bunch built on top of it for storing things like .
Any field in an item can be empty and all of our column data types have sane values for empty contents , which are returned if the data pointer for a row is set to null .
Column Locking
We ’ve got two types of locks that we use , one surprisingly boring , one a little more creative .
The most important fields in the Directed Edge database are the links and references .
They convey things like “ which pages are linked on this website ” or “ which products has this customer bought ” or “ which news items has this user clicked on ” .
Those lists are of the type IndexVector within our database and have their own special kind of lock .
The rest of the columns use normal read - write locks .
We use an array of 8 read - write locks per column .
When lock request comes in it is hashed by shifting the index by three bits and then issues a lock on the column .
We found this in practice to be faster than keeping a table or tree of locks since maintaining that tree would require a single read - write lock for the tree maintenance and contention for that lock was rather high .
Non-IndexVector columns ( strings , string lists , and binary blobs , mostly ) copy the data when they hold the read lock and release it immediately thereafter , so the locks are held only momentarily .
So , to repeat that — using a simple array of locks per column significantly outperformed keeping a list of locked items , even if it means that items share their locks with many other items .
We ’ll revisit IndexVector locks again in a little while .
Memory - Mapped I/O … and a Disk Based Malloc ?
We ’re up to my second lie now .
See , I promised that I ’d walk through the layers of abstraction from the top down and here we ’ve gone ahead and skipped to the end .
To understand the data structures that are built on top of the files , it helps to know where that data lives and how we manage it .
We experimented with a few ways of doing I/O , but the one that seemed to consistently win , as well as make life a better place , was doing straight memory mapped I/O .
For the non-system programmers among you , UNIX systems allows for files to be mapped to memory addresses .
So if we ’ve got an open file called “ foo ” and we call mmap on its descriptor , then we ’re able to access the contents of “ foo ” directly based on the address returned by mmap — we can treat the file just like it ’s an array of characters in memory .
This has a few advantages .
One is that it lets the operating system effectively handle paging in data from the disk .
UNIX also provides some handy functions like madvise ( ) and msync ( ) so that you can give the operating system hints on how to do that paging and when to write things back out to disk .
There ’s also no overhead for accessing disk data since it ’s mapped directly from the file into the system ’s address space .
Usually when you use things like fread ( ) or fwrite ( ) all of the data has to be copied into the kernel ’s space , then over to the process ’s space , then you can do stuff with it .
By using mmap we avoid all of that copying mess and the overhead of switching between kernel and user space within syscalls , which is often significant .
There ’s a good section on advanced I/O in O’Reilly ’s Linux System Programming , which I stumbled across last week and gives a good introduction to mmap and other I /O strategies .
So , that ’s what mmap does .
How do we use it ?
Well , one of the typical problems in deciding how to order disk records is how to manage disk fragmentation .
As it turns out , that ’s one of the problems that memory managers face when trying to decide how to allocate chunks of the system heap .
So , we thought , since we ’re treating the files we use as memory anyway , why not put two and two together ?
What we ended up with is an implementation in our memory - mapped file class of malloc , realloc , calloc and free — the classic functions for memory management in C .
We patterned our allocation with some modifications for our applications on the algorithms used in glibc ’s malloc .
There ’s a good , if slightly stale , introduction to them here .
Having those in place lets us allocate blocks of our files just like we ’re allocating memory and handles file fragmentation rather elegantly .
It also has the added bonus of letting us translate normal in - memory algorithms directly to disk based algorithms .
This structure lets us put arbitrary data into a file and gives us back an offset to point to where it ’s at , which is exactly what we do for things like arrays of indexes and strings and so on , but we still need some way of referencing that data to make use of it in our column types .
File - based Data Structures : Stack , Vector , Linear Hash
Most of our data structures are pretty similar to their in - memory based counterparts .
The similarity was in fact one of the reasons that we chose the mmap approach .
We have three basic data structures that we use on disk to reference the blobs of data that are inserted and removed with malloc , realloc and friends .
When we ’re writing these records to disk , we choose whether or not they get their own file by whether or not they can make use of sequential access .
Notably , vectors almost always get their own file because they ’re accessed sequentially and only expand at the end .
It ’d be a pain in the derriere if we had a 50 MB vector and there was no room immediately after it in the file , so we had to free that whole 50 MB chunk and move it to the end of the file leaving a hole where it had been before .
So vectors get to live a solitary life off in their own files .
Hashes and stacks on the other hand do n’t have that problem , their elements tend to be of smaller sizes and more scattered , so they can be mixed in with data without worrying about them fragmenting the file too much as they insert and remove elements .
Stacks are simple and do n’t merit much mention .
We use it to keep track of deleted records so that we can recycle their indexes the next time we create a new row .
Yawn .
Vectors , on the other hand , are some of the meat - and - potatoes of the Directed Edge workhorse : the things we use to keep track of offsets in data files .
These are different from the similarly named IndexVector .
In Directed Edge lingo , an Index corresponds to a unique item with fields and stuff , and an Offset just points to a place in a data file .
These vectors are used for Offsets .
Actually , these vectors are a template , so they can be used for any data type of any fixed size , but they ’re most important for offsets .
This is another point that we break from typical database design theory .
In a typical database you ’d look up a record by checking for it in a B - tree and then go off to find the data pointer for its record , which might have a continuation record at the end that you have to look more stuff up in … and so on .
Our lookups are constant time .
We hash the string identifier to get an Index and then use that Index to find the appropriate Offsets for its data .
These vectors are sequential on disk , rather than using continuation tables or something similar , which makes constant time lookups possible .
Note : Like all things in the real world , “ constant time ” really means , “ constant time in the parts we see , under cooperative conditions , if the operating system does n’t have to do anything like figure out where that disk record actually is , so probably not really constant time , but still about as fast as you can get . ”
Linear hashing is another important component of our lookup scheme .
Linear hashing is a special sort of hash table that basically does dynamic expansion rather than having to reallocate the hash - slot array every time the data gets too big and futz around with reorganizing things .
We also having a mechanism for letting our hash - table cooperate with our data files so that it handles inserting and removing data from them in addition to keeping track of where they are .
IndexVector The Great and Its Team of Sneaky Locks
So , now we finally return to the IndexVector .
Since you ’ve probably dozed off a couple times in this pile of wordiness , I ’ll remind you of its function — the IndexVector is what keeps track of links between items .
“ Bob purchased The Beegees Greatest Hits ” is a link between Bob and said album .
Bob has an index and the album has an index .
In Bob ’s list of “ links ” , which is an IndexVector , we ’ll put the value of the Beegee ’s Greatest Hits .
If you ’re doing traversal heavy graph - applications , like , say , finding related content , how you deal with those links is your where the rubber hits the road .
Most of your performance lies in accessing these links .
So , since we ’re using mmaped I / O we have no syscall overhead for grabbing this stuff from the disk .
We also have no copy that must take place to get the data from kernel space to user space .
Two points for us .
But what we want to do is to Try Real Hard to make sure that we do n’t copy it at all in the common case .
So our IndexVector class is really just a pointer to a place on the disk where it can read the data from and then it casts that data into indexes when we do things like someIndexVector [ 4 ] .
Simple , right ?
Yeah , mostly .
But there ’s a catch .
You see , IndexVectors are sometimes changed .
Like , if Bob buys another album , we ’ve got to update that vector .
To make things worse , sometimes they get bigger and get moved to a whole other part of the file where there ’s room for it now .
Unlike our other data types ( strings , binary blobs and all that ) we access IndexVectors a lot , so we do n’t want to just copy the data every time there ’s an access .
( We tried , slowed down the whole engine by 40 % . )
So , we get sneaky .
You see , most of the time we can go about just willy - nilly accessing the IndexVector from its disk position and assume that nothing ’s changing behind its back .
We have a similar array of mutexes ( 8 of them , to be precise ) for our IndexVectors .
When a read request comes in , an IndexVector adds itself to a list of active readers and goes about reading stuff from the disk .
Now , the magic happens when a write lock comes in .
We do n’t want our writes or our reads to block on these Very Important Pieces Of Data , so what the write lock does is first copy the old data from that record into memory and then go through the list of active readers and do a swaperoo on the data pointer .
The readers are now pointing to an in - memory copy of the data , rather than the disk - based version .
It can then go on writing and moving and generally doing whatever it wants with the disk based copy .
The lock also keeps a copy of the pre-write version of the data in memory so that all readers that come in and try to get a lock on that record get the in -memory version until the write is done .
This leaves us with somewhat more lax consistency than one would expect from an ACID - compliant database , but for our applications that ’s fine .
Like , if our recommendations - fu has missed the item that you rated a couple milliseconds ago when computing product recommendations for the next page , no planes will crash and no babies will be harmed .
On the plus side this means that the only case where a read or write on IndexVectors will have to wait is in the case of two threads trying to write to the same item .
Them ’s the real guts of our database , but I ’ll leave you with a couple provisos for extra credit :
Every Bit Is Sacred
Conventional wisdom in modern programming is not to get hung up on using a few bytes here or there and just get on with writing your code .
And it ’s right .
But when you ’re working on low - level , high - performance I/O , every bit is sacred .
The reason is that every bit is extra data is extra page misses and extra page misses means more waiting on the big spinning magnet that is the bottleneck in almost everything that touches it .
These things also come out of the woodwork when you ’re multiplying every extraneous bit by several million .
If we were to increase the amount of space used for one of our indexes by one byte storing the wikipedia link structure would take 114 more megabytes .
So we get a little trigger happy with our friendly neighborhood binary operators .
We combine weights and indexes into the same field using the upper 4 bits of the item index to store the weight .
Our malloc implementation uses 8 - byte alignment , so we use the extra 3 bits at the bottom end of of the address for flags .
By thinking up clever ways of putting the squeeze on data we have databases that are 40 % smaller , which means a lot less page misses and a much faster database .
What About Matrices ?
I Though Recommender Systems Were Based On Linear Algebra .
The difference between a weighted graph and a sparse matrix is mostly one of visualization rather than of data .
We conceptualize a matrix to be something different than a graph — a matrix is a huge field of rows and columns and a graph a sprawling series of interconnections , but in fact , a sparse matrix and a weighted graph are almost the same thing and easily convertible when viewed from a data - perspective .
So , if we ’re thinking of a user ’s product ratings as a sparse vector that maps to each product , we can easily model that as a series of weighted edges from the user to each product .
In fact , it ’d be difficult to produce a tighter format for storing a sparse matrix than a list of connections since we ’re able to avoid things like pointers to the next used vector dimension and munge the weights into the same integer value that we use to represent a graph edge .
Beyond that , a graph model allows for us to do some more wild clustering than you ’d typically get if you ’re imagining the ratings set as a matrix .
We can look at things that are not just one , but a couple levels out in the connection structure to figure out how things are related .
This is one of the mechanisms that we use to mitigate the “ cold start ” problem that is endemic to typical collaborative filtering algorithms .
Al fine
I ’m tired of writing , you ’re tired of reading .

title : " If TV Science was more like REAL Science " - originally published 4/6/2009
Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward had one of the greatest scoops of all time .
Two former New York Times journalists have admitted that they let slip one of the biggest stories of all time - the Watergate scandal .
They knew first that senior government figures - including President Richard Nixon - were involved .
Robert Smith told his editor , Robert Phelps , but the story was dropped .
The scoop was left to Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein at the Washington Post , whose investigation was made into the film All the President 's Men.
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The story began on 17 June , 1972 , when a group of men were caught breaking into the Watergate complex in Washington DC .
They were attempting to plant listening devices in the offices of the Democratic National Committee .
Robert Smith says that two months later - on his last day at the New York Times - he had lunch with the acting director of the FBI , L Patrick Gray .
He just looked me in the eyes , I looked him in the eyes , and in my world of journalism , that was confirmation
Robert M Smith
Former New York Times reporter
In an interview with the BBC , Mr Smith recounts how Mr Gray began divulging details of the Watergate break - in , a range of other illegal political activity , and the Nixon administration 's attempts to cover it up .
Mr Gray said that those involved included the former Attorney General John Mitchell and Donald Segretti , who were helping to run President Nixon 's re-election campaign .
Both were eventually sent to jail .
But Mr Smith wanted more .
" I said : ' Does it go higher ? '
And he looked and me , and I said : ' Well , the President ? , ' in some disbelief .
" And he just looked me in the eyes , I looked him in the eyes , and in my world of journalism , that was confirmation . "
He rushed back to the New York Times ' Washington bureau , and told all to his editor , Robert Phelps .
Search for meaning
The next day Mr Smith left the newspaper for a course at Yale Law School .
" I continued to read the newspaper and I did not see the story .
I could only assume that the Times had found the story not to be true , " he said .
Mr Phelps confirms
Mr Smith 's account of events in his newly - published memoirs God and the Editor : My Search for Meaning at The New York Times .
Now aged 89 , he says he cannot remember why the hot tip was not followed up .
A week after his conversation with Mr Smith in 1972 , he went away on a month 's holiday .
It was left to Mr Woodward and Mr Bernstein , at the rival Washington Post , to win fame and fortune with their Watergate investigation .
Their source , " Deep Throat " , was later revealed to be Mark Felt , Patrick Gray 's deputy at the FBI .
Their dogged determination traced the scandal right up to the White House .
President Nixon resigned in disgrace in August 1974 .
Mr Smith , now a lawyer in San Francisco , is sanguine about Mr Woodward and Mr Bernstein 's success .
" They completely deserve it .
They are entirely entitled to the wonderful fruits of their excellent efforts , " he said .

The Deflationary Downturn
Stocks and oil both held steady on Friday .
Gold , however , took a big hit – minus $ 26 .
There are three kinds of money in the marketplace .
There ’s the smart money that goes with the trend .
There ’s the dumb money that bets against the trend .
And there ’s the money that does n’t know whether it is coming or going .
The trouble is always figuring out which is which .
The markets are clearly in a deflationary downturn .
No doubt about it .
After a long period of credit expansion credit is finally contracting .
The smart money is probably betting on lower asset prices .
“ Consumer credit falls the second most on record , ” reported Bloomberg last Thursday .
Houses , as everyone knows , are deflating .
There are signs that the fall in housing prices is becoming less violent , but the trend is still down .
This from Robert Shiller , in the New York Times :
“ Long declines do happen with some regularity .
And despite the uptick last week in pending home sales and recent improvement in consumer confidence , we still appear to be in a continuing price decline .
“ There are many historical examples .
After the bursting of the Japanese housing bubble in 1991 , land prices in Japan ’s major cities fell every single year for 15 consecutive years .
“ Why does this happen ? ”
Shiller goes on to explain that housing markets do n’t adjust quickly .
People make their housing decisions years in advance … based on changes in their lives .
They may have found a job somewhere …or gotten a divorce …or their children may have left home …or they might just want to live in a different area .
These plans take years to come together …and years to execute .
They can be reversed by changes in market conditions … but not quickly .
And then , when people are planning to sell a house , they may not be in a hurry .
If prices slip , they may decide to hold off – maybe for years .
Then too , decisions about buying or selling a house are often decisions taken by two people together .
The husband may be desperate to get out of a sinking housing market , for example , but the wife may not want to leave her home .
Even when they must sell for financial reasons , that decision can take months …even years … to reach .
Often , they hesitate .
The wife expects to get a better job …or the husband expects a raise …or they anticipate some other economic change in their lives that would forestall the need to sell their house .
Then , after the decision is made , there ’s the actual process of selling a house — setting a price … and finding a willing buyer .
In a downward market , buyers ’ expectations tend to adjust most quickly .
Reading in the paper about a correction in the housing market , the prospective buyer expects a great deal .
The prospective seller , on the other hand , tends to deny the severity of the downturn .
He reluctantly and belatedly acknowledges that he ’ll need to lower his price .
But as he gives in the market gives way further .
The prospective buyer hears about more great deals that other buyers are getting … and he lowers his price targets even faster than the sellers lower their asking price .
Shiller gives another example …
“ An elderly couple who during the boom were holding out against selling their home and moving to a continuing - care retirement community have decided that it ’s finally the time to do so .
It may take them a year or two to sort through a lifetime of belongings and prepare for the move , but they may never revisit their decision again .
“ As a result , we will have a seller and no buyer , and there will be that much less demand relative to supply – and one more reason that prices may continue to fall , or stagnate , in 2010 or 2011 .
“ All of these people could be made to change their plans if a sharp improvement in the economy got their attention .
The young couple could change their minds and decide to buy next year , and the elderly couple could decide to further postpone their selling .
That would leave us with a buyer and no seller , providing an upward kick to the market price … .
“ Even if there is a quick end to the recession , the housing market ’s poor performance may linger .
After the last home price boom , which ended about the time of the 1990 - 91 recession , home prices did not start moving upward , even incrementally , until 1997 . ”
We ’re also looking at $ 2.4 trillion worth of Alt - A mortgages that will need to be refinanced or reset .
The peak in those resets wo n’t happen until January 2013 .
So stay tuned … this housing bear market is n’t going away any time soon .
Housing is wealth for America ’s middle class .
As long as housing is going down – or even NOT going up – the middle class is going to feel poor .
It has the huge debts that it built up during the credit expansion … and it has to pay them , even though it has 1 ) falling incomes … and 2 ) falling assets .
The smart money is probably betting that this deflationary correction has further to go…probably much further to go .
But against this natural , normal — and probably inevitable — market trend are the hopes and fantasies of an entire generation .
The baby boomers have staked their futures on continuing EZ credit .
So have their leaders .
And so now , the feds and the voters are of one mind .
Both want to stop the market correction AT ALL COST – especially if they can lay the bill onto the next generation .
Now , here ’s where it gets interesting .
Because the dumb money is probably betting that the feds can make this work .
That ’s what all this talk of “ green shoots ” is about .
A huge part of the public believes that the ‘ worst is over ’… and that the feds ’ policies are working .
They ’re buying stocks in the belief that this is a recession just like any recession of the post - war period .
Ben Bernanke says it will be over by Christmas ; they believe him .
Meanwhile , there are some very smart people who think the feds ’ efforts not only wo n’t work … but will create an even bigger disaster .
Those people are buying gold … and commodities .
David Einhorn , the hedge fund manager who foresaw Lehman Bros.
going broke , is now buying gold .
John Paulson , who made billions by being right about the credit crisis , is also buying gold .
The Chinese are buying gold .
So many smart people are buying gold coins that they have become hard to get .
What ’s our view ?
Who ’s right ?
The dumb money ; the smart money ; or the very smart money ?
They may be all right … but at different times .
This rally could last a while longer .
Then , prices will probably resume their downward path … and then , eventually , inflation fears will send gold soaring .
We continue to answer the question – “ will we have inflation or deflation ” – in the positive .
‘ Yes , ’ we say , ‘ both of them . ’
The markets must fully express themselves – which means they need to bounce … and then take the stuffing out of asset prices .
Today ’s asset prices represent yesterday ’s economic calculations .
The value of a house , for example , depends the economic conditions of the bubble period , 2002 - 2007 … and on the whole swell of the great post - war credit expansion .
That house price is now adjusting to the post - bubble era…when people have lower living standards and less expectation of a rising housing market .
That adjustment will take many years and eventually leave house prices probably 20 % to 30 % below where they are today .
But the feds must fully express themselves too .
They ’re bound and determined to cause inflation .
They believe the country ’s financial future depends on it .
It may take them a long time to get the upper hand in their war against capitalism … but eventually , they will do it .
And eventually , the very smart money will be proven right – when the dollar collapses … and gold goes up .
Regards ,
Bill Bonner
The Daily Reckoning
History of Search Engines : From 1945 to Google Today
As We May Think ( 1945 ) :
The concept of hypertext and a memory extension really came to life in July of 1945 , when after enjoying the scientific camaraderie that was a side effect of WWII , Vannevar Bush 's As We May Think was published in The Atlantic Monthly .
He urged scientists to work together to help build a body of knowledge for all mankind .
Here are a few selected sentences and paragraphs that drive his point home .
Specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress , and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial .
The difficulty seems to be , not so much that we publish unduly in view of the extent and variety of present day interests , but rather that publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record .
The summation of human experience is being expanded at a prodigious rate , and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was used in the days of square - rigged ships .
A record , if it is to be useful to science , must be continuously extended , it must be stored , and above all it must be consulted .
He not only was a firm believer in storing data , but he also believed that if the data source was to be useful to the human mind we should have it represent how the mind works to the best of our abilities .
Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of the systems of indexing .
...
Having found one item , moreover , one has to emerge from the system and re-enter on a new path .
The human mind does not work this way .
It operates by association .
...
Man cannot hope fully to duplicate this mental process artificially , but he certainly ought to be able to learn from it .
In minor ways he may even improve , for his records have relative permanency .
Presumably man 's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his own shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems .
He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory .
He then proposed the idea of a virtually limitless , fast , reliable , extensible , associative memory storage and retrieval system .
He named this device a memex .
Gerard Salton ( 1960s - 1990s ) :
Gerard Salton , who died on August 28th of 1995 , was the father of modern search technology .
His teams at Harvard and Cornell developed the SMART informational retrieval system .
Salton ’s Magic Automatic Retriever of Text included important concepts like the vector space model , Inverse Document Frequency ( IDF ) , Term Frequency ( TF ) , term discrimination values , and relevancy feedback mechanisms .
He authored a 56 page book called A Theory of Indexing which does a great job explaining many of his tests upon which search is still largely based .
Tom Evslin posted a blog entry about what it was like to work with Mr. Salton .
Ted Nelson :
Ted Nelson created Project Xanadu in 1960 and coined the term hypertext in 1963 .
His goal with Project Xanadu was to create a computer network with a simple user interface that solved many social problems like attribution .
While Ted was against complex markup code , broken links , and many other problems associated with traditional HTML on the WWW , much of the inspiration to create the WWW was drawn from Ted 's work .
There is still conflict surrounding the exact reasons why Project Xanadu failed to take off .
The Wikipedia offers background and many resource links about Mr. Nelson .
Advanced Research Projects Agency Network :
ARPANet is the network which eventually led to the internet .
The Wikipedia has a great background article on ARPANet and Google Video has a free interesting video about ARPANet from 1972 .
Archie ( 1990 ) :
The first few hundred web sites began in 1993 and most of them were at colleges , but long before most of them existed came Archie .
The first search engine created was Archie , created in 1990 by Alan Emtage , a student at McGill University in Montreal .
The original intent of the name was " archives , " but it was shortened to Archie .
Archie helped solve this data scatter problem by combining a script - based data gatherer with a regular expression matcher for retrieving file names matching a user query .
Essentially Archie became a database of web filenames which it would match with the users queries .
Bill Slawski has more background on Archie here .
Veronica & Jughead :
As word of mouth about Archie spread , it started to become word of computer and Archie had such popularity that the University of Nevada System Computing Services group developed Veronica .
Veronica served the same purpose as Archie , but it worked on plain text files .
Soon another user interface name Jughead appeared with the same purpose as Veronica , both of these were used for files sent via Gopher , which was created as an Archie alternative by Mark McCahill at the University of Minnesota in 1991 .
File Transfer Protocol :
Tim Burners - Lee existed at this point , however there was no World Wide Web .
The main way people shared data back then was via File Transfer Protocol ( FTP ) .
If you had a file you wanted to share you would set up an FTP server .
If someone was interested in retrieving the data they could using an FTP client .
This process worked effectively in small groups , but the data became as much fragmented as it was collected .
Tim Berners - Lee & the WWW ( 1991 ) :
From the Wikipedia :
While an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980 , Berners - Lee proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext , to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers .
With help from Robert Cailliau he built a prototype system named Enquire .
After leaving CERN in 1980 to work at John Poole 's Image Computer Systems Ltd. , he returned in 1984 as a fellow .
In 1989 , CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe , and Berners - Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the Internet .
In his words , " I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the TCP and DNS ideas and — ta-da ! — the World Wide Web " .
He used similar ideas to those underlying the Enquire system to create the World Wide Web , for which he designed and built the first web browser and editor ( called WorldWideWeb and developed on NeXTSTEP ) and the first Web server called httpd ( short for HyperText Transfer Protocol daemon ) .
The first Web site built was at http://info.cern.ch/ and was first put online on August 6 , 1991 .
It provided an explanation about what the World Wide Web was , how one could own a browser and how to set up a Web server .
It was also the world 's first Web directory , since Berners - Lee maintained a list of other Web sites apart from his own .
In 1994 , Berners - Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Tim also created the Virtual Library , which is the oldest catalogue of the web .
Tim also wrote a book about creating the web , titled Weaving the Web .
What is a Bot ?
Computer robots are simply programs that automate repetitive tasks at speeds impossible for humans to reproduce .
The term bot on the internet is usually used to describe anything that interfaces with the user or that collects data .
Search engines use " spiders " which search ( or spider ) the web for information .
They are software programs which request pages much like regular browsers do .
In addition to reading the contents of pages for indexing spiders also record links .
Link citations can be used as a proxy for editorial trust .
Link anchor text may help describe what a page is about .
Link co citation data may be used to help determine what topical communities a page or website exist in .
Additionally links are stored to help search engines discover new documents to later crawl .
Another bot example could be Chatterbots , which are resource heavy on a specific topic .
These bots attempt to act like a human and communicate with humans on said topic .
Parts of a Search Engine :
Search engines consist of 3 main parts .
Search engine spiders follow links on the web to request pages that are either not yet indexed or have been updated since they were last indexed .
These pages are crawled and are added to the search engine index ( also known as the catalog ) .
When you search using a major search engine you are not actually searching the web , but are searching a slightly outdated index of content which roughly represents the content of the web .
The third part of a search engine is the search interface and relevancy software .
For each search query search engines typically do most or all of the following
Accept the user inputted query , checking to match any advanced syntax and checking to see if the query is misspelled to recommend more popular or correct spelling variations .
Check to see if the query is relevant to other vertical search databases ( such as news search or product search ) and place relevant links to a few items from that type of search query near the regular search results .
Gather a list of relevant pages for the organic search results .
These results are ranked based on page content , usage data , and link citation data .
Request a list of relevant ads to place near the search results .
Searchers generally tend to click mostly on the top few search results , as noted in this article by Jakob Nielsen , and backed up by this search result eye tracking study .

Types of Search Queries :
Andrei Broder authored A Taxonomy of Web Search [ PDF ] , which notes that most searches fall into the following 3 categories :
Informational - seeking static information about a topic
Transactional - shopping at , downloading from , or otherwise interacting with the result
Navigational - send me to a specific URL
Improve Your Searching Skills :
Want to become a better searcher ?
Most large scale search engines offer :
Advanced search pages which help searchers refine their queries to request files which are newer or older , local or in nature , from specific domains , published in specific formats , or other ways of refining search , for example the ~ character means related to Google .
which help searchers refine their queries to request files which are newer or older , local or in nature , from specific domains , published in specific formats , or other ways of refining search , for example the ~ character means related to Google .
Vertical search databases which may help structure the information index or limit the search index to a more trusted or better structured collection of sources , documents , and information .
Nancy Blachman 's Google Guide offers searchers free Google search tips , and Greg R.Notess 's Search Engine Showdown offers a search engine features chart .
There are also many popular smaller vertical search services .
For example , Del.icio.us allows you to search URLs that users have bookmarked , and Technorati allows you to search blogs .
World Wide Web Wanderer :
Soon the web 's first robot came .
In June 1993 Matthew Gray introduced the World Wide Web Wanderer .
He initially wanted to measure the growth of the web and created this bot to count active web servers .
He soon upgraded the bot to capture actual URL's .
His database became knows as the Wandex .
The Wanderer was as much of a problem as it was a solution because it caused system lag by accessing the same page hundreds of times a day .
It did not take long for him to fix this software , but people started to question the value of bots .
ALIWEB :
In October of 1993 Martijn Koster created Archie - Like Indexing of the Web , or ALIWEB in response to the Wanderer .
ALIWEB crawled meta information and allowed users to submit their pages they wanted indexed with their own page description .
This meant it needed no bot to collect data and was not using excessive bandwidth .
The downside of ALIWEB is that many people did not know how to submit their site .
Robots Exclusion Standard :
Martijn Kojer also hosts the web robots page , which created standards for how search engines should index or not index content .
This allows webmasters to block bots from their site on a whole site level or page by page basis .
By default , if information is on a public web server , and people link to it search engines generally will index it .
In 2005 Google led a crusade against blog comment spam , creating a nofollow attribute that can be applied at the individual link level .
After this was pushed through Google quickly changed the scope of the purpose of the link nofollow to claim it was for any link that was sold or not under editorial control .
Primitive Web Search :
By December of 1993 , three full fledged bot fed search engines had surfaced on the web : JumpStation , the World Wide Web Worm , and the Repository - Based Software Engineering ( RBSE ) spider .
JumpStation gathered info about the title and header from Web pages and retrieved these using a simple linear search .
As the web grew , JumpStation slowed to a stop .
The WWW Worm indexed titles and URL's .
The problem with JumpStation and the World Wide Web Worm is that they listed results in the order that they found them , and provided no discrimination .
The RSBE spider did implement a ranking system .
Since early search algorithms did not do adequate link analysis or cache full page content if you did not know the exact name of what you were looking for it was extremely hard to find it .
Excite :
Excite came from the project Architext , which was started by in February , 1993 by six Stanford undergrad students .
They had the idea of using statistical analysis of word relationships to make searching more efficient .
They were soon funded , and in mid 1993 they released copies of their search software for use on web sites .
Excite was bought by a broadband provider named @ Home in January , 1999 for $ 6.5 billion , and was named Excite@Home .
In October , 2001 Excite@Home filed for bankruptcy .
InfoSpace bought Excite from bankruptcy court for $ 10 million .
Web Directories :
VLib :
When Tim Berners - Lee set up the web he created the Virtual Library , which became a loose confederation of topical experts maintaining relevant topical link lists .
Global Network Navigator
O'Reilly Media began the GNN project in May 1993 & officially launched it in August 1993 .
It provided an online directory based upon the Whole Internet User 's Guide and Catalog & it was also the first web site to contain clickable advertisements .
Their first advertiser was a law firm named Heller , Ehrman , White and McAuliffe .
GNN was acquired by AOL in 1995 & shuttered in 1996 .
EINet Galaxy
The EINet Galaxy web directory was born in January of 1994 .
It was organized similar to how web directories are today .
The biggest reason the EINet Galaxy became a success was that it also contained Gopher and Telnet search features in addition to its web search feature .
The web size in early 1994 did not really require a web directory ; however , other directories soon did follow .
Yahoo !
Directory
In April 1994 David Filo and Jerry Yang created the Yahoo !
Directory as a collection of their favorite web pages .
As their number of links grew they had to reorganize and become a searchable directory .
What set the directories above The Wanderer is that they provided a human compiled description with each URL .
As time passed and the Yahoo !
Directory grew Yahoo !
began charging commercial sites for inclusion .
As time passed the inclusion rates for listing a commercial site increased .
The current cost is $ 299 per year .
Many informational sites are still added to the Yahoo !
Directory for free .
On September 26 , 2014 , Yahoo !
announced they would close the Yahoo !
Directory at the end of 2014 , though it was transitioned to being part of Yahoo !
Small Business and remained online at business.yahoo.com .
Open Directory Project
In 1998 Rich Skrenta and a small group of friends created the Open Directory Project , which is a directory which anybody can download and use in whole or part .
The ODP ( also known as DMOZ ) is the largest internet directory , almost entirely ran by a group of volunteer editors .
The Open Directory Project was grown out of frustration webmasters faced waiting to be included in the Yahoo !
Directory .
Netscape bought the Open Directory Project in November , 1998 .
Later that same month AOL announced the intention of buying Netscape in a $ 4.5 billion all stock deal .
DMOZ closed on March 17 , 2017 .
When the directory shut down it had 3,861,210 active listings in 90 languages .
Numerous online mirrors of the directory have been published at DMOZtools.
net , ODP.org & other locations .
LII
Google offers a librarian newsletter to help librarians and other web editors help make information more accessible and categorize the web .
The second Google librarian newsletter came from Karen G. Schneider , who was the director of Librarians ' Internet Index .
LII was a high quality directory aimed at librarians .
Her article explains what she and her staff look for when looking for quality credible resources to add to the LII .
Most other directories , especially those which have a paid inclusion option , hold lower standards than selected limited catalogs created by librarians .
The LII was later merged into the Internet Public Library , which was another well kept directory of websites that went into archive - only mode after 20 years of service .
Business.com
Due to the time intensive nature of running a directory , and the general lack of scalability of a business model the quality and size of directories sharply drops off after you get past the first half dozen or so general directories .
There are also numerous smaller industry , vertically , or locally oriented directories .
Business.com , for example , is a directory of business websites .
Business.com was a high - profile purchase for local directory company R.H. Donnelley .
Unfortunately that $ 345 milion deal on July 26 , 2007 only accelerated the bankruptcy of R.H. Donnelley , which let them to sell the Business.com directory to Resource Nation in February of 2011 .
The Google Panda algorithm hit Business.com , which made it virtually impossible for the site to maintain a strong cashflow based on organic search rankings .
Business.com was once again sold in June of 2016 to the Purch Group .
Looksmart
Looksmart was founded in 1995 .
They competed with the Yahoo !
Directory by frequently increasing their inclusion rates back and forth .
In 2002 Looksmart transitioned into a pay per click provider , which charged listed sites a flat fee per click .
That caused the demise of any good faith or loyalty they had built up , although it allowed them to profit by syndicating those paid listings to some major portals like MSN .
The problem was that Looksmart became too dependant on MSN , and in 2003 , when Microsoft announced they were dumping Looksmart that basically killed their business model .
In March of 2002 , Looksmart bought a search engine by the name of WiseNut , but it never gained traction .
Looksmart also owns a catalog of content articles organized in vertical sites , but due to limited relevancy Looksmart has lost most ( if not all ) of their momentum .
In 1998 Looksmart tried to expand their directory by buying the non commercial Zeal directory for $ 20 million , but on March 28 , 2006 Looksmart shut down the Zeal directory , and hope to drive traffic using Furl , a social bookmarking program .
Search Engines vs Directories :
All major search engines have some limited editorial review process , but the bulk of relevancy at major search engines is driven by automated search algorithms which harness the power of the link graph on the web .
In fact , some algorithms , such as TrustRank , bias the web graph toward trusted seed sites without requiring a search engine to take on much of an editorial review staff .
Thus , some of the more elegant search engines allow those who link to other sites to in essence vote with their links as the editorial reviewers .
Unlike highly automated search engines , directories are manually compiled taxonomies of websites .
Directories are far more cost and time intensive to maintain due to their lack of scalability and the necessary human input to create each listing and periodically check the quality of the listed websites .
General directories are largely giving way to expert vertical directories , temporal news sites ( like blogs ) , and social bookmarking sites ( like del.ici.ous ) .
In addition , each of those three publishing formats I just mentioned also aid in improving the relevancy of major search engines , which further cuts at the need for ( and profitability of ) general directories .
Here is a great background video on the history of search .
WebCrawler :
Brian Pinkerton of the University of Washington released WebCrawler on April 20 , 1994 .
It was the first crawler which indexed entire pages .
Soon it became so popular that during daytime hours it could not be used .
AOL eventually purchased WebCrawler and ran it on their network .
Then in 1997 , Excite bought out WebCrawler , and AOL began using Excite to power its NetFind .
WebCrawler opened the door for many other services to follow suit .
Within 1 year of its debuted came Lycos , Infoseek , and OpenText .
Lycos :
Lycos was the next major search development , having been design at Carnegie Mellon University around July of 1994 .
Michale Mauldin was responsible for this search engine and remains to be the chief scientist at Lycos Inc .
On July 20 , 1994 , Lycos went public with a catalog of 54,000 documents .
In addition to providing ranked relevance retrieval , Lycos provided prefix matching and word proximity bonuses .
But Lycos ' main difference was the sheer size of its catalog : by August 1994 , Lycos had identified 394,000 documents ; by January 1995 , the catalog had reached 1.5 million documents ; and by November 1996 , Lycos had indexed over 60 million documents -- more than any other Web search engine .
In October 1994 , Lycos ranked first on Netscape 's list of search engines by finding the most hits on the word ‘ surf .’.
Infoseek :
Infoseek also started out in 1994 , claiming to have been founded in January .
They really did not bring a whole lot of innovation to the table , but they offered a few add on's , and in December 1995 they convinced Netscape to use them as their default search , which gave them major exposure .
One popular feature of Infoseek was allowing webmasters to submit a page to the search index in real time , which was a search spammer 's paradise .
AltaVista :
AltaVista debut online came during this same month .
AltaVista brought many important features to the web scene .
They had nearly unlimited bandwidth ( for that time ) , they were the first to allow natural language queries , advanced searching techniques and they allowed users to add or delete their own URL within 24 hours .
They even allowed inbound link checking .
AltaVista also provided numerous search tips and advanced search features .
Due to poor mismanagement , a fear of result manipulation , and portal related clutter AltaVista was largely driven into irrelevancy around the time Inktomi and Google started becoming popular .
On February 18 , 2003 , Overture signed a letter of intent to buy AltaVista for $ 80 million in stock and $ 60 million cash .
After Yahoo !
bought out Overture they rolled some of the AltaVista technology into Yahoo !
Search , and occasionally use AltaVista as a testing platform .
Inktomi :
The Inktomi Corporation came about on May 20 , 1996 with its search engine Hotbot .
Two Cal Berkeley cohorts created Inktomi from the improved technology gained from their research .
Hotwire listed this site and it became hugely popular quickly .
In October of 2001 Danny Sullivan wrote an article titled Inktomi Spam Database Left Open To Public , which highlights how Inktomi accidentally allowed the public to access their database of spam sites , which listed over 1 million URLs at that time .
Although Inktomi pioneered the paid inclusion model it was nowhere near as efficient as the pay per click auction model developed by Overture .
Licensing their search results also was not profitable enough to pay for their scaling costs .
They failed to develop a profitable business model , and sold out to Yahoo ! for approximately $ 235 million , or $ 1.65 a share , in December of 2003 .
Ask.com ( Formerly Ask Jeeves ) :
In April of 1997 Ask Jeeves was launched as a natural language search engine .
Ask Jeeves used human editors to try to match search queries .
Ask was powered by DirectHit for a while , which aimed to rank results based on their popularity , but that technology proved to easy to spam as the core algorithm component .
In 2000 the Teoma search engine was released , which uses clustering to organize sites by Subject Specific Popularity , which is another way of saying they tried to find local web communities .
In 2001 Ask Jeeves bought Teoma to replace the DirectHit search technology .
Jon Kleinberg 's Authoritative sources in a hyperlinked environment [ PDF ] was a source of inspiration what lead to the eventual creation of Teoma .
Mike Grehan 's Topic Distillation [ PDF ] also explains how subject specific popularity works .
On Mar 4 , 2004 , Ask Jeeves agreed to acquire Interactive Search Holdings for 9.3 million shares of common stock and options and pay $ 150 million in cash .
On March 21 , 2005 Barry Diller 's IAC agreed to acquire Ask Jeeves for 1.85 billion dollars .
IAC owns many popular websites like Match.com , Ticketmaster.com , and Citysearch.com , and is promoting Ask across their other properties .
In 2006 Ask Jeeves was renamed to Ask , and they killed the separate Teoma brand .
AllTheWeb
AllTheWeb was a search technology platform launched in May of 1999 to showcase Fast 's search technologies .
They had a sleek user interface with rich advanced search features , but on February 23 , 2003 , AllTheWeb was bought by Overture for $ 70 million .
After Yahoo !
bought out Overture they rolled some of the AllTheWeb technology into Yahoo !
Search , and occasionally use AllTheWeb as a testing platform .
Meta Search Engines
Most meta search engines draw their search results from multiple other search engines , then combine and rerank those results .
This was a useful feature back when search engines were less savvy at crawling the web and each engine had a significantly unique index .
As search has improved the need for meta search engines has been reduced .
Hotbot was owned by Wired , had funky colors , fast results , and a cool name that sounded geeky , but died off not long after Lycos bought it and ignored it .
Upon rebirth it was born as a meta search engine .
Unlike most meta search engines , Hotbot only pulls results from one search engine at a time , but it allows searchers to select amongst a few of the more popular search engines on the web .
Currently Dogpile , owned by Infospace , is probably the most popular meta search engine on the market , but like all other meta search engines , it has limited market share .
One of the larger problems with meta search in general is that most meta search engines tend to mix pay per click ads in their organic search results , and for some commercial queries 70 % or more of the search results may be paid results .
I also created Myriad Search , which is a free open source meta search engine without ads .
Vertical Search
The major search engines are fighting for content and marketshare in verticals outside of the core algorithmic search product .
For example , both Yahoo and MSN have question answering services where humans answer each other 's questions for free .
Google has a similar offering , but question answerers are paid for their work .
Google , Yahoo , and MSN are also fighting to become the default video platform on the web , which is a vertical where an upstart named YouTube also has a strong position .
Yahoo and Microsoft are aligned on book search in a group called the Open Content Alliance .
Google , going it alone in that vertical , offers a proprietary Google Book search .
All three major search engines provide a news search service .
Yahoo ! has partnered with some premium providers to allow subscribers to include that content in their news search results .
Google has partnered with the AP and a number of other news sources to extend their news database back over 200 years .
And Topix . net is a popular news service which sold 75 % of its ownership to 3 of the largest newspaper companies .
Thousands of weblogs are updated daily reporting the news , some of which are competing with ( and beating out ) the mainstream media .
If that were not enough options for news , social bookmarking sites like Del.icio.us frequently update recently popular lists , there are meme trackers like Techmeme that track the spread of stories through blogs , and sites like Digg allow their users to directly vote on how much exposure each item gets .
Google also has a Scholar search program which aims to make scholarly research easier to do .
In some verticals , like shopping search , other third party players may have significant marketshare , gained through offline distribution and branding ( for example , yellow pages companies ) , or gained largely through arbitraging traffic streams from the major search engines .
On November 15 , 2005 Google launched a product called Google Base , which is a database of just about anything imaginable .
Users can upload items and title , describe , and tag them as they see fit .
Based on usage statistics this tool can help Google understand which vertical search products they should create or place more emphasis on .
They believe that owning other verticals will allow them to drive more traffic back to their core search service .
They also believe that targeted measured advertising associated with search can be carried over to other mediums .
For example , Google bought dMarc , a radio ad placement firm .
Yahoo !
has also tried to extend their reach by buying other high traffic properties , like the photo sharing site Flickr , and the social bookmarking site del.icio.us .
After a couple years of testing , on May 5th , 2010 Google unveiled a 3 column search result layout which highlights many vertical search options in the left rail .
Google shut down their financial services comparison search tool Google Comparison on March 23 , 2016 .
Google has continued to grow their Product Listing Ads , local inventory ads & hotel ads while shedding many other vertical search functions .
When Google shut down their financial comparison search tool they shifted from showing a maximum of 3 ads at the top of the search results to showing a maximum of 4 ads above the organic search results .
Search & The Mobile Web
By 2015 mobile accounted for more than half of digital ad spending .
The online ad market is growing increasingly consolidated with Google & Facebook eating almost all of the growth .
Google 's dominance over desktop search is only increased on mobile , as Google pays Apple to be the default search provider in iOS & Android 's secret contracts bundled Google as the default search option .
Google settled an Android antitrust case in Russia & is being investigated in Europe .
Due to the increasing importance of mobile Google shifted to showing search results in a single column on desktop computers , with the exceptions of sometimes showing knowledge graph cards or graphic Product Listing Ads in the rightt column of the desktop search results .
Ad blocking has become widespread on both mobile devices & desktop computers .
However Google pays AdBlock Plus to allow ads to show on Google.com & Facebook can bypass ad blocking with inline ads in their mobile application .
Most other publishers have had much less luck in dealing with the rise of ad blockers .
As publishers have been starved for revenues , some publishers like Tronc have sacrificed user experience by embedding thousands of auto - playing videos in their articles .
This in turn only accelerates the demand for ad blockers .
Facebook & Google have been in a fight to increase their time on site on mobile devices .
Facebook introduced Instant Articles which ports publisher articles into Facebook , however publishers struggled to monetize the exposure .
Google launched a competing solution called Accelerated Mobile Pages ( AMP ) & publishers also struggled to monetize that audience .
A Post - fact Web
An additional factor which has stripped audience from publisher websites is the increasing number of featured snippets , knowledge graph results & interactive tools embedded directly in Google 's search results .
These features may extract the value of publisher 's websites without sending them anything in return .
And they have also caused issues when Google 's algorthims chose to display factually incorrect answers .
Both Google & Facebook are partly to blame for the decline of online publishing .
As they defunded web publishers it encouraged more outrageous publishing behaviors .
The Internet commoditized the distribution of facts .
The " news " media responded by pivoting wholesale into opinions and entertainment .
— Naval Ravikant ( @naval ) May 26 , 2016
Another contributing factor to the decline of online publishing is how machine learning algorithms measure engagement and fold it back into ranking .
People are more often to share or link to something which confirms their political ideology , while fairly neutral pieces that are not biased may have some analysis in them that almost everyone hates , which means they have a less loyal following & readers are less likely to share their work .
That in turn makes the work less likely to be seen on social networks like Facebook or rank high in Google search results .
Search Engine Marketing
Search engine marketing is marketing via search engines , done through organic search engine optimization , paid search engine advertising , and paid inclusion programs .
Paid Inclusion
As mentioned earlier , many general web directories charge a one time flat fee or annually recurring rate for listing commercial sites .
Many shopping search engines charge a flat cost per click rate to be included in their databases .
As far as major search engines go , Inktomi popularized the paid inclusion model .
They were bought out by Yahoo in December of 2003 .
After Yahoo dropped Google and rolled out their own search technology they continued to offer a paid inclusion program to list sites in their regular search results , but Yahoo Search Submit was ended at the end of 2009 .
Pay Per Click
Pay per click ads allow search engines to sell targeted traffic to advertisers on a cost per click basis .
Typically pay per click ads are keyword targeted , but in some cases , some engines may also add in local targeting , behavioral targeting , or allow merchants to bid on traffic streams based on demographics as well .
Pay per click ads are typically sold in an auction where the highest bidder ranks # 1 for that keyword .
Some engines , like Google and Microsoft , also factor ad clickthrough rate into the click cost .
Doing so ensures their ads get clicked on more frequently , and that their advertisements are more relevant .
A merchant who writes compelling ad copy and gets a high CTR will be allowed to pay less per click to receive traffic .
In 1996 an 18 - year - old college dropout named Scott Banister came up with the idea of charging search advertisers by the click with ads tied to the search keyword .
He promoted it to the likes of Yahoo ! , but their ( lack of ) vision was corrupted by easy money , so they could n't see the potential of search .
The person who finally ran with Mr. Banister 's idea was IdeaLab 's Bill Gross .
Overture ( Formerly GoTo )
Overture , the pioneer in paid search , was originally launched by Bill Gross under the name GoTo in 1998 .
His idea was to arbitrage traffic streams and sell them with a level of accountability .
John Battelle 's The Search has an entertaining section about Bill Gross and the formation of overture .
John also published that section on his blog .
“ The more I [ thought about it ] , the more I realized that the true value of the Internet was in its accountability , ” Gross tells me .
“ Performance guarantees had to be the model for paying for media . ”
Gross knew offering virtually risk - free clicks in an overheated and ravenous market ensured GoTo would takeoff .
And while it would be easy to claim that GoTo worked because of the Internet bubble ’s ouroboros - like hunger for traffic , the company managed to outlast the bust for one simple reason : it worked .
While Overture was wildly successful , it had two major downfalls which prevented them from taking Google 's market position :
Destination Branding : Google allowed itself to grow into a search destination .
Bill Gross decided not to grow Overture into one because he feared that would cost him distribution partnerships .
When AOL selected Google as an ad partner , in spite of Google also growing out their own brand , that pretty much was the nails in the coffin for Overture being the premiere search ad platform .

Bill Gross decided not to grow Overture into one because he feared that would cost him distribution partnerships .

Ad Network Efficiency : Google AdWords factors ad clickthrough rate into their ad costs , which ensures higher relevancy and more ad network efficiency .
As of September 2006 the Overture platform ( then known as Yahoo ! Search Marketing ) still did not fix that problem .
Those two faults meant that Overture was heavily reliant on it's two largest distribution partners - Yahoo ! and Microsoft .
Overture bought out AltaVista and AllTheWeb to try to win some leverage , but ultimately they sold out to Yahoo ! on July 14 , 2003 for $ 1.63 billion .
Google AdWords
Google AdWords launched in 2000 .
The initial version was a failure because it priced ads on a flat CPM model .
Some keywords were overpriced and unaffordable , while others were sold inefficiently at too cheap of a price .
In February of 2002 , Google relaunched AdWords selling the ads in an auction similar to Overture 's , but also adding ad clickthrough rate in as a factor in the ad rankings .
Affiliates and other web entrepreneurs quickly took to AdWords because the precise targeting and great reach made it easy to make great profits from the comfort of your own home , while sitting in your underwear :)
Over time , as AdWords became more popular and more mainstream marketers adopted it , Google began closing some holes in their AdWords product .
For example , to fight off noise and keep their ads as relevant as possible , they disallowed double serving of ads to one website .
Later they started looking at landing page quality and establishing quality based minimum pricing , which squeezed the margins of many small arbitrage and affiliate players .
Google intends to take the trackable ad targeting allowed by AdWords and extend it into other mediums .
Google has already tested print and newspaper ads .
Google allows advertisers to buy graphic or video ads on content websites .
On January 17 , 2006 , Google announced they bought dMarc Broadcasting , which is a company they will use to help Google sell targeted radio ads .
On September 15 , 2006 , Google partnered with Intuit to allow small businesses using QuickBooks to buy AdWords from within QuickBooks .
The goal is to help make local ads more relevant by getting more small businesses to use AdWords .
On March 20 , 2007 , Google announced they were beta testing creating a distributed pay per action affiliate ad network .
On April 13 , 2007 Google announced the purchase of DoubleClick for $ 3.1 billion .
Google AdSense
On March 4 , 2003 Google announced their content targeted ad network .
In April 2003 , Google bought Applied Semantics , which had CIRCA technology that allowed them to drastically improve the targeting of those ads .
Google adopted the name AdSense for the new ad program .
AdSense allows web publishers large and small to automate the placement of relevant ads on their content .
Google initially started off by allowing textual ads in numerous formats , but eventually added image ads and video ads .
Advertisers could chose which keywords they wanted to target and which ad formats they wanted to market .
To help grow the network and make the market more efficient Google added a link which allows advertisers to sign up for AdWords account from content websites , and Google allowed advertisers to buy ads targeted to specific websites , pages , or demographic categories .
Ads targeted on websites are sold on a cost per thousand impression ( CPM ) basis in an ad auction against other keyword targeted and site targeted ads .
Google also allows some publishers to place AdSense ads in their feeds , and some select publishers can place ads in emails .
To prevent the erosion of value of search ads Google allows advertisers to opt out of placing their ads on content sites , and Google also introduced what they called smart pricing .
Smart pricing automatically adjusts the click cost of an ad based on what Google perceives a click from that page to be worth .
An ad on a digital camera review page would typically be worth more than a click from a page with pictures on it .
Google was secretive about its revenue share since the inception of AdSense , but due to a lawsuit in Italy Google feared they would be stuck disclosing their revenue share , so they decided to do so publicly for good public relations on May 24 , 2010 .
Google keeps 32 % while giving publishers 68 % of contextual ad revenues .
On search ads Google keeps 49 % and gives publishers 51 % .
Some premium publishers are able to negotiate higher rates & custom integration options as well .
Yahoo !
Search Marketing / Gemini
Yahoo !
Search Marketing is the rebranded name for Overture after Yahoo ! bought them out .
As of September 2006 their platform is generally the exact same as the old Overture platform , with the same flaws - ad CTR not factored into click cost , it 's hard to run local ads , and it is just generally clunky .
Yahoo !
launched another ad platform named Gemini in 2014 , however they only gave it a small share of their overall search inventory & have relied heavily on Bing Ads for text ads and Google for Product Listing Ads in their search results .
Microsoft AdCenter / Bing Ads
In 2000 Microsoft launched a keyword driven ad program called keywords , but shut it down after 2 months because they feared it would cannibalize their banner ad revenues .
Microsoft AdCenter was launched on May 3 . 2006 .
While Microsoft has limited marketshare , they intend to increase their marketshare by baking search into Internet Explorer 7 .
On the features front , Microsoft added demographic targeting and dayparting features to the pay per click mix .
Microsoft 's ad algorithm includes both cost per click and ad clickthrough rate .
Microsoft also created the XBox game console , and on May 4 , 2006 announced they bought a video game ad targeting firm named Massive Inc .
Eventually video game ads will be sold from within Microsoft AdCenter .
Windows 10 pushes
Bing as a default search tool aggressively , which in turn boosts distribution for Bing search & Bing Ads .
Search Engine Optimization
What is SEO ?
Search engine optimization is the art and science of publishing information in a format which will make search engines believe that your content satisfies the needs of their users for relevant search queries .
SEO , like search , is a field much older than I am .
In fact , it was not originally even named search engine optimization , and to this day most people are still uncertain where that phrase came from .
Early SEO
Early search engine optimization consisted mostly of using descriptive file names , page titles , and meta descriptions .
As search advanced on the page factors grew more important and then people started trying to aim for specific keyword densities .
Link Analysis
One of the big things that gave Google an advantage over their competitors was the introduction of PageRank , which graded the value of a page based on the number and quality of links pointing at it .
Up until the end of 2003 search was exceptionally easy to manipulate .
If you wanted to rank for something all you had to do was buy a few powerful links and place the words you wanted to rank for in the link anchor text .
Search Gets More Sophisticated
On November 15 , 2003 Google began to heavily introduce many more semantic elements into its search product .
Researchers and SEO's alike have noticed wild changes in search relevancy during that update and many times since then , but many searchers remain clueless to the changes .
Search engines would prefer to bias search results toward informational resources to make the commercial ads on the search results appear more appealing .
You can see an example of how search can be biased toward commercial or informational resources by playing with Yahoo !
Mindset .
Curbing Link Spam
On January 18 , 2005 , Google , MSN , and Yahoo ! announced the release of a NoFollow tag which allows blog owners to block comment spam from passing link popularity .
People continued to spam blogs and other resources , largely because search engines may still count some nofollow links , and largely because many of the pages they spammed still rank .
Since 2003
Google has came out with many advanced filters and crawling patterns to help make quality editorial links count more and depreciate the value of many overtly obvious paid links or other forms of link manipulation .
Historical , Editorial , & Usage Data
Older websites may be given more trust in relevancy algorithms than newer websites ( just existing for a period of time is a signal of quality ) .
All major search engines use human editors to help review content quality and help improve their relevancy algorithms .
Search engines may factor in user acceptance and other usage data to help determine if a site needs reviewed for editorial quality and to help determine if linkage data is legitimate .
Navigational or branded search queries may be used as a key signal to authenticate if a site 's link profile was manufactured or authentic .
Sites which people repeatedly seek out by name are sites which generally provide a good user experience .
Google has also heavily pushed giving away useful software , tools , and services like free maps , email , web browser & mobile phone OS which allow them to personalize search results based on the searcher 's historical preferences .
Hypocrisy in Search
Google engineer Matt Cutts frequently comments that any paid link should have the nofollow attribute applied to it , although Google hypocritically does not place the nofollow attribute on links they buy .
They also have placed their ads on the leading Warez site and continued to serve ads on sites that they banned for spamming .
Yahoo !
Shopping has also been known to be a big link buyer .
Much of the current search research is based upon the view that any form of marketing / promotion / SEO is spam .
If that was true , it would n't make sense that Google is teaching SEO courses , which they do .
Self Reinforcing Market Positions
In many verticals search is self reinforcing , as in a winner take most battle .
Jakob Nielsen 's The Power of Defaults notes that the top search result is clicked on as often as 42 % of the time .
Not only is the distribution and traffic stream highly disproportionate , but many people tend to link to the results that were easy to find , which makes the system even more self reinforcing , as noted in Mike Grehan 's Filthy Linking Rich .
A key thing to remember if you are trying to catch up with another website is that you have to do better than what was already done , and significantly enough better that it is comment worthy or citation worthy .
You have to make people want to switch their world view to seeing you as an authority on your topic .
Search engines will follow what people think .
Google
Early Years
Google 's corporate history page has a pretty strong background on Google , starting from when Larry met Sergey at Stanford right up to present day .
In 1995 Larry Page met Sergey Brin at Stanford .
By January of 1996 , Larry and Sergey had begun collaboration on a search engine called BackRub , named for its unique ability to analyze the " back links " pointing to a given website .
Larry , who had always enjoyed tinkering with machinery and had gained some notoriety for building a working printer out of Lego™ bricks , took on the task of creating a new kind of server environment that used low - end PCs instead of big expensive machines .
Afflicted by the perennial shortage of cash common to graduate students everywhere , the pair took to haunting the department 's loading docks in hopes of tracking down newly arrived computers that they could borrow for their network .
A year later , their unique approach to link analysis was earning BackRub a growing reputation among those who had seen it .
Buzz about the new search technology began to build as word spread around campus .
BackRub ranked pages using citation notation , a concept which is popular in academic circles .
If someone cites a source they usually think it is important .
On the web , links act as citations .
In the PageRank algorithm links count as votes , but some votes count more than others .
Your ability to rank and the strength of your ability to vote for others depends upon your authority : how many people link to you and how trustworthy those links are .
In 1998 , Google was launched .
Sergey tried to shop their PageRank technology , but nobody was interested in buying or licensing their search technology at that time .
Winning the Search War
Later that year Andy Bechtolsheim gave them $ 100,000 seed funding , and Google received $ 25 million Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers the following year .
In 1999 AOL selected Google as a search partner , and Yahoo ! followed suit a year later .
In 2000 Google also launched their popular Google Toolbar .
Google gained search market share year over year ever since .
In 2000 Google relaunched their AdWords program to sell ads on a CPM basis .
In 2002 they retooled the service , selling ads in an auction which would factor in bid price and ad clickthrough rate .
On May 1 , 2002 , AOL announced they would use Google to deliver their search related ads , which was a strong turning point in Google 's battle against Overture .
In 2003 Google also launched their AdSense program , which allowed them to expand their ad network by selling targeted ads on other websites .
Going Public
Google used a two class stock structure , decided not to give earnings guidance , and offered shares of their stock in a Dutch auction .
They received virtually limitless negative press for the perceived hubris they expressed in their " AN OWNER'S MANUAL " FOR GOOGLE'S SHAREHOLDERS .
After some controversy surrounding an interview in Playboy , Google dropped their IPO offer range from $ 85 to $ 95 per share from $ 108 to $ 135 .
Google went public at $ 85 a share on August 19 , 2004 and its first trade was at 11:56 am ET at $ 100.01 .
Verticals Galore !
In addition to running the world 's most popular search service , Google also runs a large number of vertical search services , including :
Just Search , We Promise !
Google 's corporate mission statement is :
Google 's mission is to organize the world 's information and make it universally accessible and useful .
However that statement includes many things outside of the traditional mindset of search , and Google maintains that ads are a type of information .
This other information includes :
Paying for Distribution
In addition to having strong technology and a strong brand Google also pays for a significant portion of their search market share .
On December 20 , 2005 Google invested $ 1 billion in AOL to continue their partnership and buy a 5 % stake in AOL .
In February 2006 Google agreed to pay Dell up to $ 1 billion for 3 years of toolbar distribution .
On August 7 , 2006 , Google signed a 3 year deal to provide search on MySpace for $ 900 million .
On October 9 , 2006 Google bought YouTube , a leading video site , for $ 1.65 billion in stock .
Google also pays Mozilla and Opera hundreds of millions of dollars to be the default search provider in their browsers , bundles their Google Toolbar with software from Adobe and Sun Microsystems , and pays AdSense ad publishers $ 1 for Firefox +
Google Toolbar installs , or up to $ 2 for Google Pack installs .
Google also builds brand exposure by placing Ads by Google on their AdSense ads and providing Google Checkout to commercial websites .
Google Pack is a package of useful software including a Google Toolbar and software from many other companies .
At the same time Google helps ensure its toolbar is considered good and its competitors do n't use sleazy distribution techniques by sponsoring StopBadware.org .
Google 's distribution , vertical search products , and other portal elements give it a key advantage in best understanding our needs and wants by giving them the largest Database of Intentions .
Editorial Partnerships
They have moved away from a pure algorithmic approach to a hybrid editorial approach .
In April of 2007 , Google started mixing recent news results in their organic search results .
After Google bought YouTube they started mixing videos directly in Google search results .
Webmaster Communication
Since the Florida update in 2003 Google has looked much deeper into linguistics and link filtering .
Google 's search results are generally the hardest search results for the average webmaster to manipulate .
Matt Cutts ,
Google 's former lead engineer in charge of search quality , regularly blogged about SEO and search .
Google also has an official blog .
Matt Cutts went on leave with Google in 2014 & officially resigned from the company at the end of 2016 .
On November 10 , 2004 , Google opened up their Google Advertising Professional program .
Google also helps webmasters understand how Google is indexing their site via Google Webmaster Central .
Google continues to add features and data to their webmaster console for registered webmasters while obfuscating publicly available data .
For an informal look at what working at Google looked like from the inside from 1999 to 2005 you might want to try Xooglers , a blog by former Google brand manager Doug Edwards .
Information Retrieval as a Game of Mind Control
In October of 2007 Google attempted to manipulate the public perception of people buying and selling links by announcing that they were going to penalize known link sellers , and then manually editing the toolbar PageRank scores of some well known blogs and other large sites .
These PageRank edits did not change search engine rankings or traffic flows , as the PageRank update was entirely aesthetic .
Increasing The Rate of Algorithmic Change
In 2009 Google did an update named the " Vince " update , which placed weight on search query chains , and had the net effect of promoting larger branded websites .
In 2011 Google rolled out their Panda algorithm in an attempt to make it harder to pour low quality content into well linked sites , by allowing the weaker pages to pull down the sites as a whole .
In 2012 Google announced the Penguin update aimed at making search spamming harder .
In 2012 they also rolled out tigher anchor text filters , an algorithm to penalize ad heavy sites , and launched a ranking factor based on how many valid DMCA requests there are against a site .
The net effect of these new algorithms & other forms of obfuscation Google has introduced has been to make it much harder to rank independent websites owned by small companies , while making SEO easier for large companies that have significant usage signals associated with their websites .
This has caused many SEO professionals to chase after servicing large corporate clients , as talent tends to follow the money .
Yahoo !
Getting Into Search
Yahoo ! was founded in 1994 by David Filo and Jerry Yang as a directory of websites .
For many years they outsourced their search service to other providers , considering it secondary to their directory and other content features , but by the end of 2002 they realized the importance and value of search and started aggressively acquiring search companies .
Overture purchased AllTheWeb and AltaVista in 2003 .
Yahoo !
purchased Inktomi in December , 2002 , and then consumed Overture in July , 2003 , and combined the technologies from the various search companies they bought to make a new search engine .
Yahoo !
dumped Google in favor of their own in house technology on February 17 , 2004 .
Getting Social
In addition to building out their core algorithmic search product , Yahoo ! has largely favored the concept of social search .
On March 20 , 2005 Yahoo !
purchased Flickr , a popular photo sharing site .
On December 9 , 2005 , Yahoo !
purchased Del.icio.us , a social bookmarking site .
Yahoo ! has also made a strong push to promote Yahoo !
Answers , a popular free community driven question answering service .
Yahoo ! has a cool Netrospective of their first 10 years , a brief overview of their corporate history here , and Bill Slawski posted a list of many of the companies Yahoo ! consumed since Overture .
On July 2 , 2007 , Yahoo ! launched their behaviorally targeted SmartAds product .
On July 29 , 2009 , Yahoo !
decided to give up on search and signed a 10 year deal to syndicate Bing ads and algorithmic results on their website .
Yahoo ! shut down their directory service in December of 2014 .
In 2014 Yahoo ! signed a deal to be the default search provider in Mozilla Firefox inside the United States .
They also did a distribution deal with Oracle , however those revenue gains were short lived & Yahoo kept losing share in online advertising & web search .
Over the years Yahoo !
not only exited the search business , but they also exited most of their other vertical businesses .
The role of the general purpose web portal was relegated to irrelevancy through the combination of :
general purpose search engines like Google adding interactive features & rich answers directly to their search results
people spending a greater share of their idle web time on social networks like Facebook which offer a highly personalized news feed
the rise of ad blockers & declining CPM rates for display ads
thin outsourced vertical offerings being inferior to the third party data sources & brands which powered them
Verizon announced they were acquiring the Yahoo !
operating business in July of 2016 for $ 4.83 billion .
Microsoft
In 1998 MSN Search was launched , but Microsoft did not get serious about search until after Google proved the business model .
Until Microsoft saw the light they primarily relied on partners like Overture , Looksmart , and Inktomi to power their search service .
They launched their technology preview of their search engine around July 1st of 2004 .
They formally switched from Yahoo !
organic search results to their own in house technology on January 31st , 2005 .
MSN announced they dumped Yahoo !'s search ad program on May 4th , 2006 .
On September 11 , 2006 , Microsoft announced they were launching their Live Search product .
On June 1 , 2009 , Microsoft launched Bing , a new search service which changed the search landscape by placing inline search suggestions for related searches directly in the result set .
For instance , when you search for credit cards they will suggest related phrases like
credit card types
apply for credit cards
credit cards for bad credit
advice on credit cards
Microsoft released a Bing SEO guide for Webmasters [ PDF ] which claimed that the additional keyword suggestions helped pull down search demand to lower listed results when compared against the old results 6 through 10 when using a single linear search result set .
Conversely , the Google format tends to concentrate attention on the top few search listings .
After extensive eye tracking Gord Hotchkiss named this pattern Google 's Golden Triangle .
While Yahoo ! has lost much of their relevance , Bing has built a formidable Google search competitor .
They have narrowed the revenue gap against Google & have built a profitable search business .
Bing is strongest in the US market , while having a lower share outside of the US , in part due to Google driving aggressive installs of Google Chrome from Flash security updates & promoting Chrome across Google properties & the AdSense ad network .
Google is more dominant in moble search than they are in desktop due to
requiring Android phone manufacturers to set Google as the default search provider
signing a deal with Apple to be the default web search service in Safari on iPhones , iPads & Mac computers .
Other Engines
One would be foolish to think that there is not a better way to index the web , and a new creative idea is probably just under our noses .
The fact that Microsoft is making a large investment into developing a new search technology should be some cause for concern for other major search engines .
Through this course of history many smaller search engines have came and went , as the search industry has struggled to find a balance between profitability and relevancy .
Some of the newer search engine concepts are web site clustering , semantics , and having industry specific smaller search engines / portals , but search may get attacked from entirely different angles .
On October 5 , 2004 Bill Gross ( the founder of Overture and pioneer of paid search ) relaunched Snap as a search engine with a completely transparent business model ( showing search volumes , revenues , and advertisers ) .
Snap has many advanced sorting features but it may be a bit more than what most searchers were looking for .
People tend to like search for the perceived simplicity , even if the behind the scenes process is quite complex .
Outside of technology there are four other frontiers search is being attacked / commoditized from
Browser & Software Distribution : Search companies are paying computer manufacturers or software companies an aggregated value of hundreds of millions or billions of dollars each year to bundle their search toolbar with their products .
Search companies are paying computer manufacturers or software companies an aggregated value of hundreds of millions or billions of dollars each year to bundle their search toolbar with their products .
Social Search : Large social networks have significant reach and a ton of page views .
Many years ago Yahoo !
wass rumored to express interest in buying social network Facebook nearly a billion dollars .
Yahoo ! has already bought social picture site Flickr and social bookmarking site Del.icio.us .
In August of 2006 Google signed a 3 year $ 900 million contract to provide search and advertising on MySpace .
In addition some companies , like Eurekster , are trying to create products which allow groups of webmasters to make topic or community specific search services .

Content Providers :
Some content providers are trying to publish content on their own domains and build off their brand .
Some are refusing to be included in search indexes .
Some are requiring a kickback to be indexed .
Some are unsure of what they want and are choosing to sue search engines , either for further brand exposure , or to gain further negotiation leverage .

Some are unsure of what they want and are choosing to sue search engines , either for further brand exposure , or to gain further negotiation leverage .
Content Aggregators : Search is just one way of finding information .
Via RSS feeds and various other technologies many sites are offering what some people consider persistent search , or a way to access any information about a specific topic as it becomes available .
Google also bought YouTube for $ 1.65 in stock .
YouTube consists largely of pirated content which Google can organize and publish ads against based on usage data and other forms of ad targeting .
Some early search pioneers have tried to reboot search , but most these efforts have failed to gain a sustainable marketshare .
Cuil was heavily hyped but quickly bust .
Blekko launched with less hype & lasted longer , but ultimately sold to IBM .
Gigablast was founded in 2000 by Matt Wells .
They are an open source search engine which has quietly existed for nearly 2 decades .
Gabriel Weinberg founded DuckDuckGo in 2008 .
It leverages the core Bing index but differentiates through the search interface & result features .
They have done a great job of consistently growing off a small base & is popular with many web developers in part for their search privacy features & lack of result personalization .
Some foreign markets have dominant local search services .
Yandex is big in Russia .
Baidu leads China .
Naver is popular in South Korea .
Search & Legal Issues
Privacy
In 2005 the DoJ obtained search data from AOL , MSN , and Yahoo !.
Google denied the request , and was sued for search data in January of 2006 .
Google beat the lawsuit and was only required to hand over a small sample of data .
In August of 2006 AOL Research released over 3 months worth of personal search data by 650,000 AOL users .
A NYT article identified one of the searchers by name .
In 2007 the European Union aggressively probed search companies aiming to limit data retention and maintain searcher privacy rights .
Publishing & Copyright Lawsuits
As more people create content attention is becoming more scarce .
Due to The Tragedy of the Commons many publishing businesses and business models will die .
Many traditional publishing companies enjoyed the profits enabled by running what was essentially regionally based monopolies .
Search , and other forms of online media , allow for better targeting and less wasteful / more efficient business models .
Due to growing irrelevancy , a fear of change , and a fear of disintermediation , many traditional publishing companies have fought search .
In an interview by Danny Sullivan , Eric Schmidt stated he thought many of the lawsuits Google face are business deals done in a court room .
Newspapers
In September of 2006 some Belgian newspaper companies won a copyright lawsuit against Google News which makes Belgium judges look like they do not understand how search or the internet work .
Some publisher groups are trying to create an arbitrary information access protocol , Agence France Presse ( AFP ) sued Google to get them to drop their news coverage , and Google paid the AP a licensing fee .
In early 2017 the Wall Street Journal opted out of Google 's first - click free program .
In turn they saw a 44 % decline in organic search traffic & the WSJ saw a fourfold increase in the rate of visitors converting to paying subscribers .
Books
In September of 2005 the Authors Guild sued Google .
In October of 2005 major book publishing houses also sued Google over Google Print .
Photos
Perfect 10 , a pornography company , sued Google for including cached copies of stolen content in their image index , and for allowing publishers to collect income on stolen copyright content via Google AdSense .
Access to Hate Information
In May of 2000 a French judge required Yahoo ! to stop providing access to auctions selling Nazi memorabilia .
Many requests for information removal are covered on Chilling Effects and by the EFF .
Eric Goldman tracks these cases as well .
Pay Per Click & Ad Targeting Lawsuits
In 1999 Playboy sued Excite and Netscape for selling banner impressions sold for searches for Playboy .
Overture sued Google for patent infringement .
Just prior to Google 's IPO they settled with Yahoo !
( who by then bought out Overture ) by giving them 2.7 million shares of class A Google stock .
Geico took Google to court in the US for trademark violation because Google allowed Geico to be a keyword trigger to target competing ads .
Geico lost this case on December 15 , 2004 .
Around the same time Google lost a similar French trademark case filed by Louis Vuitton .
Lane 's Gifts sued Google for click fraud , but did not have a strong well put together case .
Google 's lawyers pushed them into a class wide out of court settlement of up to $ 90 million in AdWords credits .
The March 2006 settlement aimed to absolve Google of any clickfraud related liabilities back through 2002 , when Google launched their pay per click model .
Ads for Shady Products / Services
In 2004 search engines in the United States stopped running ads for online casinos .
In 2009 a US federal government sting operation busted Google for running ads promoting the illegal sale of steroids .
The Chinese search engine Baidu faced domestic regulatory scrutiny after public outrage in response to a kid with cancer dying & blaming his death on a bogus medical procedure marketed via Baidu ads .
The impact on Baidu ad sales was major , driving a year over year decline in spite of rapid growth in web usage inside China .
Baidu was also investigated for running stealth gambling ads at night .
In 2016 Google stopped running payday loan ads in the United States .
Search User Information
The US government requested that major search companies turned over a significant amount of search related data .
Yahoo ! , MSN , and AOL gave up search data .
The Google blog announced that Google fought the subpoena
In August , Google was served with a subpoena from the U. S. Department of Justice demanding disclosure of two full months  worth of search queries that Google received from its users , as well as all the URLs in Googles index .
A judge stated that Google did not have to turn over search usage data .
AOL not only shared information with the government , but AOL research also accidentally made search records public record .
After the AOL data leak fiasco & news of the NSA spying program most major search engines began encrypting user searches with secured search sessions .
DuckDuckGo took things one step further by promising not to track or follow a user , or personalize search reuslts .
Google aggressively tracks Android users & was also fined $ 22.5 million by the FTC for overriding privacy features in Apple 's Safari web browser .
Monopoly
On June 27 , 2017 the European Commission fined Google € 2.42 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules .
The specific fine was for Google 's preferential placement of their shopping search results & the European Commission is still investigating multiple other issues with Google including bundling defualt Android search placement .
Search as a Commoditizer
Each search company has its own business objectives and technologies to define relevancy .
The three biggest issues search engines are fighting are
Publishing Rights :
All search engines are fighting trying to gain the rights to index quality content .
Some of the highest quality content is so expensive to create and market that there is not a business model for openly sharing it on the web .
Worse yet , as more and more people get into web publishing the businesses that delay to get their content indexed will have lost authority and distribution the whole time they delayed .
This , and the fear of disintermediation , are part of the reason there are so many lawsuits .

This , and the fear of disintermediation , are part of the reason there are so many lawsuits .
Distribution :
The more distribution you have the more profit you can use to leverage the ability to buy more content or make better content partnerships .
Also more distribution means that you can potentially send more visitors ( and thus profit ) to a person who lets you index their content .
More usage data may also help engines improve their relevancy algorithms .

Also more distribution means that you can potentially send more visitors ( and thus profit ) to a person who lets you index their content .
More usage data may also help engines improve their relevancy algorithms .
Ad Network Size & Efficiency : Efficient ad networks can afford to pay for more distribution , and thus help the search company gain more content and distribution .
In order to try to lock users in search engines offer things like free email , news search , blogging platform , content hosting , office software , calendars , and feature rich toolbars .
In some cases the software or service is not only free , but it is expensive to provide .
For example , Google does not profit from Google news , but they had to pay the AP content licensing fees , and hosting Google Video can't be cheap .
In an attempt to collect more data , better target ads , and improve conversion rates Google offers
a free analytics product
free cross platform tracking
free Wifi internet access in San Francisco and Mountainview
a free wallet product which makes it quick and easy to buy products
The end goal of search is to commoditize the value of as many brands and markets as possible to keep adding value to the search box .
They want to commoditize the value of creating content and increase the value of spreading ideas , the value of attention , and the importance of conversion .
As they make the network more and more efficient they can eat more and more of the profits , which was a large part of the reasoning behind Jakob Nielson 's Search Engines as Leeches on the Web .
Selling Search as an Ecosystem
Because search aims to gain distribution by virtually any means possible the search engines that can do the best job of branding and get people to believe most in their goals / ideals / ecosystem win .
Search engines are fighting many ways on this front , but not all of them are even on the web .
For example , search engines are trying to attract the smartest minds by sharing research .
Google goes so far as offering free pizza !
Google hires people to track webmaster feedback across the web .
Matt Cutts frequently blogs about search and SEO because to him it is important for others to see search , SEO , and Google from his perspective .
He offers free tips on Google Video in no small part because it was important for Google Video to beat out YouTube for Google to become the default video platform on the web .
Once it was clear that Google lost the video battle to YouTube Google decided to buy them .
Beyond just selling their company beliefs and ideology to get people excited about their field , acquire new workers , and get others to act in a way that benefits their business model search engines also provide APIs to make portions of their system open enough that they can leverage the free work of other smart , creative , and passionate people .
Selling search as an ecosystem goes so far that Google puts out endless betas , allowing users to become unpaid testers and advocates of their products .
Even if the other search engines matched Google on relevancy they still are losing the search war due to Google 's willingness to take big risks , Google 's brand strength , and how much better Google sells search as an ecosystem .
Extending Search
Google wants to make content ad supported and freely accessible .
On October 9 , 2006 , Google announced they were acquiring YouTube for $ 1.65 billion in stock .
In March , 2007 , Viacom sued Google / YouTube for $ 1 billion for copyright infringement .
In 2007 Microsoft pushed against Google 's market position calling Google a copyright infringer ( for scanning books ) and doing research stating that many of Google 's blogspot hosted blogs are spam .
Social Search
In 2006 and 2007 numerous social bookmarking and decentralized news sites became popular .
Del.icio.us , a popular social bookmarking site , was bought out by Yahoo .
Digg.com features fresh news and other items of interest on their home page based on user votes .
Text REtrieval Conference ( TREC ) :
In 1992 TREC was launched to support research within the information retrieval community by providing the infrastructure necessary for large - scale evaluation of text retrieval methodologies .
In addition to helping support the evolution of search they also create special tracks for vertical search and popular publishing models .
For example , in 2006 they created a blog track .
Past TREC publications are posted here .
Other Search Conferences :
There are a number of other popular conferences covering information retrieval .
Search Science lists a number of conferences on the right side of the Search Science blog .
There are also a number of conferences which talk about search primarily from a marketer 's perspective .
The three most well known conferences for are

Bellator does it again !
Another amazing highlight .
This time it ’s Nick Pace and his flying knee KO of Collin Tebo at Bellator XI .
The UK Internet provider Virgin has struck a deal with Universal to offer their customers unlimited DRM - free music at a fixed monthly rate .
As part of the deal Virgin committed to doing everything in their power to prevent people from sharing music on its network , including the option of disconnecting persistent offenders .
There really is only one way to stop people from downloading music illegally , and that is to offer an alternative that can compete with file - sharing networks .
Today , Virgin announced a deal where the ISP will offer its customers unlimited access to Universal ’s music library for approximately 10 - 15 pounds a month .
Whether this is a good enough deal to get people off their old file - sharing habit still has to be seen .
Anticipating on the possibility that not all customers will be interested in the monthly subscription service , the deal between Virgin and Universal also includes an anti-piracy section .
That is , Virgin have pledged to go after their customers who share files illegally on BitTorrent and other file - sharing networks .
How exactly Virgin will prevent or discourage illegal file - sharing is unclear but the ISP itself will not spy on the download behavior of its customers or intercept traffic .
Instead , they plan to warn those who download copyrighted content , based on evidence provided by third party tracking companies .
Those who receive multiple warnings will experience a suspension in their Internet connection , lasting from “ a few minutes to a few hours . ”
Interestingly , less than a year ago Virgin publicly said that it would never disconnect alleged file - sharers , after they mistakenly threatened some of their customers with such a measure .
There is “ absolutely no possibility ” of being disconnected , the company said at the time .
Clearly they ’ve had a change of heart .
In addition to this temporary disconnection , repeat infringers might face speed bumps or humps , meaning that their Internet speed could be decreased significantly , a measure that probably wont be very effective as a deterrent .
The music industry is nevertheless happy with the deal and hope that many ISPs will follow Virgin ’s lead .
“ This is the kind of partnership between a music company and an Internet service provider that is going to shape the future for the music business internationally , ” IFPI chairman and chief executive John Kennedy told Reuters commenting on the new deal , adding “ It also marks new ground in ISPs ’ willingness to take steps to protect copyrighted content on their networks , and that sets a very encouraging example to the whole industry . ”
Geoff Taylor , head of the BPI was equally delighted about the deal and told the BBC : “ It is very encouraging to see an ISP and a record label working together as creative partners .
At the same time , the fact that Virgin Media will apply a graduated response system to tackle persistent illegal downloaders demonstrates that graduated response is a proportionate and workable way forward . ”
Tomorrow the UK government will release the final version of the Digital Britain report where it will come up with detailed solutions on how ISPs and the creative industries should deal with the ‘ piracy problem . ’
Conversely , cannabis use was associated with significantly lowered risk of injury .
Whereas the risk for injuries associated with the use of less than a pipe or joint ’s worth were not significantly different from the on associated with no use , relative risks decreased with increasing levels of use … [ BioMedCentral ]
A new study from Switzerland looked at substance use among people admitted to the hospital with injuries .
Not surprisingly , people who'd been drinking alcohol were more likely to get hurt than those who had not .
But what about marijuana use ?
Not only were marijuana users less likely to be injured than non-users , but risk of injury actually decreased with larger doses .
It 's incredible .
But my point here is n’t that the more pot you smoke the safer you 'll be ( although that is what the data suggests ) .
It was a small sample and I kind of doubt that continued research would confirm a massive reduction in risk of injury among marijuana users .
What matters here is that marijuana clearly does n't raise your risk of doing something stupid and busting your head open or whatever .
What better indication of this could there be than the fact that people who show up all bloody at the emergency room are disproportionately not high on pot ?
The researchers note that marijuana use may sometimes take place in safer environments than alcohol use and that marijuana users as a group might be more careful to avoid risks while under the influence .
I 'm sure both of these points are correct , but to really sum all this up : marijuana just does n’t make you do dumb shit .
The widely - disseminated notion that marijuana leads to impaired judgment is simply false .
Thus , I 'm tempted to conclude that much of the propaganda aimed at associating marijuana with risk - taking behaviors has been motivated by cynicism on the part of our opposition , namely to the effect that they recognized -- and sought to preemptively obscure -- the relative safety of the drug .
One thing that never ceases to amaze me in the marijuana debate is the extent to which anti-pot propaganda is not only false , but is in fact often the precise opposite of the truth .
The World Bank is predicting the global recession will be deeper than it previously thought , with the world economy forecast to shrink 2.9 per cent .
That is far steeper than the 1.7 per cent contraction the World Bank forecast just three months ago .
The large industrial economies of Europe , Japan and the United States are expected to shrink by more than 4 per cent this year , and the bank says the story will be even worse for the world 's poor .
The World Bank 's gloomy set of figures puts further doubt on the ' green shoots ' that so many economic commentators keep referring to - in fact the 2009 forecasts for most economies have been slashed again .
Mick Riordan , a senior economist with World Bank , says there are many impediments to a speedy recovery .
" We 're still left with a lot of problems : with high unemployment rates persisting ; with capacity utilisation , how much is plant and how much equipment is being used at very low levels ; and with fiscal deficits left over from stimulus plans put in place by governments , " he said .
" So this all means we 're going to have these problems with us for several years to come . "
There are also fresh worries about the diminishing flow of private capital into developing countries , which has already fallen by almost 50 per cent this year .
The World Bank says East Asia and the Pacific will be particularly hard hit , and for longer , because of trade links with developed countries .
So too sub-Saharan Africa , which has been hit by falling export prices , a drop in international aid , and a decline in remittances from economic migrants who now have fewer job options overseas .
Mansoor Dailami , the author of the World Bank report , says recovery could take many years .
" The scenario moving forward for the next couple of years is that growth is going to be at subdued levels , investments in many productive sectors , and possibly even in social sectors , as government contracts those expenditures which were very critical for social needs , " he said .
" You 're going to see an increase in the overall poverty in many of these countries . "
However , there will be some growth in the poorer economies , as the World Bank 's Andrew Burns explains .
" We are seeing that some of the strength that we are currently seeing in the global economy is coming from developing countries , particularly Chinese demand for imports is rising relatively rapidly .
That is sparking some of the recovery or some of the stabilisation that we observe in Japan , " he said .
But he also says the sluggish growth is good reason to be cautious .
" Currently almost every high income country in the world , every oeCD country , has got growth at least 4 percentage points below its trend level .
" For developing countries , that same figure , that same calculation comes in about 50 per cent .
We have never seen anything like that in the last 40 or 50 years .
" That means that we are not going to have the capacity to export our way into healthier economies , so all of those factors are part and parcel of why we see the rebound that is coming and is going to be there , it is going to be more muted than normal . "

Aber lest selbst …
[ Das ] konsequente Vorgehen gegen die Verbreitung von Kinderpornographie [ ist ] eine unbedingte Notwendigkeit , denn das Internet darf diesbezüglich kein rechtsfreier Raum sein .
Lüge # 1 : Das Internet ist nicht rechtsfrei .
Der Großteil der Kinderpornographie im Bereich des World - Wide - Web wird mittlerweile über kommerzielle Webseiten verbreitet .
Lüge # 2 und Hauptproblem bei den tragenden Politikern :
Es gibt keinen Massenmarkt , es gibt keinen kommerziellen Vertrieb , es gibt keine Millionenumsätze .
Es sind Einzeltäter und die tauschen in geschlossenen Zirkeln , vornehmlich außerhalb des Internets .
Und die Verantwortlichen sowie Täter nehmen monatlich Millionenbeträge ein .
Wiederholung von Lüge # 2 .
Nur ein geringer Anteil der Kinderpornographie wird über deutsche Server verbreitet .
Lüge # 3 : Das Hauptteil der geschlossenen Zirkel wird in Deutschland gehostet .
Sobald Kenntnis von Darstellungen des sexuellen Missbrauchs auf deutschen Websites oder Servern besteht , geht die Polizei gegen den Inhalteanbieter vor , veranlasst über den Hostprovider die Löschung und wertet Verbindungsdaten aus .
Lüge # 4 : Benutzt man die Sperrlisten anderer Länder , bei denen Deutschland auf Platz 4 des globalen Hostings von blockierten Seiten steht , und sucht sich mal wirklich illegales Material ( was dort selten genug ist ) heraus , so erfolgt die Sperre nach Hinweis an den Provider umgehend .
Diese Listen sind den deutschen Ermittlungsbehörden bekannt , jedoch blieben die Server mehr als ein Jahr weiter online .
Wenn kinderpornographische Angebote von Ausländern oder im Ausland betrieben werden , werden zuständige Behörden und Beschwerdestellen im jeweiligen Land informiert und um vergleichbare Maßnahmen der Täterermittlung oder Beseitigung des Verstoßes gebeten .
Wiederholung von Lüge # 4 : Eine gegenseitige Information findet ganz offenbar nicht statt .
Bundeskriminalamt und die Landeskriminalämter leisten im Inland hervorragende Arbeit .
An dieser Stelle möchte ich die zuständigen Ermittler wirklich loben : Bitte machen Sie ihre Arbeit weiterhin und lassen
Sie sich nicht durch wahlkampftaktische Verwirrspiele dazu verleiten , nun spanische Wände vor die Verbrechen zu stellen , anstatt die Täter zu ergreifen und die Tat zu unterbinden .
Viel Erfolg .
Die häufigen Meldungen in der Presse über ausgehobene Kinderpornographie - Ringe belegen das .
Alle diese Erfolge belegen , daß die Aktivitäten nicht über das öffentliche Web stattfanden .
Es waren immer geschlossene Zirkel .
Trotz aller nationalen und internationalen Anstrengungen bleiben viele Kinderpornographie - Seiten im Netz verfügbar .
Es gelingt in vielen Staaten nicht , Betreiber kinderpornographischer Angebote ( sog. Content - Provider ) haftbar zu machen oder ihnen die Plattform ( über sog .
Host - Provider ) zu entziehen .
Wiederholung von Lüge # 4 :
So gelesen wäre diese Aussage : „ Wir sind unfähig . “
Die derzeitige Diskussion um die Erschwerung des Zugangs zu kinderpornographischen Inhalten bezieht sich auf angebotene Webseiten , auf denen diese Inhalte gewerblich angeboten werden .
Lüge # 5 : Derartige Seiten sind nicht bekannt .
Sie tauchen in keiner der Blockadelisten irgendwelche Staaten auf .
Die Ermittler und in dem Feld tätigen Anwälte wissen nichts von derartigen Seiten .
Betrifft die ganze Diskussion nur nichtexistente Seiten ?
Heiße Luft im Wahlkampf ?
Es handelt sich dabei um eine Form der schweren und organisierten internationalen Kriminalität , über die das Bundeskriminalamt im Rahmen seiner Zentralstellenfunktion Informationen sammelt .
Die dort derzeit vorhandenen Informationen beziehen sich auf ca. 1000 solcher Webseiten .
Diese Webseiten werden derzeit jedoch nicht auf gesonderten Listen geführt .
Wiederholung von Lüge # 5 : Soll das heißen , daß das BKA seit Jahren über schwere , organisierte , internationale Kriminalität Bescheid weiß und kein anderes Land darüber benachrichtigt hat ?
Da in der Hälfte aller Länder Besitz und Verbreitung von Kinderpornographie entweder nicht einmal unter Strafe stehen oder nicht ausreichend sanktioniert werden , reichen in vielen Fällen polizeiliche Mittel nicht aus .
Lüge # 6 : Der Anteil der Länder , in denen die Rechslage nicht ausreicht , und die für das Thema Hosting im Internet überhaupt in Frage kommen , ist deutlich kleiner als 1 % .
Dann bleibt nur die Sperrung als letztes Mittel .
Ein Vorgehen gegen den Inhalteanbieter und damit eigentlich vorrangig in Anspruch zu nehmenden Verantwortlichen scheitert in diesen Fällen daran , dass der für die Inhalte Verantwortliche im Ausland niedergelassen ist .
Wiederholung von Lüge # 4 : Eine derartige gegenseitige Information die zur Ergreifung der Täter führen könnte wird offenbar aktiv unterlassen .
Zwar ist die Informationsfreiheit in Deutschland ein hohes Gut mit Verfassungsrang .
Jedoch geht es hier um die Erschwerung des Zugriffs auf Webseiten mit kinderpornographischen Inhalten .
Nach dem Strafgesetzbuch sind sowohl die Verbreitung als auch der Erwerb und Besitz von Kinderpornographie strafbar .
Lüge # 7 : Die Gleichsetzung von Kindesmißhandlung mit sexuellem Hintergrund mit den Verbreitungsdelikten bis hin zur Jugendanscheinspornographie ist eine unzulässige Vermischung von Straftatbeständen unterschiedlicher Schwere , die in keinem Fall einen derartigen Grundrechtseingriff rechtfertigt .
Die vorgeblich rechtfertigende Straftat wird durch Grundrechtseingriff nicht verhindert oder beeinträchtigt , sondern sogar vor Strafverfolgung geschützt .
Andererseits dient der Grundrechtseingriff dazu , die sowieso schon nicht öffentlichen ausgeführten , leichteren Tatbestände der Verbreitungsdelikte besser vor Ermittlungen zu schützen .
Sperrungen werden seit vielen Jahren erfolgreich in Norwegen , Dänemark , Schweden , Finnland , Italien , Großbritannien , der Schweiz , Neuseeland , Südkorea , Kanada und Taiwan durchgeführt , überwiegend auf der Grundlage freiwilliger Selbstverpflichtungen .
Lüge # 8 : Die Tatsache , daß ein Land sperrt , ist nur dann als Argument zulässig , wenn diese Sperre in diesem Land für den vorliegenden Fall ein Erfolg wäre .
Ist es aber nicht .
Keins der Länder bezeichnet die Sperre als Erfolg , im Gegenteil , es behindert die Ermittlungen und beeinträchtigt die Straftaten gar nicht .
Die jahrelangen Erfahrungen der Länder , die bereits Zugangssperren eingerichtet haben , zeigen , dass das System funktioniert
Wiederholung von Lüge # 8 .
und täglich Zehntausende an Zugriffen auf kinderpornographische Angebote geblockt werden können .
Lüge # 9 : Bekanntermaßen enthalten die Sperrlisten in anderen Länder weniger als 1 % der hier geplantermaßen betroffnen Seiten , der Rest sind legale Seiten , die oft nichts mit Pornographie in jeder Form zu tun haben , sondern kritische politische Inhalte verbreiten .
Die Gesamtzahl der geblockten Zugriffe ist also nicht die Anzahl der Zugriffe auf illegales Material .
Hier werden Fanatasiezahlen generiert , die beeindrucken sollen .
Sie haben nichts mit der Realität zu tun .
Man könnte es eher so rechnen : Die Bundesregierung möchte 400000 Zugriffe täglich auf politisch kritische Inhalte unterbinden , also im großen Maßstab Zensur ausüben .
Entscheidend ist nicht , dass technisch versierte Internetnutzer immer Wege finden werden , die Sperren zu umgehen .
Lüge # 10 : Die Umgehung der dilletantischen Sperre ist mit einer einfachen Suche nach „ Sperre umgehen Anleitung “ in Sekundenschnelle gefunden und umgesetzt .
Maßgeblich ist vielmehr , dass durch Zugangssperren der Zugang für die große Masse der durchschnittlich versierten Internetnutzer blockiert wird und die harten Fälle auf Nebenwege gezwungen werden .
Statt vor den Möglichkeiten im World - Wide - Web zu resignieren , werden alle Mittel gegen die Verbreitung von Kinderpornographie genutzt .
Wiederholung von Lüge # 5 : Diese Seiten existieren nicht .
Man kann also nicht vesehentlich darüber stolpern .
Die Tauschkanäle sind außerhalb des Web .
Die Bundesregierung sieht sich deshalb in ihrer Auffassung von den Erfahrungen dieser Länder darin bestätigt , dass Sperrungen ein geeignetes Mittel sind , die Reichweite von bekannten kinderpornographischen Websites zu beschränken , wenn andere Mittel versagen .
Wiederholung von Lüge # 8 : Die anderen Länder haben die Erfahnung gemacht , daß es eben ein völlig untaugliches Mittel ist .
Dabei sollten Sperrungen Bestandteil einer Gesamtstrategie gegen den sexuellen Missbrauch von Kindern und seiner Darstellung im Internet sein .
Die Ermittlung der Täter und der Opferschutz sollen dadurch nicht ersetzt , sondern wirksam ergänzt werden .
Lüge # 11 : Die Bundesregierung kürzt seit Jahren die Mittel für Prävention , Strafverfolgung und Opferbetreuung .
Stattdessen betreibt sie untaugliche Symbolpolitik , die das Wegschauen fördert .
So werden Lehrer , die sich an Kindern vergreifen , einfach an andere Schulen versetzt , anstatt zu ermittlen und ggf. zu bestrafen .
Die Bundesregierung strebt die Zusammenarbeit mit diesen Ländern an , um durch internationale Kooperationen zu möglichst effektiven Maßnahmen gegen die sexuelle Ausbeutung von Kindern im Internet zu gelangen und zu einem Austausch der gesperrten Seiten zu kommen .
Lüge # 12 : Die Ausbeutung und Mißhandlung von Kinder erfolgt in der eigenen Familie , nicht im Internet .
Das Familienministerium müßte das aber wissen .
Im Rahmen eines Spitzengesprächs am 13 .
Januar 2009 haben sich Minister Schäuble , Ministerin von der Leyen und Minister Glos mit Vertretern der großen Internetanbieter in Deutschland auf ein zweistufiges Verfahren geeinigt .
Lüge # 13 : Die Provider waren sehr gegen diesen Maßnahme .
Diese Einwände wurden seitens der Ministerin und der Minister schlicht ignoriert .
Damit folgt die Bundesregierung dem Beispiel vieler Länder und Deutschland schließt endlich auf als eines der großen Länder in der EU .
Die Europäische Kommission hat deshalb diesen Schritt ausdrücklich begrüßt .
Abschließende Bemerkung : Der Kampf gegen schwere Kindesmißhandlung ist kein internationaler Wettbewerb , in dem man für die größten Fallzahlen oder höchsten Klickraten oder welche anderer perverser Indikator ihnen da noch einfällt , gelobt wird …
Die entscheidende Kenngröße ist die Anzahl der Taten , die dennoch geschenen .
Auch wenn keiner hinschaut .
TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
A group of 20 to 30 men , carrying clubs and metal pipes , banged on the door of an apartment building in a Tehran neighborhood .
Fresh clashes broke out Sunday between police and protesters in Tehran .
more photos »
The group was agitated .
They chanted and shouted and kept banging on the building 's door .
Inside , they suspected , was a person who had chanted a slogan against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
This scene was witnessed by CNN reporters in Tehran on Sunday .
But in the confusion and controversy that has followed Ahmadinejad 's re-election , many stories like this have been told through social networking Web sites such as Twitter -- despite reports that the Iranian government has clamped down on such services and mobile phones .
The scene was just one involving both sides of the heated debate after Friday 's election .
The landslide defeat of Ahmadinejad 's leading opponent , Mir Hossein Moussavi , who some analysts predicted would win the election , triggered angry protests in Iran and other cities around the world .
Watch how the world is reacting to the elections »
The protests also appeared to trigger a counterreaction from supporters of Ahmadinejad , tens of thousands of whom rallied in central Tehran on Sunday .
" I 'm seeing something that I 've never seen before , " one Moussavi supporter told CNN earlier in the day .
" Young people are getting abused , sabotaged , hit with batons . "
The Moussavi supporter , whose name CNN is concealing for security reasons , reported hearing gunshots and seeing men in plainclothes breaking windows .
Meanwhile , Iranian media has mostly ignored the protests and international journalists have been prevented from covering the demonstrations .
The Islamic republic has ordered the Dubai - based satellite network Al - Arabiya 's Tehran bureau shuttered for a week .
Ahmadinejad told a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters Sunday that Iran 's elections are " the soundest , the healthiest of their kind . "
And he told reporters his country had a free press , and people " can say whatever they like . "
Moussavi 's supporters say the election was rigged .
But the huge turnout for Ahmadinejad 's victory speech Sunday leaves no doubt that the president carries plenty of support .
The streets of Tehran were crowded Sunday with supporters and detractors of Ahmadinejad , as protests and clashes continued for the second day after his re-election .
Protesters lit tires and garbage on fire and crowds milling on the streets , blocking traffic .
Before the victory rally , however , riot police fired tear gas and brandished batons to disperse about 100 stone - throwing protesters from the site of his address .
There were reports of clashes between police and protesters , but many of the injuries were being blamed on groups of Ahmadinejad supporters -- who wore nothing identifying them as police -- who chased Moussavi supporters , as CNN witnessed .
" It 's horrific , shameful and paradoxical to what you see on TV , " the Moussavi supporter said .
Watch Moussavi supporter express anger »
The divide was also seen in cities outside Iran with significant Iranian expatriate populations .
Many Iranians overseas sent in absentee ballots , and the overwhelming sentiment among the demonstrators was their votes had not been counted .
Protests in Washington ; London , England ; Toronto , Canada ; Berlin , Germany ; and Los Angeles , California , each drew several hundred people .
All of them were seemingly anti-Ahmadinejad .
See protests around the world »
Roja Bandari , a University of California student who wore a neckerchief of the green adopted by Moussavi 's supporters , said the demonstrators " wanted to come out and say there are supporters of the reformists everywhere . "
" All the polls and all the predictions were saying that Moussavi was going to win , and Ahmadinejad won with such a landslide , which was something that no one even thought about , " Bandari said .
" Even Ahmadinejad supporters did n't think about that .
And then the way that they gave out the news was very fishy . "
In Washington , about 150 protesters stood outside the Iranian Interests Section for the second day in a row , waving Iranian flags and holding posters demanding votes be accurately counted .
" This is all grassroots .
This is not anything that is particularly recognized .
There 's no political party .
There 's no political agenda , " said protester Babek Talabi .
" These are Iranian - Americans , Iranians around the world who cast their votes and stand with Iranians in Iran and want their votes counted , "
Police gave the protesters a warning to disperse from the area after local businesses complained their entrances were being blocked .
Protesters began marching down the street towards the Lincoln Memorial shortly after the warning .
CNN 's Christiane Amanpour and Samson Desta contributed to this report .

One of the first tricks in Penn and Teller 's Las Vegas show begins when Teller — the short , quiet one — strolls onstage with a lit cigarette , inhales , drops it to the floor , and stamps it out .
Then he takes another cigarette from his suit pocket and lights it .
No magic there , right ?
But then Teller pivots so the audience can see him from the other side .
He goes through the same set of motions , except this time everything is different :
Much of what just transpired , the audience now perceives , was a charade , a carefully orchestrated stack of lies .
He does n't stamp out the first cigarette — he palms it , then puts it in his ear .
There is no second cigarette ; it 's a pencil stub .
The smoke from the first butt is real , but the lighter used on the pencil is actually a flashlight .
Yet the illusion is executed so perfectly that every step looks real , even when you 're shown that it is not .
Penn and Teller demonstrate the seven basic principles of magic .
The trick is called Looks Simple , and the point is that even a puff on a cigarette , closely examined , can disintegrate into smoke and mirrors .
" People take reality for granted , " Teller says shortly before stepping onstage .
" Reality seems so simple .
We just open our eyes and there it is .
But that does n't mean it is simple . "
For Teller ( that 's his full legal name ) , magic is more than entertainment .
He wants his tricks to reveal the everyday fraud of perception so that people become aware of the tension between what is and what seems to be .
Our brains do n't see everything — the world is too big , too full of stimuli .
So the brain takes shortcuts , constructing a picture of reality with relatively simple algorithms for what things are supposed to look like .
Magicians capitalize on those rules .
" Every time you perform a magic trick , you 're engaging in experimental psychology , " Teller says .
" If the audience asks , ' How the hell did he do that ? ' then the experiment was successful .
I 've exploited the efficiencies of your mind . "
Now that on - the - job experimentation has taken an academic turn .
A couple of years ago , Teller joined a coterie of illusionists and tricksters recruited by Stephen Macknik and Susana Martinez - Conde , researchers at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix , Arizona , to look at the neuroscience of magic .
Last summer , that work culminated in an article for the journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience called " Attention and Awareness in Stage Magic . "
Teller was one of the coauthors , and its publication was a signal event in a field some researchers are calling magicology , the mining of stage illusions for insights into brain function .
" Tricks work only because magicians know , at an intuitive level , how we look at the world , " says Macknik , lead author of the paper .
" Even when we know we 're going to be tricked , we still can't see it , which suggests that magicians are fooling the mind at a very deep level . "
By reverse - engineering these deceptions , Macknik hopes to illuminate the mental loopholes that make us see a woman get sawed in half or a rabbit appear out of thin air even when we know such stuff is impossible .
" Magicians were taking advantage of these cognitive illusions long before any scientist identified them , " Martinez - Conde says .
For sleight - of - hand master Teller , magic is a form of experimental psychology .

Penn and Teller are an n of 1 in American culture : avant - garde artists who perform for the Vegas masses , skeptical philosophers who somehow got a cable TV show .
For the past 25 years , they 've played the same characters onstage .
Teller is the silent , impish illusionist — " People are always surprised that I can speak , " he says — while Penn is the hyperkinetic impresario , juggling knives , teasing the audience , and swallowing fire .
These personae reflect the men's offstage personalities .
Penn Jillette is 6 ' 7 " , with a mane of curly black hair .
When he walks , he pounds the floor like a clown in oversize shoes — not surprising , since he graduated from the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Clown College .
Teller is nearly a foot shorter and dresses in dapper three - piece suits .
He has an eerie grace , as if he can move without displacing air .
The two started performing together in 1975 , playing Philadelphia street corners and Renaissance festivals .
Along with a third artist , they called themselves the Asparagus Valley Cultural Society , an absurdist act that mixed knife - juggling with " unusual and disgusting " classical music .
They were not especially popular .
" I always assumed I 'd spend my life happily performing in artsy - fartsy little theaters , " Teller says .
After their first Renaissance gig , where Teller performed in tights and Penn in leather , they were headed back to New Jersey .
To kill some time in a diner , Teller was practicing his version of Cups and Balls , a classic sleight - of - hand trick popularized by ancient Roman conjurers .
It involves a series of " vanishes " and " transpositions " as the balls appear and disappear underneath the cups .
Teller had n't brought any props , so he used wadded - up napkins and clear water glasses .
Penn & Teller demonstrate their version of Cups and Balls .
Somehow , this made the trick even better .
Although it was now possible to follow the crumpled napkins as Teller variously palmed them , squished them , and moved them from cup to cup , the illusion persisted .
" The eye could see the moves , but the mind could not comprehend them , " he says .
" Giving the trick away gave nothing away , because you still could n't grasp it . "
They eventually worked this version of Cups and Balls into their show , and audiences loved it .
But the magic community — whose cardinal rule is " Do n't tell 'em how it 's done " — reacted with outrage and even threats of physical violence .
Penn and Teller were exposing an ancient secret !
Two arty geeks were destroying the mystery !
All that criticism got press attention , which made people want to see Penn and Teller even more .
Before long , they were performing Cups and Balls on Letterman .
The trick became a centerpiece of their first off - Broadway show .
" It was so liberating to be able to treat the audience like intelligent adults , " Teller says .
Instead of engaging in the " usual hocus - pocus clichés , " the clear cups forced the crowd to confront the real source of the illusion : the hard - wired limitations of their own brains .
Because people were literally incapable of perceiving the sleight of hand — Teller 's fingers just moved too fast — it did n't matter that the glasses were transparent .
Penn and Teller still perform Cups and Balls — it 's one of the few old bits in their current Vegas show .
Several of their other pieces take a more direct cue from research on perception .
In the Cowboy trick , an individual from the crowd is given a video camera ; Penn says he 's going to make a tiny plastic cow disappear from his hand , and he asks the audience member to film the vanish as the feed is projected onto a large screen for the rest of the room .
While the mark focuses on Penn 's flamboyant hand gestures — and the impertinently nonvanishing cow — Teller rearranges the entire stage in plain view .
The audience cracks up ; even when the poor sap looks up from the viewfinder , he fails to notice that anything is different .
Richard Wiseman demonstrates the Colour Changing Card Trick .
" The idea for this trick came straight from science , " Teller says .
" We thought it would be fun to show people how bad they are at noticing stuff . "
Called change blindness , the phenomenon is illustrated in a video ( on YouTube ) that inspired the duo .
Shot in 2007 by British psychologist Richard Wiseman , it ostensibly documents a simple card trick — the backs of the cards in a deck are magically transformed from blue to red .
But during the course of the video , Wiseman 's shirt , his assistant 's shirt , the tablecloth , and the backdrop all change color , too .
Most viewers watch the card trick unspool and miss the other alterations .
Attention , it turns out , is like a spotlight .
When it 's focused on something , we become oblivious to even obvious changes outside its narrow beam .
What magicians do , essentially , is misdirect — pivot that spotlight toward the wrong place at the right time .

I made cutout sugar cookies for my dad last year for Father ’s Day in the shape of cowboy boots and hats , but I did n’t have time to do it again this year .
This year , I spent the whole Father ’s Day weekend at work .
( I did the same for Mother ’s Day … so my mom still had n’t gotten her new skillet . )
I decided on Tuesday to celebrate a belated Father ’s Day , but I did n’t have the energy to put into making and icing cutouts again , so I had to think of another recipe that my dad would love .
During my dozen or so reads through the Martha Stewart Cupcake book , I had marked to try the Mint - Filled Brownie Cupcakes .
This sounded like the perfect treat for my dad .
He always has York Peppermint Patties stashed , and he can devour an entire pan of brownies in a day .
Plus , it ’s the perfect excuse to break in my Martha book !
The recipe is totally 1 bowl - simple .
I melted my chocolate and butter in the microwave to make it even easier .
Mix all your other ingredients in the same bowl , fill the cupcake liners halfway , plop a York Peppermint Patty on top , and fill about 2/3 full .
Bake for 35 minutes , and Ta - Da !
Greatness !
I ’m sure these would be wonderful just plain , but I wanted to take the minty goodness even further , so I topped my cupcakes with a thin layer of mint frosting , and drizzled a chocolate glaze over top .
They were so good .
Very fudgy and minty and delicious .
Definitely a brownie to eat with a tall glass of milk to wash down the fudginess .
I took them to my parent ’s , along with my mom ’s Mother ’s Day skillet , but my dad had just had a piece of cake right before we arrived , so the cupcakes were n’t tasted while we were there .
Hopefully I ’ll hear from someone soon about how it went .
I did , however , save a couple for Boyfriend since he did n’t get to try the Chocolate Raspberry Cupcakes I made last week , and he gave them an A +!
But as he found out , if you put them in the fridge , the paper liner kind of sticks …
So go ahead and leave them out at room temperature .
Or pop them in the microwave for a few seconds .
It makes the insides all “ yum and warmy . ”
Apparently they ’re just too good for real words .
Also , the morning I baked , I saw on Twitter that Heavenly Housewife had made some sugar cookies that looked fantastic , so I decided to whip some of those up too to take with me .
My dad is a big fan of sugar cookies , and would constantly steal handfuls of my cutouts , before they were even iced , so I thought these would be perfect !
Simple little yummy sugar cookies that I did n't have to roll out and make icing for !
These did get eaten while I was there , and everyone loved them !
They 're chewy in the center with the edges just a little crunchy .
Mmm !
I ’m definitely going to be making these again !
Just make sure your dough is well chilled before you bake them .
Mine spread a bit , but it was also creeping past 80 degrees in the house at the time ..
But guess what ?
My AC is fixed !!
( We 'll see how long that lasts .. )
So no more sweating in the apartment !
And I 've figured out the secret to getting the maintenance people to show up .
Throw some cookies or cupcakes in the oven .
They seem to magically appear every time I 'm baking something , so I think they 're drawn to the smell of baked goods !
So next time you 're stuck waiting for hours for the cable guy , head over to From Donuts to Delirium for Heavenly Housewife 's recipe , and they 'll be ringing your doorbell in no time .
Thanks HH !
This is the third installment of our “ books that changed the world ” series .
Be sure to read the previous two so that you do n’t think we have missed important books off the list .
If you can think of books that are not on any of the three lists that deserve a mention in future , be sure to tell us about it in the comments .
Here are the original two lists : Top 10 Books That Changed The World , and 10 More Books That Changed The World .
These are in no particular order .
10 Dictionary of the English Language Samuel Johnson
Why it changed the world :
This book ( though not the first dictionary ) was the first to use literary quotations to illustrate the meanings of words .
It set the stage for the scholarly study of language .
Published on 15 April 1755 and written by Samuel Johnson , A Dictionary of the English Language , sometimes published as Johnson ’s Dictionary , is among the most influential dictionaries in the history of the English language .
There was dissatisfaction with the dictionaries of the period , so in June 1746 a group of London booksellers contracted Johnson to write a dictionary for the sum of 1,500 guineas , equivalent to about £ 220,000 as of 2009 .
Johnson took nearly nine years to complete the work , although he had claimed he could finish it in three .
Remarkably , he did so single - handedly , with only clerical assistance to copy out the illustrative quotations that he had marked in books .
Johnson wrote several revised editions during his life .
Until the completion of the Oxford English Dictionary , 150 years later , Johnson ’s was viewed as the pre-eminent English dictionary .
9 The Wealth of Nations Adam Smith
Why it changed the world :
It virtually created modern economics – the free market and competition .
In it , Smith proposes the invisible hand of the market : the pursuit of self - interest can be beneficial to society at large : for example , the Butcher , the Baker , and the Brewer provide goods and services to each other out of self - interest ; the unplanned result of this division of labor is a better standard of living for all three .
An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations is the magnum opus of the Scottish economist Adam Smith .
It is a clearly written account of economics at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , as well as a rhetorical piece written for the generally educated individual of the 18th century – advocating a free market economy as more productive and more beneficial to society .
The work is credited as a watershed in history and economics due to its comprehensive , largely accurate characterization of economic mechanisms that survive in modern economics ; and also for its effective use of rhetorical technique , including structuring the work to contrast real world examples of free and fettered markets .
8 If this is a Man Primo Levi
Why it changed the world :
This book on Levi ’s time in Auschwitz changed man ’s understanding for suffering and gave us an awareness of our unlimited ability to work for good or evil .
If This Is a Man ( United States title : Survival in Auschwitz ) is a work of witness by the Italian author Primo Levi .
It was influenced by his experiences in the concentration camp at Auschwitz during the Second World War .
It can be described as a memoir or a personal narrative , but it goes beyond mere recollection by seeking to consider the human condition in all its extremes through the narrative form .
The first manuscript for If This Is a Man was completed by Levi in December 1946 .
However , in January 1947 , the manuscript was refused by Einaudi .
Despite this , Levi managed to find another , smaller publisher who printed 2,500 copies of the book .
1,500 of these were sold , mostly in his home town , Turin .
It was not until 1956 that Einaudi published the work in a revised form .
On this occasion , the book had major worldwide success , being translated into English by Stuart Woolf in 1958 , and into German by Heinz Reidt in 1959 .
7 Things Fall Apart Chinua Achebe
Why it changed the world : Achebe was the first African to writer to show the world that Africa had suffered brutally under colonialism .
He finally gave a voice to the millions of oppressed and misunderstood Africans and for the first time , the world listened .
Things Fall Apart is a milestone in African literature .
It has achieved the status of the archetypal modern African novel in English , and is read in Nigeria and throughout Africa .
It is studied widely in Europe and North America , where it has spawned numerous tertiary analytical works .
It has achieved similar repute in India and Australia .
Considered Achebe ’s magnum opus , it has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide .
Time Magazine included the novel in its TIME 100 Best English - language Novels from 1923 to 2005 .
Achebe ’s writing about African society is intended to extinguish the misconception that African culture had been savage and primitive by telling the story of the colonization of the Igbo from an African point of view .
In Things Fall Apart , western culture is portrayed as being “ arrogant and ethnocentric , ” insisting that the African culture needed a leader .
As it had no kings or chiefs , Umofian culture was vulnerable to invasion by western civilization .
It is felt that the repression of the Igbo language at the end of the novel contributes greatly to the destruction of the culture .
6 Protocols of the Elders of Zion Anonymous
Why it changed the world :
The historical hatred of the Jews in Europe was re-ignited by this anonymous book ( believed to have been produced by the Russian Secret Police ) and in time it formed the core of Hitler ’s plan for their extermination .
The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a tract alleging a Jewish and Masonic plot to achieve world domination .
Purportedly written by a secret group of Jews known as the Elders of Zion , the document underlies 24 protocols that are supposedly followed by the Jewish people .
The Protocols has been proven to be a literary forgery and hoax as well as a clear case of plagiarism .
The Protocols became a part of the Nazi propaganda effort to justify persecution of the Jews .
It was made required reading for German students .
In The Holocaust : The Destruction of European Jewry 1933 – 1945 , Nora Levin states that “ Hitler used the Protocols as a manual in his war to exterminate the Jews ” :
Despite conclusive proof that the Protocols were a gross forgery , they had sensational popularity and large sales in the 1920s and 1930s .
They were translated into every language of Europe and sold widely in Arab lands , the United States , and England .
But it was in Germany after World War I that they had their greatest success .
There they were used to explain all of the disasters that had befallen the country : the defeat in the war , the hunger , the destructive inflation .
5 Galileo ’s Dialogue Galileo Galilei
Why it changed the world : Galileo ’s Dialogue Concerning
The Two Chief World Systems was the book that sparked off the centuries - long debate of science versus religion .
It was the cause of Galileo ’s imprisonment and the end of his writing career ( with the exception of his Discourses ) .
It was not the science of this book which was problematic – it was Galileo ’s mocking of the Pope which caused him to come before the Inquisition .
The Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems was a 1632 book by Galileo , comparing the Copernican system with the traditional Ptolemaic system .
In the Copernican system the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun , while in the Ptolemaic system everything in the Universe circles around the Earth .
The Dialogue was published in Florence under a formal license from the Inquisition .
In 1633 , Galileo was convicted of “ grave suspicion of heresy ” based on the book , which was then placed on the Index of Forbidden Books , from which it was not removed until 1835 ( after the theories it discussed had been permitted in print in 1822 . )
In an action that was not announced at the time , the publication of anything else he had written or ever might write was also banned .
4 The Phone Book New Haven Telephone Company
Why it changed the world :
There is no doubt that the invention of the telephone is one of the most significant and world changing inventions in the history of man .
But without the telephone directory , it would never have succeeded .
The popularity of the phone relied on the ability of subscribers to know who else was subscribed so they could telephone them .
The first telephone directory , consisting of a single page , was issued on February 21 , 1878 .
It covered 50 subscribers in New Haven , Connecticut .
The Reuben H. Donnelly company asserts that it published the first classified directory , or yellow pages , for Chicago , Illinois , in 1886 .
The first British telephone directory was published in 1880 .
In the US , under current rules and practices , mobile phone and Voice over IP listings are not included in telephone directories .
Efforts to create cellular directories have met stiff opposition from several fronts , including a significant percentage of subscribers who seek to avoid telemarketers .
3 Catcher in the Rye J D Salinger
Why it changed the world :
The frequent calls for this book to be banned due to teenaged sexuality and vulgar language have kept the concept of censorship clearly in the public eye .
This novel is the archetype of the teenage novel – now a very popular genre in literature .
The Catcher in the Rye is a 1951 novel by J. D. Salinger .
Originally published for adults , the novel has become a common part of high school and college curricula throughout the English - speaking world ; it has also been translated into almost all of the world ’s major languages .
Around 250,000 copies are sold each year , with total sales of more than sixty - five million .
The novel ’s antihero , Holden Caulfield , has become an icon for teenage rebellion and defiance .
The novel was chosen by Time among the 100 best English - language novels from 1923 to 2005 , and by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English - language novels of the 20th century .
It has been frequently challenged in the United States for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and teenage angst .
2 Moby - Dick Herman Melville
Why it changed the world :
This landmark epic novel proved to the world that America had a unique voice in the world of literature – a voice worth hearing .
There is no doubt that America now dominates the world of modern literature .
Moby - Dick is an 1851 novel by Herman Melville .
The story tells the adventures of the wandering sailor Ishmael and his voyage on the whaleship Pequod , commanded by Captain Ahab .
Ishmael soon learns that Ahab seeks one specific whale , Moby Dick , a white whale of tremendous size and ferocity .
Comparatively few whaleships know of Moby Dick , and fewer yet have encountered him .
In a previous encounter , the whale destroyed Ahab ’s boat and bit off his leg .
Ahab intends to take revenge .
In Moby - Dick , Melville employs stylized language , symbolism , and metaphor to explore numerous complex themes .
Through the main character ’s journey , the concepts of class and social status , good and evil , and the existence of gods are all examined as Ishmael speculates upon his personal beliefs and his place in the universe .
1 A Study in Scarlet Arthur Conan Doyle
Why it changed the world :
The first “ Sherlock Holmes novel ” created the detective genre which has enthralled readers and filmgoers for well over a century .
It can be said that Holmes changed the face of entertainment .
A Study in Scarlet is a detective mystery novel written by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , which was first published in 1887 .
It is the first story to feature the character of Sherlock Holmes , who would later become one of the most famous and iconic literary detective characters , with long - lasting interest and appeal .
The book ’s title derives from a speech given by Holmes to his companion Doctor Watson on the nature of his work , in which he describes the story ’s murder investigation as his “ study in scarlet ” :
“ There ’s the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life , and our duty is to unravel it , and isolate it , and expose every inch of it . ”
The story , and its main character , attracted little public interest when it first appeared .
Although Doyle wrote fifty - six short stories featuring Holmes , A Study in Scarlet is one of only four full - length novels in the original canon .
The novel was followed by The Sign of Four , published in 1890 .

THE WORLD
The World reveals the international nature of Inauguration Day .
It represents the variation in call activity among US States and foreign countries as flows of people traveling to Washington , D.C. to celebrate President Obama , and then departing the capital to go back home .
The event is truly international with people present from 138 countries , totaling over half of all the countries in the world .
Among the foreign countries , the main international callers are from Canada , Great Britain , France , and Puerto Rico , which register a five - fold increase in call activity .
In the U.S. , the top calling states are also the country 's most populous : California , Florida , New York , and Texas .
Notably , Georgia also figures in the list of top five callers on Inauguration Day , even though it ranks ninth in U.S. population .
ABOUT THE VISUALIZATION
The World illustrates the provenance of those who traveled from all over the U.S. and the world to Washington D.C. to witness President Obama 's inauguration .
It interprets the variations in call activity as flows of people arriving in Washington , D.C. and then leaving the capital to go back to their home states and countries .

How to Not Worry About Money – Reader ’s Take
One of the great side benefit of not being a salesperson who is on the plane way too often is that I have more time to talk to my parents over the phone .
Yesterday , a question came up that affects almost all of us who were n’t born into eventually inheriting Exxon Mobil – How to not worry about money ?
Under all guidelines and measures , my finances are very solid .
I ’m debt free , I live below my means , my emergency fund is already setup and in some respects , my business is actually more stable than most people ’s jobs .
Furthermore , Emma ’s salary more than covers for the family ’s monthly expenses .
Pretty fail proof it seems .
Yet , I still sometimes worry about money .
I ’m concerned that having kids ( something my wife and I definitely want to do ) will increase our living costs , and I worry that the house we buy will likely add financial stress in our lives ( remember , we are in an one - bedroom apartment right now so the house we purchase will likely be bigger ) .
After a lengthy discussion and some more thoughts into the matter , below are a couple areas that can help me ( and possibly you ) reduce the worry for money .
Realize that It ’s Exaggerated – Worry is a funny feeling – it seems to exaggerate any problem .
While there are certainly many people who actually run out of money , those are usually not the people that tend to worry .
Spend the Same Time Making Money Instead –
If you are going to spend time worrying about money , why not use that time and get a side job instead ?
Maybe start a website ( or two , or three ) .
I know it ’s easier said than done , but the more you work at it , the easier it gets .
Confidence – Part of the reason why we worry about money is because of the lack of confidence in our own abilities to earn an income .
How can we boost our confidence you ask ?
Confidence comes from success , and success starts from taking action .
So try a few things .
Learn from it and try again .
The workplace plays a big role in all this as well .
Are your colleagues encouraging ?
Is your boss supportive ?
If not , then do something about it .
Do n’t get into the thinking of “ I ca n’t find another job ” .
Yes you can .
If you got this job , you can get another one .
Worrying is Actually Good – A little worrying is actually healthy for us .
It ’s what drives us to be better .
It ’s what turns our energy switch to the on position .
The right way to deal with it is to channel it into your work ethic , and your desire to be better .
How Do You Deal with It ?
Of course , what I listed are just a tip of the iceberg .
How do you deal with worrying about the lack of money ?
Or do you ?
What has worked for you ?
Let us know .
Since this morning the Internet has been abuzz about widespread trouble with Google .
Google Search and Google News performance slowed to a crawl , while an outage seemed to spread from Gmail to Google Maps and Google Reader .
Comments about the failure were flying on Twitter , and quickly became one of the most searched terms on the popular micro-blogging site .
A Google spokesman said “ We ’re aware some users are having trouble accessing some Google services , and we are looking into it , and we ’ll update everyone soon .
Please let us know how Google services are working for you in your location and on your connection . ”
UPDATE : The issues seem to be going away around 9:50 Pacific time .
UPDATE 2 : 10:35 AM
Pacific : Google says the problems are resolved and will give more details later .
“ The issue affecting some Google services has been resolved , ” the spokeswoman writes .
“ We ’re sorry for the inconvenience , and we ’ll share more details soon . ”
When the outage began , many users turned to Twitter to vent their frustrations and to look for information .
Twitter users also were quick to begin reporting that the trouble was clearing up .
“ Google is back and I ’ve stopped twitching , ” said one Tweet .
This kind of outage is going to be tough on Google .
When Google goes down , lots of stuff breaks .
Not just Google ’s own apps like GMail and Google Talk , but also applications like Firefox , which use Google as it ’s default search provider .
All of Google , or at least the big pieces , went down and this is bad news for Google ’s efforts to build up Apps , and to a lesser extent , Gmail , as critical business tools .
It also undermines the entire category of hosted applications .
If the mighty Google can stumble , then who can be trusted ? ”
The problem is not downtime - it ’s lack of any way to mitigate the problems , and a complete and total lack of any customer service from Google .
There is NOBODY you can call when there ’s a problem .
Read
That February outage came just a week after Google acknowledged that some users had experienced problems getting results from Google News searches over a span of more than 14 hours .
Other users reported that entire news sections , such as Science / Technology , were coming up empty of stories .
And last December , Google confirmed that there was a technical problem with Google Talk and the Web - based Gmail chat system .
One day early in the month , messages created by a “ subset ” of users were left unsent because of glitches in the messaging system .
The scope of today ’s outage is n’t immediately clear but it appears to be international .
Runaway Regular Expressions : Catastrophic Backtracking
Consider the regular expression ( x+x+ ) +y .
Before you scream in horror and say this contrived example should be written as xx+y to match exactly the same without those terribly nested quantifiers : just assume that each “ x ” represents something more complex , with certain strings being matched by both “ x ” .
See the section on HTML files below for a real example .
Let ’s see what happens when you apply this regex to xxxxxxxxxxy .
The first x+ will match all 10 x characters .
The second x+ fails .
The first x+ then backtracks to 9 matches , and the second one picks up the remaining x .
The group has now matched once .
The group repeats , but fails at the first x+ .
Since one repetition was sufficient , the group matches .
y matches y and an overall match is found .
The regex is declared functional , the code is shipped to the customer , and his computer explodes .
Almost .
The above regex turns ugly when the y is missing from the subject string .
When y fails , the regex engine backtracks .
The group has one iteration it can backtrack into .
The second x+ matched only one x , so it ca n’t backtrack .
But the first x+ can give up one x .
The second x+ promptly matches xx .
The group again has one iteration , fails the next one , and the y fails .
Backtracking again , the second x+ now has one backtracking position , reducing itself to match x .
The group tries a second iteration .
The first x+ matches but the second is stuck at the end of the string .
Backtracking again , the first x+ in the group ’s first iteration reduces itself to 7 characters .
The second x+ matches xxx .
Failing y , the second x+ is reduced to xx and then x .
Now , the group can match a second iteration , with one x for each x+ .
But this ( 7,1 ) , ( 1,1 ) combination fails too .
So it goes to ( 6,4 ) and then ( 6,2 ) ( 1,1 ) and then ( 6,1 ) , ( 2,1 ) and then ( 6,1 ) , ( 1,2 ) and then I think you start to get the drift .
If you try this regex on a 10 x string in RegexBuddy ’s debugger , it ’ll take 2558 steps to figure out the final y is missing .
For an 11 x string , it needs 5118 steps .
For 12 , it takes 10238 steps .
Clearly we have an exponential complexity of O ( 2 ^n ) here .
At 21 x the debugger bows out at 2.8 million steps , diagnosing a bad case of catastrophic backtracking .
RegexBuddy is forgiving in that it detects it ’s going in circles , and aborts the match attempt .
Other regex engines ( like . NET ) will keep going forever , while others will crash with a stack overflow ( like Perl , before version 5.10 ) .
Stack overflows are particularly nasty on Windows , since they tend to make your application vanish without a trace or explanation .
Be very careful if you run a web service that allows users to supply their own regular expressions .
People with little regex experience have surprising skill at coming up with exponentially complex regular expressions .
Possessive Quantifiers and Atomic Grouping to The Rescue
In the above example , the sane thing to do is obviously to rewrite it as xx+y which eliminates the nested quantifiers entirely .
Nested quantifiers are repeated or alternated tokens inside a group that is itself repeated or alternated .
These almost always lead to catastrophic backtracking .
About the only situation where they do n’t is when the start of each alternative inside the group is not optional , and mutually exclusive with the start of all the other alternatives , and mutually exclusive with the token that follows it ( inside its alternative inside the group ) .
E.g. ( a+b+|c+d+ )+y is safe .
If anything fails , the regex engine will backtrack through the whole regex , but it will do so linearly .
The reason is that all the tokens are mutually exclusive .
None of them can match any characters matched by any of the others .
So the match attempt at each backtracking position will fail , causing the regex engine to backtrack linearly .
If you test this on aaaabbbbccccdddd , RegexBuddy needs only 13 steps rather than millions of steps to figure it out .
However , it ’s not always possible or easy to rewrite your regex to make everything mutually exclusive .
So we need a way to tell the regex engine not to backtrack .
When we ’ve grabbed all the x’s , there ’s no need to backtrack .
There could n’t possibly be a y in anything matched by either x+ .
Using a possessive quantifier , our regex becomes ( x+x + ) ++y .
This fails the 21 x string in merely 7 steps .
That ’s 6 steps to match all the x’s , and 1 step to figure out that y fails .
Almost no backtracking is done .
Using an atomic group , the regex becomes ( ?>( x+x+ ) + ) y with the exact same results .
A Real Example : Matching CSV Records
Here ’s a real example from a technical support case I once handled .
The customer was trying to find lines in a comma-delimited text file where the 12th item on a line started with a P .
He was using the innocently - looking regexp ^(.*? , ) {11}P .
At first sight , this regex looks like it should do the job just fine .
The lazy dot and comma match a single comma-delimited field , and the { 11} skips the first 11 fields .
Finally , the P checks if the 12th field indeed starts with P .
In fact , this is exactly what will happen when the 12th field indeed starts with a P .
The problem rears its ugly head when the 12th field does not start with a P .
Let ’s say the string is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 .
At that point , the regex engine will backtrack .
It will backtrack to the point where ^(.*? , ) {11} had consumed 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 , giving up the last match of the comma .
The next token is again the dot .
The dot matches a comma .
The dot matches the comma !
However , the comma does not match the 1 in the 12th field , so the dot continues until the 11th iteration of .*? , has consumed 11,12 , .
You can already see the root of the problem : the part of the regex ( the dot ) matching the contents of the field also matches the delimiter ( the comma ) .
Because of the double repetition ( star inside { 11} ) , this leads to a catastrophic amount of backtracking .
The regex engine now checks whether the 13th field starts with a P .
It does not .
Since there is no comma after the 13th field , the regex engine can no longer match the 11th iteration of .*? , .
But it does not give up there .
It backtracks to the 10th iteration , expanding the match of the 10th iteration to 10,11 , .
Since there is still no P , the 10th iteration is expanded to 10,11,12 , .
Reaching the end of the string again , the same story starts with the 9th iteration , subsequently expanding it to 9,10 , , 9,10,11 , , 9,10,11,12 , .
But between each expansion , there are more possibilities to be tried .
When the 9th iteration consumes 9,10 , , the 10th could match just 11 , as well as 11,12 , .
Continuously failing , the engine backtracks to the 8th iteration , again trying all possible combinations for the 9th , 10th , and 11th iterations .
You get the idea : the possible number of combinations that the regex engine will try for each line where the 12th field does not start with a P is huge .
All this would take a long time if you ran this regex on a large CSV file where most rows do n’t have a P at the start of the 12th field .
Preventing Catastrophic Backtracking
The solution is simple .
When nesting repetition operators , make absolutely sure that there is only one way to match the same match .
If repeating the inner loop 4 times and the outer loop 7 times results in the same overall match as repeating the inner loop 6 times and the outer loop 2 times , you can be sure that the regex engine will try all those combinations .
In our example , the solution is to be more exact about what we want to match .
We want to match 11 comma-delimited fields .
The fields must not contain comma’s .
So the regex becomes : ^( [^ , \r
] * , ) {11}P .
If the P can not be found , the engine will still backtrack .
But it will backtrack only 11 times , and each time the [ ^ , \r
] is not able to expand beyond the comma , forcing the regex engine to the previous one of the 11 iterations immediately , without trying further options .
See the Difference with RegexBuddy
If you try this example with RegexBuddy ’s debugger , you will see that the original regex ^(.*? , ) {11}P needs 25,593 steps to conclude there regex cannot match 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 .
If the string is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 , just 3 characters more , the number of steps doubles to 52,149 .
It ’s not too hard to imagine that at this kind of exponential rate , attempting this regex on a large file with long lines could easily take forever .
Our improved regex ^( [ ^ , \r
] * , ) {11}P , however , needs just 52 steps to fail , whether the subject string has 12 numbers , 13 numbers , 16 numbers or a billion .
While the complexity of the original regex was exponential , the complexity of the improved regex is constant with respect to whatever follows the 11th field .
The reason is the regex fails almost immediately when it discovers the 12th field does n’t start with a P .
It backtracks the 11 iterations of the group without expanding again .
The complexity of the improved regex is linear to the length of the first 11 fields .
24 steps are needed in our example to match the 11 fields .
It takes only 1 step to discover that P ca n’t be matched .
Another 27 steps are then needed to backtrack all the iterations of the two quantifiers .
That ’s the best we can do , since the engine does have to scan through all the characters of the first 11 fields to find out where the 12th one begins .
Our improved regex is a perfect solution .
Alternative Solution Using Atomic Grouping
In the above example , we could easily reduce the amount of backtracking to a very low level by better specifying what we wanted .
But that is not always possible in such a straightforward manner .
In that case , you should use atomic grouping to prevent the regex engine from backtracking .
Using atomic grouping , the above regex becomes ^( ?>(.*? ,) {11} ) P . Everything between ( ? > ) is treated as one single token by the regex engine , once the regex engine leaves the group .
Because the entire group is one token , no backtracking can take place once the regex engine has found a match for the group .
If backtracking is required , the engine has to backtrack to the regex token before the group ( the caret in our example ) .
If there is no token before the group , the regex must retry the entire regex at the next position in the string .
Let ’s see how ^( ?>(.*? ,) {11} ) P is applied to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 .
The caret matches at the start of the string and the engine enters the atomic group .
The star is lazy , so the dot is initially skipped .
But the comma does not match 1 , so the engine backtracks to the dot .
That ’s right : backtracking is allowed here .
The star is not possessive , and is not immediately enclosed by an atomic group .
That is , the regex engine did not cross the closing parenthesis of the atomic group .
The dot matches 1 , and the comma matches too .
{ 11} causes further repetition until the atomic group has matched 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 , .
Now , the engine leaves the atomic group .
Because the group is atomic , all backtracking information is discarded and the group is now considered a single token .
The engine now tries to match P to the 1 in the 12th field .
This fails .
So far , everything happened just like in the original , troublesome regular expression .
Now comes the difference .
P fails to match , so the engine backtracks .
But the atomic group made it forget all backtracking positions .
The match attempt at the start of the string fails immediately .
That is what atomic grouping and possessive quantifiers are for : efficiency by disallowing backtracking .
The most efficient regex for our problem at hand would be ^( ?>((?>[ ^, \r
] * ) , ) { 11} ) P , since possessive , greedy repetition of the star is faster than a backtracking lazy dot .
If possessive quantifiers are available , you can reduce clutter by writing ^( ?>( [ ^, \r
]*+ , ) {11} ) P .
If you test the final solution in RegexBuddy ’s debugger , you ’ll see that it needs the same 24 steps to match the 11 fields .
Then it takes 1 step to exit the atomic group and throw away all the backtracking information .
Discovering that P ca n’t be matched still takes one step .
But because of the atomic group , backtracking it all takes only a single step .
Quickly Matching a Complete HTML File
Another common situation where catastrophic backtracking occurs is when trying to match “ something ” followed by “ anything ” followed by “ another something ” followed by “ anything ” , where the lazy dot .*? is used .
The more “ anything ” , the more backtracking .
Sometimes , the lazy dot is simply a symptom of a lazy programmer . " .*? " is not appropriate to match a double - quoted string , since you do n’t really want to allow anything between the quotes .
A string ca n’t have ( unescaped ) embedded quotes , so " [ ^" \r
] * " is more appropriate , and wo n’t lead to catastrophic backtracking when combined in a larger regular expression .
However , sometimes “ anything ” really is just that .
The problem is that “ another something ” also qualifies as “ anything ” , giving us a genuine x+x+ situation .
Suppose you want to use a regular expression to match a complete HTML file , and extract the basic parts from the file .
If you know the structure of HTML files , it ’s very straightforward to write the regular expression < html > .*?< head >.*?< title >.*?</ title >.*?</head >.*?< body [^ > ]*>.*?</ body >.*?</html > .
With the “ dot matches newlines ” or “ single line ” matching mode turned on , it will work just fine on valid HTML files .
Unfortunately , this regular expression wo n’t work nearly as well on an HTML file that misses some of the tags .
The worst case is a missing < / html > tag at the end of the file .
When < /html > fails to match , the regex engine backtracks , giving up the match for </ body >.*? .
It will then further expand the lazy dot before </ body > , looking for a second closing < / body > tag in the HTML file .
When that fails , the engine gives up < body [ ^ > ]*>.*? , and starts looking for a second opening < body [ ^ > ]*> tag all the way to the end of the file .
Since that also fails , the engine proceeds looking all the way to the end of the file for a second closing head tag , a second closing title tag , etc .
If you run this regex in RegexBuddy ’s debugger , the output will look like a sawtooth .
The regex matches the whole file , backs up a little , matches the whole file again , backs up some more , backs up yet some more , matches everything again , etc. until each of the 7 .*? tokens has reached the end of the file .
The result is that this regular has a worst case complexity of N^7 .
If you double the length of the HTML file with the missing < html > tag by appending text at the end , the regular expression will take 128 times ( 2^7 ) as long to figure out the HTML file is n’t valid .
This is n’t quite as disastrous as the 2^N complexity of our first example , but will lead to very unacceptable performance on larger invalid files .
In this situation , we know that each of the literal text blocks in our regular expression ( the HTML tags , which function as delimiters ) will occur only once in a valid HTML file .
That makes it very easy to package each of the lazy dots ( the delimited content ) in an atomic group .
< html >( ?>.*?< head > ) ( ?>.*?< title > ) ( ?>.*?</ title >) ( ?>.*?</head >) (?>.*?< body [ ^ > ]*>)
(?>.*?</ body > ).*?</ html > will match a valid HTML file in the same number of steps as the original regex .
The gain is that it will fail on an invalid HTML file almost as fast as it matches a valid one .
When < /html > fails to match , the regex engine backtracks , giving up the match for the last lazy dot .
But then , there ’s nothing further to backtrack to .
Since all of the lazy dots are in an atomic group , the regex engines has discarded their backtracking positions .
The groups function as a “ do not expand further ” roadblock .
The regex engine is forced to announce failure immediately .
You ’ve no doubt noticed that each atomic group also contains an HTML tag after the lazy dot .
This is critical .
We do allow the lazy dot to backtrack until its matching HTML tag was found .
E.g. when .*?</ body > is processing Last paragraph</ p></body > , the </ regex tokens will match </ in </ p > .
However , b will fail p .
At that point , the regex engine will backtrack and expand the lazy dot to include </ p > .
Since the regex engine has n’t left the atomic group yet , it is free to backtrack inside the group .
Once </ body > has matched , and the regex engine leaves the atomic group , it discards the lazy dot ’s backtracking positions .
Then it can no longer be expanded .
Essentially , what we ’ve done is to bind a repeated regex token ( the lazy dot to match HTML content ) to the non-repeated regex token that follows it ( the literal HTML tag ) .
Since anything , including HTML tags , can appear between the HTML tags in our regular expression , we cannot use a negated character class instead of the lazy dot to prevent the delimiting HTML tags from being matched as HTML content .
But we can and did achieve the same result by combining each lazy dot and the HTML tag following it into an atomic group .
As soon as the HTML tag is matched , the lazy dot ’s match is locked down .
This ensures that the lazy dot will never match the HTML tag that should be matched by the literal HTML tag in the regular expression .

The federal government is forcing 3 million Americans to disclose sensitive , personal information about finances , health and lifestyle in a 14 - page survey – including questions about availability of household flush toilets and difficulty with undressing and bathing .
The 2009 American Community Survey , an annual supplement to the decennial Census , asks about residents ' personal relationships and whether a home has hot and cold running water , a flush toilet , bathing facilities , appliances and phone services .
It also asks how many rooms are in a home and what vehicles are used at each household .
The new questionnaire asks respondents what they pay for electricity , gas , water and sewer every month and whether residents receive food stamps .
Question 16 asks , " About how much do you think this house and lot , apartment , or mobile home would sell for if it were for sale ? "
Respondents are required to disclose costs associated with rent or mortgage , annual real estate taxes on and fire , hazard and flood insurance expenses .
TRENDING : Alleged attacker behind carnage at pro-Trump event linked to ' Caravan 4 Justice ' group
For each person in the household , the questionnaire asks for citizenship status , education level , whether that person attends private or public schools .
It also features questions about health coverage , hearing and vision impairment and physical , mental or emotional conditions .
It asks if residents " have difficulty dressing or bathing " or " doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor 's office or shopping " or whether they have difficulty making decisions .
Respondents must indicate if they have served in the military , their current marital status and whether they have been married or given birth to children in the last 12 months .
The Census Bureau claims its question is used as a " measure of fertility " and is used to " carry out various programs required by statute , including … conducting research for voluntary family planning programs . "
The letter asks where residents worked last week and whether they drove a car , rode a bus , subway railroad , ferryboat , taxicab or bicycle to get there .
It then asks what time they left for work and how long their commute lasted .
Respondents are also required to disclose their place of employment , duties and income .
While many recipients may consider the questionnaire to be tedious and meddling , the Census Bureau warns that citizens are required by law to complete it and may be fined as much as $ 5,000 for willfully refusing .
While an individual may feel uneasy about answering each question truthfully , the fine for filing false information can be as much as $ 500 .
The Census Bureau estimates that the form takes an average of 38 minutes for each household to complete .
While the U.S. Constitution allows Americans to be counted for purposes of taxation and political representation , Jim Harper , a privacy expert at the Cato Institute , told the New York Post the survey is " a classic example of mission creep over the decades – this constitutional need to literally count how many noses are in the United States has turned into a vast data - collection operation . "
Rep . Ron Paul blasted the government for spending " hundreds of millions of dollars " on the survey and called the questionnaire " insulting " in his Texas Straight Talk column .
RELATED : City dumps facial - recognition program
" The questions are both ludicrous and insulting , " he wrote .
" The survey asks , for instance , how many bathrooms you have in your house , how many miles you drive to work , how many days you were sick last year , and whether you have trouble getting up stairs .
It goes on and on , mixing inane questions with highly detailed inquiries about your financial affairs .
One can only imagine the countless malevolent ways our federal bureaucrats could use this information .
At the very least the survey will be used to dole out pork , which is reason enough to oppose it . "
Paul continued , " The founders never authorized the federal government to continuously survey the American people .
More importantly , they never envisioned a nation where the people would roll over and submit to every government demand .
The American Community Survey is patently offensive to all Americans who still embody that fundamental American virtue , namely a healthy mistrust of government . "

Mit diesem Ansturm hatten sie nun wirklich nicht gerechnet .
„ Sonst waren wir meistens zu fünft “ , sagte der Landesvorsitzende der Piratenpartei Andreas Baum .
An diesem Dienstagabend aber waren es mehr , viel mehr , etwa 40 Leute , die zum ersten Treffen nach den Europawahlen gekommen sind .
Dort hatte die Partei 1,4 Prozent der Stimmen geholt , in Friedrichshain - Kreuzberg , insbesondere bei jungen Wählern , sogar 3,4 Prozent .
Seit Sonntag ist die Besatzung der Berliner Parteipiraten um 30 auf 101 gewachsen .
Mangels einer Zentrale versammeln sich die Wahlsieger unter den Kleinen immer dienstags in ihrer Kreuzberger Stammbar „ Breipott “ in der Skalitzer Straße , passend gewählt zum Parteiprogramm : Hier wird lizenzfreie Musik aus dem Internet kostenlos zum Herunterladen angeboten .
An die Musikindustrie angelehnt ist auch der Name der Partei : Man wolle das Wort ’ Internet - Piraten ’ , das von Seiten der Industrie häufig als Schimpfwort für Raubkopierer verwendet werde , positiv besetzen , so Baum .
Viele Posten auf dem Piratenschiff sind noch vakant
Entspannt ein Bier in der Hand , waren einige der bisherigen Mitglieder an ihren T - Shirts zu erkennen , auf denen das schwarz - orangene Logo mit der wehenden Flagge prangte .
Die große Mehrheit jedoch kam zum ersten Mal : Wähler , Sympathisanten , Interessenten .
„ Da sehen schon viele nach Computernerds aus “ , sagte ein studentischer Neuzugang mit Blick in die Runde .
35 Männer um die 30 Jahre , die meisten in Jeans und Sneakers – und fünf Frauen .
Informell und improvisiert ging es in kleinen Gruppen um die Lockerung von Urheber - und den Schutz von Bürgerrechten , um die Arbeit am Parteiprogramm via Diskussionplattform im Internet , um die offene und basisdemokratische Struktur der Ende 2006 in Berlin gegründeten Partei .
Viele Posten auf dem Piratenschiff sind noch vakant : „ Gut zu wissen “ , sagte Michael Höhne , Geschäftsführer einer Internet - Firma .
Wer sich einbringen will , findet hier einen Platz .
Überläufer von anderen Parteien gibt es kaum – die meisten , die am Dienstag da waren , wollten sich zum ersten Mal politisch engagieren .
„ Die Themen sprechen mich einfach an “ , hieß es überall .
Bei den großen Parteien gebe es , was digitale Medien angehe , eklatante Lücken oder falsche politische Signale .
Vergleiche zu den frühen Grünen wurden gezogen : „ Die waren damals auch Vorreiter , was ihr Thema anging “ , sagte eine Pädagogin .
„ Jetzt sitzen sie schon lange im Bundestag . “
Wer glaubt , sie seien eine Spaßpartei , habe nie das Programm gelesen
Da wollen auch die Piraten hin , die bereits Unterschriften sammeln , um bei der Wahl im September antreten zu können .
1200 sind schon beisammen , 800 fehlen noch .
Im Gegensatz zum Europawahlkampf , der mangels Geld ganz ohne Plakate in der Stadt und fast nur auf Foren und Blogs im Netz geführt wurde , wolle man bis dahin „ stark sichtbar “ werden , so Vorsitzender Andreas Baum .
Deshalb wird gerade ein Floß gebaut , mit dem man „ in der Echtwelt “ , so Baum , als Spreepiraten unterwegs sein und Wahlkampf machen werde .
Den Vorwurf , eine Spaßpartei zu sein , wies er jedoch zurück : „ Wer das sagt , hat sich noch nie mit unserem Programm auseinander gesetzt . “
Zentral ist darin zwar die Netzwelt .
Damit die Partei aber künftig breiter aufgestellt ist , soll auf dem Bundesparteitag Anfang Juli in Hamburg ein neues Programm beschlossen werden .
Er arbeite daran und sei mit viel Herzblut bei der Sache , sagt Pirat Lars Hotil : „ Datenschutz im Internet betrifft uns alle .
Wir wollen das Thema unbedingt auf die Agenda bringen . “

The White House has recently unveiled its Official White House Photostream on Flickr , posting dozens of stunning photos by official photographer Pete Souza .
In posting the photos , the White House chose the least restrictive license available , a Creative Commons Attribution license — which means the public is free to download , copy , and re-mix freely , so long as the original photographer is credited .
While this is certainly better than releasing the photos under the usual copyright rules ( no use without permission , specific license and compensation ) , the license made us wonder : if these are official photos by the official White House photographer , are n't they government works ?
If so , they are n't copyrightable , which means they need n't be licensed at all , but should instead be flagged as public domain .
( All the photos we 've looked at were by the official White House photographer ; however , to the extent that any are provided by non-governmental third parties , we 've no quarrel with the CC - BY license for those . )
So we did a little investigation .
As it happens , there is a kind of public domain option on Flickr .
Photos in the Flickr streams of other public institution such as the Smithsonian and the Library of Congress are accompanied by text that reads " No known copyright restrictions , " with a link to a page explaining that the photo is either public domain or is owned by an institution that is not exercising control over the image .
The White House should reconsider its licensing approach , and work with Flickr to flag these government works in the same way .
This Administration is pioneering the use of the Internet to reach out to citizens — and part of the precedent it should set is a clear recognition that publicly funded government works should be free to the public , without the burden of copyright and licensing restrictions .
Flickr , for its part , should open up the " no copyright restrictions " option to the rest of us .
As it stands , it appears that is only open to specific institutions .
Flickr has been a pioneer in this area , and deserves credit for helping people put Creative Commons licenses to use .
We hope they 'll consider allowing the public access to the same " non-license " being used by the Smithsonian and other institutions , or at the very least add a public domain license certification to the list of options .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Friday he would force state workers to take a third unpaid furlough day every month if lawmakers do not pass a balanced budget by Tuesday .
The move came as another round of budget votes in the Legislature failed to produce a remedy for California ’s looming insolvency .
Schwarzenegger said in a statement that in imposing an additional furlough day , he would be doing his part “ to conserve cash so that the state can continue to operate . ”
Controller John Chiang has said he would have to begin issuing IOUs next Thursday if the budget crisis is not resolved by then .

Three furlough days would amount to nearly a 15 % pay cut for the state ’s workers , who have been ordered to stay home two days a month without pay since February .
The new furlough order would go into effect Wednesday , the first day of the new fiscal year , and save the state $ 420 million , according to H.D. Palmer , a spokesman for the Department of Finance .
The governor “ continues to use state workers as pawns , ” said Yvonne Walker , president of Service Employees International Union Local 1000 , which represents 95,000 state employees .
A joint legislative budget committee last week rejected a proposed new 5 % pay cut for state workers , but Schwarzenegger can implement furloughs through executive order .
Friday marked the third straight day GOP lawmakers voted against Democratic proposals to balance the state ’s books , which show a $ 24 - billion projected deficit .

Republican senators blocked several budget revisions that included a $ 15 hike in the annual vehicle license fee to keep roughly 220 state parks open and a new tax on homeowners ’ insurance to pay for emergency response systems .
A third measure contained accounting maneuvers to accelerate tax collections .
Democrats could revive the measures later .
Senate GOP leader Dennis Hollingsworth of Murrieta derided the vote as a “ political drill ” involving measures that do n’t close the full deficit .
The Democratic proposals considered this week would reduce the shortfall by more than $ 21 billion , said Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) , calling the approach “ anything but piecemeal . ”

Democrats have also proposed $ 2 billion in tax increases on oil and tobacco , but those have not come to a vote .
Members of the majority party pressed their package as necessary to prevent the issuance of IOUs .
“ We have less than 100 hours to get our act together , ” said Sen. Dean Florez ( D - Shafter ) .
Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders said they would meet privately over the weekend , with the full Legislature to reconvene Sunday evening .

" They say that time changes things , but you actually have to change them yourself . "
- Andy Warhol
Massive supercomputers that devour electricity to keep them humming are not exactly the poster children for green technology .
But IBM hopes to change that with its plans to build a supercomputer that will use water to keep the system cool and even recycle some of the waste heat to help heat the university where it 's housed .
The technology could lead to a reduction in overall energy consumption by at least 40 percent , when compared to similar air - cooled machines , says the company .
“ Energy is arguably the number one challenge humanity will be facing in the 21st century , " says Dimos Poulikakos , lead investigator of the project .
" We cannot afford anymore to design computer systems based on the criterion of computational speed and performance alone . "
Supercomputers are used in energy research labs such as Argonne National Laboratory , in space research by NASA and at universities for scientific research , all applications which have a nearly insatiable demand for processing power .
The new supercomputer , called Aquasar , will be housed at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ( ETH ) Zurich and will have a top speed of 10 teraflops .
( A teraflop is a trillion floating point operations per second , a measure of computing capacity . )
While that 's a lot of computing power – a Core 2 Duo processor is capable of about 20 gigaflops , or 1/500 the speed of Aquasar – it's a fraction of what some of the fastest supercomputers today .
For instance , IBM's Blue Gene / L supercomputer , which ranks fourth on the top 100 list , has a peak speed of 596 teraflops .
Meanwhile , IBM has moved on to create its first supercomputer in Europe capable of one petaflop , or one thousand trillion operations per second .
Keeping these massive machines running is n't as much a challenge as trying to maintain them in an optimal temperature band .
Aquasar , however , hopes to offer more bang for the buck in terms of its energy consumption .
Many of the chips used the supercomputing systems dissipate about ten times as much heat as a typical kitchen hotplate , says Thomas Brunschwiler , a researcher at IBM Zurich Research Lab .
For optimal performance , the chips must be cooled below 185 degrees Fahrenheit ( 85 degrees Celsius ) .
Accomplishing that much cooling across a huge data center means a significant strain on electricity consumption .
Researchers estimate that about 50 percent of an average air - cooled data center ’s energy consumption stems from powering the cooling systems to keep the processors from overheating .
Reducing that would be a big step towards energy efficiency .
The power consumption of one rack of the Aquasar will be around 10 KW , IBM officials say .
By comparison , the Blue Gene L/P supercomputer consumes about 40 KW of power per rack , and the average power consumption of a supercomputer in the top 500 list is 257 KW .
Aquasar , set to be commissioned in 2010 , will have two IBM BladeCenter servers in each rack .
Power consumption per teraflop for Aquasar will be known once the system is built , says IBM .
Aquasar 's breakthrough lies in how it has successfully managed chip level water cooling , says Brunschwiler .
" One way to do it is to cool the air in a data center to 40 degrees Celsius ( 104 degrees Fahrenheit ) , which means air conditioning units that take space and energy , " he says .
" Or you can use liquid cooling to get there . "
In the Aquasar system , high performance micro-channel coolers are attached directly to the backside of the processor .
In them , the cooler water is distributed through a fine network of capillaries that spread throughout the back .
It 's different from the water - cooled modules used in other supercomputers , says Brunschwiler .
Water cooling on a module level brings the liquid between the processors , but not right up against them via micro capillaries .
" The breakthrough in our special package design lies in how we can bring the water as close as possible to the chips without letting it affect the chips ' performance , " says Brunschwiler .
The water - cooled supercomputer will require a small amount , just about 2.64 gallons of water for cooling .
A pump ensures the water flows through at the rate of roughly 7.9 gallons per minute .
For overall efficiency , the entire cooling system is a closed circuit .
The heated water from the chips is cooled as it passes through a passive heat exchanger and the removed heat is recycled .
In this case , it is channeled into the University 's heating system .
“ Heat is a valuable commodity that we rely on in our everyday lives , " says Bruno Michel , manager at IBM ’s Zurich Research Laboratory .
" If we capture and transport the waste heat from the active components in a computer system as efficiently as possible , we can reuse it as a resource . "

APRIL 16 -- The woman who filmed herself and a co-worker as they joked about contaminating food at a Domino 's Pizza in North Carolina is a registered sex offender who last year pleaded guilty to engaging in an illicit act with a 14 - year - old girl .
Kristy Hammonds , 31 , and Michael Setzer , 32 , were arrested yesterday and charged with delivering prohibited foods after a video surfaced showing Setzer preparing sandwiches while putting cheese up his nose , passing gas on salami slices , and appearing to blow his nose on the food .
While this was occurring , Hammonds filmed Setzer and provided commentary such as , ' In about five minutes it 'll be sent out on delivery where somebody will be eating these , yes , eating them , and little did they know that cheese was in his nose and that there was some lethal gas that ended up on their salami . '
She added , ' Now that 's how we roll at Domino's . '
Court records show that Hammonds , pictured in the mug shot at left , was charged in 2006 with three counts of statutory rape and pleaded guilty last June to a reduced count of misdemeanor sexual battery .
According to a Superior Court indictment , a copy of which you 'll find here , Hammonds ( who was charged under her married name ) , sexually abused the teenage girl over a four - month period .
Investigators with the Alexander County Sheriff 's Office , which arrested Hammonds in the sex case , declined to provide further details about their probe , citing the need to protect the minor victim .
As part of her plea deal , Hammonds was required to register as a sex offender and ordered ' not to be alone with anyone 16 or under , with the exception of her own children . '
She was also placed on probation for two years , hit with a 60 - day suspended jail sentence , and fined $ 1941 .

Savage Love Bliss Con
My 14 - year - old son just came out to me .
He has a slightly older boyfriend , and they 're going to the school dance on Saturday night .
I am adjusting to a truth I had long suspected .
I am worried , though , that my son will get hurt .
We live in the South — North Carolina — but our town has a gay community and an annual pride parade .
When I asked him if the other students at school would be cool with him bringing a boy , he said , " Who cares ? "
Bullying is not a huge problem at his school .
We have had the sex talk several times , but I have always assumed a hetero approach .
I think my son is too young for sleepovers with his boyfriend , and I would really like him to wait a couple more years before he gets seriously sexually active , though I expect petting and kissing are givens .
Any advice ?
Still My Son
Treat your son to some of that equal treatment we gay people are always going on about , SMS , and treat him just like you 'd treat your 14 - year - old straight kid .
No responsible parent would allow his 14 - year - old daughter — and that 's how you should think of him for now ( more on that in a moment ) — to have sleepovers with her slightly older boyfriend , right ?
So no sleepovers for your gay kid .
Remember :
You can be supportive and be his advocate without signing off on stuff you would n't sign off on for a straight child — indeed , it 's the best way to show your support .
What else can you do ?
You can hover , scrutinize , interfere — all the crap that parents typically do when their children begin to date .
For instance , SMS , this boy your son is seeing ?
Have you met him ?
Meet him .
How much older is he ?
Find out .
Are they messing around ?
Ask them .
Make sure your son understands that he does n't have to engage in anal intercourse to be authentically gay , or all grown - up , or out .
He can take things slow — he should take things slow .
Encourage your son to date , to hold hands , to make out .
And you should , as awkward as it's going to feel to say so aloud , encourage your son , when he does become sexually active , to stick with mutual masturbation and oral sex for a good , long time — until he 's sure he 's ready for intercourse , not just anxious for it .
Getting back to the daughter business :
You should also regard your son , at least through his adolescence , as more of a daughter to you than a son .
We tend to be more protective of our daughters — our straight daughters — than we are of our sons .
Why ?
A sexist desire to keep our daughters " pure " ?
That 's a part of it , sure , but there 's also this :
Men are pigs , and people on the receiving end of male sexual desire / attention are in more danger than people on the receiving end of female sexual desire / attention .
( In general — individual results may vary . )
Testosterone is the crystal meth of hormones , a badass drug , and men are more likely to be abusive and violent .
The prevalence of HIV among gay men makes the stakes higher for your son .
So do n't allow him to date anyone you do n't get to meet and approve of , and do n't confuse " being supportive " with " letting him do whatever / whomever he wants . "
Be active , be engaged , and never stop being his meddling , interfering , hypersuspicious dad .
Good luck , SMS .
It sounds like your son lucked out having you as a parent .
I 've been seeing this guy for about two years .
We 've been living together for six months now , and it 's been REALLY bumpy .
We fight a lot , I cry a lot , and it just gets really messy .
To tell you the truth , I 'm tired of it .
I work two jobs , and I never get any time to myself because he 's moody and insecure .
He always wants to know where I 'm going or who I 'm with .
He does n't like to do the same things I do , and I 'm beginning to think this is all one big mistake .
The problem is every time I try to leave , it always gets ugly .
Ugly to the point that he 's thrown my stuff in the front yard , broken things of mine , and even called me names .
He 's abusive .
As sad as this sounds , and as ridiculous as I feel , I want to make this work .
I want us to be happy .
And the thing is , I know that we can be .
When we 're mad , it 's like World War III over here .
But when we 're happy , it 's so blissful that I know in my heart with him is the only place I want to be .
What can I do ?
People tell me it 's time to sever ties , but the people who usually tell me this are the ones who can't stand him .
How can I make a completely unbiased decision ?
Am I stupid for believing in a love that feels destined to fail ?
Hopelessly Devoted To Him
This is not a relationship , HDTH , it 's a hostage situation .
He 's a controlling , abusive piece of shit — listen to your fucking friends , HDTH .
When your boyfriend breaks your shit , he 's making an implicit threat : I can break your face just as easily as I 'm breaking your shit , bitch , so do n't even think about leaving me .
And of course things are great when they 're great — that 's part of an abuser 's MO .
If abusers were abusive 24/7 — if they were n't capable of doling out a little bliss now and then — no abusive relationship would last longer than one date .
Like all abusers , he parcels out the good times , doping you up with a little bliss now and then , because he knows that these glimpses of how great things could be convince you to stick around against your better judgment .
The bliss is a con , HDTH , a weapon that he uses against you , just as much a part of the cycle of abuse as his tantrums , fits , and threats of violence are .
Think of the good times as rainbow sprinkles on a dog - shit sundae — sprinkles or no sprinkles , you 're still standing there with a bowlful of dog shit in your hands .
Get a couple of friends to come over when he's at work or out of town , box up your shit , and leave .
You can't change him .
Go .
Apropos of nothing , Savage , you fucking suck ass .
You And Your Column Both Suck
Have I ever claimed otherwise ?
And apropos of nothing , YAYCBS , I 'm totally grooving on Garfunkel & Oates right now ( www.garfunkelandoates.com), and everyone has to check them out ; Perez Hilton was absolutely right about Miss California ( she is a dumb bitch ) ; Seattle - based artist Kim Graham ( www.kimgrahamstudios.com) is getting centaur fetishists halfway there ; and I recently visited the University of Georgia in Athens , where the kids asked me to come up with a dirty meaning for " between the hedges , " which is their football stadium 's nickname .
Off the top of my head , I said , " The boy in a girl - boy - girl three - way could be described as being between the hedges . "
But upon further reflection , I think the term is a better description of going down on a woman with a particularly hairy bush — and the tongue , not the boy / girl doing the tonguing , is " between the hedges . "

So I just happened to be keeping my eye on some packages being upgraded in Debian on dist - upgrade , and something caught my eye , the package " libasound2 - plugins " .
I wondered what kind of plugins it provided , so I asked APT to show me what it was .
Here 's what came up :
Now something jumped out at me , run native ALSA apps on OSS drivers ?
If you read my sound article , you know I 'm an advocate of OSS v4 , since it seems superior where it matters .
So I looked into the documentation for the Debian ( as well as Ubuntu ) package " libasound2 - plugins " on how this ALSA over OSS works exactly .
I edited , and changed it to the following :
And presto , every ALSA application now started properly outputting sound for me .
No more need to always have to fiddle with configurations for each sound layer to use OSS , because the distros do n't allow auto config of them .
I could never get flash on 64 bit with sound before , even though each new OSS release says they " fixed it " .
Now it does work for me .
I tested the following with ALSA : MPlayer ( - ao alsa ) Firefox , flashplugin - nonfree , Homestar Runner ZSNES ( - ad alsa ) bsnes ( defaults )
Oh and in case you 're wondering , mixing is working perfectly .
I tried running four instances of MPlayer , two set to use ALSA , the other two set to output using OSS , and I was able to hear all four at once .
Now it 's great to setup each application and sound layer individually to use OSS , so there 's less overhead .
But just making this one simple change means you do n't have to for each application where the distro defaulted to ALSA , or have to suffer incompatibility when a particular application is ALSA only .
Note that depending how you installed OSS and which version , it may have tried forcing ALSA programs to use a buggy ALSA emulation library , which is incomplete , and not bug for bug compatible with the real ALSA .
If that happened to you , here 's how to use the real ALSA libraries , which are 100 % ALSA compatible , as it's 100 % the real ALSA .
First check where everything is pointing with the following commandI get the following :
Now as you can see libasound .
so and libasound .
so.2 both point to libasound .
so.2.0.0 .
The bad emulation is called libsalsa .
So if instead of seeing " -> libasound ... " you see " -> libsalsa ... " there , you 'll want to correct the links .
You can correct with the following commands as root :
If you 're using Ubuntu and do n't know how to switch to root , tryprior to the steps above .
If you 'd like to try to configure as many applications as possible to use OSS directly to avoid any unneeded overhead , see the documentation here and here which provide a lot of useful information .
However if you 're happy with your current setup , the hassle to configure each additional application is n't needed as long as you setup ALSA to use OSS .
Enjoy your sound !
Today , 10th if June , the Office of the Prime Minister in the UK announced that Tim Berners - Lee will “ help drive opening of access to Government data on the web over the coming months . ”
The announcement is an important step in helping to fulfill the vision for a Web of Linked Open Data built on W3 C ’s open Semantic Web standards , espoused by Berners - Lee in his TED 2009 talk .
“ Government data — the people ’s data is an important component to the larger Linked Open Data movement , ” said Berners - Lee .
“ I look forward to working with multiple government agencies and local enthusiasts to help early adopters bring their data to the bigger picture . ”
In April , Berners - Lee engaged similarly with the US government offering to help them join the “ rapidly growing Linked Open Data cloud , to which US recovery data will be a welcome addition . ”
W3 C ’s own eGovernment Interest Group has also been actively building an international network of support to work with governments on issues of transparency , accountability , and efficiency through open data .
Sure , this is n't the sexiest MID render we 've ever seen , but it does make for a fun little video .
Cambridge Technology Development , known around MIT and environs for fluidic device design , CFD analysis , and a number of other things we know less than nothing about , have designed a collapsible , pocketable PC that they call the Dragonfly .
This bad boy can take the form of a flip phone , a straight - up netbook , or it can lay flat , in " table mode , " ideal for pen and touch input .
Of course , this is n't a real device -- and there 's no telling when or if it'll become available .
But when it does , how about floating us a review unit ?
Check 'er out yourself after the break .
As if things could n’t get any weirder in the on - going litigation between Apple and un-authorized clone maker Psystar , Apple recently filed a motion to remove the stay put in place after Psystar filed for bankruptcy protection 3 weeks ago .
If you recall , Apple and Psystar were in the midst of the Discovery process when Apple began filing motions in early May to compel Psystar to disclose pertinent financial information about its business , the reason being that Psystar ’s financial record keeping left much to be desired .
Psystar was required to hand over financial documents pertaining to revenues , sales , profits and losses , invoices and a smattering of other information that every incorporated business is required to keep track of .
But curiously , Psystar claimed that it either did n’t have the requested documents , or that they had been physically lost when Psystar moved office locations .
On top of that , Psystar President Rudy Pedraza was inexplicably unable to recall even the most basic financial information about the company he ’s in charge of running .
Consequently , Apple requested that Psystar make available for deposition , at their own expense , an individual who could answer those questions .
In early May , the court sided with Apple and ruled that Psystar had to produce an array of documents that it appeared to be purposefully keeping from Apple .
It also ruled that Psystar had until June 3 , 2009 to provide a Psystar representative capable of speaking about and knowledgeable of Psystar ’s financials .
Less than 3 weeks later , and just 1 week before the June 3 deadline , Psystar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , with filings showing that it owed more than $ 250,000 to a slew of creditors .
As a result , the ongoing litigation between Psystar and Apple was put on hold while the court sorted through Psystar ’s bankruptcy filing .
In the meantime , though , Psystar can continue to sell its hackintosh boxes that are at the root of Apple ’s lawsuit .
We ’ve covered Psystar in a somewhat in - depth fashion over the past few months , and it seems plainly obvious that Psystar is run by 2 brothers who overtly engage in shady business practices , their hackintosh business aside .
That ’s why it ’s not surprising that Apple is calling BS on Psystar ’s recent bankruptcy filings .
Apple asserts that Psystar is using its bankruptcy as a shield to protect itself from having to hand over , both in paper form and via deposition , important financial information about the company .
In addition , it allows them to continue selling hackintosh machines without having to worry about Apple ’s legal might .
Apple argues that putting their litigation with Psystar on hold allows Psystar to continue engaging in a business that might very well be illegal .
To the best of our knowledge , Psystar has yet to respond to Apple ’s motion , but when they do , you can bet that it ’ll be a hoot .
Who knows what kind of BS they ’re gonna come up with next .

What we 're learning , these thinkers argue , should make us reconsider some of the basic rules by which government regulates behavior : how we litigate lawsuits and write contracts ; how we zone neighborhoods ; which medical research we fund , and how we prioritize healthcare .
The findings of happiness researchers offer a new and potentially powerful set of tools to compare the impacts of various laws : how does it change everybody 's happiness if the minimum wage is raised , if the speed limit is lowered , if divorce laws are loosened ?
These findings have fed the growth of a burgeoning " positive psychology " movement focused on helping people enrich their own lives .
But now some scholars are starting to ask a bigger question : should n't this new understanding affect policy , too ?
A huge range of social systems , from tort law to urban planning to medical care , are built on assumptions about what makes people happy .
Now , for the first time , researchers are claiming to be actually measuring happiness , to actually know what causes it .
In a society whose founding document asserts a basic right to the pursuit of happiness , that new knowledge could have far - reaching implications .
In recent years , cognitive scientists have turned in increasing numbers to the study of human happiness , and one of their central findings is that we are not very good at predicting how happy or unhappy something will make us .
Given time , survivors of tragedies and traumas report themselves nearly as happy as they were before , and people who win the lottery or achieve lifelong dreams do n't see any long - term increase in happiness .
By contrast , annoyances like noise or chronic pain bring down our happiness more than you 'd think , and having friends or an extra hour of sleep every night can raise it dramatically .
But in fact , it 's back pain that causes more misery .
Most blind people would like to be able to see , of course , but once they 've figured out how to live a sightless life , their blindness does n't really make them unhappy .
Chronic pain , on the other hand , sours our mood with every new twinge , and we never really adapt to it .
IF YOU WERE given the choice , and you wanted to reduce human suffering by as much as possible , would you cure blindness or back pain ?
It seems a silly question .
The thought of losing one 's sight is , to most people , as frightening as it is depressing : we would no longer be stirred by sunsets or landscapes or the expressions on the faces of our loved ones .
Everyday chores would become more difficult , crossing the street perilous .
Many sports and pastimes would simply be off - limits , and we would lose a good deal of our independence .
Because serious happiness research is still new , these proposals remain broad , even speculative .
But underlying all of them is the likelihood that if our longtime assumptions about happiness are wrong , they have led to ineffective , even counterproductive , laws and policies .
" This work challenges not only the way the legal system works , but a lot of the assumptions that we 've been making about the way people act and think and behave and feel , " says Jeremy Blumenthal , an associate professor at the Syracuse University College of Law .
Some skeptics think it 's premature to let happiness research dictate policy : much of the data is still provisional , and some findings seem to contradict each other .
And , more fundamentally , some argue that no amount of data could justify the sort of paternalism that would be required for the government to force people into some happiness - maximizing choices .
It 's part of a broader debate that has preoccupied thinkers since the dawn of philosophy but been rekindled by the new research : how do we define happiness , anyway , and how much should we value it ?
The patron saint of the happiness maximizers is Jeremy Bentham , the English philosopher who two centuries ago gave the world the ethical theory known as utilitarianism .
The theory itself is simple : in any situation , the best thing to do is that which brings the greatest aggregate pleasure or happiness .
Bentham imagined a " hedonic calculus " : a systematic reckoning that weighed factors like intensity of feeling , duration , purity and the number of people affected .
One of his disciples , Francis Edgeworth , wrote hopefully of a future when utilitarians could use a device he called a " hedonimeter " to simply read out a person 's happiness level .
Since then , social scientists and policymakers have tended to reject Bentham 's ideas as unusably vague .
The " hedonic calculus " seemed too riddled with subjectivity to base real - world social policies on .
But some psychologists have begun to argue that you can , in fact , reliably measure happiness : all you need to do is ask people .
Because we so badly mispredict and misremember how happy something made us , however , the trick is to ask people to rate their current happiness , and then track the changes over time .
Many recent studies have subjects keep happiness diaries ; others give them beepers and have them rate their happiness whenever beeped .
These studies , matched up with research that relies on more general happiness self - reporting , have begun to provide a consistent , and occasionally surprising , portrait of what really feeds and impedes happiness .
Rush Limbaugh called it an attempt by the Obama Administration to " stifle what anybody would consider to be normal political dissent " :
" Rightwing extremists are harnessing this historical election as a recruitment tool .
Many rightwing extremists are antagonistic toward the new presidential administration and its perceived stance on a range of issues , including immigration and citizenship , the expansion of social programs to minorities , and restrictions on firearms ownership and use .
Rightwing extremists are increasingly galvanized by these concerns and leverage them as drivers for recruitment .
From the 2008 election timeframe to the present , rightwing extremists have capitalized on related racial and political prejudices in expanded propaganda campaigns , thereby reaching out to a wider audience of potential sympathizers . "
What you have here is Barack Obama , forget Napolitano , it 's his administration , he provides the vision , he puts people in these positions that he wants to do his bidding .
This is Barack Obama , and this is an effort to stifle what anybody would consider to be normal political dissent .
He is characterizing those of you who oppose an expanding government , huge socialistic tendencies , legalization of illegals for the purpose of making them Democrats , we are now right - wing extremists and we are arming up , and this report is to warn other law enforcement agencies of the dangers posed by right - wing extremists .
Obama Report on " Right - Wing Radicals " Timed for Tea Parties
Michael Steele was insulted :
This is the height of insult here .
I 'm sorry , Sean .
I just want to jump on this so badly because this is so — talk about arrogance .
Talk about insult .
I mean to segment out Americans who dissent from this administration , to segment out conservatives in this country who have a different philosophy or view from this administration , and labeling them as terrorists and then to call into question the service of the men and women who are right now standing on that wall defending our freedom and linking them to terrorism while you refuse to call the terrorists — the real terrorists — terrorists , to me it 's the height of insult , and you know , you know , the president and Napolitano , with these half - hearted apologies , to American citizens versus these full throated apologies to the rest of the world , to me is embarrassing .
Steele Blasts ' Right - Wing Extremist ' Label
Michelle Malkin saw it as confirmation that the Obama Administration was out to get conservatives :
By contrast , the piece of crap report issued on April 7 is a sweeping indictment of conservatives .
And the intent is clear .
As the two spokespeople I talked with on the phone today made clear :
They both pinpointed the recent " economic downturn " and the " general state of the economy " for stoking " rightwing extremism . "
One of the spokespeople said he was told that the report has been in the works for a year .
My b.s. detector went off the chart , and yours will , too , if you read through the entire report — which asserts with no evidence that an unquantified " resurgence in rightwing extremist recruitment and radicalizations activity " is due to home foreclosures , job losses , and ... the historical presidential election .
In Obama land , there are no coincidences .
It is no coincidence that this report echoes Tea Party - bashing left - wing blogs ( check this one out comparing the Tea Party movement to the Weather Underground ! ) and demonizes the very Americans who will be protesting in the thousands on Wednesday for the nationwide Tax Day Tea Party .
Confirmed : The Obama DHS hit job on conservatives is real
Newt Gingrich tweeted :
The person who drafted the outrageous homeland security memo smearing veterans and conservatives should be fired .
Newt Gingrich
I guess Newt jumped the twit , because a reporter at Fox News disclosed the fact that it was the Bush Administration that ordered the report :
However , this morning , Fox News ’s Catherine Herridge revealed that the report , along with an earlier report on radicalized left - wing groups , was actually " requested by the Bush administration " but not completed until recently :
HERRIDGE :
Well this is an element of the story which has largely gone unreported .
One looks at right - wing groups , as you mentioned .
And a second is on left - wing groups .
Significantly , both were requested by the Bush administration but not finished until President Bush left office .
Fox Reporter Contradicts Fox : DHS Report On Right Wing Was ‘ Requested By The Bush Administration ’
As Brian Beutler at TPM reports , Shepard Smith at Fox News says today that it is time to take a second look at that report :
Say what ?
You want to go back and read that report again for content , instead of looking for problems with the labels it used to identify extremists ?
I would hope that Fox News is beginning to realize that there are consequences for the type of hate - filled commentary and reporting they offer to viewers of Fox News .
But , I 'm not holding my breath .
Update :
Thank you to grannyhelen for reminding me that Shep Smith did n't join the bandwagon when the report was released in April :
Shepard Smith brought that rarest of things to Fox News yesterday : amid the cacophony over the Tea Parties , he actually committed an act of journalism .
In the process , he also managed to also bring a voice of sanity to the nonstop right - wing shrieking at Fox over the recent Department of Homeland Security bulletin about the possible rise of right - wing extremism .
In fact , Smith confirms everything we 've reported here :
Not only is the report focused entirely on the very real problem of the lethally violent potential of extremist right - wing terrorism , but mainstream conservatives ' wailing and teeth - gnashing over it is -- besides being an egregious display of a persecution complex -- if anything a tacit admission of their own complicity in fueling extremist rhetoric .
Shepard Smith blows the ' DHS is picking on the Tea Parties ' meme out of the water
Today : Smith on DHS report and Holocaust Museum shooting : " It was a warning to us all , and it appears now they were right "
Update II : So what did that report actually say ?
I just read an excellent recap by Joan Walsh over at Salon :
What should happen now ?
Ironically , a great example of the right - wing echo chamber 's bullying came when they managed to smack down the release of a Department of Homeland Security report about the rise of right - wing extremism .
Judging from the right 's rhetoric , you 'd have thought Janet Napolitano was suggesting rounding up Rush and his dittoheads and putting them in an old Japanese - American internment camp or something .
But in fact , as Susan Page explained today on " Hardball , " the calm nine - page report merely looked at warning signs for extremism , based on history :
They include a prolonged economic downturn , the demonization of immigrants , the election of the first black president , fears about losing the right to own guns , a banking crisis inciting age - old paranoia about " Jewish cabals " and the return of many veterans to the States suffering from PTSD and other conditions while getting insufficient care .
Presciently , the report said the top perceived threat was a " lone wolf " : " White supremacist lone wolves pose the most significant domestic terrorist threat because of their low profile and autonomy — separate from any formalized group — which hampers warning efforts . "
DHS , meet James von Brunn , whose wife divorced him because of his hatred , racism , paranoia and violence .
Can right - wing hate talk lead to murder ?
This is the problem .
Separate and aside from the fact Right - Wing Hate Talk incites people to violence , when this report came out the story was n't about the report and what it contained .
Nobody was saying , " Let 's talk about ideas of how we can help identify these lone wolf home - grown terrorists and neutralize them before they can act . "
The story became about the labels within the report and perceived offenses against political factions .
Will anybody in the media have the courage to go back to all those who demonized the report in April , and ask them what they think of that report now ?
And if so , will those people who attacked Janet Napolitano for issuing the report , continue to claim they were correct in their accusations at the time ?
I watched Northeastern University Criminologist Jack Levin interviewed on Countdown with Keith Olbermann and he made some excellent points , as well ,
But let me point out something .
First of all , it 's not the ideology that comes from the right that causes these kinds of crimes .
It 's the name calling .
You know , these kinds of racists view blacks and Asians and latinos as sub - human , as animals .
And they see Jews as the children of Satan .
They do n't like Catholics , they do n't like gays .
They do n't specialize .
There 's a whole bunch of people they regard as less than human and as influences that come from outside of our society .
( snip )
Certainly , we 've been very concerned , as you know , to fight the War on Terror .
And we always see it as international , coming from the Middle East , or Pakistan .
What a lot of people do n't realize is that the vast majority of terrorism since 9/11 has actually come from American citizens .
It 's domestic , it 's not international , the vast majority .
If we can't turn our country around and stop the personal attacks , this is going to get much worse .
Last year I watched the interview of Supreme Court Justice Scalia on 60 Minutes .
No , I do not agree with Scalia on many of his opinions , but I do agree with him about one thing .
Lesley Stahl ( Interviewing ) :
But do you respect that there 's another way to look at this ?
Antonin Scalia :
You know the story of the Baptist preacher who was asked if he believed in total immersion Baptism .
And he said , " Believe in it ?
Why , I 've seen it done . "
I have to say the same thing about your question .
There must be other views because I 've seen them .
Lesley Stahl ( Interviewing ) : But do you respect them ?
You do n't .
Do you ?
Antonin Scalia : I respect the people who have them but I think those views are just flat out wrong .
Lesley Stahl ( Narrating ) :
He 's talking about some of his fellow justices , like Ruth Bader Ginsburg , a liberal who is , and this never ceases to surprise people , one of his best friends both on and off the court [ displaying photo of Scalia and Ginsburg sitting on top of an elephant ] .
Ruth Bader Ginsburg : I see the constitution as striving for a more perfect union .
Lesley Stahl ( Narrating ) :
To her , the constitution evolves and should reflect changes in society .
That going back to what was meant originally when they wrote for instance , We The People , makes little sense .
Ruth Bader Ginsburg : Who were We the People in 1787 ?
You would not be among We the People .
African Americans would not be among the people .
Switches back to interview with Justice Scalia Lesley Stahl ( Interviewing ) : Justice Ginsburg and you disagree .
Antonin Scalia :
We do indeed .
Lesley Stahl ( Interviewing ) :
On lots of things , and yet , you 're such good friends .
Antonin Scalia : I attack ideas .
I do n't attack people .
And some very good people have some very bad ideas .
And if you can't separate the two , you gotta get another day job .
You do n't want to be a judge .
At least not a judge on a multi-member panel .

The remainder of the interview is here : Part Two
I attack ideas .
I do n't attack people .
Who is going to explain to the Rush Limbaugh , Bill O'Reilly , Glen Beck , and their ilk , that if the continued to attack people , that this problem is only going to get worse ?
Will they listen ?
Do they care ?
The case for keeping banks in something close to their current structure begins to take shape .
It ’s not about traditional claims that big banks are more efficient , or Lloyd Blankfein ’s argument that this is the only way to encourage risk - taking , or even the House Financial Services Committee view that immediate resumption of credit flows is essential for preserving jobs .
Rather , the argument is : those opposed to banks and bankers are angry populists who , if unchecked , would do great damage .
Bankers should therefore agree to some mild reforms and more socially acceptable behavior in the short - run ; in return , the centrists who control economic policymaking will protect them against the building backlash .
This is a version of Jamie Dimon ’s line : “ if you let them vilify us too much , the economic recovery will be greatly delayed . ”
There are three problems with this argument : it is wrong , it wo n’t work , and it does n’t move the reform process at all in the right direction .
The “ center vs. the pitchforks ” idea fundamentally misconstrues the current debate .
This is not about angry left or right against the center .
It ’s about centrist technocrat ( close to current big finance ) vs. centrist technocrat ( suspicious of big finance ; economists , lawyers , nonfinancial business , and – most interestingly – current / former finance , other than the biggest of the big , particularly people with experience in emerging markets . )
Just as an example , a broad range of entirely centrist people ( including in and around the IMF ; former Treasury ; you ’d be amazed ) are expressing support for the ideas in our Atlantic article .
People on the left are , not surprisingly , also in line with this view ; but we ’re also hearing convergent thoughts from some on the right – many who emphasize improving the environment for entrepreneurship do n’t see big finance as their friend .
So far , the only person who called to complain works for an “ oligarch . ”
You might think the “ anti- pitchfork ” strategy might work , particularly as it has in the past ( e.g. , in the early Clinton years ) .
The problem for this strategy now is not just the fragile state of banks – by itself this can be ignored for a long while through forbearance , behind a smokescreen of complicated schemes with confusing acronyms – but the ways in which the markets they created now operate .
Just as global financial liberalization created the potential for capital to move violently across countries and greatly facilitated speculative attacks on currencies , so financial deregulation within the United States has made it possible for capital markets to attack – or , in less colorful terms , go short or place massive negative bets on – the credit of big banks and , in the latest developments , the ability of the government to bailout / rescue banks .
The latest credit default spreads data for the largest banks show a speculative run underway .
As the system stabilizes , it becomes more plausible that a single big bank will fail or be rescued in a way that involves large losses for creditors .
This would like trigger further speculative attacks on other banks , much as the shorting of countries ’ obligations spread from Thailand to Indonesia / Malaysia and then to Korea in fall 1997 .
The government ’s own policies are facilitating these attacks , because as the Fed and Treasury make progress towards easing credit conditions , this makes it easier and cheaper for large hedge funds and others to take large short positions .
And keep in mind the underlying loss of confidence is self - fulfilling : as you lose confidence , you want to go short , and selling the credit causes further loss of confidence – and banks are forced out of business .
The government ’s entirely reasonable and long overdue request for a resolution authority will set up runs on that authority .
If the authority is not granted , the runs will be on the government ’s low and failing ability to save banks – given that the trust of Congress has been lost and no more cash for bailouts is likely forthcoming ( presumably until there are large further shock waves or until Goldman Sachs itself is on the line . )
The continuing pressure on banks has nothing to do with populism and everything to do with the internal contradictions of the house of cards they built .
Now they will scramble to limit short selling or find other emergency measures that will protect their credit .
Such partial fixes would do nothing to stop the underlying deterioration of their credit ; think about how countries facing currency attacks throw up futile defenses , try to change the rules , and squander their reserves on the way down .
You can see where this is going , but do not cheer .
The likely result will be misery for many and further financial chaos around the world .
The big issue is of course the financial sector reform process .
Some of my colleagues expressed great satisfaction with the progress made by the G20 .
But progressing down a blind alley is not something to be pleased about .
I have yet to hear a single responsible official in any industrial country state what is obvious to most technocrats who are not currently officials : anything too big to fail is too big to exist .
If the bankers were just stupid , as suggested by David Brooks , then regulatory fixes might make some sense .
But we know that bankers are smart , so it is their organizations that became stupid .
What is the economic and political power structure that made it possible for such stupid organizations to become so large relative to the economy ?
Answer this and you address what we need to do going forward .
At a high profile conference in the run-up to this crisis , someone destined to become a leading official in the Obama Administration responded to a sensible technocratic critique of the financial system ’s incentive structure ( from the IMF , no less ) by calling it “ Luddite ” .
By all accounts , this is the prevailing attitude in today ’s White House .
But the right metaphor is not breaking productive machines , or peasants with pitchforks , or even the poor vs. the rich .
It ’s as if the organizations running the nuclear power industry had shown themselves to be stupid and profoundly dangerous .
You might wish to abolish nuclear power , but that is not a realistic option ; storming power plants makes no sense ; and the industry has captured all regulators ever sent after them .
The technocratic options are simple , ( 1 ) assume a better regulator , of a kind that has never existed on this face of this earth , ( 2 ) make banks smaller , less powerful , and much more boring .

DJ gang 'used stolen credit cards to buy their OWN music on iTunes then pocketed £ 200,000 in royalties '
A gang of DJs used stolen credit cards to buy their own music on iTunes in a scam that netted about £ 200,000 in bogus royalties , police said today .
Nine people were arrested after detectives raided properties in London and the Midlands as part of an international operation .
The arrests follow a joint investigation with the FBI that began in February .
Apple boss Steve Jobs .
Apple iTunes and Amazon.com were targeted by a gang of musicians who uploaded their music and then used stolen credit cards to buy it
A London DJ is among the gang who police believe uploaded music to Apple iTunes and Amazon.com for sale between September 2008 and January 2009 before spending around £ 460,000 buying the tracks using 1,500 stolen credit cards .
Apple and Amazon then paid royalties on the sales totalling nearly £ 200,000 , while the gang members enjoyed the added benefit of boosting their position in the music charts .
Detective Chief Inspector Terry Wilson said : ' This has been a complex investigation to establish what we believe to be an international conspiracy to defraud Apple and Amazon .
' This investigation , with its national and international dimension , exemplifies why we have set up this national response to e-crime .
It shows the success that can be achieved through our close working relationship with the FBI .
' We are now making it more risky for criminals who seek to exploit the Internet and commit e-crime across national borders .
We are working hard through partnership with industry and law enforcement to combat e-crime and are committed to pursuing those responsible . '
It is thought the gang compiled 19 songs to put on the websites and that their songs even attracted the attention of music industry bosses .
The group allegedly paid an annual £ 18 - per-album fee to music distribution service Tunecore to get their albums uploaded onto the sites before downloading them at £ 6 a time .
Six men and three women were arrested at addresses in London , Birmingham , Kent and Wolverhampton .
All nine are in custody at police stations in London and the Midlands on suspicion of conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering .
I have never read a self - help book and consider myself immune to out - of - body experiences .
Meditation bores me and the few times I tried yoga , I ended up inexplicably angry .
Above all , what I most certainly do not do is stand up in front of 200 people who openly talk about sharing , loving and personal journeys , and apologise for getting it all wrong .
Except , as of last Tuesday , I apparently do .
This is how it happened .
When I signed up to a course held by Landmark Education , I wanted to investigate tales I had heard about a course that turned intelligent , predominantly middle - class professionals into strange automatons .
Students were said to lose all sense of themselves and take to phoning loved ones late at night to bring up long - forgotten arguments while excoriating themselves for real and imagined character flaws .
A quick look on the internet revealed even more dramatic claims .
Since its creation in 1991 , Landmark Education has been described variously as a cult , an exercise in brainwashing and a marketing trick cooked up by a conman to sap the vulnerable of their savings .
Landmark rebuts such claims .
Not satisfied with simply transforming the lives of its students , it promises to deliver the secret of what it means to be human and guarantees them futures greater than they could imagine .
For £ 275 and 39 hours of my time , it seemed like an offer worth considering .
In my head , however , I had already begun to draft an article about a society so needy that even its educated elite were mugs enough to pay through the nose for such vague , preposterous promises .
Mugs or not , over the past two years , Landmark has experienced an astonishing surge of interest .
While most companies congratulate themselves on achieving a 6 per cent growth , Landmark boasts a steady 10 per cent rise in customers across 100 cities and 21 countries .
More than 125,000 people in the world participated in Landmark 's courses last year .
In 2001 , its revenues reached $ 56 million , although the organisation is struggling to recover from the destruction of its main New York office in the Twin Towers .
But it is on Britain 's cynical shores that the organisation has struck gold , attracting more than 1,050 students each month , 80 per cent of whom go on to take a second course .
Questioning former students on what the course taught them got me nowhere : happy to talk , they spoke winningly of transformations and breakthroughs , insights and possibilities while remaining vague as to how such magic was achieved .
Clearly , the only way to get to the bottom of the course was to attend myself .
So it was that three weeks ago , I reinvented myself as a human resources manager for an unspecified City firm , and signed myself up .
It was with mild trepidation that I took my seat on Friday morning in the all - white lecture hall in Landmark Education 's rented north London offices .
I had three days of lectures ahead of me , each day lasting 15 hours and seemingly designed to induce mild sleep deprivation .
Still , I had been guaranteed a transformation by Monday morning .
We sit in rows .
On the stage in front of us , 53 - year - old Jerry Baden perches on a director 's chair and twinkles at us with dark eyes .
Below him sit 160 students , aged from 18 to 84 , with the majority in their thirties .
There is a fairly equal balance between the sexes and we are a reasonably representative ethnic mix .
On the floor beneath us , are 100 Forum graduates taking the £ 495 Advanced course .
Two floors below , another 100 students study the £ 90 Self - Expression and Leadership programme .
The building practically throbs with budding transformations .
People look apprehensive .
There is much twisting of hair , shifting in seats and quick , covert glances around the room : everyone seems to be wondering what they have got themselves into .
Jerry is bombarding us with grand claims : Landmark Education is so powerful , he says , that it could achieve world peace if used correctly .
He slips in a reference to Arafat and Rabin shaking hands in the rose garden ; it was a Landmark moment , he claims .
Really ?
Our eyebrows have barely time to arch in cynical disbelief but he has swept on .
World peace aside , this course will transform our lives , he promises .
Transformation will come to all , but individual moments will vary : like corn , we are told , we will pop at different times .
' But not all popcorn pops , ' I think , momentarily panicked by the sure knowledge that I 'm going to be that one last kernel , left charred and blackened at the bottom of the pan .
Jerry sweeps on .
To pop , we must make ourselves coachable .
We must not , he emphasises , choosing the one word guaranteed to strike fear into my soul , be observers .
He seems to look straight at me .
I kick my notebook under my chair and sit up straighter .
There are rules .
Timekeeping is essential , toilet breaks are discouraged : missing even a minute will jeopardise our chance of achieving transformation .
We will work for three to four hours at a time .
During short breaks , we will have homework .
There is one meal break in the early evening and more homework after the day is done .
Notetaking , unprescribed medicines and alcohol are forbidden and we must open our minds to all suggestions .
Are we being lulled into dangerous credulity ?
We discuss it anxiously in corners during our first break .
Are these mind games ?
Is this how brainwashing begins ?
We glance over our shoulders as we whisper together to see if we are being watched .
Comforted , I think , by the discovery that we all share the same anxieties , we begin to relax .
We start to take active responsibility for each other and a community is formed .
Over the next three days , we are educated in a mix of philosophies , psychology and religious theories , illustrated by readings from books , plays and one detailed description of the entire plot of Citizen Kane .
Including the ending .
The theories expounded cherry pick ideas from existential philosophy and motivational psychology .
They take in aspects of Maxwell Maltz 's psycho-cybernetics , Zen Buddhism , Alan Watts and Freud .
Shadows of Abraham Maslow , Hinduism , Dale Carnegie , Norman Vincent Peale and P.T. Barnum flit over the proceedings .
We 're encouraged to share and , schooled by Oprah in what to do with a platform and a neurosis , people rush to the microphone to have Jerry lay waste to their tales of parental neglect , social deprivation and emotional hardship .
It 's useful but not rocket science and I remained stolidly unpopped .
We 've been sitting in the same , hard chairs for almost 13 hours .
I 'm bored and my back hurts .
There are two more hours to go before we can go home , by which time my last train will be long gone .
I begin to get cross .
I suspect I 'm losing what little coachability I might once have possessed .
Next morning , we retake our seats .
Everyone in my row spent hours on their homework .
I unwound instead by reading P.G. Wodehouse and criticising the course with my boyfriend .
I feel bad .
I 've had kinder starts to the day .
We 're still taking our seats when Jerry begins shouting :
We 're ugly people .
Disgusting .
Our behaviour is entirely governed by a need to look good which makes us liars , fakes and frauds .
' You 're disgusting , ' he shouts .
' You just do n't realise quite how disgusting you are yet . '
He pauses .
' But you 're just about to find out . '
His timing is impeccable ; we 've hardly woken up and we 're already hanging on his every word .
This morning , he says , he is going to force our resistant minds to recognise how fetid and mean our personalities are .
He shouts , he mocks , he refuses to let us ask questions .
He tells us we 're liars and ridicules the stories we tell about our own lives .
I can hardly bear it .
I resent the way he struts across the stage and the way he takes stock of us all , smoothing the pleats in his trousers and patting his hair .
I find his confidence intolerable and am maddened by his belief that he knows us better than we know ourselves .
And yet , I am gradually forced to admit that he might be right .
One after another , Jerry lambasts those who take the microphone to complain about how hard , harsh and unfair their lives have been .
He pushes them through stages of anger , tears and denial until they stand face to face with their own delusions , deceits and contrivances .
Jerry knows he 's won .
Now that we 're putty in his hands , he launches his bombshell .
For every relationship that has failed , it is up to us to make it right .
And now .
In the next break .
It 's time for that phone call .
He asks for a show of hands : who will make the call .
A smattering of hands go up .
Too few for Jerry , who tells us to begin the conversation with the words : ' I 've been making you wrong for ...' , ' I 've been resenting ...' or ' I regret that ...'.
There are more hands in the air now and Jerry ploughs on .
However we choose to begin the call , he says , we 're to end it with the unambiguous , unilateral statement : ' I love you . '
A few people take their hands back down .
By midday , the pressure to make the phone call is so intense that people are dialling as they walk down the stairs .
Tearful heart - to - hearts take place in public corridors as once - implacable feelings of hurt and recrimination turn to reconciliation in a few short sentences .
I do not make a phone call - I feel I have no one to call - but I see how brave and strong others are to make theirs .
I begin to wonder whether it is healthy self - awareness or a deepset denial that make me feel so stable .
I begin to prod at the possibility of the latter .
Landmark has faced accusations of being a cult , but I saw nothing of that .
Far from working to separate us from our families and friends , we were told there was no relationship too dead to be revived , no love too cold to be warmed .
One girl who complains that she cannot feel close to her own mother realises she has never recovered from seeing her struggle ferociously bring up a young family alone .
' You were scared of your mother at the age of four and have been carrying that frightened child around with you ever since , ' Jerry says .
That evening , she phones her mother .
' I did n't even realise I was doing it because the feeling had become so familiar , ' she says next day .
' It 's only now I 've stopped being scared of her that I realised how it had affected our relationship . '
By the third day , nearly everyone except me seems to have popped .
One man who has called everyone in his phonebook describes his newfound joy to another man who has just rung every woman he has ever slept with .
People are straining at the leash to take their new - found confidence out into the real world .
Everywhere , plans are being made ; careers are reinvigorated and lives overhauled .
I wish I could be part of it but , apart from recognising a couple of useful lifestyle tools , I remain out in the cold .
Eventually , I realise I 'm breaking the promise I made to be coachable .
I decide to stop analysing , and simply give Jerry my trust .
The words sound extraordinary in my mouth : this is not what I do .
As a semi-interloper , I do n't feel I have the right to go up to the microphone but at the next break I ask Jerry to show me how to mend a once - strong relationship that hit a barrier .
' We make others wrong so we can be right and you just love to be right , do n't you ? ' he says .
His words mean nothing to me .
I do n't understand .
Jerry speaks as though to a child .
Chastened , I accept his condescension ; I realise his words will change my view on not just this relationship but on others .
I struggle and dimly begin to see his point .
If my friend did n't regard what she did as wrong then there are at least two versions of her intention .
If there are two interpretations of anyone 's meaning , there might be dozens .
If , therefore , there is no absolute truth , then whatever I believe about someone else 's intentions says more about me than about them .
I feel pins and needles run down my legs .
I realise I have , finally , popped .
Now I have to make that call .
' Just tell her you love her , ' Jerry concludes , getting up .
I do n't want him to go now .
I want him to stay for ever and advise me .
' Is n't that the only thing you know for certain ? ' he asks .
' Just tell her what you know to be true . '
And I do .
It 's easy , surprisingly so .
In a single phone call I get a friendship back .
She tells me she loves me too .
I cry and am happy .
Two days later , after a tentative excursion into the real world , we return to compare notes .
I cannot find a single person who believes their life has n't improved .
We 're invited to come up to the microphone and share .
It is Doug Tucker , a 35 - year - old hot tub salesman from Stratford - upon - Avon who puts it best .
Over 6ft 4in , with a shaven head and rippling biceps tattooed with a snarling bulldog and the England flag , Doug is hardly the middle - class professional the course appears to attract .
' If anyone who knew me before I came on this course said I would even be in the same room as a bunch of people clapping and saying they loved each other , I would have hit them , ' he says .
' Likewise , if anyone had told me I would have realised things about myself that I 've realised in the last few days , I would have laughed in their face . '
' This course has transformed me .
And the funny thing is , I did n't know I even had it in me to transform , ' he smiled .
The Landmark Forum is not magic .
It is not scary or insidious .
It is , in fact , simple common sense delivered in an environment of startling intensity .
It is this intensity that makes the difference .
While any one of us might well have already been told the same home truths by friends and family , we were too distracted by life and too wrapped up in our own defence mechanisms to listen .
Landmark takes you away from life .
The three days create a bubble of possibility in which we were able to try on new opinions and experiment with fresh behaviours .
I do n't know whether I will apply every lesson in the future , although I hope I will .
I 'm simply going to trust Jerry when he promised it was like riding a bicycle ; that once we learn how to balance , we never forget .
Although we might , every so often , still fall off .
Secret seven
The Landmark Forum's ' seven commandments ' for being an extraordinary person :
· Be Racket - Free : give up being right - even when you know you were .

· Be Unreasonable : in expectations of yourself and others beyond what you would think they are capable of .
Bus Travel Takes Off
Bus travel in the United States has increased ( 8.1 % in 2007 and 9.8 % in 2008 ) over the past couple of years .
A nation that prides itself on traveling by automobile is starting to see ultra cheap bus tickets that are too attractive to pass up .
In many cases , travelers are finding that it ’s even more convenient than air travel .
That ’s especially true in the Northeast corridor with the popular route from New York to Boston that is served by Chinatown buses .

Americans love their cars , but concerns over gas prices and the environment are likely to keep them open to alternatives .
If buses prices continue to drop , inter-city bus travel will persevere in the coming years .
That scenario is likely with the success of budget companies such as MegaBus and BoltBus .
Throw in President Obama ’s recent proposal for a high - speed rail , and the nation may be moving in a new direction .
Have you traveled by bus in the U.S. ?
Which route ?
How was it ?

Did you ever wonder what Jim Stewart of Stewart ’s Calculus did with his ill - gotten millions ?
Apparently , he built a really big house one with a concert hall in the middle .
In addition to his textbook writing , Stewart is also a classical violinist , and he built the hall so that he and others could use it to perform .

Norway 's largest dairy products producer is redesigning the logo they use on one of their chocolate milk products .
They invited the public to design cows of their own , and then vote on them to decide the winner , which then becomes the new logo .
Right now a Pirate Bay - inspired cow is in second place .
Tine , Norways largest dairy products company is giving its Litago chocolate milk branding a bit of a makeover .
Rather than waste time and money employing expensive designers , they started a competition .
Litago milk features a cow on the packaging so not wanting to break with tradition , Tine invited the public to enter their own cow designs .
Once all entries were received voting began – the winning cow will become the new Litago logo – no bull .
Here are the finalists , they are very amoosing .
According to reports , the cow in first place right now – the Opera Browser Cow – could have been put there by supporters or even ( gasp ) employees of the Norwegian browser company .
An udderly scandalous allegation , especially when the steaks are this high .
But take a closer look at the design in second place right now .
That ’s right , just as expected , it ’s a Pirate Bay - inspired cow .
With green arrows on it .
“ What we are really talking about here is Litago with a Pirate bay logo , submitted by a someone who loves to drink milk and loves to download torrents , ” say IT - Avisen , “ but perhaps has less love for Tøndel and intellectual property law . ”
But of course , Tine has a few safeguards to ensure that no Pirate Bay logo gets anywhere near their bottles and packaging .
The final decision will be made by a panel of farmers judges – selected by Tine .
Moo .
This was fun
You have a pretty fantastic game here with some really nice options and the whole idea of the game is very fun and makes you think a little bit so that 's cool the controls are great and overall everything was fun about this game if I can offer any kind of improvment maybe ad some medals to this game but anyways congrats on the award for this game well deserved

Making a hash of floating point numbers
I 've always thought that hash tables were well named , because often when you see how people have used them you wonder what they were smoking at the time .
Often the problem revolves around a mistaken notion that switching a binary search tree for a hashed container bestows some sort of magical constant time lookup behavior , but sometimes it 's more subtle .
One case has to deal with the choice of hash function .
The hash function for a hashed container converts a key to a bucket index with the intent of trying to distribute data items as evenly as possible .
Given a decent distribution for input values , the hash function for an integral key can be as simple as just using the integer value itself , with the container then applying a modulus operation to wrap it within the bucket count .
Anyone who 's gone down this route , however , then discovers the problem of trying to do this for a key that is of floating point type .
Usually the first thing they try is something like this :
size_t operator ( ) ( float value ) const {
return ( size_t ) ( value * 100 ) ;
}
This is unfortunately usually fairly slow due to poor performance in the float - to - int conversion .
There 's also the matter of slightly worse behavior around zero due to truncation toward zero instead of negative infinity .
At this point , the inclination is probably to just give up and either deal with it or use a different container .
Others go " aha ! " and use this hack instead :
size_t operator ( ) ( float value ) const {
return ( size_t ) *( const unsigned int *) &value ;
}
This code uses the bit pattern of the float as the hash value .
Yeah , it 's non-portable .
It 's also got problems with the aliasing rules of the C language .
In the not so unusual case of being able to depend on a 32 - bit integral type and IEEE single precision floating point , though , it 's a really neat and fast trick .
And , sadly , it 's also wrong .
If you 've done this or thought about it , do n't feel bad .
The .NET Framework team almost made this mistake , too .
Reason after the jump .
Negative zero is the problem .
For IEEE floats , positive zero and negative zero differ by only the sign bit in bit pattern , but compare equal as floats .
Using the bit pattern as the hash code therefore results in an inconsistency in the hashed container where two values compare equal but have different hash codes .
I 've also seen people burned by this when trying to compare floats quickly with integer compares ( - 0 < +0 ) and when implementing fast float - to - int functions ( floorToInt ( - 0 ) = - 1 ) .
A plan to create a new Pentagon cybercommand is raising significant privacy and diplomatic concerns , as the Obama administration moves ahead on efforts to protect the nation from cyberattack and to prepare for possible offensive operations against adversaries ’ computer networks .
Some administration officials have begun to discuss whether laws or regulations must be changed to allow law enforcement , the military or intelligence agencies greater access to networks or Internet providers when significant evidence of a national security threat was found .
Ms. Leed said that while the Defense Department and related intelligence agencies were the only organizations that had the ability to protect against such cyberattacks , " they are not the best suited , from a civil liberties perspective , to take on that responsibility . "
Frida Berrigan , a longtime peace activist who is a senior program associate at the New America Foundation ’s arms and security initiative , expressed concerns about whether the Obama administration would be able to balance its promise to respect privacy in cyberspace even as it appeared to be militarizing cybersecurity .
" Obama was very deliberate in saying that the U.S. military and the U.S. government would not be looking at our e-mail and not tracking what we do online , " Ms. Berrigan said .
" This is not to say there is not a cyberthreat out there or that cyberterrorism is not a significant concern .
We should be vigilant and creative .
But once again we see the Pentagon being put at the heart of it and at front lines of offering a solution . "
Ms. Berrigan said that just as the counterinsurgency wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had proved that " there is no front line anymore , and no demilitarized zone anymore , then if the Pentagon and the military services see cyberspace as a battlefield domain , then the lines protecting privacy and our civil liberties get blurred very , very quickly . "
With regard to FISA and issues of liberty and privacy in general , let me now ask you a few questions .
How long do you think it would take you to identify , read , and understand every provision in every statute , regulation and other authorization that gives surveillance powers to the government ?
Furthermore : Would you know each and every place to look , or how to determine what those places were ?
Additionally : With a staff of 20 , or 50 , could it be done , even if you were provided with limitless time and limitless funds ?
I submit to you , without qualification or reservation , that you could not do it .
No one could .
Consider that most legislators in Washington are n't even aware of much of what 's in the bills they so eagerly vote on .
Consider the prohibitive length and complexity of legislation that comes before Congress .
That 's true of what is going on now .
If you tried to track down every piece of legislation , every regulation , every administrative agency ruling , and every other pronouncement still in effect that allows the government to surveil and otherwise keep track of you , me , the guy down the street , the woman next door and the man in the moon , based on alleged concern with and the need to protect us all from the ravages of drugs , " illicit " sex , any and all other suspected criminal activity and , natch , terrorism , how on God 's green earth would you do it ?
You could n't .
I further submit to you that the only reason you appear to have some precious remnants of freedom left , and the only reason you remain at liberty , is that the government has n't comprehensively focused on all the powers it already possesses and has n't come anywhere close to utilizing them fully and consistently .
This is the moment you should fall to your knees and thank whatever gods may be for the miraculous , close to perfect incompetence of the pathetically ineffectual blockheads in Washington .
My head began exploding when I read the opening paragraph of this NYT article
It 's impossible to say which is more disturbing : thatwill be in charge of this " cybercommand " monstrosity , or that the U.S. government -- which , as all good Americans know deep in their hearts , wants only peace and sunshine and puppy dogs and kitty cats and ponies !
for all humanity ( if not for any sizable number of actually existingpersons ) -- is yapping about " possibleoperations against adversaries ' computer networks .
" I mean , hell .
All those bullets , bombs , missiles and nookleear thingamajigs are n't enough ?
We gotta attack evil , terroristic ' puter networks -- and do soWhatever .
And then the few remaining bloody bits of my brain simply dissolved into gooey slime when I read these two paragraphs in the middle of the piece :
" Not the best suited , from This is first - class comedy material .
Truly , it is .
I doff my blood and goo-encrusted cap to these Comedy Clowns of Mirth and Merriment .
Let us also note the concluding paragraphs of this masterpiece of black comedy ( you know , when blood dries , it often turns black ; I 'm just saying , no reason to be concerned -- they 're only trying toandus ) :
In other words , you 're on the battlefield this very minute , and your computer might be a deadly weapon .
In these circumstances , it 's remarkably shortsighted and selfish of you to think your computer isand that you 're entitled to some nambypamby notion of " privacy . "
What world areliving in ?
The Pentagon will decide what you 're " entitled " to .
Or not .
With due respect to Ms. Berrigan , it 's a little late in this game for any of us to be expressing " concerns " about whether the government , most decidedly including the administration of the Prince of Hopetastically Hopey Hopeiness , is going to be keeping " its promise to respect privacy . "
I repeat : what world areliving in ?
I analyzed the broader issues involved almost a year ago , in " No One Is Safe : FISA Is Only the Prelude to Nightmare . "
The theme of that article was this :
" The selective focus on FISA misses the crucial larger picture in a way that ensures that the ruling class 's hold on increasingly tyrannical power will never be consistently or seriously challenged -- which is , of course , precisely what the ruling class wants .
... [ I ] f the protests about FISA remain the sole ( or even the major ) focus of [ the ] complaints about the surveillance state , the protesters will make a very large gift to those who wish to oversee , regulate and control every aspect of our lives .
" The heart of my argument will be found in this passage .
I repeat it , because I think a great many people still fail to understand this issue fully : I now add a few further comments on that last point .
Many people frequently praise Obama , or Hillary Clinton , or many other Democrats on the grounds that they 're so much more able and " competent " than Republicans .
Let 's assume that 's true .
Given the staggering and frightening powers that the government already possesses -- powers which , as my earlier discussion emphasizes , already allow the government to do whatever it wants , whenever it wants , to whomever it wants -- the fact that they may be " competent " should terrify you .
If the Obama administration is determined to continue and expand America 's wars and foreign interventions for the purposes of control and domination , competence only makes the ensuing devastation and murder that much
This is especially true for the victims of America 's campaigns of destruction abroad .
If you 're minding your own business in the Middle East or Central Asia , or Latin America , or Africa , and someone decides you 're in the way of America 's imperial plans , the last thing you want is to be hunted down by akiller .
Your obliteration is almost certain .
In the same way , if the Obama administration is determined to consolidate and expand the scope and reach of the surveillance state , the fact that those who may wish to keep watch over a huge range of online activities , all in the name of " cybersecurity , " of course , should not be a source of comfort for you .
It should fill you with dread .
And always remember : just as the government will never hesitate to manufacture an alleged justification for its overseas campaigns of terror , so too the government will find some reason , even if it has to concoct it out of less than nothing , if it decides to go afterConfronted with a government of already massive , ungraspably broad and invasive powers , powers which only increase by the day , you should pray as fervently as you can that those who would track your every keystroke , every email , and every moment of internet activity are the most colossally incompetent , ignorant fools the world has ever seen .
And when they are , when they are competent or , far worse , even expert at what they are doing , that 's precisely when you should run for your life .
Of course , you can go to be left alone might be a problem of some significance , assuming you can even manage it .
But I think you take my point .
Aw , they 're only trying tous .
Of course .
As I remark from time to time , it is a grievous error to think that those who possess enormous power of this kind seek power for some other end , whether you imagine that end is " national security " or " peace " or whatever other propaganda slogan they may throw at you .
No : powerthe end .
It is the purpose , and the only purpose : powerThat 's the whole pathetic , detestable truth .
I respectfully suggest that you never , ever forget it .
LexisNexis acknowledged Friday that criminals used its information retrieval service for more than three years to gather data that was used to commit credit card fraud .
LexisNexis has started warning about 32,000 people that " a few " customers used its service to help them illegally obtain credit cards .
" These individuals were operating businesses that at one time were both ChoicePoint and LexisNexis customers , " the company said in a notification letter that it began sending out Friday .
To perpetrate the scam , the fraudsters would set up fake mail boxes and then use information obtained on LexisNexis to open credit cards in the victims ' names .
The criminals were able to obtain names , dates of birth , and even Social Security numbers from the data broker .
In 2006 , ChoicePoint paid US $ 15 million to settle a lawsuit with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission after scammers allegedly used ChoicePoint 's data services for ID fraud .
LexisNexis 's parent company , Reed Elsevier , purchased ChoicePoint last year for $ 4.1 billion .
LexisNexis apparently waited a long time to notify victims at the request of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service .
The fraud was stopped on Oct. 10 , 2007 , LexisNexis said , but the breach notification letters were not sent out until now .
A LexisNexis spokesman could not say definitively when the company became aware of the breach .
If LexisNexis withheld disclosure for a year - and - a - half it was " far too long , " according to Beth Givens , director or Privacy Rights Clearinghouse .
" A lot of damage can be done in 18 months , " she said .
The U.S. Postal Inspection Service did not return calls and e-mail messages seeking comment Friday .
LexisNexis has tightened up the way it verifies customers since the incident , the company said in the notification letter .
LexisNexis was involved in other data breaches in 2005 and 2006 , according to data from Privacy Rights Clearinghouse , a privacy watchdog group .
According to CBS News , which first reported the breach , another company , Investigative Professionals , was also hit by the scammers , who were ultimately able to obtain information on 40,000 victims , including those targeted using the LexisNexis data .
Investigative Professionals could not be reached for comment .
Dear Cecil :
A recent article in the New York Times mentioned a bit of civil disobedience that caught my attention : " … in the 1670's … the prime minister was killed , and partially eaten , by a mob of angry Dutch … "
Would you mind giving out the background behind this incident ?
And perhaps the contact information for any of the mob 's descendants who might consider consuming a few unruly U.S. politicians ?
Michael Roberts , via e-mail
Cecil replies :
I ’d better give a little context for this bizarre story , not that it ’s going to help .
The article you refer to , which appeared in the Times on August 21 , 2005 , discusses the views of Yale economist Robert Shiller , who believes that “ housing prices may drop sharply , as they did 300 years ago on the Herengracht [ canal ] in Amsterdam . ”
The article cites the work of Piet Eichholtz , a Dutch economist and evidently an admirer of Shiller ’s , who charted housing prices on the prestigious waterway over a 400 - year span .
The passage about the unfortunate prime minister reads in its entirety as follows :
On the Herengracht , [ economic ] returns have often been fantastic for 25 or even 50 years at a time .
Home prices soared in the first half of the 17th century , around the time of the tulip mania .
But they came crashing down in the 1670 ’s , when the prime minister was killed , and partially eaten , by a mob of angry Dutch , and the country nearly disintegrated .
Prices lagged inflation during the Napoleonic wars but surged after William became king in 1814 and the country industrialized .
No further details are provided .
The reader seeking guidance about the housing market can only conclude :
If people are eating government officials in your neighborhood , it ’s time to sell .
So much for the Times .
Now for the straight dope :
(1) The digested party was Johan de Witt ( 1625 - 1672 ; his first name is sometimes given as Jan or John ) , head of the Dutch government from 1653 till shortly before his demise .
His title was raadpensionaris ( commonly rendered as “ grand pensionary ” or “ councillor pensionary ” ) , but he was the equivalent of prime minister .
Unknown today in the English - speaking world and apparently little remembered even in the Netherlands , he was one of the great statesmen of his time , building his tiny confederacy ( the United Provinces , as they were known , had a combined population of less than 2 million ) into a global economic power through skillful diplomacy and efficient administration .
His reward was a gruesome death at the hands of his ingrate countrymen .
(2) De Witt ’s chief problem prior to being eaten was that he was a staunch republican in an era when most people preferred to be ruled by a prince .
The princes of the Netherlands , who had traditionally served as stadtholders , or governors , hailed from the house of Orange and were mostly named William .
De Witt had no use for princes or stadtholders and contrived to keep the Williams out of the picture during most of the time he was in charge .
Meanwhile he did his best to fend off his two much larger neighbors , England and France .
So , a real champion of the underdog , right ?
Not that simple .
During the 17th century the stadtholders were elected by the Dutch provinces and enjoyed popular support , whereas de Witt represented the wealthy merchant class .
But cut the man some slack .
He was the smartest person around , and the Dutch were materially better off for his running the show .
(3) It all fell apart in 1672 .
France invaded , the frightened populace turned to William III of Orange , and suddenly de Witt was the bad guy .
His brother Cornelis was arrested on a trumped - up charge of plotting to assassinate the prince .
Johan went to see about getting him out of jail , which was surrounded by a mob .
Possibly incited by supporters of William III , the crowd burst in , dragged out Johan and Cornelis , and beat , stabbed , and shot them to death .
The bodies were hung upside down from a nearby gallows ladder and mutilated , with fingers , ears , genitals , guts , and so on sliced off .
Bits of the corpses were sold as souvenirs , and allegedly a few were cooked and eaten .
Question # 1 : Seriously , cannibalism ?
Answer :
The sources cited in the principal English - language bio , Herbert Rowen ’s 1978 John de Witt , are obscure , but Rowen himself does n’t seem to doubt that the crowd snacked on burghers .
Question # 2 : So what was up with these people ?
Answer : Rowen does n’t say , though he distinguishes between the killers , who were solid citizens , and the mutilators , who were were “ scaffold scum , ” as a contemporary pamphlet puts it .
The atrocity had no noticeable impact on William III ’s career ( he later became king of England ) .
Though notorious for centuries — the murders are the centerpiece of Dumas pere ’s 1850 novel The Black Tulip —
Rowen thinks the incident now has been largely forgotten , apparently for some merely marking an occasion when Amsterdam property values temporarily went to hell .

Catbert : Evil director of human resources Catbert says , " You should n't come to work just for money . "
Catbert says , " You should come to work to avoid not having any money . "
Wally says , " I 'm only in it for these meetings . "
Catbert says , " Settle down , baldy . "
Therefore , needless to say , it has been pretty much ignored by the serious people inside the beltway .
Here is the independent analysis sponsored by The Commonwealth Fund ( which actually supports the Obama / Baucus / Kennedy " Building Blocks approach ) and with The Lewin Groups ( supposedly still the reliable valid gold standard for doing such analyses even though owned by an insurance company ) .
You can see Stark plan is the only one to control and even reduce total costs .
Building Blocks , which is the name given at the time for the mandates + weaker public option proposals of Hacker / Obama / Baucus / Kennedy etc .
You will read in the media all the time about how costs are the big problem of the current mainstream proposals .
Well , if they were serious about costs , why are they not talking about the Stark plan ?
And here is the projection for the number of the uninsured who would become newly covered :
Out of the then estimated total number of 48.9 million , only the Stark Plan ( like the Conyers HR - 676 plan ) would automatically assure that everybody is covered .
Commonwealth / Lewin finds that the Wyden and Building Blocks ( including Obama and Baucus to lesser extents ) come relatively close but do n't actually achieve universal coverage .
Again , you can see and read the full comparative analysis at The Commonwealth Fund site .
And here is Peter Stark 's own explanation of his fine compromise proposal :
Madam Speaker , it gives me great pleasure to reintroduce the AmeriCare Health Care Act of 2009 .
I have often spoken before this body about the great need to reform our health care system .
For too long , we have been plagued with an inadequate patchwork system that today leaves nearly 46 million Americans uninsured .
We spend more per person than any other country in the world , yet our health outcomes lag well behind that of other industrialized nations .
The failing economy is even more proof of our need to act now .
Our broken health system is a tremendous financial burden on our Nation 's families and businesses alike .
Since 1999 , family premiums for employer - sponsored insurance have increased 119 percent , nearly 4 times the increase in wages ( 34 percent ) and inflation ( 29 percent ) during that same time .
About one in three Americans reported a serious problem " paying for health care and health insurance " in October 2008 .
Half of all bankruptcies can be traced to medical bills .
49 percent of people in foreclosure named medical problems as a cause of their financial difficulties .
According to the New America Foundation , our economy lost as much as $ 207 billion last year because of the poor health and shorter lifespans of those without health insurance .
General Motors spends more on health care than on steel .
While I ’m not suggesting we import the Canadian health system , it is worth highlighting that if we paid the same amount for health care as Canada , G.M. would have accumulated an additional $ 22 billion in profits over the last decade .
Inadequate health coverage is crippling our economy .
The President - elect declared that health care reform should happen " this year " .
Chairman Rangel and I are ready to work with him , Chairmen Waxman and Miller , our leadership and the Senate to achieve this goal .
AmeriCare is a template of a way that we can achieve universal health care .
AmeriCare is built on a framework that is consistent with many of the principles that President - elect Obama identified during the campaign .
Like President - elect Obama ’s plan , it includes a public plan option .
It uses Medicare 's existing administrative infrastructure , but improves upon Medicare 's benefits to address some of the current gaps in coverage .
A public plan option is the only way to ensure that beneficiaries have access to an option that promotes people over profit .
As Medicare itself includes both public and private plan options , one could make the case that AmeriCare has an exchange , like Obama ’s plan as well .
Like President - elect Obama ’s plan , it maintains employer sponsored coverage .
People can keep the coverage they have if they like it .
We need to build on what works , not create an entirely new system .
Like President - elect Obama ’s plan , it includes a pay - or - play component to ensure that the private sector continues to play a role in providing health care .
AmeriCare meets the Health Care for America Now ! reform principles .
It was endorsed last year by the coalition , as well as provider groups , beneficiary advocates , and unions including : American Academy of Pediatrics , American Nurses Association , Center for Medicare Advocacy , Consumers Union , Families USA , National Association of Community Health Centers , National Association of Public Hospitals , SEIU , Universal Health Care Action Network .
AmeriCare is a practical proposal to ensure that everyone has affordable health coverage in our country .
It builds on what works in today 's health care system to provide simple , affordable , reliable health insurance .
I look forward to working with President - elect Obama as he assumes the office of the President to achieve a universal health care program that meets the principles that he will outline to Congress .
I will submit for the record a short summary of AmeriCare .
More can be found on my website at http://www.house.gov/...
AMERICARE HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2009 Overview : The AmeriCare Health Care Act ( " AmeriCare ' ' ) is a practical proposal to ensure that everyone has health coverage in our country .
It builds on what works in today 's health care system to provide simple , affordable , reliable health insurance .
People would be covered under the new AmeriCare system , modeled on Medicare , or they would continue to obtain health coverage through their employer .
Using the administrative efficiencies within Medicare and building on the existing coverage people receive through their jobs today , we can create an affordable , efficient , and stable universal health care system in America -- and guarantee access to medical innovation and the world 's most advanced providers and facilities .
Structure and Administration : Creates a new title in the Social Security Act , ``AmeriCare . ''
Provides universal health care for all U.S. residents , with additional coverage for children ( under 24 ) , pregnant women , and individuals with limited incomes ( < 300 % FPL ) .
Sets out standards for supplemental plans with a focus on consumer protection .
Requires the Secretary to negotiate discounts for prescription drugs .</ p>
Benefits : Adults receive Medicare Part A and B benefits ; preventive services , substance abuse treatment , mental health parity ; and prescription drug coverage equivalent to the BC / BS Standard Option in 2008 .
Children receive comprehensive benefits and Early and Periodic Screening , Diagnostic , and Treatment ( EPSDT ) coverage with no cost - sharing .
Cost Sharing :
There is a $ 350 deductible for individuals / $ 500 for families ( indexed over time ) , and 20 % coinsurance .
Total spending ( premiums , deductibles , and co-insurance ) is capped at out - of - pocket maximum of $ 2,500 individual / $ 4,000 family ( indexed over time ) , or 5 percent of income for beneficiaries with income between 200 percent - 300 percent FPL and 7.5 percent of income for beneficiaries with income between 300 percent - 500 percent FPL .
There is no cost sharing for children , pregnant women and low - income individuals ( below 200 percent FPL ) .
Sliding scale subsidies are in place for cost - sharing for individuals between 200 percent and 300 percent FPL .
Financing :
At April 15 tax filing each year , individuals either demonstrate equivalent coverage through their employer or pay the AmeriCare premium based on cost of coverage and class of enrollment ( individual , couple , unmarried individual with children , or married couple with children ) .
Employers may either pay 80 percent of the AmeriCare premium or provide equivalent benefits through a group health plan ( the contribution for part - time workers is pro-rated ) .
AmeriCare does not affect contracts or collective bargaining agreements in effect as of the date of enactment , and employers may choose to provide additional benefits .
Employers with fewer than 100 employees have until January 1 , 2014 to comply ( employees of small businesses would still only pay 20 percent of the premium ) .
The use of company - issued mobile phones could trigger new federal income taxes on millions of Americans as a " fringe benefit . "
The Internal Revenue Service proposed employers assign 25 % of an employee 's annual phone expenses as a taxable benefit .
Under that scenario , a worker in the 28 % tax bracket , whose wireless device costs the company $ 1,500 a year , could see $ 105 in additional federal income tax .

So says the Ford Motor Company , which on 19 May revealed test results on a novel ethanol - assisted engine .

New Super Mario Bros.
wo n't feature online cooperative play , Shigeru Miyamoto told a room full of writers during his developer 's round table yesterday .
Advertisement
New Super Mario Bros. allows up to four players to run through side - scrolling worlds reminiscent of the classic Super Mario Bros. games with up to four people .
Players take on the role of Mario , Luigi and two Toads .

The game wo n't support online play because the title uses up all of the Wii 's processing power , Miyamoto said .
He added that hitting the processing limits of a console is something that developers strive to do , and that processing limitations is an issue that developers have been dealing with since the 8 - bit age .
Obama is a socialist / fascist ; Sonia Sotomayor is a racist , and La Raza is the KKK ; there ’s an evil plot against Republican car dealers .
The GOP is sounding a bit , well , demented these days .
But here ’s the thing : it always did .
A few trips down memory lane :
Senator Tom Coburn :
In a tape recently released by Brad Carson , Coburn ’s Democratic opponent for the Senate race there , Coburn is heard warning the good clean citizens of Oklahoma of the great lesbian threat to their state .
On the tape , Coburn tells how a campaign worker form Coalgate , Okla . , told him that lesbianism is “ so rampant in some of the schools in southeast Oklahoma that they ’ll only let one girl go to the bathroom . ”
Senator James Inhofe :
Why did the UN cook up the idea of global warming ?
To “ shut down the machine called America . ”
In fact , we learned , global warming is a plot to destroy the US economy and to initiate one - world government–a goal not only of the UN but of the American political left more broadly .
Establishing his Christian credentials , Inhofe invoked Romans 1:25 ( For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie , and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator , who is blessed forever ) to suggest that taking steps to ameliorate global warming would constitute a form of idol worship .
We ’re not talking fringe activists here ; we ’re talking U.S. senators .
The truth is that lunatics have been running this particular asylum for years .
But in a classic case of emperor ’s new clothes , it was n’t acceptable to notice this until the lunatics lost power .

In the recently released Sphinx version 0.9.9 - rc2 there is a support for MySQL wire protocol and SphinxQL – SQL - like language to query Sphinx indexes .
This support is currently in its early preview stage but it is still fun to play with .
A thing to mention – unlike MySQL Storage Engines , some of which as InfoBright or Kick Fire take over execution after parsing , Sphinx MySQL support has nothing to do with MySQL – it is implementation of the wire protocol from scratch .
For this test I was not interesting in the full text search performance , we already know Sphinx is much faster than MySQL build in full text search .
I was rather interested to look performance of other queries , not using Full Text Search .

For the tests I used the table from the forum search engine , leaving just bunch of ids in it , removing everything else :
CREATE TABLE `sptest` ( `id` bigint ( 20 ) unsigned NOT NULL , `site_id` int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL , `forum_id` int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL , `author_id` int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL , `num_links` smallint ( 5 ) unsigned NOT NULL ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 CREATE TABLE ` sptest ` ( ` id ` bigint ( 20 ) unsigned NOT NULL , ` site_id ` int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL , ` forum_id ` int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL , ` author_id ` int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL , ` num_links ` smallint ( 5 ) unsigned NOT NULL ) ENGINE = MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET = utf8
This table contained some 25 millions of rows and no indexes there defined – Sphinx does not support explicit indexes and it is clear when you can use index for sort MySQL will be a lot faster .
First – Sorting .
Sphinx is smart doing sorting because it does not try to sort everything but if you ask but rather only number of rows it needs to reach the LIMIT

As you can see Sphinx adds couple of extra columns to result set even if you have not asked it .
Another thing to try is GROUP BY – Sphinx executes GROUP BY in fixed memory which means results may be approximate – this is geared towards full text search applications when exact number is not important .

Another optimization I wanted to check is the “ early block reject ” which should allow to quickly throw away large blocks of attributes if they do not contain any data :
Sphinx
select max( author_id ) as a , forum_id as f from sptest where num_links =1 ; Empty set ( 2.70 sec ) 1 2 select max ( author_id ) as a , forum_id as f from sptest where num_links =
1 ; Empty set ( 2.70 sec )
MySQL
mysql > select max( author_id ) as a , forum_id as f from sptest where num_links =1 ; +------+---+ | a | f | +------+---+
| NULL | NULL | +------+---+ 1 row in set ( 4.29 sec ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 mysql > select max ( author_id ) as a , forum_id as f from sptest where num_links = 1 ; + -- -- -- + -- - + | a | f | + -- -- -- + -- - + | NULL | NULL | + -- -- -- + -- - + 1 row in set ( 4.29 sec )
I would expect much larger lead in this case because of this optimization but it seems to be broken in the tested version .
Also note the result set difference – Sphinx finds no rows and creates no groups while MySQL reports NULL group as a result .
SphinxQL at this point is rather picky – it wants AS for all the expressions , it also could not parse some queries for no reason though I expect these things to be polished in the near future .
The good thing is the query execution maps to the same execution engine which is quite stable which means it will likely stabilize soon .
Sphinx also offers number of extensions to the SQL which are helpful for search use cases – WITHIN GROUP ORDER BY allows to select which item to pick within given group ( like if you want to show most recent document , or most relevant ) and others .
You might find using Native API more feature full at this point but command line language is very helpful for testing and debugging purposes as well as so Sphinx can be accessed from languages which doe not have native Sphinx API implemented – everyone seems to be able to talk to MySQL these days .
Now on performance – for given class of queries Sphinx was just 1.5 - 2 times faster .
I honestly hoped for more , though I carefully picked queries which are reasonably good for both of them – it is easy to “ break ” MySQL making it to do group by with on disk temporary table which will make Sphinx much faster and few others .
The true gain from Sphinx however comes from its ability to scale almost linearly using multiple CPU cores and multiple nodes in the system .
The raw scan speed was almost 10 millions of rows per second ( this is on rather outdated CPU I used for testing ) – this means you should be able to scan through 100 M + rows on the single modern 8 core server which is quite a number .
TOGoS's Music
I first started making music sometime in 2002 when I realized that I could hook up my dad 's CZ101 to my MIDI in port and record stuff .
The first ( about 20 , many of which were not very good )
Mulkers were made by me clicking notes into Jazz + + and rendering my songs using TiMidity with EAWPATS 10/11/12 .
Starting with a remix of Mulker 21 and Into Moria , I have used Propellerhead 's Reason ( versions 2 and 3 ) softsynth / sequencer , sometimes using Audacity for sampling .
Since 2015
I 've switched over to Ableton Live 9 ( PA Sucks being my ' hello world ' track , composed using the Push ) , which is a great program , but expensive , and I 've found it harder to get into the composition flow that I had with Reason .
Most of my tracks are in a sort of artsy slowed down trancy style influenced primarily by nothing in particular , and secondarily by Underworld , Nine Inch Nails , Way Out West , and assorted video game music .
More recently I 've noticed similarities between my composition style and that of Deadmau5 , but it was developed independently .
There 's also this metadata file that gives some background info about my tracks and SHA - 1 URNs , in case you 're into that kind of thing .
You can download and distribute my music under the by - nc - sa CC license , or otherwise with permission .
You can buy TOGoS shirts from Zazzle : a spensive ( dark ) , cheaper ( light color ) , cheapest ( white )
Various subsets of my songs have been uploaded to YouTube , Archive.org , SoundCloud , and Spotify .

This is not a full listing , but only newer tracks that I 've bothered to properly document .
I plan to eventually add some of my older work .

Don Bohning , a former Miami Herald Latin America editor , is the author of The Castro Obsession : US Covert Operations Against Cuba , 1959 - 1965 .
A single 9:30 p.m. telephone call on April 16 , 1961 , forty - eight years ago this month , could well have assured what was to become a half - century rule of Cuba by Fidel and Raul Castro .
The call from McGeorge Bundy , special assistant to President John F. Kennedy , went to General Charles Cabell , deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency , who at the time was at CIA headquarters for Operation Zapata , more commonly known today as the Bay of Pigs .
The CIA organized and trained Cuban exile Brigade 2506 was to land on a Cuban beach at dawn the next morning , April 17 , 1961 , to begin the assault it was hoped would free Cuba from more than two years of Castro ’s increasingly dictatorial and Communist - oriented rule .
As Cabell was to testify later , Bundy “ notified me that we would not be permitted to launch air strikes the next morning until they could be conducted from a strip within the beachhead .
Any further consultation regarding the matter should be with the Secretary of State . ” ( 1 ) It was a decision that by many accounts - including members of the CIA task force who planned the operation - doomed it to failure .
In the wake of the disastrous April 1961 attempt to overthrow Castro , President Kennedy named Gen. Maxwell Taylor , his military aide , to head a commission of inquiry to determine the cause of the failure .
Cabell recounted the sequence of events beginning with the Bundy phone call in a May 5 , 1961 , memorandum addressed to Taylor as part of the inquiry .
Parts of the Taylor Commission ’s report were released in 1987 and 1981 .
It was n’t until 2000 , however , that the full report – including Cabell ’s memo - were declassified , largely through the efforts of a non -profit -- the National Security Archive -- that the full details became known from the testimony of those involved .
The report received only minimal attention at the time , given the lapse of four decades between the Bay of Pigs and its full declassification .
After hanging up with Bundy , Cabell said he quickly called Secretary of State Dean Rusk and asked if he could come to the State Department immediately to discuss the decision to revoke the D - Day air strikes .
Rusk said yes .
Cabell and Richard Bissell , the CIA ’s head of clandestine operations , rushed to the State Department , arriving about 10:15 p.m. , the night before the dawn assault at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba ’s south coast , was to begin .
Their effort , according to Cabell , was to no avail .
Rusk informed them “ that political requirements at the present time were overriding .
The main consideration involved the situation at the United Nations . ”
There U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson “ insisted … that the air strikes would make it absolutely impossible for the U.S. position to be sustained .
The Secretary stated that such a result was unacceptable . ”
Rusk , said Cabell , asked “ if I would like to speak to the President .
Mr. Bissell and I were impressed with the extremely delicate situation with Ambassador Stevenson and the United Nations and the risk to the entire political position of the United States , and the firm opposition of the Secretary .
We saw no point in my speaking personally to the President and so informed the Secretary . ”
By then there was minimal time to get the order calling off the air strikes to the pilots who were waiting to depart from Puerto Cabezas , Nicaragua .
“ This was barely accomplished as the order to cancel caught some of the crews in their cockpits , ” wrote Cabell .
After returning to Quarters Eye , then the CIA headquarters on the Washington Mall , Cabell wrote that the
next task was to try and compensate for the loss of effective air strikes .
In order to protect the shipping as it withdrew from the beachhead , I arranged with the Navy to stand by pending authority to give fighter cover .
At 4:30 a.m. , April 17 ( D - Day ) , I called on the Secretary of State at his home and reiterated the need to protect the shipping .
The Secretary called the President and put me on the phone .
After I made the request the President asked that the Secretary be put back on .
After conversation with the President , the Secretary informed me that the request for air cover was disapproved .
When Cabell returned to Quarters Eye after the visit with Rusk at the State Department and delivered the message that the President would not re-instate the air strikes , he was greeted with a barrage of outrage .
According to Bissell ’s memoirs , Colonel Jack Hawkins , the Marine officer detached to the project as its paramilitary chief , yelled , “ Goddamn it , this is criminal negligence , ” to which Jake Esterline , the CIA ’s project director for the operation , added : “ This is the goddamndest thing I ever heard of . ”
Bissell , who did not return to Quarters Eye after the meeting with Rusk , acknowledged in his memoirs that it was “ probably out of cowardice , ” that he let Cabell face the music alone at Quarters Eye by “ delivering the bad news . ” ( 2 )
Esterline , in an interview years later , described the evening in painful and lengthy detail , saying what he found “ most unacceptable is that they [ Bissell and Cabell ] were offered the opportunity to speak with the President and they elected not to….
Bissell knew damn well what we were saying [ about the need for air cover ] had to be right . ”
Esterline noted that only a week before he and Hawkins had visited Bissell at his home “ where he solemnly pledged that … he would go to the President and explain why it simply had to be … that we could get the total number of planes we had to have before the task force got too close to Cuba to be recalled .
Of course the rest is painful history …. ” ( 3 )
Without air cover for them on the morning of the Brigade ’s landing , Cuban aircraft sank the Rio Escondido and Houston freighters carrying ammunition and other supplies for the invasion .
The air attack on the two freighters prompted two other supply freighters , the Atlantico and Caribe , to head back out to see .
Esterline , in May 22 , 1961 , testimony to the Taylor Commission , noted that “ beginning with the 16th [ April ] , General Cabell or one of the other senior officers were in constant contact with the White House during the period of the operation .
I ca n’t say specifically at what moment the White House was notified of the criticality of the situation , but I know that they were notified of the criticality by either Mr. Bissell or General Cabell , and I can tell you that there ’s nothing we failed to transmit in terms of criticality because , frankly , I decided the operation was lost at midnight the 16th . ”

Polymorphic Delimited Contiunations by Kenichi Asai and Yukiyoshi Kameyama , in the 5th ASIAN Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems ( 2007 ) .
This paper presents a polymorphic type system for a language with delimited control operators , shift and reset .
Based on the monomorphic type system by Danvy and Filinski , the proposed type system allows pure expressions to be polymorphic .
Thanks to the explicit presence of answer types , our type system satisfies various important properties , including strong type soundness , existence of principal types and an inference algorithm , and strong normalization .
Relationship to CPS translation as well as extensions to impredicative polymorphism are also discussed .
These technical results establish the foundation of polymorphic delimited continuations .
Now , the real reason that I post this is because of Oleg 's ShiftResetGenuine , which implements polymorphic delimited continuations in Haskell , and primarily cites this paper as well as Robert Atkey 's Parameterized Notions of Computation .
So if you find this paper challenging to read , Oleg provides you with a concrete playground in which to experiment .
It 's also notable that Matthieu Sozeau has GenuineShiftReset available , which is a Coq version of Oleg 's code .
( Raw Story ) A woman serving a short sentence in a Houston , Texas , jail for possession of marijuana died in custody over the weekend , and officers are not saying how or why .
The 29 - year - old , identified as Theresa Anthony , had expected to spend just two and a half weeks behind bars in the Harris County lockup .
On Saturday , Cynthia Prude , Theresa ’s mother , received a phone call from the jail ’s Chaplain informing her that her daughter was dead .
Prude has not been allowed to see the body , nor has the Harris County Sheriff ’s Department even spoken with her , according to area media .
On 4 June 2009 , the Justice Department concluded a 15 months - long investigation into the Harris County facility and determined in the subsequent 27 - page report that over 142 prisoners had died there since 2001 .
Most expired due to lack of medical care , the report claims .
The Associated Press noted that after the Justice Department declined to make its findings public , The Houston Chronicle was able to obtain a copy , which it released on the Internet .
Wait a minute , how is this possible ?
According to our last Drug Czar , John Walters , finding a non-violent offender in jail or prison for simple possession is like finding a unicorn .
Theresa
Anthony could be you or me .
Or could have been a young Barack Obama .
Just another dead unicorn , expiring in a cage for the crime of preferring the safest choice of social relaxant or therapeutic medicine .
President Obama , if you can stop giggling for a moment , could you please put “ legalization ” back on the table ?
Director Kerlikowske , could you please find the time to add “ decriminalization ” to your vocabulary ?
You have the power to see to it that Theresa Anthony is the last unicorn to die in a cell .

The Perfect Desktop - Linux Mint 7 ( Gloria )
Version 1.0
Author : Falko Timme
This tutorial shows how you can set up a Linux Mint 7 ( Gloria ) desktop that is a full - fledged replacement for a Windows desktop , i.e. that has all the software that people need to do the things they do on their Windows desktops .
The advantages are clear : you get a secure system without DRM restrictions that works even on old hardware , and the best thing is : all software comes free of charge .
Linux Mint 7 is a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu 9.04 that has lots of packages in its repositories ( like multimedia codecs , Adobe Flash , Adobe Reader , Skype , Google Earth , etc. ) that are relatively hard to install on other distributions ; it therefore provides a user - friendly desktop experience even for Linux newbies .
I want to say first that this is not the only way of setting up such a system .
There are many ways of achieving this goal but this is the way I take .
I do not issue any guarantee that this will work for you !
1 Preliminary Note

2 Installing The Base System
The installation of the base system is easy as 1 - 2 - 3 because the Linux Mint installer does n't offer a lot of options to choose from , so you can not go wrong .
Download the Linux Mint 7 iso image from http://www.linuxmint.com/download.php, burn it onto a CD , and boot your computer from it :
The system boots and starts a desktop that is run entirely in the RAM of your system ( the Linux Mint installation CD is also a Live - CD ) without changing anything on your hard disk .
This has the advantage that you can test how Linux Mint works on your hardware before you finally install it .
This is how the Linux Mint desktop looks .
Double - click the Install icon on the desktop to start the installation to the hard drive :
The installer starts .
First , select your language :
Then choose your time zone :

This is how your new desktop looks :
Now the base system is ready to be used .
The Canadian government has worried for some time about the possibility of having its creative industries squeezed into oblivion by competitive pressure from Hollywood and elsewhere .
To support homegrown content , the government offers money to content creators and uses regulation to mandate that certain amounts of Canadian content end up on TV .
But what happens when broadcasting moves onto the Internet ?
That was the question confronting the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) , which was facing pressure to set up a levy system on ISPs to help fund Canadian Internet audio and video content .
The CRTC today decided not to adopt the levy proposal , though , and also voted not to regulate broadcast content on the Internet ( read the complete report ) .
Internet broadcasting has had a special regulatory exemption since 1999 , but some cultural groups and content creators argued that it was time to apply the same standards that govern TV to Internet broadcasting .
ISPs were totally opposed to the plan , which would in some ways regulate them like traditional broadcasters .
Since late 2008 , the CRTC has been examining the issue , especially the contentious claim that ISPs should start paying their " fair share " to create Canadian content .
" With respect to the source of the funding for the creation of such a fund , certain parties , including creative unions , guilds and producers , argued that ISPs and wireless service providers ( WSPs ) , to the extent that they deliver broadcasting content , are an important part of the broadcasting system in Canada , " says the new CRTC report .
" These parties were of the view that ISPs and WSPs , in their distribution capacity , should be required to contribute to Canadian program creation and exhibition . "
But , in the end , the ISPs won out .
" While broadcasting in new media is growing in importance , we do not believe that regulatory intervention is necessary at this time , " said CRTC Chair Konrad von Finckenstein .
" We found that the Internet and mobile services are acting in a complementary fashion to the traditional broadcasting system .
Any intervention on our part would only get in the way of innovation . "
The move was cheered by Google , for one , which said that the " new media " regulatory exemption was the best approach to " keeping the Internet awesome . "
Canadian law professor Michael Geist concurred , saying , " Overall , the decision to avoid new regulations and levy schemes is a good one . "
" New media " was spared regulation this time , but only through an " exemption " — the CRTC still considers Internet video to be " broadcasting " and could therefore remove the exemption at some future date and treat TV and the Internet exactly the same way .
One CRTC Commissioner , Tim Denton , wrote a concurring opinion in which he called the entire Broadcast
Act an outdated law that needs to be scrapped .
" Commissioners of the CRTC should not be deciding at five - year intervals or less whether massive amounts of personal and corporate communications should be subjected to a comprehensive scheme of prior approval by the state , " he wrote .
" This is the issue which should be put permanently beyond the reach of the CRTC .
It is for this reason especially that steps must be taken to limit the Act to ' broadcasting , ' as it is popularly understood , and to leave the Internet to evolve . "
" With whiskies that are older , we can get a range of dates but we can usually tell which century it came from .
The earliest whisky we have dated came from the 1700s and most have been from 19th century .
In yet another sign of political perfidy , the White House of President George W. Bush has drafted a presidential executive order that would allow that double - dealing Republican chief executive to hold suspected terrorist detainees indefinitely .
According to the president 's intentions , such suspects could be detained for long periods of time , virtually indefinitely .
Is this really what the nation voted for last November ?
Oh , wait .
No .
According to an exclusive Washington Post / Pro Publica report this afternoon , it 's the refreshing new Democratic administration of Barack Obama that 's now preparing this new executive order to hold certain terrorist suspects indefinitely .
This is an obviously inspiring sign of the new style of leadership the Democrat promised and is finally bringing to the White House .
As one blogger put it , George W. Obama .
And it shows the kind of powerful political pragmatism with which the ex-senator from Illinois approaches this job at such a crucial and globally turbulent time .
Strangely , it was leaked to the Post on a slow summer Friday afternoon when it would n't gain much attention .
According to the Post report , the 44th president is now starting to think that closure of the internationally - reviled Guantanamo Bay detention facility , which Obama announced with so much fanfare on his first day in office last winter , may be impossible to actually accomplish before the one - year deadline he set for himself before actually planning where else to put these prisoners .
In other words , fanfare aside , status quo ante .
Democrat or Republican , same deal .
Ex -Vice President Dick Cheney will be so pleased that the Obama - Biden folks finally accepted his advice to protect national security .
Another sign , finally , of real change after eight long years of the very same thing .

Report on US job figures up to 2007 also says wind and solar sectors resisting recession better than traditional manufacturing
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
America 's emerging clean energy economy produced new jobs at more than twice the rate of more traditional industries in the years leading up to the economic downturn , a new study released today claimed .
The report by the Pew Charitable Trusts provides the first hard evidence of jobs created by the rising demand for environmentally friendly services , and in the new clean energy sectors like wind and solar .
It said such jobs grew at a rate of 9.1 % from 1998 - 2007 , easily outstripping job growth in traditional areas of the economy , which was 3.7 % .
The study stopped before the economic downturn , which has caused steep job losses in the traditional economy .
Some 347,000 Americans were put out of work in May alone .
However , its authors also noted that the rapid growth came at a time when there was little or no federal government support for clean energy – unlike today when Barack Obama has committed to greening the economy .
They also said that wind farms , solar projects , and battery factories had fared better than traditional manufacturing as the job market has contracted .
" This is a sector poised for explosive growth , " said Lori Grange , the interim deputy director of Pew .
" Our report points to trends that show a very promising future for the green energy economy . "
The report helps bolster Obama 's claims that his $ 787 billion economic recovery plan could create millions of new jobs .
The package contains about $ 85 billion in green investment , and the administration has repeatedly touted its efforts at creating new clean energy jobs .
The Pew report said the new jobs were created across 38 states , and not restricted to specific regions .
By 2007 , more than 68,200 businesses accounted for about 770,000 green jobs .
That is not hugely below the numbers of jobs in fossil - fuel industries , including oil and gas extraction and coal mining , which employed 1.27 million people in 2007 , the report said .
California created the most green jobs : 125,390 , while Wyoming had the fewest , just 1,419 .
Pay scales among the new jobs ranged from $ 21,000 to $ 111,000 a year , Pew said .
A few months ago I ran into an economist who was formerly head of the Bolivian Central Bank in the La Paz airport .
He had been reading Nouriel Roubini , the New York University economist whom the media has nicknamed " Dr Doom " , and was predicting a very gloomy economic future for the hemisphere , the region and especially his own country .
I did n't agree about Bolivia , which has more international reserves relative to its economy than China .
But it was striking to see the same thing in all the countries that I visited : opposition economists and political leaders everywhere reminded me of communists in the 1930s , praying for the collapse of the capitalist system – in this case , somewhat ironically , so that they could rid themselves of the left governments that the voters had chosen in Bolivia , Venezuela , Brazil , Argentina , Paraguay , Ecuador and elsewhere .
In all of these countries the vast majority of the mass media , to varying degrees , shares the opposition 's agenda and in many cases appears willing to present an overly pessimistic or even catastrophic scenario in order to help advance the cause .
But despite the worsening of the world and regional economy , the left keeps winning in Latin America .
The latest left victory was that of President Rafael Correa of Ecuador , an economist who was first elected at the end of 2006 and was re-elected last Sunday under a new constitution .
This gives the charismatic 46 year - old four more years , and he can be re-elected once more for another term .
There are a number of reasons that most Ecuadorians might stick with their president , despite what they hear on the TV news .
Some 1.3 million of Ecuador 's poor households ( in a country of 14 million ) now get a stipend of $ 30 a month , which is a significant improvement .
Social spending as a share of the economy has increased by more than 50 % in Correa 's two years in office .
Last year the government also invested heavily in public works , with capital spending more than doubling .
Correa has delivered on other promises that were important to his constituents , not least of which was a referendum allowing for a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution , which voters approved by a nearly two - thirds majority .
It is seen as one of the most progressive constitutions in the world , with advances in the rights of indigenous people , civil unions for gay couples and a novel provision of rights for nature .
The latter would apparently allow for lawsuits on the basis of damage to an ecosystem .
Many thought Correa was joking when he said during his presidential campaign that he would be willing to keep the US military base at Manta if Washington would allow Ecuadorian troops to be stationed in Florida .
But he was n't , and the base is scheduled to close later this year .
He also resisted pressure from the US Congress and others in a multi-billion - dollar lawsuit that Ecuadorian courts will decide , in which Chevron is accused of dumping billions of gallons of toxic oil waste that polluted rivers and streams .
And in an unprecedented move last November , Correa stopped payment on $ 4bn of foreign debt when an independent Public Debt Audit Commission , long demanded by civil society organisations in Ecuador , determined that this debt was illegally and illegitimately contracted .
In the United States , these policies have mostly been dismissed as " populism " or worse .
A New York Times editorial in November 2007 entitled " Authoritarians in the Andes " summed up the foreign policy establishment view that Correa , Bolivia 's President Evo Morales and President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela were " increasingly interested in grabbing power for themselves . "
For Correa and Morales , wrote the Times editorial board , " their confrontational approach is also threatening to rend Bolivia and Ecuador 's fragile social and political stability . "
The Times ( and Washington 's foreign policy establishment ) have proven to be wrong , as Ecuador and Bolivia are now more politically stable than they have been for decades .
( Ecuador has had nine presidents over the last 15 years ) .
They are also more democratic than they have ever been .
In fact , most of Latin America is going through a democratic transition that is likely to prove every bit as important as the one that brought an end to the dictatorships that plagued many countries through the first four decades of the post - second world war era .
Ironically , the region 's economic performance was vastly better in the era of the dictatorships , because the governments of that era generally had more effective economic policies than the formally democratic but neoliberal governments that replaced them .
A few years ago there were fears , backed by polling data , that people would become nostalgic for the days of real ( not imagined ) authoritarian governments because of the much greater improvements in living standards during that era .
Instead , they chose to vote for left governments who extended democracy from politics to economic and social policy .
The left governments have mostly succeeded where their neoliberal predecessors failed .
Partly they have benefited from an acceleration in world economic growth during most of the last five years .
But they have also changed their economic policies in ways that increased economic growth .
Argentina 's economy grew more than 60 % in six years and Venezuela 's by 95 % .
These are enormous growth rates even taking into account these countries ' prior recessions , and allowed for large reductions in poverty .
Left governments have also taken greater control over their natural resources ( Ecuador , Bolivia , Venezuela ) and delivered on their promises to share the income from these resources with the poor .
This is the way democracy is supposed to work : people voted for change and got quite a bit of what they voted for , with reasonable expectations of more to come .
We should not be surprised if most Latin American voters stick with the left through hard times .
Who else is going to defend their interests ?
A new poll by The Politico has some good news for Democrats and President Barack Obama and some bad news for Republicans and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in particular :
It finds :
* President Barack Obama has emerged as the most trusted figure in American politics .
* Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has emerged as the political figure perceived as the most untrustworthy .
* More people trust the Democrats to come up with solutions than the Republicans .
This poll is significant because it ’ll be hard for GOPers to discount it as coming from a leftist or Democratic publication or from a polling company suspected of skewering the poll in favor of Democrats .
It also fits in with other polls that continue to show Obama with a high poll rating which is partially due to him having pieced together a coalition of Democrats , independents and Republicans who are n’t into the talk show political culture ( in other words : Republicans who wo n’t be attending tomorrow ’s tea parties .. ) .
Here are some details from the poll :
Three months into his presidency , Barack Obama stands out as perhaps the most trusted figure in American politics .
In a new Public Strategies Inc. / POLITICO national survey of 1,000 registered voters , Obama outdistances figures on both the left and the right in earning the public ’s trust , with two - thirds of respondents saying they trust the president “ to identify the right solutions to the problems we face as a nation . ”
Of those who said they trust the president , 31 percent said they trust him “ a great deal . ”
An additional 35 percent said they have “ some ” trust that Obama will find the correct solution .
Thirty - one percent said they trust Obama either “ not very much ” or “ not at all . ”
Voters were asked the same question of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) , Republican Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska , former Massachusetts Republican Gov. Mitt Romney , conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh and the two major political parties .
Among those choices , only the Democratic Party was trusted to find the right solutions by a majority of voters , 52 percent to 40 percent .
Forty percent of those surveyed said they trusted the Republican Party , compared with 54 percent who did not trust the GOP .
The bad news for the Republicans is that they are not trusted by a large number of Americans that means a large number of Americans are tuning out their message .
And looking at Pelosi and Palin ?
The Politico found this :
Only 26 percent said they trust Pelosi , the lowest total in the group .
Palin attracted the highest percentage of those who did not trust her at all to identify the right solutions , topping Pelosi 33 percent to 32 percent .
Romney got a mixed reaction , with 38 percent of voters saying they trust him and 39 percent saying they do n’t .
So far there are no indications Pelosi is eying the White House .
And there are indications Palin is .
So Palin has a lot of work to do since imagery counts in politics and just winning over part of the GOP wo n’t suffice .
This image obtained from the Virginia Secretary of Technology website , shows Aneesh Chopra .
US President Barack Obama on Saturday named Chopra , a Harvard - educated Indian - American , to the newly created post of Chief Technology Officer in an appointment much - awaited by Silicon Valley .
US President Barack Obama on Saturday named a Harvard - educated Indian - American to the newly created post of Chief Technology Officer in an appointment much - awaited by Silicon Valley .
As the country 's first Chief Technology Officer , Aneesh Chopra , 36 , will use technology to " improve security , ensure transparency , and lower costs , " Obama said in his weekly address to the nation .
" In this role , Aneesh will promote technological innovation to help achieve our most urgent priorities -- from creating jobs and reducing health care costs to keeping our nation secure , " the president added .
Chopra , whose background is in health policy , has served as secretary of technology for the state of Virginia and as an executive in a company which advises hospitals .
Obama said Chopra would work closely with Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra , who is responsible for setting technology policy and federal technology spending , which amounts to more than 70 billion dollars a year .
The appointment of the relatively unknown Chopra came as somewhat of a surprise in technology circles , where speculation over the past three months had focused on more high - profile candidates .
Chopra 's name was not even listed among the choices in an online poll of readers by the technology blog TechCrunch which asked who should be appointed to the job .
Microsoft's Bill Gates , Google 's Eric Schmidt and Amazon 's Jeff Bezos were among the top vote - getters in the poll .
Obama pledged during his presidential campaign to create the position of Chief Technology Officer , and there had been some speculation it would be a cabinet - level position but that turned out not to be the case .
Obama ran the most technology - savvy political campaign in US history , leveraging social networks , email , text messages and other media to build a vast fundraising and political operation .
But hopes that the president can unleash a technology revolution and create a new e-White House in government have come up against antiquated government technology and privacy and security restrictions .
As Virginia 's secretary of technology , Chopra was responsible for applying technology to government reform , innovation and economic development and served as an advisor to Governor Tim Kaine .
Before taking the state government position , Chopra was managing director of the Advisory Board Company , a publicly - traded health care think tank serving nearly 2,500 hospitals and health systems .
Chopra earned his undergraduate degree from John Hopkins University and a masters in public policy from Harvard University .

Chinese censors blocked access to Twitter and other popular online services today , two days before the 20th anniversary of the crackdown on democracy protests in Tiananmen Square .
The move came amid increasing pressure on dissidents , in a reflection of the authorities ' anxiety ahead of the sensitive date .
Hundreds died as the army forced its way through Beijing to clear away demonstrators from the capital 's political heart in June 1989 , but the issue is taboo on the mainland .
The photo - sharing site Flickr , email service Hotmail and other services were also unavailable this evening .
" Twitter is a tool which can put all the sensitive things and sensitive guys together , very quickly .
That 's the very thing that the Chinese government does n't want to see in China , " said one blogger , Michael Anti , who had predicted Twitter would not be allowed for long .
" They needed time to figure out what it is and whether it needed to be controlled . "
He added : " I do n't know whether they will reopen Twitter after 4 June .
I hope they will , for Twitter is a crucial icon for the new internet era on which many innovations emerge .
China can't block their young generation from the future . "
While most Chinese internet users rely on domestic services , which are heavily monitored and controlled , Twitter had become hugely popular among an urban elite .
They used the site to share information on sensitive issues in recent months , such as the fire at the Chinese state television complex .
But while people could not access the site this evening , some users were still able to tweet , sending their complaints about the ban .
" We netizens were beaten by a ' combination blow ' .
So many famous websites are not accessible now ...
This time , it is huge , " wrote user williamlong .
Reuters reported that the email service Hotmail was also blocked across the mainland , while some internet users said they were unable to access Microsoft 's Windows Live .
Blogger.com was blocked last month and YouTube has been inaccessible from the mainland since March .
Internet monitors have also shut down message boards on more than 6,000 websites affiliated with colleges and universities , according to the Hong Kong - based Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy .
In a statement distributed by the same organisation , the exiled former student leader Chai Ling appealed for the release of political prisoners , an independent investigation into the events and permission for former student leaders to return home .
" The current generation of leaders who bear no responsibility should have the courage to overturn the verdicts [ on the protests ] , " said Chai , who now lives in the US and has not commented on the issue for several years .
" The party and the government long ago reached a conclusion about the political incident that took place at the end of the 1980s and related issues , " spokesman Qin Gang said when asked about the issue at the Foreign Ministry 's regular news conference .
The Chinese authorities deemed the protests counterrevolutionary riots .
In Taizhou , Zhejiang , officials have detained a former prisoner who last week co-signed an open letter to the government complaining about economic discrimination against dissidents , according to US - based group Human Rights in China .
Wu Gaoxing and four other men who were jailed for supporting the 1989 pro-democracy protests said former prisoners were struggling to survive because they could not find steady jobs and are deprived of medical benefits and pensions .
Calls to Taizhou 's state security bureau rang unanswered .
Another signatory , Mao Guoliang , told the Associated Press : " I expect he 's being held under some form of house arrest , but I do n't know where . "

FBI agents have arrested a man suspected of posting online messages threatening the life of a California transit cop who was involved in a controversial shooting earlier this year .
Jeffrey Weaver , 47 , of Roanoke , Virginia , is suspected of posting anonymous comments to the popular InfoWars.com site run by radio show host and free - speech advocate Alex Jones .
Those comments , which were quickly deleted by moderators , threatened to kill Johannes Mehserle , a former police officer for Bay Area Rapid Transit ( BART ) , who was caught on video last January shooting a 22 - year - old man in the back at point - blank range while the youth was lying on the ground .
That shooting – which occurred on the platform of an Oakland , California BART station in front of numerous train passengers – received widespread publicity and prompted violent protests and calls for Mehserle 's arrest on murder charges .
Mehserle was arrested in Nevada on January 14th , where he said he went after receiving death threats .
According to an FBI affidavit ( .pdf ) , Weaver allegedly posted on January 5 and January 7 under the name " FuckThePigs . "
" Fuck the pigs and if I find out who the pig is then I will kill the pig who killed him , " one of the messages read .
After another reader posted Mehserle 's home address at InfoWars , the original poster added a second message noting Meherle 's address and saying " now that I know who he is and where he is its only a matter of time and his punishment will be to watch his bitch and his baby get wasted in front of him . . . this is n't a threat its a fucking promise . . . because justice will be served death wish charles bronson vigilante style .
. . . "
On January 10 , the same user posted a third message to InfoWars implying that he might kill another police officer in Martinsville , Virginia , who had killed a 17 - year - old boy with a Taser .
In that message , the user claimed he owned a gun .
All I got to say is that I 'm within 100 miles of where this incident happened at and reading this makes my blood boil .
Maybe I should drive to Martinsville with my 9 mm Glock and some teflon coated armor piercing Black Rhino hollow pointed rounds and do the world a favor by ridding the world of this piece of shit pig . . .
Mehserle 's father contacted the FBI on January 8 saying he'd found the threats against his son online .
FBI agents subpoenaed Jones , who runs InfoWars , to obtain IP addresses from which the messages were posted .
They matched three addresses to a Verizon account owned by Weaver .
Three years earlier Weaver , who was convicted in 1986 for selling or furnishing marijuana , had also threatened to massacre employees of Cox Communications after the company cut off his cable TV , according to the FBI .
When a Cox representative came to the house Weaver shared with his mother , Weaver said he was so mad he planned to go to the Cox office with his 9 mm and kill everyone .
The only reason he did n't , the affidavit says , was because his mother stopped him .
FBI agents raided Weaver 's house two weeks ago , and found a " green leafy substance " ( . pdf ) and " a glass smoking device , " but no gun .
According to a complaint filed by agents , Weaver admitted to them during the raid that he posted the comments to InfoWars but said he was angry when he made the statements and did not intend to harm anyone .
He was arrested and is being held without bond for threatening harm to someone through interstate communication .
Jones told Threat Level that he had instructed one of his moderators to remove the threatening messages posted at InfoWars , because of their incendiary nature , a week before the FBI contacted him .
" I do n't defend the terrible things the individual posted on my site , " Jones said .
" I can see where these types of incendiary things get hyped up because of the outrageous conduct of the police .
But , regardless , there 's no excuse to go after peoples ' families with death threats .
This is n't a joke when you go on a big website and post threats .
Then they bitch and complain when the police come to their door .
The ones who really make the bad threats are the idiots who do it from their real computer . "
Jones is angry that authorities focused on his site when threats against the San Francisco cop were posted at YouTube and elsewhere .
He said it was the fourth subpoena he 's received and he 's considering eliminating the comments section from his site as a result .
" That 's not me happily handing over peoples ' IP addresses , " Jones said .
" This is not an enjoyable thing . "

So , after the first post I did last week , I sat back with a little swelled pride and watched in earnest as the comments rolled in .
Some of them were , well , rather scathing .
No , I ’m not harboring any ill will , but I would like to address a few .
First off , I received a ton of feedback on the fact that the canned bread I chose is actually quite delicious and reminiscent of a sweet bread with a moist texture and that it ’s great toasted .
Well , that ’s so very cool and it has given me reason to rush right out and buy a loaf … er , can as soon as I can .
Another series of comments talked about the condoning / condemning of my leaving off of the oft - used Spotted Dick .
Well , sorry to those expecting it on this list , cuz it ai n’t here either .
I ’m just as sick of that , despite it ’s humor , as many of you .
Now finally , the biggest issue I came across with my images was the simple fact that I forgot to give credit from where they came .
Well , of that omission I will heal the wounds , as you will soon see .
Okay , so with that easing of the minds , here we go with another twelve WTF canned foods …
Jellied Eels
I know , its not technically ‘ canned ’ , but I will certainly stipulate when it comes to something so atrocious as jellied eels .
Just thinking of this being on a plate in front of me surrounded by guys with guns to my head , makes me want to start making my final plans .

Canned Moose / Elk
What was funny was where I found this was n’t sure either .
I suppose out there in God ’s Country , it really makes little difference which hoofed mammal your wife packed for dinner .

Durian
This sums up just how foul this evidently quite popular fruit is : Andrew Zimmern , host of the Travel Channel ’s Bizarre Foods , will eat ANYTHING .
Yet , the durian literally makes him sick .
It smells like befouled rotted onions .
Yeah , I can forgive him for that .

Canned Lamb
I ’m stunned at this less - than - informative label and thus not entirely sure if I should be eating this , or the dog .
So , I ’m sticking with neither , especially since I do n’t own a dog .

Beef Tripe ( Menudo )
Yes , yes , before I get vicious hate mail , I fully understand that this is a Hispanic delicacy and really quite tasty and it ’s even one of the few I ’ve eaten , when homemade in a real Mexican kitchen .
What got me was the label : “ With Milk ” .
That ’s just so wrong .

I love fish of all sizes and shapes .
Pickled and canned fish ?

Canned Bacon
Again , another in the ‘ nothing inherently wrong with this ’ category , but let ’s be a little realistic here : is it that hard to find decent , real bacon at your local store ?
No , no it is n’t .

Canned Haggis
Though I know full well what this horror show is , just in case you do n’t , here ’s the recipe :
There are many recipes , most of which have in common the following ingredients : sheep ’s ‘ pluck ’ ( heart , liver and lungs ) , minced with onion , oatmeal , suet , spices , and salt , mixed with stock , and traditionally boiled in the animal ’s stomach for approximately three hours .
And then let ’s can this mess !

Bird ’s Nest Drink in a Can
Many countries , especially those responsible for the dangerous cave - harvesting of these avian - saliva concoctions , swear by the nest ’s nutritional and medicinal value .

Berlusconi a " Porta a Porta "
UK government 's £ 25 m scheme to slash emissions from transport will allow public to take part in long - term trials of a range of electric cars
The UK government will today unveil the world 's largest ever coordinated trial of environmentally friendly vehicles .
The £ 25 m scheme , which is designed to accelerate the introduction of electric cars to the UK will allow people to take part in long - term trials of everything from electric Minis and Smart city cars to sports cars and electric vans .
From the end of this year , around 340 of the vehicles will be available to qualifying members of the public in eight different locations around the country including Oxford , London , Glasgow , Birmingham and the north - east .
Power companies , regional development agencies and universities will also be involved in coordinating the experiments , building infrastructure such as charging points and analysing the way the cars are used .
" Here 's an opportunity to position the UK as a world leader in the adoption of this technology by supporting the largest ever trial of such vehicles , " said Paul Drayson , the science minister .
" That encourages companies working in this field to do their research and development here .
That knowledge generated by the trial then gets fed back to the follow - on systems that come through . "
Around 22 % of the UK 's carbon emissions come from transport , with 13 % of these from private cars .
According to a study for the Department for Transport ( DfT ) , widespread adoption of electric vehicles capable of a range of 50 km or more could cut road transport carbon emissions in half .
" We have about 33 m cars on the road at the moment and it's going to go up by another 4 - 5 m in the next 10 years , " said David Bott of the Technology Strategy Board ( TSB ) , the government - backed agency that promotes the development of new technologies and is coordinating the national demonstration project .
" There 's a lot of people buying new cars anyway so the question is how quickly can we get credible alternatives out there ? "
Moving the UK 's drivers onto cleaner forms of road transport would not be addressed by a single piece of technology , said Bott , and so the demonstration project had been designed to try out different cars in different places .
" We get to find out what we can't do and we get a whole bunch of new problems that are real .
We get confidence that we 're on the right path or the knowledge that we need to change . "
One branch of the trial will involve around 40 of BMW 's Mini E available to those living in Oxford and south - east England .
The 12 - month project will evaluate the technical and social aspects of living with an all - electric vehicle and scientists at Oxford Brookes University will keep track of the drivers .
Anyone interested in taking part will need to meet certain criteria .
" You 'll have to have a garage , for example , and you 'll have to have a fairly modern electrical wiring system , " said Emma Lowndes of Mini UK .
" A conventional cable on a normal socket would take over 10 hours to charge the Mini 's battery .
We 're talking with Scottish and Southern Energy about putting in a 32 amp box into homes which would mean a charging time of just over 4 hours . "
The cost of the Mini E has not been finalised but , in a similar scheme in the United States , the company charged customers around $ 850 ( £ 520 ) per month to lease the car , a cost that included maintenance and insurance .
In Glasgow , 40 battery - powered cars will be made available by Peugeot , the local council and in partnership with the battery company Axeon .
Scottish Power will provide 40 charging points around Glasgow and , during the year - long trial , the cars will be monitored using GPS to record the number and length of individual journeys .
That data will be analysed by researchers at Strathclyde University .
Mercedes - Benz will make 100 of its latest electric Smart cars available in the west Midlands and in London .
"
We 're asking the public to come forward and apply to be one of the drivers of these vehicles , " said Dermot Kelly , managing director of Mercedes - Benz cars .
" What we want is a diverse group who are commuting to work every day , who have the ability to charge their cars at home .
The power supply companies will be supplying smart metering to work out when people would charge their cars up and when they would use them . "
Kelly said he wanted to know how people used electric cars .
" What we 're hoping to learn is ... what we need to do to make the car as friendly and adaptable as possible to people 's lifestyle . "
For those who want their environmentally friendly cars with a bit more power , the EEMS Accelerate consortium — a group of small independent manufacturers — are making 21 electric sports cars available .
These will include models from the Lightning car company , Westfield and Delta Motorsport .
In addition , wind energy company Ecotricity will build and test an electric sports car that it claims will be the world 's first charged only using energy from wind turbines .
Friends of the Earth 's transport campaigner Tony Bosworth welcomed the new scheme , but said : " Ministers must boost the UK's flagging renewable energy industry because electric vehicles are only as green as the power they run on .
Low - carbon vehicles are certainly needed , but we need broader changes to make the necessary cuts in transport emissions .
Urgent action is needed to get people out of their cars by making public transport , cycling and walking more attractive options . "
The government 's demonstration project will also examine people 's attitudes and behaviour around owning electric cars .
Some people might hesitate to buy a typical electric car that might only have a range of 100 miles on a full charge , said Bott , but their attitudes might change if they tried the cars in question or realised that 95 % of all UK journeys tend to be under 25 miles .
The demonstrations announced today are part of the government 's wider £ 250 m electric car strategy , unveiled in April , which includes potential incentives of up to £ 5,000 for consumers to buy electric cars .
London 's mayor , Boris Johnson , has also announced his intent to make the city the electric car capital of Europe .
He wants to introduce 100,000 electric cars to the capital 's streets and build an infrastructure of 25,000 charging points in public streets , car parks and shops .

" Tin - Can " Curt Degerman , a well - know aluminum can scavenger in the Swedish town of Skellefteå , was apparently a multi-millionaire when he died last year .
He was apparently very thrift and also a shrewd investor .
From Sweden 's The Local :
" He went to the library every day because he did n't buy newspapers .
There he read [ Swedish business daily ]
Dagens Industri , " a cousin ( of Degerman told the Expressen newspaper ) .
" He knew stocks inside and out . "
And Tin-Can
Curt used that investing know - how to turn the modest deposits he collected from returning empty cans into mutual funds worth more than 8 million kronor .
In addition , he had purchased 124 gold bars currently valued at 2.6 million kronor and had nearly 47,000 kronor in the bank .
Tin -Can
Curt also owned his own home , which was found to have 3,000 kronor in loose change , bringing the total value of his estate to 12,005,877 kronor .
Investigators believe model rocket buzzed jet Investigators believe model rocket buzzed Continental jet
Investigators believe the object that narrowly missed a Continental Express jet a week ago was a civilian - made rocket — described as a white cylinder about 5 to 7 feet long with triangular fins on its tail — rather than a military missile .
The description came from debriefing the jet ’s pilot and copilot who spotted a rocket with a long white vapor trail headed directly toward their cockpit at 16,000 feet shortly after they took off from George Bush Intercontinental Airport about 8 p.m. on May 29 , authorities said .
The flight was carrying 23 passengers to Greenville , S.C .
This is the second time in little over a year that a Continental plane has encountered a rocket - like object in its air space shortly after taking off from Houston Intercontinental .
The first incident occurred last year on Memorial Day .
It involved a Continental plane which was only a minute away from colliding with a rocket that shot past the cockpit window .
The plane , which was carrying 148 passengers to Cleveland , was much lower in the sky — about 4,750 feet — than the Express jet .
According to recorded radio dispatches on the first incident , the pilot reported that a rocket was on his “ 12 o’clock ” ( in front of his plane ) just as he as he flew over Lake Houston in Harris County .
Investigators were never able to determine who launched the suspected model rocket that came within one or two miles of the plane that was traveling at 277 mph .
But in the second case , Liberty County Sheriff ’s Chief Deputy Ken DeFoor said the rocket was flying horizontally and directly toward the airplane — rather vertically .
“ The object may have reached its apex and leveled out before starting its descent , ” DeFoor said .
Another search planned
Also , authorities now think the object was launched from Chambers County rather than Liberty County as earlier reported .
The FAA tracked the flight paths and calculated that the second rocket was fired from the northeast corner of Chambers County .
The airliner then encountered the rocket about 2 to 4 miles north of Interstate 10 .
“ Whenever the rocket fell to the ground , it would have hit somewhere in western Chambers County or eastern Harris County , ” DeFoor said .
Investigators will use a helicopter to search this area on Monday for any sign of the rocket .
“ If it had a parachute , as some do , it might have gotten entangled in the trees or something , ” DeFoor said .
DeFoor also asked residents to contact the sheriff ’s department ( 936-336-4500 ) if they have any information about the incident .
No model rocket clubs reported having any launches on Memorial weekend , authorities said .
DeFoor said a permit would be needed to launch a rocket traveling to such a high elevation and none had been granted .

The 7 - month - old American tabby climbed more than 50 - feet up a neighbor 's tree on Oak Avenue in Staten Island 's Oakwood section -- and the kitten has been stuck there for four days .
" I do n't know what else to do at this point , " Stacy Pizzurro , the kitten 's owner , told the Advance today .
Here 's a video from the yard :
7 - month old kitten stuck in tree
Ms. Pizzurro said attempts to get the Fire Department or Animal Care and Control of New York City to come to the kitten 's aid were unsuccessful .
When informed by the Advance , a crew from Con Edison arrived on the scene within an hour , but the kitten scampered even higher up the tree , out of reach from the utility 's 30 - foot tall cherry pickers .
" All the city agencies we pay taxes for did n't want to help , " said Marilyn Crespo , the owner of yard with the tree where the cat is stuck .
" Animal Control said put food out , she 'll come down .
It 's been four days . "
Four Con Edison workers arrived on the scene this afternoon , but were not able to rescue the kitten .
" We thought we'd be able to reach her with the bucket truck , but this is in the backyard , " said Jeff Isaacs , the Con Edison supervisor .
Nicholas Marshall , the chief lineman , climbed up a ladder with a can of tuna trying to lure the cat down .
His partners poked and prodded with the long extension sticks hoping it would fall into the long comforter held out by Ms. Pizzurro and her neighbor .
When that did n't work , another neighbor came with a hose and squirted it with water , but the kitten climbed even higher out of reach .

I ’ve published my thoughts on keyword research for new sites numerous times ; but this is the first time that I ’ve decided to share my way to do keyword analysis for a well established resource .
Why is it difficult ?
It is hard to say whether it is more ( or less ) difficult : to analysis keywords for an established site or for a new one .
It is just different .
I am not talking of the case when you are developing the site from the very start in which case you are likely to be doing keyword research weekly when checking your analytics for new search referrals .
I am talking about the case when you are asked to optimize an established site and this is the first time you ’ve seen it .
In this case you do n’t know how it ’s been evolving and you can hardly tell what words have a good ( missed ) opportunity to drive highly targeted traffic .
Advertisement Continue Reading Below
Where to start ?
Unlike with a new site where you usually start with the general niche research and then broaden it with keyword suggestion tools , keyword analysis for an established site should be started with its internal analytics , of course .
The first problem you are likely to face analyzing search referrals for a well - established , high - traffic site is the overwhelming volume of long tail which is almost impossible to figure .
So the steps you might want to consider are ( I am describing how to do that with Google Analytics but any advanced analytics tool can do that too ) :
Look at the top referrals first .
Do n’t forget to set a longer period of time not to miss some good words the site used to receive traffic in the past .
Try to sort top referrals into patterns .
I mentioned how to do that in the last week ’s post on discovering your most frequent modifiers .
What you need is to determine your core terms and most frequent modifiers for each one .
The best tool to do it is Excel as , among other options it provides us with , it also enables to visualize those patterns with different colors .
Organize your keyword phrases and patterns by topics , levels and modifiers .
Again , Excel is the best tool for that .
The more time you spend on sorting your keyword list into tables , the better idea you will get on how to better manage your future keyword optimization strategy .
Organize your words by topic : general versus specific ; informative , navigational , brand - specific – the topics depend on the site and your goals ;
Organize your words by levels where basic levels are determined by your core term and frequent modifiers ;
Organize your words by modifiers : this is basically meant to make sense of your patterns you determined in step 2 .
Research your current rankings : comparing your current keyword position to traffic numbers will give you an idea how promising each keyword is .
For example , if your site gets 500 + uniques weekly for a word that ranks on page 2 , you can safely assume it has a huge potential to send a lot of traffic when pushed to page 1 .
Rank checking in this case aims to answer two questions :
How much traffic a page is likely send ( with some deeper research , by looking at bounce rate and visitor ’s paths , you can also predict how much conversion potential the phrase has ) ;
How easily it will be to achieve page 1 rankings for the given phrase ( if your page has been on page 2 or 3 for the phrase for some period of time longer than one or two weeks , you stand very good chances to achieve page 1 rankings if you focus some effort on it ) .
The above steps will make you remember the site keywords and patterns by heart .
Now it ’s time to do some third - party analysis ( keyword suggestion tools and / or competitors research ) .

Note , that any of the above steps can be enhanced by testing keyword behavior with PPC .
SEO tools and articles to help you organize and manage your keyword lists :
You probably wear your seatbelt , look both ways before crossing the street and make sure your chicken is cooked thoroughly before cramming it into your mouth .
Safety first , right ?
Well guess what , you 're not taking it nearly far enough .
Judging by the safety gear out there on the market , there are horrifying , retarded dangers you 've never even thought of .

Scientists at Burnham Institute for Medical Research ( Burnham ) have discovered that specific microRNAs ( non-coding RNAs that interfere with gene expression ) reduce HIV replication and infectivity in human T - cells .
In particular , miR29 plays a key role in controlling the HIV life cycle .
The study suggests that HIV may have co-opted this cellular defense mechanism to help the virus hide from the immune system and antiviral drugs .
The research was published today in the journal Molecular Cell .
Tariq Rana , Ph.D. , director of the Program for RNA Biology at Burnham , and colleagues , found that the microRNA miR29 suppresses translation of the HIV - 1 genome by transporting the HIV mRNA to processing - bodies ( P - bodies ) , where they are stored or destroyed .
This results in a reduction of viral replication and infectivity .
The study also showed that inhibition of miR29 enhances viral replication and infectivity .
The scientists further demonstrated that strains of HIV - 1 with mutations in the region of the genome that interact with miR29 are not inhibited by miR29 .
" We think the virus may use this mechanism to modulate its own lifecycle , and we may be able to use this to our advantage in developing new drugs for HIV , " said Dr. Rana .
" Retroviral therapies greatly reduce viral load but cannot entirely eliminate it .
This interaction between HIV and miR29 may contribute to that inability .
Perhaps , by targeting miR29 , we can force HIV into a more active state and improve our ability to eliminate it . "
Rana 's team looked at miR29 expression levels in infected and uninfected cells and found that miR29 expression was enhanced by HIV - 1 infection .
Blocking the activity of miR29 with interfering RNA resulted in increased replication and infectivity of the virus .
The scientists tested the association of miR29 and HIV - 1 by mutating both miR29 and its target region on the HIV virus .
When either was altered , miR29s suppression of HIV replication and infectivity was reduced or eliminated .
In addition , the team suppressed P - bodies in the cells and noted a similar effect .
This suggests that HIV may use miRNAs to become dormant and escape immune response .

The Conference Board of Canada plagiarism and undue influence story – which with the Board ’s report and overdue apology to Curtis Cook will now go on hiatus until new reports are issued in the fall – has obviously attracted considerable interest .
Looking back , while plagiarism is rare , it is the public airing of the copyright lobby policy laundering effort that is the far more important development .
This lengthy post seeks to unravel the effort further by demonstrating how there has been a clear strategy of deploying seemingly independent organizations to advance the same goals , claims , arguments , and recommendations .
Over the past three years , this strategy has played out with multiple reports , each building on the next with a steady stream of self - citation .
The following diagram highlights the key players :
Although there are many groups involved in copyright lobbying , at the heart of the strategy are two organizations – the Canadian Recording Industry Association and the Canadian Motion Picture Distributors Association .
CRIA ’s board is made up the four major music labels plus its director , while the CMPDA ’s board is comprised of representatives of the Hollywood movie studios .
Those same studios and music labels provide support for the International Intellectual Property Association , which influences Canadian copyright policy by supporting U.S. government copyright lobby efforts .
In addition to their active individual lobbying ( described here ) , CRIA and CMPDA have provided financial support for three associations newly active on copyright lobbying – the Canadian Anti-Counterfeiting Network , the Canadian Chamber of Commerce ’s IP Council , and the Ontario Chamber of Commerce ( there are other funders including pharmaceutical companies and law firms ) .
Those groups have issued virtually identical reports and in turn supported seemingly independent sources such as the Conference Board of Canada and paid polling efforts through Environics .
The net effect has been a steady stream of reports that all say basically the same thing , cite to the same sources , make the same recommendations , and often rely on each other to substantiate the manufactured consensus on copyright reform .
The relevant reports are as follows :
Just how similar are these reports ?
First consider some sample recommendations ( note particularly the Ontario Chamber and Conference Board recommendations which include arguable plagiarism problems ) :
Recommendation CACN Ontario Chamber IP Council Conference Board Create an IP Council Establish a federal Intellectual Property Coordination Council consisting of senior civil servants and IP rights holders whose key objectives would include :
( i ) creating and implementing educational programs , with emphasis on Canadian youth , that teach the rationale for and importance of intellectual property ;
( ii ) communicating with IP right holders to ensure that their IP needs are being met by the current application of the laws ; IP Inter - Ministerial Coordination Council :
– comprising high - level representatives from ministries involved in innovation and intellectual property rights protection ( Ministry of Research and Innovation , Ministry of Economic Development and Trade , Ministry of Education and Ministry of Finance ) partnered with key industry stakeholders

Not only are the recommendations the same , so too are the claims and the arguments used to support the recommendations .
First the claims :
1. Counterfeiting costs the Canadian economy billions .
( see posts on the uncertainty associated with counterfeiting claims here , here , and here )

And a few of the arguments :
1. Piracy is out of control in Canada
CACN
Piracy can only thrive in a culture where citizens view the acquisition of counterfeit goods as acceptable , thereby opening the way to consumer demand for those products .
This appears to be case in Canada – particularly among youth – where research has found that stealing IP is increasingly regarded as morally acceptable .
Ontario Chamber the OECD found in a December 2005 report that Canada had the highest level of peer - to - peer downloading among OECD countries .
IP Council The RCMP has identified an “ ever - growing use of the Internet for IP crime ” in Canada , and predicted that the problem will escalate because “ soft ware , music and movie piracy are easy , low - risk activities . ”
In November of 2007 , the Quebec Superior Court declared that unauthorized file sharing in Canada was an “ endemic ” problem .
Conference Board
The Internet piracy problem within Canada continues to worsen and is causing serious problems for markets in other countries .
2. The U.S. is unhappy with Canada
CACN The United States Congressional International Anti-Piracy Caucus , which designated Canada as a “ Watch List Country ” ( along with China , Russia , Mexico , India , and Malaysia ) because of its failure to amend its copyright law in accordance with its WIPO obligations and because of “ Canada ’s lax border measures [ that ] appear to permit the importation of pirated products from East Asia , Pakistan , and Russia . ” Ontario Chamber Further , the United States Trade Representative ( USTR ) has stated that Canada ’s lax border measures “ appear to be non-compliant with TRIPS requirements ” and the Canadian Anti-Counterfeiting Network has stated that “ Canada has effectively failed to meet ” its TRIPS obligations .
IP Council Several international organizations and countries have specifically identified Canada for its failure to adequately protect IP rights .
In March 2008 , the International Intellectual Property Alliance placed Canada in the same league as well known counterfeiting havens like China and Russia by listing it among “ countries of the greatest concern . ”
In April 2008 , the United States Trade Representative ( USTR ) placed Canada on the Special 301 Watch List for the fourteenth consecutive year .
Conference Board
There is ongoing debate and outcry in Canada regarding the 2007 and 2009 Special 301 Reports issued by the Office of the United States Trade Representative .
3. Canada ’s lax IP protection hampers innovation and puts foreign investment at risk
CACN
By providing a marketplace where investments in creative goods and services will be profitable , IP protection fosters innovation , job creation and economic prosperity .
In developed nations like Canada , where innovation has become a key economic driver , this has never been more important .
Unfortunately , it appears that all levels of government in Canada lack a sophisticated understanding of the connection between innovation and IP .
Ontario Chamber
There is a real concern that mounting criticism of Canada ’s IPR regime will impact Ontario ’s attractiveness to foreign investors , its ability to foster innovation as well as overall competitiveness IP Council Canadian failure to properly protect IPR directly affects the willingness of foreign firms to invest domestically .
Conference Board Canada is not among the top innovation nations , but is well positioned to do better if it can bring together its fragmented and uncoordinated innovation infrastructure .
Otherwise , Canada will continue to offer only a marginal framework for developing and exploiting intellectual property from both the private and public sectors .
The role of intellectual property systems in Canada has received inadequate attention .
If Canada does not change , its economic outlook will suffer .
False Momentum
It is not just that these reports all receive financial support from the same organizations and say largely the same thing .
It is also that the reports each build on one another , creating the false impression of growing momentum and consensus on the state of Canadian law and the need for specific reforms .
Consider the IP Council ’s A Time for Change , which was released in early 2009 .
The very first chapter of the report is titled “ Canada ’s Emerging Consensus on Intellectual Property Rights . ”
Where does this consensus come from ?
According to the IP Council , it starts with the CACN report , followed by two House of Commons committees that heard primarily from these groups and which led to the 2007 Speech from the Throne and Canada ’s participation in ACTA .
The chapter then states that IPR policy was taken to the “ next level ” with the Ontario Chamber report , the founding of the IP Council , and the 2008 Conference Board of Canada conference that led to the three recalled IP reports .
The chapter then notes the “ growing public awareness of the need for action ” which cites Environics polls ( paid for by the IP Council ) and a Toronto Star supplement on counterfeiting ( paid for by the CACN ) .
In all , the IP Council cites the CACN four times , the Ontario Chamber twice , the Conference Board of Canada proceedings 13 times , and the Environics research five times .
Environics
The influence over some of these independent reports is evident in other ways .
For example , Environics has emerged as the survey company of choice for this effort ( Pollara was a favourite until Duncan McKie left to run the Canadian Independent Record Production Association ) .
Environics lead on these issues was once Don Hogarth , who now provides communications for CRIA .
On June 4 , 2008 – one week before the introduction of C - 61 – Environics released a poll that it said found that Canadians are looking for leadership on IP issues .
The report repeats the CACN , Ontario Chamber , and IP Council assertions , stating :
over the past several years Canada has fallen behind the international community when it comes to the protection of intellectual property and products of the mind .
The gap between Canadian laws and international standards in the area of counterfeiting , piracy , and illegal downloading is growing ever wider .
Canada has been maintained by the U.S. Trade Representative on a special watch list specifically because of its laxity in the realm of protecting intellectual property .
What makes the timing particularly noteworthy is that even though Environics issued a press release claiming that the data came from a new study , the data was not new .
Rather , it was drawn from a 2006 survey that seemingly sat idle for two years until the opportune moment to raise it days before the introduction of new copyright legislation .
Who funded the questions related to intellectual property ?
It will come as little surprise to find that CRIA paid for those .
Moreover , Environics oddly proceeded to re-issue the identical press release six months later ( June 2008 version , December 2008 version ) in conjunction with an IP Council commissioned survey on counterfeiting .
What does it all mean ?
At a certain level , none of this will come as a surprise .
Companies lobby for their position and what made the Conference Board of Canada series of events so unusual was the way in which it was exposed .
Yet the Conference Board of Canada ’s recalled reports were clearly just a part of a much larger strategy to influence Canadian copyright policy by creating a narrative of crisis and the false impression of Canada as a piracy haven .
This week ’s comments from Industry Minister Tony Clement and Canadian Heritage Minister James Moore provide the strong sense that they better understand the current dynamic around copyright , but it is obvious that the lobbying on the issue is only going to intensify in the months ahead .
The public is widely ignorant of the stories and people who provide the basis of Christianity , a survey has found , despite 75 per cent of respondents owning a copy of the Bible .
The National Biblical Literacy Survey found that as few as 10 per cent of people understood the main characters in the Bible and their relevance .
Figures such as Abraham and Joseph were a source of puzzlement and it was rare to find anyone who could name the Ten Commandments .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Many stories considered to be central to the Christian message were a mystery to most .
As few as 7 per cent of respondents knew the story of Whitsun and only 15 per cent were familiar with the stories associated with Advent .
St John 's College Durham in Durham carried out the survey and released preliminary findings yesterday .
The full report is expected to be published in July .
Researchers found that 57 per cent of people knew nothing about Joseph or his brothers despite the hit musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat and 60 per cent were ignorant of the story of the Good Samaritan .
The Reverend David Wilkinson , from St John's , said the consequences of ignorance went far beyond being unclear about what church leaders might preach .
He said a good grounding in the stories and characters of the Bible was essential to understanding history and culture because so much of art , music and literature was bound up with religious themes .
" There are depths to many pieces of music , many of Shakespeare 's plays , particular pieces of art that draw from the imagery , the stories , the language of the Bible , " Dr Wilkinson told the BBC .
The Reverend Brian Brown , a Methodist preacher and visiting lecturer at St John's , said he was startled by the lack of knowledge and understanding among people questioned , despite a third of them saying that the Bible was important to them .
Today , more children than ever are being treated with complementary and alternative therapies .
Recent studies indicate that about 30 percent of healthy children and up to 50 percent of children with chronic disease are using some kind of alternative therapy .
“ There is a huge place for complementary and alternative medicine in pediatrics , ” says Dolores Mendelow , M.D. , clinical assistant professor of pediatrics and communicable diseases at the University of Michigan Medical School .
Complementary and alternative therapies are becoming a more prevalent treatment for children .
If individuals follow the directions of their physicians , these treatments are a safe and effective way to get and stay healthy , Mendelow says .
While certain types of complementary and alternative therapies are safe for children , there are many therapies that could potentially be dangerous .
Mendelow notes that parents should always consult their children ’s pediatrician before beginning any new treatment .
Alternative therapies can be successful against many illnesses – including the common cold or skin rashes – when over - the - counter medications do not have immediate success .
For instance , honey can be used for coughs related to the common cold – just not for children less than one year of age .
“ In terms of complementary medicine , we ’re using acupuncture , dietary supplementation and herbal or botanical therapies , ” Mendelow says .
Some types of therapies that may be beneficial for children :
Yoga .
Experts suggest that pediatric patients participate in yoga as a form of therapy .
Yoga , when combined with medicines prescribed by a physician , can be used to help asthmatic patients learn to practice and use deep breathing and remain calm when faced with shortness of breath .
Yoga also helps reduce stress in teens and adolescents .

Probiotics .
These live bacteria , similar to those found in the human stomach , can be found in dietary supplements or in food , such as yogurt .
Used to treat antibiotic - associated diarrhea , controlled studies have shown probiotics are safe for children .
Using probiotics can reduce diarrhea by one to two days , allowing children to go back to school or day care sooner .
Probiotics are not recommended for children on any immunosuppressive drugs or those who are immuno - compromised .
Always consult a doctor first .
While there is strong evidence that these complementary and alternative therapies are safe for children , Mendelow advises parents that other complementary and alternative medicines can have serious consequences for children and adolescents .
Some types of therapies that may be harmful to children include :
There ’s new data flowing into Wolfram| Alpha every second .
And we ’re always working very hard to develop the core code and data for the system .
In fact , internally , we have a complete new version of the system that ’s built every day .
But before we release this version for general use , we do extensive validation and testing .
In addition to real - time data updates , we ’ve made a few changes to Wolfram| Alpha since its launch three weeks ago .
But today , as one step in our ongoing , long - term development process , we ’ve just made live the first broad updates to the core code and data of Wolfram| Alpha .
And now we ’re working hard to get ready the next update … which will be in fact probably be going live for preview testing as early as tomorrow .
We ’ll be doing many similar updates in the future ; check this blog for the latest information .
Today ’s update includes the following :
Additional linguistic forms for many types of data and questions
More comparisons of composite properties ( e.g. “ US military vs. UK ” )
Combined time series plots of different quantities ( e.g. “ germany gdp vs population ” )
More complete handling of government positions ( e.g. “ chancellor ” , etc . )
Updates to country borders for India , China , Slovenia , Croatia , and others
Updates to naming for certain politically sensitive countries and regions
Additional subcountry regions ( e.g. “ Wales ” ) ; many more to come
Additional support for current and past fractional timezones ( e.g. “ Iran time ” )
City - by - city handling of U.S. states with multiple timezones
Updates to certain European currencies ( e.g. for “ Cyprus ” and “ Slovakia ” )
Some additional historical events ; many more to come
Additional probability computations for cards and coins ( e.g. “ 2 or 3 aces ” )
Additional output for partitions of integers ( e.g. “ partitions of 47 ” )
Implicit handling of geometric figure properties ( e.g. “ ellipse with area 6 and major axis 2 ” )
Additional support for Mathematica 3D graphics syntax
Additional support for stock prices with explicit dates
Support for planet - to - planet distances and “ nearest planet ” , etc .
Extra information when comparing incompatible units ( e.g. “ ergs vs. newtons ” )
Improved linguistic handling for many foods ( e.g. “ love apple ” )
More mountains added , especially in Australia
Support for many less - common given names ( e.g. “ zebulon ” )
More “ self - aware ” questions answered ( e.g. “ how old are you ” )
More consistent handling of sidebar links to Wikipedia , etc .
Altogether , there have been 1850 code commits , and 591 code files have been changed .
About 1.1 million data values have also been touched in some way in this update .
But the medium provides a new angle on a familiar story , in a voice more directly empathetic than those of many prose histories .
It gives the hipsters back their body language .
In a book that is largely about license and the enlightened rebel , it is easy to find reflections of both in the graphic form .
The panels , which are flat and often horrific , capture the dullness and insanity not only of the lives the Beats sought to escape but of the ones they made in their place .
The Beats here inhabit a world that looks a lot like Harvey Pekar ’s Cleveland .
No wonder they had to go go go and not stop till they got there .
Some of the history is off .
Jan Kerouac was not shown by a blood test to be Jack ’s daughter ( the test was inconclusive ) , and Pekar scrambles the chronology of some of Kerouac ’s books and stylistic breakthroughs .
Nancy J. Peters , a part owner of the City Lights bookstore in San Francisco , was unwisely tapped to help write the chapter on the store , which includes lines like “ City Lights is not only a bookstore and publisher , it ’s a historic public space and an international cultural center , ” and “ Today , City Lights has come to symbolize the American spirit of free intellectual inquiry . ”
Here , nonobjective history gives way to plain self - promotion , and not even cool self - promotion .
And sometimes the scope of history overwhelms the panels .
There ’s too much to tell , and the telling gets clunky and dutiful : “ Another 1950 occurrence was Kerouac ’s trip with Cassady to Mexico City , where Burroughs had been living since his last drug bust and working on ‘ Junkie , ’ a classic of its kind , which Ginsberg , who was always acting as an unpaid agent for other writers , encouraged him to write and finally got Ace Books to publish . ”
The freshest chapters are on the less well - known characters , and those in which the writers insert themselves .
Nick Thorkelson and Pekar , in their hallucinatory chapter on the jazz - influenced poet Kenneth Patchen , begin : “ My high school friend Dave Burton turned me on to Kenneth Patchen ’s picture poems in 1961 .
We were on the lookout for anything ‘ beat , ’ which for us meant tough , funny . . . & ecstatic .
Patchen had it all ! ”
This , perhaps , is the Beats ’ true legacy : the impact they continue to have on people who encounter them for the first time , even if that impact is n’t literary .
Discussions of “ On the Road ” tend to begin , “ I was 17 when I first read it , and it made me . . . ” in ways that discussions of “ Ulys­ses ” or “ The Great Gatsby ” do not .
( They tend to end there as well , alas . )
“ The Beats ” captures some of the wonder of that first encounter and places it in historical and political context .
Here was a group of writers who hoped to change consciousness through their lives and art .
They fit America ’s romance with the outsider .
That they were products of elite colleges — Harvard , Reed , Columbia , Swarthmore — and owed their visibility to non­outsider publications like Mademoiselle and this newspaper is a paradox “ The Beats ” chooses not to engage .
They rocked .

John was in bed , nearly ready to turn out the light when his wife — who had been burning the midnight oil in the computer room — rushed in .
" John , I think there 's something wrong with the computer , " she said .
" I went online and things were going ok at first , but now the internet is at a crawl . "
" Did you close everything and reboot ? " he asked , hoping to avoid getting out of bed .
" Do n't you think I already did that , " she snapped , " YOU need to come and do something about this NOW ! "
Not wanting World War 3 over a panic about the slow internet , John managed an " Ok , dear . " as he slipped out from under the covers to go downstairs and see what was wrong .
Saving Money and Sanity is a WIN - WIN
John 's wife worked as a nurse at the local hopsital and was in the midst of taking some mandatory medical training .
In previous years , everyone griped that the training was only available during certain days at certain hours .
That , and the sessions were a full eight hours of classroom time delivered by the inhouse trainer whose voice was a near match to Ben Stein's .
So , in the interest of staving off a mutiny of the hospital 's nursing staff , management sought the expertise of Web - U - Learn , a " leading e-learning provider for the health care industry . "
Skip ahead to the next round of annual training and , as anticipated , the e-learning suite was a massive success .
However , if the hospital staff did not complete their training by 8 AM of a certain date , it was off to the classroom they would go .
And John 's wife was damned if she was going to have to sit through eight hours of hell to get a certificate of participation .
Stopping the Flood
After making his way to the family computer , John sat down and pulled up a new browser .
Figuring that the training company 's site was stressed under the load of all the late arrivals cramming in their testing , he was surprised to see that everything was slow : Google , MSN , you name it .
John thought that there had to be some rogue app that was sucking up all available network bandwidth , so he pulled up the task manager .
As it turned out , Outlook was the guilty culprit .
To be more specific , it was currently downloading message 20 of 621 .
Immediately , John killed Outlook and logged into the webmail interface .
It loaded up pretty quickly and displayed the customary " 700 Unread Messages " notice .
Well , customary , except for the 700 part .
Scrolling through page after page of emails , it was apparent that the 700 unread emails ( and growing ) were all from Web - U - Learn .
It was their newsletter and each one weighed in at about 256kb .
To remedy the problem , John deleted the hundreds of " spam " emails and redirected any messages from the newsletter address straight to the trash .
With brownie points earned and the wife back on task , John moseyed himself into bed for the night .
However , he could n't help but wonder why the email was being sent out hundreds of times .
Virus on their end ?
Batch job gone wild ?
Much to John 's surprise , his answer came in the form of an apology email the next morning .
Mea Culpa ... ab absurdo
The email read as follows .
Hey Everybody !
We are sooo sorry for the multiple emails that went out overnight and the ensuing grumbling , cursing , spitting , and swearing it caused as a result !
The automatic emailing program that we use here went a little bit crazy and we TOTALLY feel the same pain you all felt .
The madness was so bad on our end that our web host had to shut down our server and reboot it just so that we could send out this email .
So thank you for all of you who called , emailed and sent the boys round to knee cap us ( LOL ) .
Ok , skip ahead to now .
We have stopped it now and are looking into what went wrong ( if you are a " techy " , and want to know the reason , check out the end of this email ) .
If you would like to be unsubscribed from our newsletter , this can be easily done via your account , but for everyone else , our system will be changed so that it wo n't happen ever again .
Scout 's honor !!
Thanks for understanding and , after all that , if you did want to read the newsletter , that would be great !
A large serving of humble pie from all of us ...
Eric McKean on Behalf of Web - U - Learn ( and the crazy server that started all this ! )
In spite of the rather informal tone of the letter , especially the LOL ( seriously Web - U - Learn , LOL ? ) ,
John thought it was pretty gutsy of the training company to fess up and apologize for the flood of emails .
However , after skipping the generous " DISCLAIMER :
This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and intended solely ... blah ... blah ... " that nobody ever reads to view the " techy " reason , John figured that the company does n't have guts , it has balls to admit the real reason .
TECHY STUFF
After midnight a viewing of the homepage of your website runs the cron script which sends the enewsletter Sending 5000 + emails takes time , its not recorded on the system as completed until all 5000 emails have been sent .
While this is going on other people view the homepage and this restarts the email newsletter script ( because the database does n't show that these emails have already been sent ) , so there are now multiple emails being sent .
Meantime , the server is getting very busy sending out all these emails and crashes .
When server gets going again the whole thing starts all over again .
Eventually at about 7 this morning the web host support team came in and hard - rebooted our server and no more emails were sent out !
why can't we just accept that black people love fried chicken , indians love curry , asians like fish and mexicans like chiles ?
this whole issue of stereotypes vs racism reminds me of an average relationship between an man and a woman .
At first , there are inevitably some larger issues to work out - trust and honesty , commitment , respect - all the things that typically require some sort of adjustment early on .
so the man changes based on her complaints , and pretty soon , he 's shed all the things that originally bugged her .
but it 's not over yet - nay , the list is a mile long , and the more self restrained and conforming the man gets , the less significant are the issues that she 'll complain about .
' improve ' yourself long enough , and you 'll wake up one day to find her drawing conclusions about your relationship based on the fact that you are using a gravy spoon to eat your cereal .
the point is that stereotypes are n't any more racist ( which is a hateful thing ) than using a gravy spoon to eat cereal is an affront to your S.O. it 's just the inevitable course this feminist - P.C. stuff takes - eventually a serious issue dissolves into a petty one , and yet , that does not stop the complaining .
and so those who nag over stereotypes - let it go .
there 's no hate there , at least , not in a black guy / fried chicken situation .
such a stereotype is n't demeaning or dehumanizing .
it 's simply amusing , and uh ... you 'll be hard pressed to find a black guy who claims there 's no basis in reality for this stereotype .

M97 : The Owl Nebula
Credit & Copyright : Keith Quattrocchi
Explanation : The Owl Nebula is perched in the sky about 2,600 light - years away toward the bottom of the Big Dipper 's bowl .
Also cataloged as M97 , the 97th object in Messier 's well - known list , its round shape along with the placement of two large , dark " eyes " do suggest the face of a staring owl .
One of the fainter objects in Messier 's catalog , the Owl Nebula is a planetary nebula , the glowing gaseous envelope shed by a dying sun- like star as it runs out of nuclear fuel .

GENEVA ( Reuters ) - The World Health Organization declared an influenza pandemic on Thursday and advised governments to prepare for a long - term battle against an unstoppable new flu virus .
The United Nations agency raised its pandemic flu alert to phase 6 on a six - point scale , indicating the first influenza pandemic since 1968 is under way .
“ With today ’s announcement , WHO moves from an emergency to a longer - term response .
Based on past experience , this pandemic will be with us for some months , if not years , to come , ” WHO Director - General Dr. Margaret Chan said in a letter to staff , a copy of which was obtained by Reuters .
People aged 30 - 50 , pregnant women or people suffering from chronic conditions such as asthma , diabetes or obesity are at highest risk , Chan told a news conference .
Countries from Australia to Chile and the United States are reporting the new swine flu virus is “ crowding out ” seasonal flu , becoming the predominant influenza strain , she said .
For now the virus was “ pretty stable , ” but Chan warned that it could still change into a more deadly form , perhaps mixing with the H5N1 bird flu virus circulating widely in poultry .
“ So it is incumbent on WHO and all members to stay vigilant and alert for the next year or two or even beyond , ” she said .
There is also a risk the swine flu could mix with its seasonal H1N1 cousin , which has developed resistance to the main antiviral flu drug Tamiflu , made by Roche AG and Gilead Sciences Inc , Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told a separate briefing .
The United States has been operating on pandemic status for weeks , with hundreds of thousands of cases and at least 1,000 hospitalizations , Schuchat said .
GUARDING AGAINST ‘RASH ’ ACTIONS
The virus disproportionately makes younger people sick .
Some 57 percent of U.S. cases were among people aged 5 to 24 , and 41 percent of those hospitalized were in this younger age group .
H1N1 is active in all 50 states and there are so many cases now that in some areas , patients with specific flu - like symptoms -- a fever above 104 degrees F ( 40 degrees C ) , cough or other respiratory symptoms -- are presumed to have the new virus .
WHO reiterated its advice to its 193 member countries not to close borders or impose travel restrictions to halt the movement of people , goods and services , a call echoed by U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon .
“ We must guard against rash and discriminatory actions such as travel bans or trade restrictions , ” Ban told a news conference at U.N. headquarters .
The move to phase 6 reflects the fact that the disease , widely known as swine flu , is spreading geographically , but does not indicate how virulent it is .
Widespread transmission of the virus in Australia , signaling that it is entrenched in another region besides North America , was one of the key triggers for moving to phase 6 .
“ We are satisfied that this virus is spreading to a number of countries and it is not stoppable , ” Chan said .

“ Moving to pandemic phase 6 level does not imply we will see an increase in the number of deaths or very severe cases .
Quite on the contrary .
Many people are having mild disease , they recover without medicines in some cases and it is good news , ” she said .
“ Although the pandemic appears to have moderate severity in comparatively well - off countries , it is prudent to anticipate a bleaker picture as the virus spreads to areas with limited resources , poor health care , and a high prevalence of underlying medical problems , ” she added .
Canadian health officials said they were concerned about reports of more severe symptoms in some aboriginal communities , but said it was too soon to say for sure .
“ To make conclusions based on a couple of communities that this is somehow a disease that is worse in a particular ethnic group .
It ’s much too early to make any of those kinds of conclusions or presumptions , ” said Dr. David Butler - Jones , Canada ’s chief public health officer .

VACCINE DEVELOPMENT UNDERWAY
Chan said WHO would start distributing a further donation of 5.65 million courses of Tamiflu from Roche .
WHO recommended drugmakers stay on track to complete production of seasonal influenza vaccine for the Northern Hemisphere ’s next winter in the next two weeks .
Each year , normal flu kills up to 500,000 people and infects millions .
Work on developing an H1N1 vaccine is already under way at leading companies , whose factories will be ready to switch to making a pandemic shot in around two weeks ’ time , when normal season flu vaccine production is complete .
Seasonal flu affects mainly the elderly and causes severe illness in millions , so a premature switch in vaccine production to cope with the new strain could put many people at risk .
“ So our recommendation is they need to finish the seasonal vaccine and then move over , ” Chan said .
Chan said the Geneva - based agency would work with regulatory authorities to help fast - track approval of new pandemic vaccines that are safe and effective so that they can be made available as soon as possible .
In any case , the first doses would only be available in September , she added .
A pandemic could cause enormous disruption to business as workers stay home because they are sick or to look after family members and authorities restrict gatherings of large numbers of people or movement of people or goods .
World markets shrugged off the pandemic , as investors focused on possible global economic recovery .
The strain , which emerged in April in Mexico and the United States , has spread widely .
There have been 28,774 infections confirmed in 74 countries to date , including 144 deaths , according to WHO ’s latest tally of laboratory - confirmed cases .

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published findings of a study on Friday , suggesting that climate change endangers public health and welfare .
The landmark findings could be the basis for federal regulation of CO2 .
The proposed endangerment findings , which will now move to a public comment period , also state , “ In both magnitude and probability , climate change is an enormous problem .
The greenhouse gases that are responsible for it endanger public health and welfare within the meaning of the Clean Air Act . ”
Chief among the findings is that global climate change has the potential to make U.S. air quality management more difficult , and therefore future air quality management decisions should begin to account for the impacts of climate change .
“ This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem now and for future generations .
Fortunately , it follows President Obama ’s call for a low carbon economy and strong leadership in Congress on clean energy and climate legislation , ” said Administrator Lisa P. Jackson in a statement .
In proposing the finding , Administrator Jackson also took into consideration the impacts of climate change on national security and the disproportionate impacts of climate change on vulnerable segments of the population like the poor , elderly , very young and disabled .
The scientific analysis also confirms that climate change impacts human health in several ways including higher concentrations of ground - level ozone , a harmful pollutant .
The endangerment finding also suggests additional impacts of climate change include :
· increased drought ;
· more heavy downpours and flooding ;
· more frequent and intense heat waves and wildfires ;
· greater sea level rise ;
· more intense storms ; and
· harm to water resources , agriculture , wildlife and ecosystems .
Led by EPA ’s Global Change Research Program and EPA ’s Office of Air and Radiation , the effort represents the first systematic attempt to use linked global - to - regional climate and air quality modeling systems from multiple research groups to jointly investigate the regional dimensions of potential climate - induced air quality changes across the United States .

( CNN ) --
In a new anti-Israel , anti-U.S. video , an American al Qaeda member makes reference to his Jewish ancestry for the first time in an official al Qaeda message .
Adam Yahiye Gadahn , also known as Azzam the American , is seen in an earlier al Qaeda video .
In the video , Adam Yahiye Gadahn , also known as Azzam the American , discusses his roots as he castigates U.S. policies and deplores Israel 's offensive in Gaza that started in late December 2008 and continued into January .
" Let me here tell you something about myself and my biography , in which there is a benefit and a lesson , " Gadahn says , as he elicits support from his fellow Muslims for " our weapons , funds and Jihad against the Jews and their allies everywhere . "
" Your speaker has Jews in his ancestry , the last of whom was his grandfather , " he says .
Growing up in rural California , Gadahn embraced Islam in the mid-1990s , moved to Pakistan and has appeared in al Qaeda videos before .
He was indicted in the United States in 2006 on charges of treason and material support to al Qaeda , according to the FBI .
Gadahn is on the FBI 's Most Wanted List , with a reward of up to $ 1 million leading to his capture .
FBI records show Gadahn 's date of birth as September 1 , 1978 .
The video -- in which Gadahn speaks Arabic , with English subtitles -- surfaced on Saturday .
This account is based on an English transcript provided by As - Sahab Media , the media production company used by al Qaeda .
Gadahn 's Jewish ancestry has been reported in the news media .
But terrorism analyst Laura Mansfield says it is the first time Gadahn acknowledged his Jewish ancestry in an official al Qaeda message .
Gadahn says his grandfather was a " Zionist " and " a zealous supporter of the usurper entity , and a prominent member of a number of Zionist hate organizations . "
" He used to repeat to me what he claimed are the virtues of this entity and encouraged me to visit it , specifically the city of Tel Aviv , where relatives of ours live , " says Gadahn , referring to Israel .
He says his grandfather gave him a book by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called " A Place Among the Nations " -- in which the " rabid Zionist " sets out " feeble arguments and unmasked lies to justify the Jews ' rape of Muslim Palestine . "
But Gadahn says that despite his youth at the time , he did n't heed his grandfather 's words .
" How can a person with an ounce of self - respect possibly stand in the ranks of criminals and killers who have no morals , no mercy , no humanity and indeed , no honor ? " he says in reference to Zionists and Israel .
" Is n't it shameful enough for a person to carry the citizenship of America , the symbol of oppression and tyranny and advocate of terror in the world ? "
Mansfield thinks the video may have been made between late April and mid-May , before President Obama 's speech in Cairo , Egypt , addressing U.S. relations with Muslims .
Gadahn notes Obama 's inauguration , Netanyahu 's election in February , and Obama 's speech in Turkey in April .
Specifically mentioning the Gaza offensive and citing other hot spots such as Iraq , Afghanistan , Chechnya and Somalia , where the " Zio- Crusader alliance " is fighting his " brothers , " he says " this open - faced aggression " comes as Obama has risen to power .
He scorns Obama 's statements in his inaugural address and in Turkey that America is n't and wo n't be at war with Islam , and " other deceptive , false and sugarcoated words of endearment and respect . "
He says Obama 's language is similar to words Netanyahu uttered in the Knesset in 1996 .
Gadahn also backs the idea of targeting " Zio- Crusader " interests anywhere in the world , not just " within Palestine . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Global consumer confidence is stabilizing after falling for 18 months , providing a glimmer of hope for a shattered world economy in which three quarters of households cut spending , a survey showed on Tuesday .

Some 40 percent of consumers blame the banking and finance industry for the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression , while 19 percent also hold former U.S. President George W. Bush ’s administration and their own governments responsible , the Ipsos / Reuters poll of 23 countries found .
The survey of 23,000 people , conducted between April 14 and May 7 , showed 29 percent thought that the economic situation in their country is very good or somewhat good , only a slight dip from 31 percent in November 2008 , but well down on 43 percent in April 2008 and 54 percent in October 2007 .
“ It looks like we have hit bottom and so there are glimmers of hope , ” said Clifford Young of Ipsos Global Public Affairs , the international market research and polling company that carried out the online poll .
“ What we ’re seeing is that consumers for the most part have been scared , they have cut expenditures and increased savings , ” he said .
“ The uptick wo n’t be as fast as the decline , but if the United States is stabilized that ’s really important in the global sense . ”
Ipsos polled people in the United States , Canada , Brazil , Mexico , Argentina , South Korea , China , Japan , Australia , India , Russia , Czech Republic , Poland , Hungary , Turkey , Sweden , Italy , the Netherlands , Belgium , Germany , France , Spain , and Britain .
“ The stabilization is basically happening in the United States , India and China and that has staunched a bit the bleed around the world , ” Young said .
“ That being said Europe is still dicey as well as Brazil and Russia . ”
In the United States , which sparked the global economic downturn , consumer confidence rose two percentage points to 13 percent , while in China it jumped to 61 percent from 46 percent and in India it increased five points to 70 percent .
The effect of the financial crisis has lagged in Brazil , but consumer confidence in Latin America ’s largest economy dropped to 56 percent from 61 percent in the past six months , while Russian optimism fell to 35 percent from 52 percent and Europe dropped nine points to 23 percent .
“ It ’s an issue of confidence in institutions , ” Young said of the continued fall in Europe .
“ For better or worse in the United States the people saw the government taking extreme actions .
Though this happened in Europe it happened less so . ”
The 23 countries polled make up 75 percent of the world ’s gross domestic product .
Cuts in household spending have remained constant during the past six months with entertainment , vacations and luxury items the first to go for nearly three quarters of families followed by clothing for 61 percent , energy consumption for 53 percent and gasoline / driving for 42 percent .
Respondents in the online poll were recruited and screened , the survey said .
The results are then balanced by age , gender , city population and education levels .
The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percent .

Google said it is in " discussion " with the FTC Google CEO Eric Schmidt says he will not resign his Apple board position despite a government inquiry .
The Federal Trade Commission is looking at a possible breach of antitrust laws given Mr Schmidt 's directorships at Google and Apple .
Both companies have competing browsers and phone operating systems , leading to possible conflicts of interest .
But Mr Schmidt told reporters : " If there are issues on competitiveness , I recuse myself . "
He also said that it is well established that he leaves the boardroom whenever the discussion has anything to do with the iPhone .
When asked if he had considered resigning given the recent FTC interest , Mr Schmidt replied " it has n't crossed my mind . "
" Antitrust devil " Mr Schmidt 's comments to news organisations , including the BBC , came ahead of his address to shareholders at the company 's headquarters in Mountain View , California .
During that briefing he also said he did not think the fact that Google and Apple share directors was a problem .
The role of Arthur Levinson , a former chief executive of Genentech , who is also on both boards is part of the FTC investigation .
" From my perspective I do n't think Google sees Apple as a primary competitor , " said Mr Schmidt .
Google 's legal team also told journalists that it did not see any conflict of interest .
" The law is clear that there is a safe harbour under the Clayton Act for companies that do n't have overlapping revenue in different areas , and we 're comfortable with that position , " said the search giant 's legal counsel Kent Walker One shareholder attending the annual meeting did not seem to agree .
Speaking on behalf of the federation of labour organisations known as the AFL - CIO , Brandon Rees challenged Mr Schmidt to resign from Apple 's board to avoid further government investigation .
" There is nothing to gain and a lot to lose .
We do n't want Google to become an antitrust devil like Microsoft did , " said Mr Reese .
Mr Schmidt said he did not want to comment on any discussions or " rumours of an investigation " and that his presence on both boards was " both legal and proper . "
" Killer app " Turning to the health of Google , Mr Schmidt told shareholders that despite the economic downturn , this was a good time to invest in innovation .
SearchWiki is one of the 350 improvements made in the last year
In the first quarter of 2009 , the company posted its first revenue decline in consecutive quarters since going public nearly five years ago .
" Companies that invest in innovation in the downturn emerge stronger than their cost - cutting competitor .
" The success of Google will ultimately be determined on our rate of innovation , " said Mr Schmidt .
One major area of investment and growth for the company remains search .
Mr Schmidt said it is " still the killer app " especially on mobile phones were " more people are accessing the web through their thumbs . "
Recent figures show that Google accounted for 63.7 % of all US searches and 97.5 % of mobile phone searches .
" Information is what we do .
Doing it right and doing the world 's perfect search engine remains very very difficult , " said Mr Schmidt
To that end he underlined that Google had made 350 improvements in search in the last year alone .
Marissa
Mayer who is the vice president of search products told shareholders " we are making the reinvestment in terms of improving search .
" We have all kinds of different ways we use our large market share to our advantage to make our service even better .
" Google today is better than yesterday and Google tomorrow will be even better .
" There are actually changes going on this afternoon like there are almost every day , " said Ms Mayer .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran ’s leadership has quelled mass protests over a disputed presidential poll two weeks ago , but the battle has moved off the street into a behind - the - scenes struggle splitting the clerical establishment into two camps .
EDITORS ’ NOTE : Reuters and other foreign media are subject to Iranian restrictions on their ability to report , film or take pictures in Tehran .
Hardline preacher Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami is expected to reinforce the government message when he leads Friday prayers that the June 12 election in which President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared victor was legal and fair .
Supporters of defeated candidate Mirhossein Mousavi , who want the result annulled , plan to release thousands of balloons on Friday with the message : “ Neda you will always remain in our hearts , ” in memory of the young woman killed last week who has become an icon of the protests .
The last mass protests were on Saturday and a combination of warnings , arrests and the threat of police action have driven large demonstrations off Tehran ’s street with small gatherings dispersed with tear gas and baton charges .
The worst unrest since the Islamic Revolution of 1979 set off by the poll left about 20 people killed , prompting President Barrack Obama to say he was “ appalled and outraged ” by the security crackdown in the world ’s fifth largest oil exporter .
Group of Eight powers meeting in Trieste plan in a statement to deplore post- election violence , to urge Tehran to settle the crisis through peaceful , democratic means and to respect basic rights including freedom of expression , a diplomat said .
The condemnation by Obama , who had been trying to improve ties with Iran before the election , prompted Ahmadinejad to accuse Obama of behaving like his predecessor and say there was not much point in talking to Washington unless Obama apologized .
“ I tell ( the United States ) that all those people who voted and all the Iranian nation will stand against them , ” the Iranian president , who was elected for a second four - year term , said in response to Obama ’s comments .
Before the poll , Obama , aiming to change the policy of George W. Bush toward Iran , had hoped to persuade Tehran to drop what Washington suspects are plans to develop nuclear bombs , while seeking cooperation in Afghanistan and Iraq .
MOUSAVI UNDER PRESSURE
In what appeared to be further evidence of the government ’s determination to crush resistance , 70 professors were detained after meeting Mousavi and his campaign manager was arrested , his website said on Thursday .
The semi-official Fars News Agency said that the professors were later released .
Mousavi said he was under pressure to stop challenging the election result and also complained about the closure of his Kalameh - ye Sabz daily newspaper and arrest of its staff .

Iran has jailed around 40 journalists and media workers in the post-election crackdown , New York - based media watchdog the Committee to Protect Journalists said on Thursday .
The row over the election has exposed an unprecedented public rift within Iran ’s ruling elite .
Mousavi has the backing of such influential figures as former presidents Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami , and dissident cleric Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri .

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who normally stays above the political fray , has sided strongly with Ahmadinejad .
Khamenei has upheld the result and Iran ’s top legislative body , the Guardian Council , has refused to annul the elections .
State Press TV quoted a spokesman for the council as saying they were “ among the healthiest elections ever held in the country . ”
Mousavi said he was determined to keep challenging the election results despite pressure to stop .
“ A major rigging has happened , ” his website reported him as saying .
“ I am prepared to prove that those behind the rigging are responsible for the bloodshed . ”
He called on his supporters to continue “ legal ” protests and said restrictions on the opposition could lead to more violence .
A statement by G8 foreign ministers , to be published on Friday , will “ deplore the post- election violence ” and “ urge Iran to respect fundamental rights , including freedom of expression , ” according to the diplomat who had seen a draft .
The statement will include a message that “ the crisis should be settled through democratic dialogue and peaceful means , ” the diplomat told Reuters .

Raw : Canada releases video of night attack on Somali pirates who were trying to hijack a Norwegian cargo ship .
Canadian sailors apprehended a band of Somali pirates at gunpoint early yesterday morning after a seven - hour pursuit across the Gulf of Aden , much of it under the cover of night .
HMCS Winnipeg , sailing off the Horn of Africa as part of a NATO - led anti-piracy mission , was escorting a United Nations food shipment when it happened on a skiff carrying seven bandits attempting to hijack the MV Front Ardenne , an 80,000 - tonne tanker from Norway .
The Somalis ignored warning shots fired by a Canadian naval helicopter and fled the scene .
HMCS Winnipeg , led by Commander Craig Baines , left the food shipment to other NATO vessels and gave chase .
An American ship also joined the pursuit .
It was the Canadians who got to the pirates first .
As darkness fell , Cdr. Baines cut the lights and caught up with the smaller vessel by stealth .
After firing another flurry of warning shots , sailors boarded the pirate craft , recovering a rocket - propelled grenade round .
" We blocked their path , " Michael McWhinnie , a spokesman for HMCS Winnipeg , told the Reuters news agency .
" We were faster and surprisingly more manoeuvrable than the pirate skiff .
" Prime Minister Stephen Harper praised HMCS Winnipeg 's 240 crew members , who were sent to the Gulf of Aden earlier this month to join a patrol of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that includes ships from Portugal , the Netherlands , Spain and the U.S.Still , Mr. Harper was forced to confront what is emerging as a significant weakness in the international effort to combat piracy off Somalia , a lawless country that lacks a governing authority strong enough to crack down on its growing number of the seafaring gangs .
The NATO patrol saved the Norwegian tanker from capture and robbed a gang of bandits of weapons , most of which the pirates tossed into the sea while being chased .
But after all that , the Somalis were released .
The Canadian sailors , like their NATO allies , lack the authority to make arrests in international waters .
" We did briefly detain pirates and disarm them , " Mr. Harper told reporters after concluding a summit with leaders from the Americas in Port of Spain , Trinidad and Tobago .
" Those were the appropriate measures under the circumstances .
" Asked whether Canada might take a more aggressive role and even fire on pirates ' crafts , Mr. Harper said , " We use force when necessary , but only when necessary .
" HMCS Winnipeg is one of about 20 warships deployed by members of NATO , the European Union and big exporting nations such as China and India to patrol the Gulf of Aden , one of the world 's busiest trade routes .
In 2008 , there were 111 pirate attacks off the coast of Somalia , triple the number during the previous year , according to the International Maritime Bureau , a London - based organization that attempts to combat crime on the seas .
Pirates captured 42 of those vessels , including a Saudi supertanker called the Sirius Star and the MV Faina , a Ukrainian ship carrying tanks .
The international armada has had some success in repelling more and more gangs of gun-and - grenade wielding marauders .
Before the weekend , there had been 68 attempts this year , but only 18 captures , often of smaller vessels .
Still , there 's little sign the pirates are close to letting up .
Many of them are poor fishermen and young unemployed men who have seen their brazenness rewarded with tens of millions of dollars in ransom payments , Hours before HMCS Winnipeg set off on its chase , the Belgian government confirmed that a 1,850 - tonne dredger from that country called the Pompei and the ship 's 10 crew members had been taken by bandits .
Also on Saturday , Dutch marines foiled a short - lived hijacking of a Greek - owned tanker , saving about 20 seamen from being added to a hostage list that currently is in excess of 300 people , according to a count by the Associated Press .
Like Canada 's sailors , the Dutch were forced to release their captives .
The Canadian and the Dutch sailors , for example , are permitted to detain pirates only if they attack Canadian and Dutch citizens or property .
Otherwise , they must disarm them and set them free .
" There have been a lot of comments in the media about how much easier it was a couple hundred years ago , when we could just hang them from the yard arm , " Canadian Rear Admiral Bob Davidson said in an interview with CTV's Question Period yesterday .
" There 's the rule of law that needs to be applied , so we 're not currently regularly detaining them , no .
There are all kinds of challenges with that . "
Bob Graham just appeared on WNYC's Brian Lehrer Show .
In addition to repeating earlier reports that he was never briefed on waterboarding , Graham revealed that the first time he asked the CIA when he was briefed on torture , it claimed it had briefed him on two dates when no briefing took place .
I did n't get Graham 's exact quotes ( and the quotes below are rough approximations ) , but when asked to respond to Philip Zelikow 's assertion that members of Congress from both parties had been briefed on this program , Graham said that when he asked the CIA when he had been briefed on the program , the CIA gave him the dates of four briefings , two in April 2002 and two in September 2002 , when they claimed they had briefed him about the program .
But after Graham consulted his own records , he pointed out that on two of those dates , he had not attended any briefing .
After Graham pointed this out to the CIA , they conceded their own dates were incorrect .
Graham then went on to repeat his claim that he had no recollection of being told about waterboarding Zubaydah or anything else about extreme interrogation .
In addition to repeating his earlier assertion that he would have remembered something that dramatic , Graham contextualized the briefing the CIA gave him -- which occurred right in the middle of Graham 's complaints about the inaccuracy of the Iraq NIE ( the briefing on September 27 , 2002 would have shown up just a few days after the British released a White Paper on September 24 , 2002 that publicized for the first time the yellocake claim ) .
I know Obama do n't like this , just as I heard Joe Lieberman state , " Who cares about this , it is the past . "
Well , many Americans do care about this and it has been this reckless behavior of the Bush Administration that put this country in the predicament it is in .
In the end , whether Obama likes it or not , all memos , cia briefings , tapes , etc. , need to be put on the table and an independent counsel put together to flesh through it all .
Because there is a whole lot ofgoing on here .
