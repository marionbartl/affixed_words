HITACHI の研究所の話題が出たので、どういうことやってるのか見てみたら、音声合成のデモがあった。
！！！ これはスゴイ！ 真ん中らへんにリンクがあるので是非聞いてください。久々に感動したよ。ちょっと前に、わりと簡単に手に入れられるサンプルを聞いて、日本語はこのくらいなのかとがっかりしていたが、HITACHI のサンプルを聞いた感じだとこれはそのまま実用化できるんじゃないのかと思ってしまう。あとは、実行時間とか、未知語をどうするかとか気になる。そもそも、手法それ自体よくわからないし。これだけきれいに発音できるんだと、フレーズ単位でデータがあるんだろうか。どうなんだろうか。さっぱり分からない。
追記
とりあえず音声合成の基礎を勉強してからものいえと怒られました。すいません。
大学関連だとこのへんのデモ。デモを聞くとスゴイと思うが、「（注）ピッチは自然音声から抽出したものを用いている．」の一文が気になる。下の自由に合成できるデモで遊んでみると、前のデモの通りにイントネーションが再現されず、不自然な感じ。イントネーションを正しく推定するのが大事なのかなぁというのが感想。
The two players who were involved in the scandal at the World Open in Philadelphia last month , where the total prizes were $ 358,000 , are named by the New York Times .
One player , Steve Rosenberg , was expelled , the other , Eugene Varshavsky , was allowed to finish the tournament but was searched before each round , then watched closely during the games .
Varshavsky was one of the lowest - ranked players in the main tournament , but he started off by beating two high - ranked masters in his first three games .
After that he beat FM John Bartholomew , rated 2452 , with the black pieces , then lost to GM Giorgi Kacheishvili , 2643 , and went on to defeat GM Ilia Smirin , 2659 , again with the black pieces , in a virutally flawless game .
GM Larry Christiansen , who did not play at the world Open , ran the moves through the program Shredder and found that the last 25 moves matched those played by the program .
[ You can replay the two wins , against Bartholomew and Smirin , on our JavaScript board using the link given below . ]
Bill Goichberg , the director of the World Open , asked to see Varshavsky before the next round , at which stage the player hurried off to the bathroom .
Goichberg waited ten minutes outside a stall until he came out .
Varshavsky consented to be searched , but no electronic device was found .
So he was allowed to proceed in the tournament .
When a couple of tournament directors went to search the bathroom stall later on they found it occupied .
They waited 45 minutes before a director peeked under the door and saw Varshavsky ’s shoes .
After Varshavsky left the stall , nothing was found in it .
In the last two rounds , Varshavsky played against two grandmasters and lost each game quickly .
The Phonito wireless receiver
In the second case Steve Rosenberg , playing in a lower section , was leading before the final round .
A victory would have been worth about $ 18,000 .
Before the round began a tournament director noticed that Rosenberg was wearing something in his ear and asked to see it .
Rosenberg told the director it was a hearing aid , but the director wrote down the name and the serial number of the device and looked it up on the Internet .
It turned out to be a " Phonito " , a wireless receiver used for undetected communication between two people .
Part of the paraphernalia of the device was additional equipment that had to be worn elsewhere on the body to boost and receive signals .
Rosenberg was wearing a heavy sweater and declined to be searched .
World Open director Goichberg said the discovery of the device did not prove that Rosenberg had cheated , but he felt he had no choice but to remove him from the tournament .
Goichberg said that the incidents were troubling because of the players ’ stealth and effectiveness .
In the future he planned to take countermeasures to try to catch people who might be using hidden electronic devices but he would not be specific for fear of tipping his hand .
Amongst the signals that organisers had to look for were sequences of moves that are different from what a player would do , error - free play and , as in the case of Varshavsky , if a player shows a sudden dramatic improvement in strength over a short period of time , something that is rare among adult players .

Chocolate Raspberry Smoothie Recipe
Gasoline price is influenced by 5 things :
1 ) crude oil prices .
Only Saudi Arabia could really manipulate crude prices downwards for any length of time ( by boosting production ) .
They no longer have the necessary spare capacity , and thus today , no one can move the oil prices downwards meaningfully .
2 ) refining margin .
That 's the price for gasoline as quoted on markets like NYMEX in the USA .
It depends on supply and demand on the gasoline market .
That price has been extremely low for most of the late 80s and all of the 90s , as spare refining capacity made competition very fierce .
Refining spare capacity is now much lower , which means that prices tend to go up but not down unless you have brutal shifts in the underlying market .
In addition , there are still too many independants and export refiners ( esp. Venezuela ) to manipulate the NYMEX for more than a couple of weeks or more than a few % .
3 ) distribution and marketing markups .
There are mostly fixed and linked to technical factors .
4 ) taxes
Also mostly fixed , with some variations acroos the country .
5 ) Dealer markup
The margin of the local pumping station .
It can vary with local competition , but most dealers are independant and do n't get too much interference from their big oil masters .
And many are truly independant .
In most cases , margins are razor thin and these gas stations make most of their income on ancillary sales ( snacks , cigarettes and the like )
So that 's the chain .
Now on to the market phenomena over the summer .
I 'll be quoting - and explaining this lengthy comment which HiD buried in my last diary .
sorry but there is a non conspiracy explanation .
Gasoline has a very seasonal price variation compared to crude .
The nadir is winter when demand is low and gas is produced as a byproduct to heating oil at the margin .
The surplus gets tanked by trader types like I used to be .
In order to get us to take it , the price has to drift low enough that you can hedge against May futures without going too far in the hole .
Basically , in winter , you can sell gasoline at the price you can sell it ( via the futures markets ) for delivery in May , when demand picks up , minus the storage costs , the technical losses and the cost of financing the fact that a lot of money is stuck in these tanks for 6 months .
Go look at NYMEX forward futures prices .
The May / May 07 futures crack ( mogas - WTI ) is $ 15 / bbl which is about what we had last year .
This is huge compared to the 90's when refining was in glut worldwide .
Typical spring levels were $ 6 - 8 , winter $ 3ish IIRC .
The price for gasoline to be delivered in May 2007 is currently in line with what it was in May 2006 .
HiD notes , as I pointed out above , that refining margins ( " crack " ) are currently much higher than they were for most of the last 20 years , but that 's been the case for a couple of years now .
there are no real hedgers to speak of on gasoline so any buyer out that far is speculating .
period .
End users on gasoline are regular folk who just do n't have the means or motive to hedge .
On diesel / jet you have trucking co's and airlines that buy forward .
This means that no one buys gasoline in advance on the markets .
That happens for diesel and kerosene ( truck fleets and airlines can hedge their future prices and thus buy their fuel needs in advance ) , but not for gasoline .
which means that there is no " natural " demand for gasoline in the futures market , and thus the only buyers of gasoline futures are speculators .
After the spring peak , prices stay up as demand exceeds refinery production and the stocks built up are worked off .
Prices usually stay up until middlemen lose the fear that supply could run short on them .
This is why the EIA stats each week make the market jump .
Typically mogas stocks drift down from 230 - 240 million bbls to 190 million .
Below 190 , people get panicky and the market stays bid up .
Demand is cyclical , more so than production ( refineries cannot change their production runs completely ) .
So stocks build up in the winter , and drfit down in the summer , when demand is higher .
As supply is thus constituted of actual production plus stock drawdowns , the leve lof stocks is an important variable in the price setting mechanism .
Above 200 Million in late August and STILL building is a problem for a speculator .
Come August 31 your Sept futures are going to go wet .
your choices are - take wet bbls or
- roll into Oct ( a dead period )
- sell With no hurricane looming to make you a bundle , you have a tough choice to make .
What this means is that if you have committed to buy gasoline in September , and stocks are quite high , you can see a very real risk that , unless something unexpected happens to push prices up ( a hurricane of a refinery accident , for instance ) , you are going to take a loss .
Your 3 options are to :
bet the farm and buy expensive gasoline
delay the reckoning and convert your position into October , which is evne more speculative as underlying demand is even weaker ( and possibly already at some cost today )
take your losses and be done with it
If you are a middleman wholesaler , a retailer or a wet oil speculator , you have a similar problem .
Come Sept , the system gets flushed of low RVP summer grades .
This is n't as big a problem as in spring , but player tend to sell down their stocks to facilitate the spec swing .
This is why most years you see a dip in Sept on prices .
An additional factor in the market is that September is the period when refineries switch from summer blends to winter blends ( different technical requirements in terms of vaporisation to better adapt to average temperatures ) , and they have to get rid of their stocks of summer stuff , thus creating a glut in supply in the market .
this year the speculators have stepped into a buzz saw .
Based on 2005 with Katrina making prices bounce off the moon , placing a bet came dear .
You had to pay up to buy mogas cracks .
Meanwhile , most any player in the wet system held a little extra " just in case " .
Hurricane season was expected to be robust .
Last year , the Sepotember situation was completely different because of the Hurricanes .
A bug chunk of the supply unexpectedly disappeared from the market , thus creating a big gain for those that held paper rights to buy gasoline at a previously agreed cheap price .
What actually happened ? - no hurricanes .
- refiners ran hard to catch the high margins
- stocks stayed high .
- no major refinery fire / disruptions ( I guess BP can only wangle one major fuckup per year )
- Import volumes stayed way up
- Demand was up , but less than anticipated .
Come August , the speculators just could n't hold on much longer and started to sell .
If you remember , the hurricane forcast was revised downward sharply about then ...
Basically , a lot of people bet that this summer would see the same problems as last year ( which was not a completely stupid bet ) .
That sustained demand ( from speculators ) and prices .
But the underlying market was less favorable ( a bit more production from refiners , a bit less demand than expected ) , and the hurricanes speculators were betting on to give value to their virtual gasoline did not materialise , thus forcing them to sell their gasoline buying rights ( in order not to have to take actual delivery , which involves a whole other kind of infrastructure and cost if you 're not a physical player in the market )
At the end of August the selling turned into a rout .
Mogas cracks the first week of Sept hit $ 2ish if you believe the prints .
They 've since rebounded to $ 5 ish .
Financial speculators panicked , sold out , and drove price down massively .
So believe what you will , but there 's no way big oil can coordinate a selling panic .
They do n't have the excess stocks to do it , nor the control of the Merc .
The market is deep enough that such massive selloffs cannot be provoked without a real underlying reason .
OPEC is clearly keeping production up trying to get crude prices down .
They 've been giving the market all it wanted all year hence the contango , but going into the lowest demand period , fall , they usually trim production .
Now perhaps Saudi want Bush back in ( ask Hugo Chavez and Iran about that ) .
But they 've been clear they want crude more like $ 50 than $ 70 to forstall conservation .
Perhaps it 's a lucky bit of serendipity .
Ca n't say .
Now getting back to the oil market , HiD notes that producers cranked up volumes as much as they could this year , to keep prices down somewhat - and it worked , in that there is " contango " , i.e. spot prices are higher than prices for futures , which means that there is a temporary glut in the market which drives prices temporarily lower than what the market expects them to be in the future .
As HiD notes , producers like Saudi Arabia ( if not Venezuela ) are wary of too high prices that would encourage alternatives to be developed or worse , conservation , and they are keen to supply all they can to keep prices down .
But on mogas , big oil is not in the drivers seat .
Imports , wall street , other traders rule the NYMEX roost .
The NYMEX is the key to gasoline pricing in the US east of the Rockies .
Perhaps big oil could accelerate the rate the price drop hits the pump .
that 's about it .
Back to gasoline : it 's not the oil market players that rule the gasoline market .
I hope that this shows clearly enough that there are very real market reasons for the current price drop .
To simplify things further : speculators bet that there would be problems during the summer , and bought gasoline paper .
That drove prices up during the summer .
When it appeared that the problems did not materialise and there was excess gasoline ( real or paper ) in September , the speculators had to fold , and sell at a big loss .
But that 's the point of speculation : you bet on uncertain events .
This one was not an unreasonable bet in view of last years events , but it did not work out .
What this is n't is market manipulation by Bigoil .

State of War : The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration by James Risen Free Press , 240 pp. , $ 26.00
###1 .
The challenges posed to American democracy by secrecy and by unchecked presidential power are the two great themes running through the history of the Iraq war .
How long the war will last , who will “ win , ” and what it will do to the political landscape of the Middle East will not be obvious for years to come , but the answers to those questions cannot alter the character of what happened at the outset .
Put plainly , the President decided to attack Iraq , he brushed caution and objection aside , and Congress , the press , and the people , with very few exceptions , stepped back out of the way and let him do it .
Explaining this fact is not going to be easy .
Commentators often now refer to President Bush ’s decision to invade Iraq as “ a war of choice , ” which means that it was not provoked .
The usual word for an unprovoked attack is aggression .
Why did Americans — elected representatives and plain citizens alike — accede so readily to this act of aggression , and why did they question the President ’s arguments for war so feebly ?
The whole business is painfully awkward to consider , but it will not go away .
If the Constitution forbids a president anything it forbids war on his say - so , and if it insists on anything it insists that presidents are not above the law .
In plain terms this means that presidents cannot enact laws on their own , or ignore laws that have been enacted by Congress .
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act of 1978 is such a law ; it was enacted to end years of routine wiretapping of American citizens who had attracted official attention by opposing the war in Vietnam .
The express purpose of the act was to limit what presidents could ask intelligence organizations to do .
But for limits on presidential power to have meaning Congress and the courts must have the fortitude to say no when they think no is the answer .
In public life as in kindergarten , the all - important word is no .
We are living with the consequences of the inability to say no to the President ’s war of choice with Iraq , and we shall soon see how the Congress and the courts will respond to the latest challenge from the White House — the claim by President Bush that he has the right to ignore FISA ’s prohibition of government intrusion on the private communications of Americans without a court order , and his repeated statements that he intends to go right on doing it .
Nobody was supposed to know that FISA had been brushed aside .
The fact that the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , America ’s largest intelligence organization , had been turned loose to intercept the faxes , e-mails , and phone conversations of Americans with blanket permission by the President remained secret until the New York Times reporters James Risen and Eric Lichtblau learned over a year ago that it was happening .
An early version of the story was apparently submitted to the Times ’ editors in October 2004 , when it might have affected the outcome of …
Serious disagreement has broken out among scientists over a United Nations climate report 's contention that the world 's greatest wilderness - Antarctica - will be largely unaffected by rising world temperatures .
The report , to be published on Friday , will be one of the most comprehensive on climate change to date , and will paint a grim picture of future changes to the planet 's weather patterns .
Details of the report were first revealed by The Observer last weekend .
However , many researchers believe it does not go far enough .
In particular , they say it fails to stress that climate change is already having a severe impact on the continent and will continue to do so for the rest of century .
At least a quarter of the sea ice around Antarctica will disappear in that time , say the critics , though this forecast is not mentioned in the study .
One expert denounced the report - by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , or IPCC - as ' misleading ' .
Another accused the panel of ' failing to give the right impression ' about the impact that rising levels of carbon dioxide will have on Antarctica .
Antarctica possesses the Earth 's greatest mass of ice and acts as an engine that drives the globe 's weather systems .
Disturbances to Antarctica could have wide repercussions .
If all its ice were to melt , sea levels round the world would rise by 70 metres .
The fate of that continent crucially affects the fate of the planet , and according to scientists at the British Antarctic Survey it is already being affected by global warming .
' The greatest temperature rise on Earth over the past five decades has been found on the Antarctic peninsula , which stretches north from the continent towards South America , ' said Dr John Turner .
' Temperatures have risen 5C on the peninsula . '
That figure is 10 times the average global temperature rise for the same period .
In addition , researchers reported last October that in just over a month , an entire Antarctic ice shelf , bigger than Gloucestershire , had disintegrated and disappeared , with its loss directly linked to man-made global warming .
Yet there is no mention of these events in the draft version of the panel 's report obtained by this newspaper .
It paints a broad picture of how carbon emissions will alter global temperatures , which will rise by between 3C to 5C by the end of the century , triggering storms of increasing severity , the acidification of seas and the spreading of deserts .
But when it comes to certain types of climate change , especially those concerned with Antarctica , the report is fairly coy .
' Current global studies project the Antarctic ice sheet will remain too cold for widespread surface melting and is expected to gain in mass due to increased snowfall , ' states the draft version of the report .
But this vision is disputed .
Last year , Dr Turner and colleagues , using records returned by Russian research balloons that were flown over the whole of Antarctica between 1971 and 2003 , discovered that temperatures in the lowest level of the atmosphere over the continent have already risen by about 0.7C .
Their paper , in Science , was published in March , too late for inclusion in the IPCC 's deliberation .
Other factors - including the expected disappearance of the Antarctic ozone hole , which has had a cooling effect on the continent - will lead to a further rise of 5C - 6C over parts of the continent over the rest of the century .
Critics point out that the IPCC is a conservative body whose documents are a co-operative effort , with contributions from hundreds of scientists .
Only points that are considered indisputable by all of them are included .
This consensus deflects potential accusations that the body might be exaggerating the threat to the planet .
But the critics say it also means its documents tend to err too much on the side of caution .
' From what I hear of the report , it seems misleading to suggest nothing much is going to happen to the Antarctic over the coming decades , ' said Dr Chris Rapley , director of the British Antarctic Survey .
' Some parts of the continents are already losing substantial amounts of ice and others will in future - and that will have direct consequences for the rest of the planet . '
David Astor memorial lecture
David Astor was this newspaper 's editor for 27 years from 1948 to 1975 .
Ever a campaigner , he fought for an end to apartheid , the abolition of the death penalty - and for a greater awareness of our environment .
With this in mind , The Observer has joined forces with his daughter , Lucy , to stage the first in an annual David Astor Memorial Lecture series .
Klaus Toepfer , the outgoing under - secretary general and executive director of the United Nations Environmental Programme ( UNEP ) , will ask , ' How can democracy and liberal values survive in a world of finite and diminishing resources ? '

What is a confessing Sam ?
Asked by Casey Filocamo of Edmonton , Alberta
" Confessing Sam " is the term in criminal psychology for a person who makes a false confession after a particularly widely publicised crime has taken place .
Some Confessing Sams will admit to just one infamous crime reported in the media .
Others will confess to every infamous crime .
Confessing Sams will often continue to maintain their guilt long after police rule them out as suspects .
The first genuine Confessing Sam was Robert Hubert .
In 1666 , the Great Fire of London destroyed 80 per cent of the city .
Hubert confessed to having started the fire by throwing a crude fire grenade through an open bakery window .
At his trial it was proven that Hubert , a sailor , had not arrived in England until two days after the fire started , was never near the bakery where the fire started , and was so badly crippled that throwing anything was beyond him .
If that were not enough , the bakery had no windows .
Nevertheless , as a foreigner , a Frenchman , and a Catholic , Hubert was a perfect scapegoat .
Ever maintaining his guilt , Hubert was brought to trial , found guilty , and duly executed by hanging .
The extremes to which some Confessing Sams will go is illustrated by John Hart .
In the 1920s , Hart confessed to the Jack the Ripper murders in late nineteenth century London .
Although it was pointed out that Hart was only three years old at the time of the first murder , this did not shake his story .
He maintained he was Jack the Ripper for the rest of his life .
More than 50 people confessed to having committed the famous and still unsolved Black Dahlia murder in Los Angeles in 1947 .
None was ever charged .
At least six people have confessed to being the Zodiac Killer .
The Zodiac Killer terrorised San Francisco on a murderous rampage beginning in 1968 .
One of the confessants is a woman - a " Confessing Samantha " .
The case is still unsolved .
At last count , 20 individuals have confessed to the 1996 murder of child beauty queen Jon Benet Ramsey .
Why does someone become a Confessing Sam ?
According to forensic psychiatrists , Drs Peter Quintieri of the School of Medicine at Duke University and Kenneth Weiss of the University of Medicine and Dentisty of New Jersey , writing in the Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and Law in 2005 , there are many reasons why someone will give a non-coerced false confession : mental illness , mental retardation , attention - seeking , publicity - seeking , or a combination of these .
Often a psychiatric disorder , one involving severe guilt feelings completely unrelated to the crime at hand , may provide the motivation .
Researchers ironically note that it is often just as difficult to know whether or not someone is telling the truth when they plead against themselves as when they plead for themselves .
Dr S M Kassin and two colleagues from the Department of Psychology at Williams College in Massachusetts report in the April , 2005 Law and Human Behaviour that when college students and police investigators judged 10 prison inmates confessing to crimes ( half the confessions were true , half were false as they were concocted for the study ) , the students were more accurate than the police in determining who told the truth .

The American Psychological Association seems to think so .
The APA called for a reduction in video game violence in 2005 , after reviewing research that suggested exposure to violent video games leads to increased aggressive thoughts and behavior in young people .
The APA further compared violence in video games with television violence , but noted that video games are different in that they are interactive and essentially act as learning tools by reinforcing certain behaviors .
So was the APA ’s assessment fair ?
There is research that seems to show that playing violent video games can increase aggressive thoughts and behavior , at least in the short term .
Studies have also linked playing violent video games with physiological responses such as increased heart rate .
However , a strong causal link between playing violent video games and real world violence has not yet been made .
For anyone who has played a violent video game , the idea that it can affect you on some level is not shocking .
I have my own memories of letting off stress during freshman college exams by playing the fighting game Soul Caliber II with many of the other guys in my dorm , and getting into the thrills of Grand Theft Auto with my three roommates during junior year .
While there are studies that try to make associations between exposure to violent video games and violent behavior in the real world , these do not seem to account for other factors such as family life that probably play a greater role .
Henry Jenkins , the director of comparative media studies at MIT , wrote on a PBS website that the consensus ( if any ) among researchers is that playing violent video games over the long term is merely one risk factor among more immediate real world influences such as a history of violence in the family .
A study by researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign in 2005 provided an interesting look at the long term effects of playing an online video game , Microsoft ’s Asheron ’s Call 2 .
Known as an MMORPG , or Massive Multiplayer Online Role- playing Game , Asheron ’s Call 2 includes violence in fantasy settings .
The game also involves social and cooperative interaction among players .
In the U of I study , test subjects played Asheron ’s Call 2 online for an average of 56 hours over a month .
Researchers then surveyed both the gamers and a control group of non-gamers and found that the players ’ aggression in attitude and social interaction were not different from those of the control group .
Perhaps concern regarding video game violence will eventually subside , as it generally has with books , movies , and television .
As the story lines of video games grow more diverse and complex , ranging from the day - to - day management of individual lives in The Sims to economic decision making in games like Civilization and Rollercoaster Tycoon , and even dealing with moral issues in games like Black and White and Fable , perhaps concern about their violent nature will decrease .
In fact , the latest news on video games and violence has nothing to do with gamers run amok .
A man in Putnam , Connecticut was waiting in a long line to buy the new Playstation 3 video game console when he was shot in the chest by armed thugs after refusing to hand over his money .
Now that ’s scary .

I just got finished watching Alexandra Pelosi's Friends of God documentary on HBO and was taken aback at what has become an increasing trend among American christianists .
This particular part on evangelicals and evolution ( and what they teach their children about the science of evolution ) was very disturbing .
The " secular progressive " War on Christmas has nothing on the evangelical War on Science .

Glenn Greenwald has a post on evangelical religious beliefs that ties in nicely :
Apparently Mary - Kate
Olsen lives in some alternate universe where the " homeless lumberjack " look is in .
The less - fashionable of the Olsen Twins was spotted shopping in West Hollywood wearing only a plaid button down shirt -- barely concealing her panties -- and black tights .
Oh Mary - Kate , we get that you have your own " unique " sense of style , but please at least put on some pants before leaving the house next time !
Blizzard Entertainment Company is one of leading developers in the video game industry .
Blizzard rarely publishes titles yet when they do individuals can expect them to be of the utmost quality .
That was the case with StarCraft , the Diablo series , and the Warcraft series .
Each of these titles has sold millions of copies and are some of the most famous computer games ever developed .
In November of 2004 , Blizzard Entertainment released a long awaited title , World of Warcraft , and made history by having created the most popular massive multiplayer online role - playing game to date with well over 5 million players registered .
World of Warcraft is primarily set in " Azeroth , " a mystical world full of J.R.R .
Tolkien type creatures .
In Azeroth , there are two main continents , Kalimdor and the East Kingdoms , that house a variety of races .
These races are split into two groups , the Alliance and the Horde .
The Alliance is made up of Dwarves , Elves , Humans , and Gnomes while the Horde is tribal unity of the Tauren , Undead , Troll , and Orc races .
Each have their own story and each seek control of the two continents .
In World of Warcraft , individuals must complete various missions , gain experience points by fighting high - level creatures , and may obtain prestige by engaging in warfare with the opposing team .
There are also areas of the game called " instances " where teams can enter select dungeons in hopes of obtaining rare in - game items from fierce enemies .
It may seem odd to the reader that there are economic laws that take place within the game but , as I soon will show , there are various elements within World of Warcraft that have expanded the " virtual marketplace " in comparison to other games .
World of Warcraft uses three different types of currencies : gold , silver and copper .
These are the only currencies that are legal tender though individuals may trade using almost any item in the game .
Gold , silver , and copper are the also only form of payment accepted at the in - game auction houses ; the nature of these auction houses will be elaborated in the following paragraphs .
At one point in time , gold was incredibly rare and individuals often used silver to complete transactions .
Large amounts of gold were only held by the most skilled of players and individuals who had been saving up funds since the release of the game .
Yet in time the supply of gold began to dramatically increase , and with it , the price of all goods in the game .
Hence , because of the constant increase in the quantity of gold ( e.g. , inflation ) , prices began to rise .
Though the quantity of virtual gold has increased , it is not as a consequence of any Federal Reserve or monetary authority but due to the labor of individual players .
The supply for gold has been increased by individuals called " farmers , " whose job is to kill the most " profitable " ( i.e. , will give up the most gold ) beasts and sell the virtual currency they have acquired in the real world .
If one were to look up " World of Warcraft Gold " on most online auction houses , they would find a variety of farmers selling their newly acquired in - game currency .
At the beginning of this " farming " trend the price of gold in real life online auction houses were quite high but as individuals began to enter the field , the price of United States dollars per virtual World of Warcraft gold piece dropped significantly .
This phenomenon has caused the prices of all items in the game to increase radically and , due to a rise in farming , in - game auction house prices are constantly rising .
The abundance of gold in World of Warcraft is limitless , but it must be laboriously obtained from defeating creatures ; this creates a deterrent to most individuals that rather buy virtual currency from online auction houses than take the time and farm the gold themselves .
This " farming " trend has become so popular that now families in China are using their time to farm gold for World of Warcraft players and are selling the virtual currency on Internet auctions for profit .
A variety of families have become dependent on the virtual gold market created by World of Warcraft and " farming . "
This phenomenon also can be an application of the subjective theory of value .
For instance , an individual who purchases virtual gold coins online must prefer current in - game purchasing power versus the present purchasing power of the dollar bills forgone .
Another interesting aspect of the game is how items are bought and sold .
In most games , items are sold by the actual software of the game and have set prices .
Hence , the software has a monopoly on all items in the game and can sell goods at whatever price it deems is appropriate .
In World of Warcraft , however , things are quite different .
Individual players often come across items that they either do n’t need or can not use , in which case these players go to the virtual auction houses within the game and sell their items at a certain price .
The auction houses work just like real auction houses , aside from using virtual money , but they are only specific to each team and one can not sell items at their team ’s auction house to a member of the opposing force .
The Horde and the Alliance each have their own auction houses and each of these auction houses have different price levels that are often dependent on their population size .
As populations increase on either side , so do the number of items obtained .
This increase in the quantity of items causes the price of those goods to fall at the auction houses .
So , over time , there has been a decrease in the price of most goods as a result of an increase in the amount of individuals playing and the number of items found .
Where at the release of World of Warcraft an item could have cost fifty silver coins , may now only cost a couple copper pieces .
These auction houses have allowed for prices to fall and rare items to become commonplace .
Hence , because of the profit incentives to sell items at the auction houses for competitive rates , the " standard of living " of all characters in the game has increased .
By " standard of living " I mean their ability to carry out their online tasks such as winning battles against the opposing team .
All characters have become stronger , more advanced , and tougher than ever .
There is also a " neutral " auction house in the game where an individual can sell items to all players , regardless of their allegiance .
This auction house has served to reduce the price of all goods in the game , on both teams .
Where one item may cost four gold pieces at one of the team auction houses , it may only cost a couple silver coins at the neutral auction house .
This is an incredible difference and has served to decrease the profits of those who are marking up their prices .
All items are cheaper at the neutral auction house and its mere presence has decreased in - game prices .
Though the increase in the supply of gold has caused many monetary prices to rise , the real prices of goods are falling .
In World of Warcraft , there are also elements of the division of labor and specialization .
Aside from the different races , there are various " classes " to choose from ; these classes can be compared to careers .
These classes include : Druid , Mage , Shaman , Warrior , Paladin , Priest , Hunter , Warlock , and Rogue .
Each of these classes help in different ways when trying to defeat high - leveled monsters .
They each lend benefits to their teams by using certain skills to defeat the enemies .
Some beasts are only weak to magic while some can only be killed by brute force .
Each individual in the game must choose a race and a class as well as specialize in different in - game " trades . "
These trades may be blacksmithing , weapon - smithing , gun-smithing , leather - working , skinning , tailoring , etc .
This has also caused the real prices of goods in the game to fall as well as having introduced various new items and weapon innovations .
In each of these cases , classes and trades , the division of labor has allowed increased productivity ( i.e. , the swiftness and ease of killing monsters ) as well as a rise in the " standard of living " of all players .
What is marvelous about economic science is that it can be applied to almost everything .
All human action can be analyzed through it and almost no realm is cut off from economic analysis .
As I continue my research and expand my intellectual horizons , my understandings concerning the applications of economic science broadens .
World of Warcraft may only be a game with no true connection to the real world but it is a realm built by human action ; it is a game where all individuals are free to engage in the virtual marketplace .
Throughout the game there are instances of economic laws taking place , as I have so described .
It is incorrect to believe that economic analysis can only be applied to " real world " occurrences but in fact it can be used to understand all interpersonal relationships , virtual and " real . "
World of Warcraft is just another instance were Austrian economic analysis is quite useful in understanding in - game trends and developments as well as deciphering the elements that comprise the virtual marketplace .

Is Peak Oil Pessimism a Generation of Men Coming to Realise How Useless They Are ?
In this post I want to discuss an evolving theory I have which may illuminate some and enrage others .
I have come to think that part of the reason behind the “ die-off ” perspective and the mind - set which thinks that Western civilisation is doomed because humanity is basically selfish and foolish , and that it is too late for humanity to do anything on the necessary scale is in fact that a generation of men are coming to realise on some level that they are almost entirely unequipped to face the challenge that peak oil creates .
One of the main impacts of the Age of Cheap Oil , the great Petroleum Party so rapidly drawing to a close , has been the monumental deskilling that has gone on during that time .
A friend of mine recently told me of a friend of his 14 year old son , who had grown up eating sliced bread , and was unable to actually cut a slice of bread from a loaf !
How many people now know how to cook , garden , build , repair , mend , pickle , prune or scythe ?
In the space of two generations , we have lost so much basic knowledge and skills that previous generations learnt by osmosis without even thinking about it .
Over the last few weeks I have been doing oral history interviews with older people in and around Totnes of their memories of the 30s , 40s and 50s .
They remember working with horses on the farms , raising children with gas lamps , candles , home grown vegetables and home made clothes .
This is less than 2 generations ago .
What emerges is an innate sense , in the generation that made it through World War Two , of what constitutes * enough * , of an instinctive sense of self - reliance and an almost universal ability to turn one ’s hand to anything .
A couple of years ago I went to London to a peak oil conference , and the evening before it I went to the pre-event social .
I was struck by the fact that everyone there ( with one exception ) was male , aged 25 - 40 , and , as far as I could tell , worked in IT .
They were all very pleasant , intelligent , well read on the whole peak oil issue , and as able as anyone to argue that the peak is imminent and we need to act .
There were however , almost no women , no gardeners , no builders , no foresters in the room , nor at the subsequent conference as far as I can tell .
Writers such as Shepherd Bliss and Carolyn Baker have questioned why it is that women are less prominent in the peak oil community .
I have a nagging suspicion that it is because what we are seeing is , in part , a generation of men awakening to the fact that they are completely ill - prepared for life beyond oil .
Almost all of the peak oil writers , and the vast majority of peak oil website writers and bloggers , are men .
When I have organised peak oil - related events , finding female speakers on the subject is very tricky .
From the oral history interviews I have been doing , I have seen how older men are less concerned about “ going back ” to the kind of lifestyles of the 40s and 50s because they still remember how to do things .
They often say “ well it ’s not a problem , I still know how to do all that stuff ” .
Something happened around the 1960s and the passing - on of that knowledge just stopped .
Perhaps mens ’ natural instinct is to protect and to provide , and at a time when we feel on some level the need to be doing so again , we are realising that our education has left us completely incapable of doing either .
The oil - based economic system has basically said “ do n’t worry about that , we ’ll take care of that for you ” for that last 50 years , but that system is now starting to look very shaky , and we realise we have been taught the wrong skills .
The skills one needs to work in the service industry , in sales , in IT , in the insurance industry , in a call centre , are of very little use when one starts thinking about what might follow that in a more localised near - future .
What those of 2 generations ago had that we have lost was a practical attitude .
They knew how to use the various tools around them , and had a confidence that they could turn their hands to most things .
They had the core skills they would need to get through most challenges .
Dig for Victory was possible because most people still knew how to garden .
I think that panic and woe is a natural first response to peak oil .
In my recent interview with Richard Heinberg he discussed the different stages of peak oil awareness .
*” Probably the typical stages of grief , denial , anger and all that and very often an obsession with the facts themselves and trying to become knowledgeable about those facts , internalise the information and then verify the information so they can be sure of this .
After all , they are probably in the process of reorienting their lives and their priorities and they may be trying to convince their friends and family about this and they need to have better information and get all the facts straight so they can do that ” *.
I would add to this that what often follows that is a realisation that we have lost the skills to adequately respond .
In running the recent Transition Town Totnes Open Space days , I have seen that one of the most powerful things about them is that people get to meet and chat with other people who have the skills they are realising that they need .
I came away from the food day with a great sense of hope , there are lots of knowledgable people around here , there are the skills to tap into .
I ’m a 38 year old male .
I know how to grow food .
I can build walls , plaster , make compost , plant trees , design , cook , make jam and chutney , make turf roofs and chop wood .
I ’m hopeless with electrics .
I ’m not a great carpenter , and I have no clue about fixing machines of any kind .
Yet having learnt to do the things I can do , I feel confident that I could turn my hand to most things .
Almost as importantly , I am starting to find the people around me who could teach me thing things I need to learn .
Although you may disagree with the theory I have set out above , I have found it an interesting way of looking at where the numbing sense of peak oil catastrophism comes from .
It is , in the main , a theory most felt and promoted by men .
My feeling is that it represents a stage in evolving peak oil awareness , and is rooted in a dawning sense of horror at ones personal inadequacy in terms of skills and personal resources .
My hope is that , within and beyond the peak oil movement , this sense of despair and futility can be harnessed by the acquiring of skills and local networking and turned into a catalyst for the relearning of a wide range of skills .
In Transition Town Totnes we are doing our part by planning a series of workshops for the next programme called “ The Great Reskilling ” , which contains , among other things , workshops on sock darning and on edible container gardening .
Succumbing to peak oil die - off despair gets us nowhere , unless we can use it as a spur to action and to reskilling .

Hurricanes
PBS Airdate : January 25 , 2005
ROBERT KRULWICH :
I wonder if I could have a hurricane , just a small one please .
Thank you .
Now , the thing about hurricanes is , if there 's one in the neighborhood and you are , say , over here , the first thing you want to know is : " Is it coming at me ? "
Because , if you 're in its path , you 're going to want to leave .
Thank you .
But over the years , scientists have gotten pretty good at predicting the direction of a hurricanes but not so good at predicting a hurricane 's intensity .
Hurricanes ... I 'll need one again .
Hurricanes , because of changes in terrain and in water temperature , and all kinds of things down below , can suddenly swell and then diminish and then swell again .
And because scientists do n't have the tools to read hurricanes that well , these changes are very , very hard to predict — until recently ...
Thank you .
...' cause now there 's a new development , a kind of CAT scan for hurricanes .
As our correspondent Peter Standring reports , predicting a hurricane 's power may now get a little easier .
PETER STANDRING ( scienceNOW Correspondent ) :
When most people think of New Orleans , they think of the French Quarter , Mardi Gras , jazz , gumbo .
But according to federal officials one of the most dire threats facing the nation would be a massive hurricane striking New Orleans .
They say that if a major storm had a direct hit here , the effect would be devastating .
They 're talking perhaps as many as 50,000 dead , up to a million homeless and a city under water .
And that disaster nearly happened this past hurricane season .
When hurricane Ivan barreled into the Gulf of Mexico , it was on a collision course with New Orleans , a city with a unique vulnerability to hurricanes .
RAY NAGIN ( Mayor , New Orleans , Lousiana ) :
This is a very dangerous storm .
Hurricane Ivan is approaching us .
PETER STANDRING :
Fearing the worst , the mayor called for an evacuation of the city .
MAN : I 've been through a couple of hurricanes but this one looks like a monster .
I 'm hoping it does n't hit us directly .
PETER STANDRING : Luckily for New Orleans , Ivan veered east at the eleventh hour , and the Big Easy dodged a bullet .
To get a sense of the damage a hurricane like Ivan would have caused if it made a direct hit on the city of New Orleans , I met with emergency manager , Walter Maestri .
What have we got here ?
WALTER MAESTRI :
Well , this is a surveyor 's rod .
And this can extend up to 25 feet , and it shows us just how deep the water would be here if Ivan came through .
PETER STANDRING :
And you 're getting pretty high there , Walter .
WALTER MAESTRI : Notice we 're probably about the second level , right ?
There we go now .
Watch .
We 're getting close .
We 're there .
PETER STANDRING :
What are we at ?
WALTER MAESTRI :
Twenty two feet is what they tell us could be right here in the French Quarter .
PETER STANDRING :
You 're saying that this street , French Quarter , under 22 feet of water ?
WALTER MAESTRI : If Ivan made that direct hit , this is what we'd be looking at .
We 're swimming here .
We 're like fish , if we 're alive .
PETER STANDRING :
Not good .
WALTER MAESTRI : Not good .
PETER STANDRING : Just 50 miles from Gulf of Mexico , New Orleans is at such great risk because most of the city lies below sea level .
Settled in 1718 , it 's sandwiched between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain .
IVOR VAN HEERDEN ( Louisiana State University ) : New Orleans was built on a swamp .
And in order to build it , they had to put a wall , a levee , around the swamp , and then pump all the water out .
As you pump the water out , you allow oxygen to then get into the soils , the oxygen breaks down the organic matter in the soils and they lose bulk and they sink .
PETER STANDRING :
To keep the river and lake from flooding this ever - deepening bowl , which is more than 12 feet below sea level in some places , hundreds of miles of giant levees like this one now surround New Orleans .
To get rid of rainwater that collects in the bowl , 22 pump stations were installed throughout the city .
These pumps are so powerful that they can suck up 29 billion gallons of water a day from the city and push it all back into the lake .
Now , that 's enough water to fill the stadium here in New Orleans , the Superdome , in about 35 minutes .
But in a strong hurricane , these pumps would be overwhelmed and the very same levees that protect New Orleans from floods could be its demise .
Hurricanes are whirling dynamos , generating enormous winds .
These winds create a gigantic swell of water called a storm surge .
And in New Orleans , a storm surge could deliver a fatal one - two punch .
Approaching from the Gulf of Mexico , the storm surge would push water into Lake Pontchartrain and up the Mississippi River .
As the water level rises , it would overflow the levees on the lake , inundating the city from the north .
A strong enough hurricane would push water over the higher levees along the Mississippi River , flooding the city from the south .
In this doomsday scenario , levees intended to keep water out trap it inside New Orleans .
WALTER MAESTRI :
If that bowl fills up , we have no way , necessarily , to get that water out of here ; in essence , Lake Pontchartrain , which surrounds us , is transferred and becomes Lake New Orleans .
PETER STANDRING :
If anything , the situation is getting even more dangerous .
That 's because wetlands that provide a natural defense against storm surges are disappearing .
To see how , University of New Orleans geologist Shea Penland takes me for a swamp buggy ride into the bayous just a few miles south of the city .
Here , between New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico , is the largest area of coastal wetlands anywhere in the United States .
So , Shea , why did we stop here ?
SHEA PENLAND ( University of New Orleans ) :
We stopped here because this is an area that was solid land 50 years ago and today is open water .
PETER STANDRING :
Healthy wetlands weaken a hurricane by starving it of warm ocean water , its fuel .
But in the last 70 years , nearly 2,000 square miles of this protective buffer have eroded due to manmade and natural causes .
What does all this land loss mean to the city of New Orleans ?
SHEA PENLAND :
The wetlands are our natural speed bump ; they 're our first line of defense .
We have a slow disaster that 's kind of eating its way towards the city , and all of a sudden , here comes the hurricane .
And that major hurricane could be the one on the right track , the right trajectory that puts the storm right down in the city , people can't get out , and we have the ten thousand , twenty thousand , thirty thousand dead .
And that 's the worst case scenario ; that 's what we 're gambling with right now .
PETER STANDRING :
With so many lives at risk , accurately predicting these killer storms is a high stakes endeavor .
JEFFREY HALVERSON ( NASA Goddard Space Flight Center ) : Forecasters do walk a tightrope when they make forecasts for landfall .
You do n't want to give people the wrong impression about every storm .
You move them harmlessly out of the way and nothing hits , it is a cry wolf kind of syndrome .
PETER STANDRING : ... just what happened in the wake of hurricane Ivan .
With Ivan closing in on New Orleans , more than 600,000 people evacuated the city .
New Orleans shut down .
The storm veered off course , but the question remains : when another storm threatens the Louisiana coast , will people evacuate a second time ?
In recent years , forecasting the track of a hurricane has improved dramatically , but predicting its intensity , how strong it will be when it hits land , is still a difficult challenge .
MARSHALL SHEPHERD :
If you just grab your glasses there and I 'll give you a test drive .
PETER STANDRING :
We 're going to dive on into the storm ?
MARSHALL SHEPHERD :
We are going to fly into the storm .
PETER STANDRING : NASA is using satellites to understand hurricanes both inside and out .
MARSHALL SHEPHERD :
Twenty , thirty years ago , when we used a conventional view of a storm , we could really only see the cloud top .
We could see how big the storm was , we could see the white mass which represented the clouds , and that was valuable , but that 's all we could see .
We were just touching the hood of the car .
Now we can pop the hood and look inside the storm .
PETER STANDRING :
To do that , they 're using a satellite equipped with weather radar , the only one of its kind .
Much the way a CAT scan provides a three - dimensional picture of internal organs , the satellite 's radar is producing stunning pictures of a hurricane 's internal structure .
And these unique images reveal something unexpected : extremely violent thunderstorms , called hot towers — seen here in red .
These storms - within - a - storm can reach more than 10 miles into the sky .
MARSHALL SHEPHERD :
When we see these hot towers , we think that they are giving us a clue that the storm is releasing a lot of energy , and it 's firing on all cylinders if you will .
And that may be a sign that the storm is about to undergo intensification processes .
PETER STANDRING :
So you do think , preliminarily , that there 's a link between the abundance of hot towers , and how strong and intense a storm is going to be ?
MARSHALL SHEPHERD :
That 's exactly where we are in the research .
We do n't have enough evidence to conclusively link the number of hot towers or how tall they are to intensity , but our hypothesis is that they might be a sign or a clue that this hurricane is about to enter an intensification phase .
PETER STANDRING :
And if this work pays off , forecasters will be able to predict more accurately not just where a storm will hit , but whether it will weaken or intensify just before landfall .
WALTER MAESTRI :
What really scares me to death is that we get a category 2 or 3 hurricane that rapidly intensifies to a category 4 or 5 storm .
That 's the one that could absolutely be catastrophic here because we would n't get people out .
People would n't be moving early as they were for Ivan .
They would all be here , in the community , and all of a sudden we'd get this wall , this massive wall of water , the double whammy .
IVOR VAN HEERDEN :
Every year that goes by , the probability of this killer storm occurring increases .
JEFF HALVERSON :
It 's inevitable that at some point , probably in the next 10 to 15 years , there 's going to be a tragedy somewhere along the U.S. coastline .
It may not be New Orleans ... some other high population center .
Fairly likely scenario .
PETER STANDRING :
Gaining a deeper understanding of hurricanes is the best answer , but it wo n't happen overnight .
Here on Bourbon Street , the good times continue to roll .
But the party atmosphere masks a widespread concern about the threat of these killer storms .
For this city , or any other place that 's at risk , improvements in hurricane prediction can't come soon enough .
ROBERT KRULWICH : Correspondent Peter Standring .
The United States has offered to return nearly all British residents held at Guantánamo Bay after months of secret talks in Washington , the Guardian has learned .
The British government has refused to accept the men , however , with senior officials saying they have no legal right to return .
Documents obtained by the Guardian show US authorities are demanding that the detainees be kept under 24 - hour surveillance if set free - restrictions that are dismissed by the British as unnecessary and unworkable .
Although all are accused of terrorist involvement , Britain says there is no intelligence to warrant the measures Washington wants , and it lacks the resources to implement them .
" They do not pose a sufficient threat , " said the head of counter - terrorism at the Home Office .
The possible security arrangements appear to have caused months of wrangling , but senior UK sources have told the Guardian the government is interested in accepting only one man - Bisher al - Rawi - who is now known to have helped MI5 keep watch on Abu Qatada , the London - based Muslim cleric and al - Qaida suspect who was subsequently arrested .
At least nine former British residents have been detained without trial at Guantánamo for more than four years after being taken prisoner in the so - called war on terror .
Their lawyers say some have suffered appalling mistreatment .
With the US government anxious to scale down and eventually close its prison at the Cuban base , however , the US state department is putting pressure on the British government to allow some to return .
Foreign Office officials have denied that any talks have taken place .
In Washington , the state department confirmed that there are " ongoing diplomatic negotiations " , as the documents show .
They were written by the most senior counter - terrorism officials at the Home Office and Foreign Office at a time when some ministers were voicing their harshest criticism of Guantánamo .
The documents are witness statements from David Richmond , director general of defence and intelligence at the Foreign Office , and William Nye , director of counter - terrorism and intelligence at the Home Office .
Mr Richmond wrote : " The British embassy in Washington was told in mid-June 2006 that , during an internal meeting between US officials , the possibility had been floated of asking the UK government to consider taking back all the detainees at Guantánamo who had formerly been resident in the UK .
Information about what had occurred at this meeting had been fed back informally to the embassy , and the UK government wished to clarify the significance of this idea . "
On June 27 UK officials met US officials from the departments of state , defence and the national security council .
Mr Richmond wrote of that meeting : " The US administration would only be willing to engage with the UK government if it sought the release and return of all the detainees who had formally resided in the UK ( ie , regardless of the quality of their links with the UK ) , rather than just a subset of the detainees falling in that category . "
Britain says the only way to meet the security conditions would be to have MI5 spy on them .
Mr Nye wrote : " The US administration envisages measures such that the returnees cannot legally leave the UK , engage with known extremists or engage in support , promote , plan or advocate extremist or violent activity , and further have the effect of ensuring that the British authorities would be certain to know immediately of any attempt to engage in any such activity . "
But Mr
Nye says the evidence and intelligence he has seen is not enough for a control order severely restricting their movements : " I am not satisfied it would be proportionate to impose ... the kind of obligations which might be necessary to satisfy the US administration . "
The measures the US wants in place would have to be enacted by MI5 and take effort and resources away from countering more dangerous terrorist suspects .
Mr Nye wrote : " The use of such resources ... could not be justified and would damage the protection of the UK 's national security . "
He says the Guantánamo detainees " do not pose a sufficient threat to justify the devotion of the high level of resources " the US would require .
The talks have been held against the backdrop of a growing realisation within the Bush administration that it would be in the interests of the US to shut down the camp .
In addition to growing public unease , the supreme court ruled in June that there could be no military tribunals of detainees without the protections of the Geneva conventions and American law , reaffirmed the rights of inmates to challenge the legality of their detention , and implicitly outlawed torture and the enforced movement of detainees known as extraordinary rendition .
As well as arguing that none of the former residents has a legal right to return to the UK , British officials are concerned that human rights legislation would forbid the deportation of any who are permitted to return .
However , the supreme court ruling means that it may be impossible for the US to return them to the countries of their birth if there is a risk of them facing persecution .
" The result is that the arguments are going around and around like a washing machine cycle , " said one official familiar with the talks .
Last month Lord Falconer , the lord chancellor , said Guantánamo was a " shocking affront " to the principles of democracy .
In June he branded it a " recruiting agent " for terrorism , whose existence was " intolerable and wrong " .
Lawyers for the British residents say they are still being ill - treated , with four being subjected to the extremes of freezing cold and then high heat .
Shares of the popular search engine pass $ 300 for the first time and are now up 260 % since IPO .
Googly - eyed : Shares of Google have continued to soar since going public last August .
More about Google and Net stocks         NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) - Shares of Google , the popular search - engine company , surpassed the $ 300 level for the first time on Monday , sparking memories of the dot - com stock craze of the late 1990s .
Google ( Research ) gained 2.3 percent to finish at $ 304.10 , slightly below its high for the day of $ 304.30 .
The stock has now gained nearly 260 percent since it went public last August at $ 85 a share .
Much of the optimism surrounding Google comes from the fact that it is the leader in the white - hot online advertising industry .
The company reported much better than expected sales and earnings for the first quarter , thanks to a booming market for online advertising , particularly ads tied to specific keyword searches .
And during the past few weeks , Google has released several new features -- including a desktop search function for businesses and a test version of a personalized home page tool -- that should help the company remain competitive against rivals Yahoo !
( Research ) and Microsoft ( Research ) .
Several analysts have also speculated that Google will soon launch an online payment service that could compete against eBay 's ( Research ) PayPal .
In addition , many investors have been betting that the company , which now has a market value of nearly $ 85 billion , will soon be added to the benchmark S&P 500 index .
But the stock 's meteoric rise as of late -- shares have surged more than 50 percent since the company reported first - quarter results in mid-April -- has some analysts thinking that the stock could take a hit in the near future .
" You might see the stock pause temporarily , " said Marianne Wolk , an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group .
" For the longer term , we 're still very bullish but in the very short term it would n't be a surprise to see the stock stabilize or pull back . "
The key for Google will be how strong its second quarter results are .
Google is set to report these numbers on July 21 .
Analysts expect Google 's sales , excluding revenues it shares with affiliates , a figure known as traffic acquisition costs or TAC , to come in at $ 840 million , nearly double last year 's levels .
Earnings , excluding certain one - time charges , are forecast at $ 1.21 , an increase of 121 percent from a year ago .
Wolk thinks that Google should meet these targets but does not believe the company will report results that are significantly better than consensus projections .
And if Google does not continue to beat estimates , the stock could take a bath .
" For Google to keep heading higher , it 's absolutely critical that they keep hitting numbers .
Everyone now believes the story , " said John Tinker , an analyst with ThinkEquity Partners .
Still , many investors are finding it hard to bet against Google because it has been posting extremely strong levels of sales growth and healthy profit margins as a public company .
So the comparisons to the late 1990s , when shares of many unprofitable Internet companies soared solely due to hype , may not be apt .
To that end , Google is expected to generate nearly $ 3.6 billion in sales , excluding TAC and revenue of $ 5 billion next year as the company continues to benefit from a shift of advertising dollars from more mainstream media sources such as television , radio , and newspapers , to the Web .
In addition to its ubiquitous search engine , Google has branched out into related areas in order to capitalize on the boom in online advertising .
The company has a comparison shopping site , Froogle , a free e-mail service called Gmail which features ads embedded in e-mails , and a local search site that operates as kind of a Web version of the Yellow Pages .
Google also has expanded rapidly abroad , with sales from outside the U.S. accounting for nearly 40 percent of total sales in the first quarter .
What 's more , some argue that Google is not overvalued , since it continues to trade at a discount to its top rival , Yahoo .
However , this gap has narrowed significantly as of late .
Google 's price - to - earnings ratio , based on 2005 earnings estimates , is 58 .
Yahoo trades at 61.5 times earnings estimates for this year .
" Google is not an undiscovered stock any more , " said Tinker .
" It 's no longer inefficiently priced . "
And Google also potentially faces the issue of the summer sluggishness that typically affects Internet stocks .
Last year , shares of several Internet companies plunged in July as results did not live up to lofty expectations .
" I 'd rather be a little conservative in the face of a seasonal slowdown .
It 's not worth stepping up to the plate now , " said Clayton Moran , an analyst with Stanford Financial Group .
" If Google does miss earnings , the stock will pull back a lot more than it will go up if they beat .
And if Google is going to miss , it would be the second quarter or third quarter . "

A $ 10 Linux Answering Machine

Introduction
Architecture of a Linux Telephone Interface
Install Drivers and Libraries
Select and Install the Softmodem
Next Steps ...
Introduction
This article describes how to build a Linux - based telephone answering machine using a low cost winmodem ( softmodem ) for the telephone interface .
We describe how to install the drivers and libraries , and how to select and install the proper modem card .
Our answering machine program is a couple of hundred lines of C code in a single file .
If you 've ever used a telephone you should have no trouble understanding the code .
The requirements for the project are :
- An Intel 537 - based modem ( softmodem )
- A PCI slot that does not share interrupts
Intel 537 - based modems are readily available for less than $ 10 .
The driver we are going to use requires the Intel chip , so be sure you have the right modem before starting .
Architecture of a Linux Telephone Interface
Our answering machine uses drivers and libraries which are a part of the Asterisk open - source PBX .
Asterisk can work as an answering machine , but Asterisk is huge and has a steep learning curve for installation and configuration .
The uncompressed Asterisk package is over 16 megabytes , well in excess of our 5 kilobyte source file .
The overall architecture of our answering machine is shown in the attached diagram .
The driver for the modem card is the wcfxo module .
This interfaces to a higher - level driver called " zaptel " .
The division of the driver into two pieces helps the Asterisk developers minimize how much code they need to write for new types of PC telephony interface cards .
The zaptel driver delivers a 64 Kbps stream of mu-law samples to the user space application .
Zaptel also has IO control routines ( IOCTLs ) to go on - hook , off - hook , and to indicate that the phone line is ringing .
The Zapata library ( libzap ) processes the 64 Kbps stream of data to extract caller ID and DTMF signals .
The competence of libzap is why our answering machine application is so simple .
Our answering machine is pretty minimal as telephony applications go .
It extracts and displays the caller ID information for incoming calls .
If the phone rings more than four times , it answers the phone and plays a greeting .
The greeting message asks the caller to press ' 1 ' to leave a message .
Having the caller press a button eliminates messages from so called " bulk dialers " .
Voice mail is left as mu-law - encoded data in a file with the date and time encoded into the file name .
Install Drivers and Libraries
Our answering machine requires the zaptel drivers and the Zapata library , both of which are available from the Asterisk web site .
Installing the Drivers
Two drivers , wcfxo and zaptel , are required .
Both are in the zaptel package .
You can get to the package from the Downloads link on the Asterisk home page or you can get it directly from Digium which hosts the download site .
http://ftp.digium.com/pub/zaptel/zaptel-1.0.9.2.tar.gz
Untar the file , do a ' make linux 26 ' and a ' make install ' ( as root ) .
If you are using udev , be sure to follow the directions in README.udev .
Specifically , you need to add the following lines to your /etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules file :
KERNEL =" zapctl " , NAME = " zap / ctl " KERNEL =" zaptimer " , NAME = " zap / timer " KERNEL = " zapchannel " , NAME = " zap / channel " KERNEL = " zappseudo " , NAME = " zap / pseudo " KERNEL = " zap [ 0 - 9 ] * " , NAME = " zap / % n "
I run the answering machine as myself so I 've added the following line to the udev permissions file ( /etc/udev/permissions.d/00-udev.permissions ) :
zap/*:bobsmith:bobsmith:660
The final piece of zaptel configuration is to tell it that we have one interface to the telephone " central office " .
Edit /etc/zaptel.conf and add the following line to the end :
fxsks=1
If you do n't live in the US , you should should make one other change to zaptel .conf .
You need to uncomment the line with your country code and make that country code the defaultzone .
Installing the Zapata Library
The Zapata library is no longer used by Asterisk , so it has been relegated to the ' old ' directory on the download site .
http://ftp.digium.com/pub/zaptel/old/zapata-0.9.1.tar.gz
Untar the file , do a ' make ' and a ' make install ' ( as root ) .
The Zapata library does not need any configuration .
Select and Install the Intel Modem
As mentioned above , you need to be sure to get an Intel 537 - compatible modem .
These modems should be easy to find and should be relatively inexpensive .
To call it a " modem " is not quite correct .
It is really more of a " phone line interface " .
Its 64 Kbps stream is 8000 bytes per second , which the wcfxo / zaptel driver delivers in 8 byte chunks .
This means a thousand interrupts per second !
It is the interrupt load that makes installing the modem card a little tricky .
You need to install it in a PCI slot with an interrupt that is not shared by any other device .
Check the documentation for your motherboard to find which interrupts are used for which slots and how those interrupts are used by the internal peripherals .
If you are very unlucky , you may find that the interrupt for every slot on your motherboard is shared and used .
You can try disabling internal peripherals but wcfxo just wo n't work on some motherboards .
The other , less common problem is that the wcfxo driver does not recognize your modem .
To fix this you need to edit the wcfxo_pci_tbl table near the bottom of wcfxo.c in the zaptel build directory .
Use ' lspci - nv ' to get the needed vendor ID , product ID , and subsystem ID .
The following vendor , product , and subsystem IDs are already recognized by wcfxo :
- e159:0001 8085 - e159:0001 8086 - e159:0001 8087
System Check - out
If you 've completed the hardware and software installation , you can verify your system with a few commands .
Install the modules and examine the resulting syslog output .
# modprobe zaptel # modprobe wcfxo #tail / var / log/ messages Sep 18 23:30:41 kernel : Zapata Telephony Interface Registered on major 196 Sep 18 23:30:51 kernel : PCI : Found IRQ 5 for device 0000:00:0b.0 Sep 18 23:30:51 kernel : PCI : Sharing IRQ 5 with 0000:00:07.5 Sep 18 23:30:51 kernel : wcfxo : DAA mode is ' FCC ' Sep 18 23:30:51 kernel : Found a Wildcard FXO : Generic Clone Sep 18 23:30:51 kernel : Registered tone zone 0 ( United States / North America )
Do n't worry about the " Sharing IRQ 5 " log message .
This reports that the IRQ can be shared but does not imply that another Linux device is using it .
An lsmod should show the following three modules :
# lsmod Module Size Used by wcfxo 10848 0 zaptel 185572 3 wcfxo crc-ccitt 1664 1 zaptel
Verify that the wcfxo driver is generating a thousand interrupts per second and that it is not shared with any other devices :
cat / proc / interrupts ; sleep 10 ; cat / proc / interrupts
The wcfxo entry in / proc / interrupts should be on a line by itself , and the interrupt count should have gone up by ten thousand during the above 10 second sleep .
If wcfxo is not on a line by itself , you need to move the modem to another PCI slot .
Specifically , you want something like this :
5 : 3003856 XT - PIC wcfxo
9 : 0 XT - PIC uhci_hcd , uhci_hcd , wcfxo
something like this :
The zaptel driver includes a utility to view the driver configuration .
Use it to verify that it has one interface .
If this fails , check the fxsks =1 line in the configuration file .
# ztcfg -v Zaptel Configuration ======================
1 channels configured .
Installation and Use of the Answering Machine
The code for the answering machine is in a single C file which is available here .
Compile the program with the command :
gcc - lzap -o answering_machine answering_machine.c
Run the program with the command :
./answering_machine
The program expects to find an 8 KHz mu-law - encoded greeting message called " leave_a_msg.ul " in the working directory .
You can record the greeting using any tool you like and then convert the WAV file to mu-law using sox .
The command is :
sox leave_a_msg.wav leave_a_msg.ul
Sox interprets files with the .ul extension as mu-law - encoded audio at 8 KHz .
You can hear your voice mail by using the play command .
For example :
play 2005_09_22_13_30_22.ul
Code Review of the Answering Machine
The hard work in the answering machine is done by the Zapata library .
It does the caller ID , DTMF tone detection , and reads and writes mu-law audio files .
Here is the skeleton of the code in the answering machine :
zp = zap_open ( " / dev/zap/1 " , 0 ) ; while ( 1 ) { /*
Wait for a ring and get caller ID info */ zap_clid( zp , cidnumber , cidname ) ; { Display caller ID to user .
Do logs or black list checking here .
} /*
Wait for an additional RINGS - 1 rings before answering */ zap_waitcall ( zp , ( RINGS - 1 ) , ZAP_OFFHOOK , TM_OUT /1000 ) ; /* Tell Zapata that we want DTMF digits */ zap_digitmode ( zp , ZAP_DTMF ) && zap_clrdtmf( zp ) ; /*
Play our outgoing message .
Abort on DTMF or hang - up . */ zap_playf ( zp , " leave_a_msg.ul " , ZAP_DTMFINT | ZAP_HOOKEXIT ) ; { Continue if caller hung up } /*
Wait up to TM_OUT ms for the caller to enter a DTMF digit */ zap_getdtmf ( zp , 1 , ( char *)0 , 0 , 0 , TM_OUT , ZAP_HOOKEXIT ) ; { Hang - up / continue if time - out and no DTMF digit .
} /*
Get the DTMF digit the caller entered .
Hang - up if wrong digit */ pDigits = zap_dtmfbuf( zp ) ; { Hang - up / continue if caller entered wrong digit } /*
Save voice mail to ' date_time ' file .
*/ zap_recf ( zp , date_time , 0 , ZAP_BEEPTONE | ZAP_SILENCEINT ) ; /* Done with message .
Hang - up and wait for next call .
*/ zap_sethook ( zp , ZAP_ONHOOK ) ; } }
The above code should give you a feel for how to write telephony applications using the Zapata library .
The library also has routines that you can use to make outgoing calls and to help make conference calls .
Next Steps ...
For a simple answering machine , this program works surprisingly well .
Its simplicity is its best feature .
If we were to add features to the answering machine , we would probably add :
Remote access to voice mail :
We should be able to retrieve our voice mail over a phone line .
Saving to a file at least gives us some remote access .

This would be a more reliable way to take notes during a call .
Of course you 'd want to tell the other person that you are recording the call and you 'd want the machine to play a beep every 10 seconds or so .

Pager or message forwarding :
Use libzap 's ability to dial out to tell a pager that there is a new message , or have the application call your cell phone and play the voice mail .
The Zapata library uses blocking IO , making it a little difficult to use a select ( ) loop to manage a user interface while waiting for incoming calls .
Perhaps a threaded application could step around this problem .

DIGG THIS
Whenever U.S. officials wish to demonize someone , they inevitably compare him to Adolf Hitler .
The message immediately resonates with people because everyone knows that Hitler was a brutal dictator .
But how many people know how Hitler actually became a dictator ?
My bet is , very few .
I ’d also bet that more than a few people would be surprised at how he pulled it off , especially given that after World War I Germany had become a democratic republic .
The story of how Hitler became a dictator is set forth in The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich , by William Shirer , on which this article is based .
In the presidential election held on March 13 , 1932 , there were four candidates : the incumbent , Field Marshall Paul von Hindenburg , Hitler , and two minor candidates , Ernst Thaelmann and Theodore Duesterberg .
The results were :
Hindenburg 49.6 percent Hitler 30.1 percent Thaelmann 13.2 percent Duesterberg 6.8 percent
At the risk of belaboring the obvious , almost 70 percent of the German people voted against Hitler , causing his supporter Joseph Goebbels , who would later become Hitler ’s minister of propaganda , to lament in his journal ,  We ’re beaten ; terrible outlook .
Party circles badly depressed and dejected .
Since Hindenberg had not received a majority of the vote , however , a runoff election had to be held among the top three vote - getters .
On April 19 , 1932 , the runoff results were :
Hindenburg 53.0 percent Hitler 36.8 percent Thaelmann 10.2 percent
Thus , even though Hitler ’s vote total had risen , he still had been decisively rejected by the German people .
On June 1 , 1932 , Hindenberg appointed Franz von Papen as chancellor of Germany , whom Shirer described as an unexpected and ludicrous figure . 
Papen immediately dissolved the Reichstag ( the national congress ) and called for new elections , the third legislative election in five months .
Hitler and his fellow members of the National Socialist ( Nazi ) Party , who were determined to bring down the republic and establish dictatorial rule in Germany , did everything they could to create chaos in the streets , including initiating political violence and murder .
The situation got so bad that martial law was proclaimed in Berlin .
Even though Hitler had badly lost the presidential election , he was drawing ever - larger crowds during the congressional election .
As Shirer points out ,
In one day , July 27 , he spoke to 60,000 persons in Brandenburg , to nearly as many in Potsdam , and that evening to 120,000 massed in the giant Grunewald Stadium in Berlin while outside an additional 100,000 heard his voice by loudspeaker .
Hitler ’s rise to power
The July 31 , 1932 , election produced a major victory for Hitler ’s National Socialist Party .
The party won 230 seats in the Reichstag , making it Germany ’s largest political party , but it still fell short of a majority in the 608 - member body .
On the basis of that victory , Hitler demanded that President Hindenburg appoint him chancellor and place him in complete control of the state .
Otto von Meissner , who worked for Hindenburg , later testified at Nuremberg ,
Hindenburg replied that because of the tense situation he could not in good conscience risk transferring the power of government to a new party such as the National Socialists , which did not command a majority and which was intolerant , noisy and undisciplined .
Political deadlocks in the Reichstag soon brought a new election , this one in November 6 , 1932 .
In that election , the Nazis lost two million votes and 34 seats .
Thus , even though the National Socialist Party was still the largest political party , it had clearly lost ground among the voters .
Attempting to remedy the chaos and the deadlocks , Hindenburg fired Papen and appointed an army general named Kurt von Schleicher as the new German chancellor .
Unable to secure a majority coalition in the Reichstag , however , Schleicher finally tendered his resignation to Hindenburg , 57 days after he had been appointed .
On January 30 , 1933 , President Hindenburg appointed Adolf Hitler chancellor of Germany .
Although the National Socialists never captured more than 37 percent of the national vote , and even though they still held a minority of cabinet posts and fewer than 50 percent of the seats in the Reichstag , Hitler and the Nazis set out to consolidate their power .
With Hitler as chancellor , that proved to be a fairly easy task .
The Reichstag fire
On February 27 , Hitler was enjoying supper at the Goebbels home when the telephone rang with an emergency message :  The Reichstag is on fire ! 
Hitler and Goebbels rushed to the fire , where they encountered Hermann Goering , who would later become Hitler ’s air minister .
Goering was shouting at the top of his lungs ,
This is the beginning of the Communist revolution !
We must not wait a minute .
We will show no mercy .
Every Communist official must be shot , where he is found .
Every Communist deputy must this very day be strung up .
The day after the fire , the Prussian government announced that it had found communist publications stating ,
Government buildings , museums , mansions and essential plants were to be burned down … .
Women and children were to be sent in front of terrorist groups … .
The burning of the Reichstag was to be the signal for a bloody insurrection and civil war… .
It has been ascertained that today was to have seen throughout Germany terrorist acts against individual persons , against private property , and against the life and limb of the peaceful population , and also the beginning of general civil war .
So how was Goering so certain that the fire had been set by communist terrorists ?
Arrested on the spot was a Dutch communist named Marinus van der Lubbe .
Most historians now believe that van der Lubbe was actually duped by the Nazis into setting the fire and probably was even assisted by them , without his realizing it .
Why would Hitler and his associates turn a blind eye to an impending terrorist attack on their national congressional building or actually assist with such a horrific deed ?
Because they knew what government officials have known throughout history  that during extreme national emergencies , people are most scared and thus much more willing to surrender their liberties in return for security .
And that ’s exactly what happened during the Reichstag terrorist crisis .
Suspending civil liberties
The day after the fire , Hitler persuaded President Hindenburg to issue a decree entitled ,  For the Protection of the People and the State . 
Justified as a defensive measure against Communist acts of violence endangering the state ,  the decree suspended the constitutional guarantees pertaining to civil liberties :
Restrictions on personal liberty , on the right of free expression of opinion , including freedom of the press ; on the rights of assembly and association ; and violations of the privacy of postal , telegraphic and telephonic communications ; and warrants for house searches , orders for confiscations as well as restrictions on property , are also permissible beyond the legal limits otherwise prescribed .
Two weeks after the Reichstag fire , Hitler requested the Reichstag to temporarily delegate its powers to him so that he could adequately deal with the crisis .
Denouncing opponents to his request , Hitler shouted ,  Germany will be free , but not through you !
When the vote was taken , the result was 441 for and 84 against , giving Hitler the two - thirds majority he needed to suspend the German constitution .
On March 23 , 1933 , what has gone down in German history as the  Enabling Act made Hitler dictator of Germany , freed of all legislative and constitutional constraints .
The judiciary under Hitler
One of the most dramatic consequences was in the judicial arena .
Shirer points out ,
Under the Weimar Constitution judges were independent , subject only to the law , protected from arbitrary removal and bound at least in theory by Article 109 to safeguard equality before the law .
In fact , in the Reichstag terrorist case , while the court convicted van der Lubbe of the crime ( who was executed ) , three other defendants , all communists , were acquitted , which infuriated Hitler and Goering .
Within a month , the Nazis had transferred jurisdiction over treason cases from the Supreme Court to a new People ’s Court , which , as Shirer points out ,
soon became the most dreaded tribunal in the land .
It consisted of two professional judges and five others chosen from among party officials , the S.S. and the armed forces , thus giving the latter a majority vote .
There was no appeal from its decisions or sentences and usually its sessions were held in camera .
Occasionally , however , for propaganda purposes when relatively light sentences were to be given , the foreign correspondents were invited to attend .
One of the Reichstag terrorist defendants , who had angered Goering during the trial with a severe cross-examination of Goering , did not benefit from his acquittal .
Shirer explains :
The German communist leader was immediately taken into  protective custody ,  where he remained until his death during the second war .
In addition to the People ’s Court , which handled treason cases , the Nazis also set up the Special Court , which handled cases of political crimes or insidious attacks against the government .
These courts
consisted of three judges , who invariably had to be trusted party members , without a jury .
A Nazi prosecutor had the choice of bringing action in such cases before either an ordinary court or the Special Court , and invariably he chose the latter , for obvious reasons .
Defense lawyers before this court , as before the Volksgerichtshof , had to be approved by Nazi officials .
Sometimes even if they were approved they fared badly .
Thus the lawyers who attempted to represent the widow of Dr. Klausener , the Catholic Action leader murdered in the Blood Purge , in her suit for damages against the State were whisked off to Sachsenhausen concentration camp , where they were kept until they formally withdrew the action .
Even lenient treatment by the Special Court was no guarantee for the defendant , however , as Pastor Martin Niemoeller discovered when he was acquitted of major political charges and sentenced to time served for minor charges .
Leaving the courtroom , Niemoeller was taken into custody by the Gestapo and taken to a concentration camp .
The Nazis also implemented a legal concept called Schutzhaft or protective custody  which enabled them to arrest and incarcerate people without charging them with a crime .
As Shirer put it ,
Protective custody did not protect a man from possible harm , as it did in more civilized countries .
It punished him by putting him behind barbed wire .
On August 2 , 1934 , Hindenburg died , and the title of president was abolished .
Hitler ’s title became Fhrer and Reich Chancellor .
Not surprisingly , he used the initial four - year temporary  grant of emergency powers that had been given to him by the Enabling Act to consolidate his omnipotent control over the entire country .
Accepting the new order
Oddly enough , even though his dictatorship very quickly became complete , Hitler returned to the Reichstag every four years to renew the temporary  delegation of emergency powers that it had given him to deal with the Reichstag - arson crisis .
Needless to say , the Reichstag rubber - stamped each of his requests .
For their part , the German people quickly accepted the new order of things .
Keep in mind that the average non-Jewish German was pretty much unaffected by the new laws and decrees .
As long as a German citizen kept his head down , worked hard , took care of his family , sent his children to the public schools and the Hitler Youth organization , and , most important , did n’t involve himself in political dissent against the government , a visit by the Gestapo was very unlikely .

“ I think there is in the V.C. community a sense that the rules have changed or are changing , ” said John Battelle , a journalist and entrepreneur , who is a host of a technology conference in San Francisco this week that will include a panel on the subject .
“ How does the V.C. who is set up for a model that requires millions , if not tens of millions , revamp for a different scale ? ”
And as large firms try to go small , they are encountering a new crop of competitors who are happy to bankroll start - ups on the cheap and are fueling the current Internet boom .
They include a large pool of angel investors and a number of small venture funds whose specialty is to invest tens of thousands of dollars , or hundreds of thousands at most .
There is even a group called Y Combinator , whose rule of thumb for investing in start - ups is $ 6,000 per employee .
One of its investments , Reddit , was acquired last week by Wired Digital , which is owned by Condé Nast Publications , for an undisclosed sum .
“ I came to the conclusion that $ 500,000 was the new $ 5 million , ” said Michael Maples Jr. , an entrepreneur who created a $ 15 million venture fund aimed at investing in companies that required little capital .
Mr. Maples sees himself not so much as a competitor to venture capitalists , but as someone who is filling the gap between angels , who may invest $ 250,000 or so in a start - up , and venture investors , whose typical early - stage bet is closer to $ 5 million .
Several forces are allowing companies to operate cheaply compared with the first Internet boom .
They include the declining costs of hardware and bandwidth , the wide availability of open - source software , and the ability to generate revenue through online ads .
“ It ’s a great time to be an entrepreneur , ” Joe Kraus , a veteran of the dot - com boom , wrote in a widely noted blog posting last year .
Mr. Kraus said it took $ 3 million to get his first start - up , Excite.com , from idea to product , much of it spent on servers and software , which have since become much cheaper or even free .
His new start - up , JotSpot , was started on just $ 100,000 .
With the notable exception of YouTube , many recent acquisitions involved Internet start - ups that simply could not effectively use large amounts from venture capitalists or produce large returns , said Paul Kedrosky , a venture capitalist and blogger .
Tell people why transit matters to you
As we open up parts of the economy , having reliable and safe transit in place will be critical .
But the pandemic has changed transit use patterns and ridership is down , putting services in jeopardy .
Help remind your community that public transportation is safe , sustainable and essential !
Write your letter
In every office , in every building , there ’s a manager who ’s never there .
They ’re always double booked for meetings , running from “ important thing ” to “ even more important thing ” – and on the rare occasion you see them in the flesh they have a phone to their ear and a line of people waiting outside their door .
They ’re so hard to get to , sometimes people squeeze their way in for chats on the boss ’s way the bathroom , the conference room , or their car .
When I was young I thought the uber - busy manager was a god – If they ’re so busy , does n’t that mean they ’re very important ?
I used to think so , but not anymore .
Everyone goes through a phase early in their career where they ’re proud of hard work .
Circles of young professionals regularly debate with friends over drinks , who has put in crazier hours – “ I worked 60 hours last week ” , “ 60 ?
I worked 60 hours in 3 days . ” “ 3 days ?
I worked 70 hours this morning , before breakfast . ”
And on it goes .
It ’s usually dumb pride to focus on the size of things , rather that their quality or , god forbid , finding actual fulfillment in life .
To work 70 hours is a statement of work , not of progress .
For every idiot working 70 hours there ’s a smarter , wiser person who ’s doing the same amount of work in 45 because he ’s paying more attention to results than the clock .
I ’d rather be , and rather hire , that employee .
It might take years for the realization to happen , but soon , in every circle of friends , one will ask “ Why I am spending 70 hours a week at work when I want a girlfriend , a dog , and maybe even a life ? ”
The ever - busy manager is the one person who never fully asks that question .
They ’re stuck in the obsession of volume , preferring being busy to being just about anything else .
Busy can be a very safe place for a person to hide .
Being busy gives a safe excuse for not being accountable to the people who need you the most .
Being busy is a failure to prioritize .
To call everything important means in reality that nothing is important .
It ’s likely some people will see you as busy because they are unimportant , but if the people most important to you find you busy , the problem is yours , not theirs .
A good manager discovers that if they are unavailable to the people who work for them , their true value is limited .
Most of the literal work that gets done in any organization , whether it ’s writing , engineering or selling , can be best done by others who do those tasks all day .
It ’s making strategy decisions , giving advice , putting out dangerous fires , and paving the way for the team through organization politics that are the tasks only the “ the boss ” can do best .
A manager that ’s never there is often also micromanager , as they do n’t understand what management is for in the first place .
I had a manager once who insisted on reading his e-mail and typing responses through our 1 - on - 1s .
He ’d pretend to give me focus by typing without looking at his screen , but I never saw his soul in his eyes – instead I knew most of his true attention went out into the emails and not towards me .
I soon found myself cutting our 1 - on - 1s as short as possible ( and using the time to work on finding another job and a better manager ) .
Anyone powerful should recognize if they do n’t have time for important things then it ’s their responsibility to delegate tasks away until they do .
So reconsider who you give respect to : the manager that ’s never there , or the one that ’s always there when you need them .

With maid cafes where pretty young girls that ooze submissiveness to their “ masters ” , and “ shuccho health ” ( 出張ヘルス , basically , dial - a- prostitute ) and soap - lands ( sensual bathing houses with soapy special service ) to vending machines for porn , and specialty shops with used high school girl underwear ; Japan , at least on the surface appears one of the most sexually proactive nations in the world .
Japanese men are as perverted ( if not more perverted ) than those in other countries , and as for the ladies , on top of being naturally feminine ( with petite sexy bodies , skin that does n’t seem to change complexion from childhood , pretty faces and silky black hair ) , the women of Japan have no misconceptions about what style – clothes , perfume and make up – makes a man stop in his tracks , and rouse that tingle in his loins .
When interacting with others , sex and everything surrounding it is fair game for a topic of conversation in Japan and , it is certainly not frowned upon by religious groups or society at large as it is in the USA and other countries .
When it comes to secreting sexual hormones and sexuality in general , almost nothing is taboo in Japan – until that is , the day one gets married , or so it seems .
Indeed in stark sexual contrast , Japan may be suffering from a sexual drought , where being totally open about sex and being sexy in general , does n’t seem to be converted into the ins- and - outs of baby making when it comes to married couples .
Shown in these statistics , a recent survey by Japan ’s health ministry found that as many as one - third of all marriages in Japan are sexless .
The problem is now so widespread that the government fears it is a major contributor to the dramatic plunge in Japan ’s birthrate ( now only 1.28 births per woman ) .
This sexless phenomenon is not only found in those relationships that are plunging down the drain toward divorce , but to the contrary , more and more couples that consider themselves healthily married ( and have no intention of separating ) , have not had sex with each other in the last month or more ( the common definition of “ sexless ” in Japan ) , with many saying that they have not had sex together in the last 6 months to one year .
According to the most recent survey of 41 nations last October , the average Japanese has intercourse 45 ( and according to Bayer Pharmaceuticals as low as 17 ) times a year , compared with the global average of 103 .
Japan is repeatedly at the bottom of the list .
Last year it trailed Singapore , which was 28 shags a year higher !
The term “ sexless ” , was first used in Japan in the early 1990s , but now is instantly recognizable to the Japanese as a universally understood concept , and widely discussed in the media .
There are books on the subject and thousands websites and heartbreaking blogs discussing sexless Japan , while letters on the subject fill agony columns on “ dear doctor ” - type sites .
One in five sexless couples say they view sex simply as a nuisance .
A small number cite the lack of a private space , because children or elderly parents often sleep just the other side of a paper - thin door , leading many married couples to even sleep in separate rooms .
Mitsui Home announced recently in an Asahi Newspaper article , that in 30 % of the new houses they build , the couples are asking for 2 “ master ” bedrooms .
This is a shocking statistic , which shows that sexless couples want to continue living their lives together – separately !
“ We are sort of room - mates rather than a married couple ” , one 31 - year - old man , who had not had sex with his wife for two years , told the Asahi Shinbun .
There are many other theories about why the Japanese become less inclined to raunchy evenings in the sack together , but likely it is a mixture of some of these :
Stress of work / life in Japan ( maybe the taihen cloud ? )
Lack of understanding , and usage of contraception , especially “ the pill ” ( who wants to use condoms with their wife ! ? ) , making sex with your wife viable only when you want to have a baby
Abundance of 不倫 ( furin , or extra- marital ) relationships
More and more Japanese women choosing career over family
A tendency among Japanese married couples to feel an aversion to sex with their spouse , not because they dislike one another , but rather because they feel that they have more of a sister - brother relationship ; the sanctity of which would be destroyed with a repulsive incest - like feeling , by what westerners would consider normal conjugal relations
The last point is an interesting one , as in the past , it has been traditionally Japanese women who complained that they could n’t see their hubby “ as a member of the opposite sex . ”
But in the last few years , there ’s been an exponential increase in men who ca n’t view their wives as sexual partners either .
While it is true that many Japanese married couples seem to be sexless in nature , they key thing to remember is that this certainly does not mean that they lack the desire for sexual fulfillment .
While marriage and children may bring on a sex drought in the home , Japanese people who want ( and in the case of most men , need ) sex do not simply abstain from sex because they cannot see the feminine qualities in their own wife , or the sexual attraction of their hard working husband .
Japanese men love their companies ; they live for work , and many do n’t even think it is a problem if they do n’t have sex with their wives .
They have pornography and the sex industry ( soap lands , cabaret bars , and dial - a - girl services , and trips to Taiwan ) to take care of their needs , but their wives have nowhere to go .
They just suffer in silence .. or do they ?
The divorce rate in Japan has nearly doubled in the past 10 years , with more women blaming their sexually inactive , as opposed to sexually errant , husbands for break - ups .
Though they may not be seeking sexual pleasure from their better halves , married Japanese women are seeking intimacy from other sources ( many even claim to have a sex addiction ) , leading double lives – being the good mother , while at the same time seeking out “ Leroy ” the lover , who is always lurking , and ready to fulfill her every desire .
Japan is full of temptation , and it does n’t matter whether you are a housewife or salary - man , there is plenty of raunchy action waiting out there – if that is what you desire .
Furin sites to find a ( extra marital ) “ sex friend ” partner are just as rampant in Japan as in other countries , however they are much more widely used by women in Japan to solve their sexless quandaries .
For the more conservative ladies , sites like mixi.jp – which are neutrally classed as “ social networking ” spaces – are abound with profiles ( men and women ) looking for partners to secretly spruce up their sexless , but otherwise happily married lives .
Many Japanese marriages may be sexless , but this is only a statistic about the state of sex within marriage itself .
In fact , there may be a good reason for the sexless condition of marriages here – Are the Japanese getting enough of the good stuff outside their marriages to keep them happy ?
I certainly think so .
Japanese people will never be sexless as individuals ; therefore Japan is not sexless , so do n’t let mere statistics confuse the situation !

まず、以下の小学校国語の問題を読んでみてくださいな。
問題：次の（ ）にあてはまるものをア〜エの中から選びなさい。 その問題の解決には（ ）が折れた。 彼は（ ）が広い男だ。 （ ）があいたら、手伝ってください。 （ ）を割って話し合おう。 選択肢：ア .腹 イ.顔 ウ.骨 エ.手
塾でこういう問題を小学生にやらせてみると、これはもう壊滅的にできません
* 1 。「手が折れた」だの、「顔を割って話し合おう」だの、おそろしい文章を作りますよ、彼らは。おまけに、慣用句を知らないだけならまだしも、「そんな（『骨が折れる』とか『顔が広い』とか）言い方誰もしないよ！」と文句を言う子がかなりいます。誰もって誰だよ、アンタのクラスの小学生連中か？
小学生はしなくてもおとなはこういう言い方するんだよ。幼稚な表現力の人ばっかりに囲まれて「これが当たり前」と思い込んでいたら、アンタの言語表現は一生幼稚なままだよ！
表現の幅が狭いままだと、将来メールで人を口説くことも、入社試験で面接官に「この人を採ろう」と思ってもらうこともできないよ！……と叱ってがっつり覚えさせるんですけどね。
ちなみに、中高生にもまったく同じ傾向があります。中学生は「虎穴にいらずんば虎児を得ず」を習って「そんな言い方誰も（略）」と言い張り、高校生は" kill two birds with one stone " ということわざの訳 が 「 一石二鳥」だと説明されて「そんな言い方誰も（略）」と言い張ります。それはもう判で押したように、同じことを言うんですよ。
すごく興味深いのは、小中高どの学年でも、自分の回答が不正解だとわかった瞬間には狼狽またはがっかりした顔をしているのに、「そんな言い方誰も（略）」と言う瞬間にはものすごく人をバカにした口調になっていることです。つまり、この子たちは、一旦失われた自尊心を以下のようなプロセスで回復しているんだと思います。
間違えた、しまった！（←狼狽、またはがっかり）
このままでは自分が無知なことになってしまう。やばい。
でも自分の周りにこんな表現を使っている人はいない。
「みんな」と同じなんだから、きっと自分の方が正しいんだ。
こんな表現を使うやつの方がおかしいんだ！
おかしい奴を見下せ！（←ものすごく人をバカにした口調）
自分の無知を認める代わりに、「『みんな』と同じ自分が正しい」という主張でプライドを保とうとしているんでしょうね。
でも、よく考えたら、大人でもこういう人はたくさんいます。ことば遣いについてのみならず、人間の価値観や行動について、安易に「そんなこと誰も言わない／しないよ！」などと言い放ってふんぞり返っている人には要注意です。その人は、自分の無知を糊塗するために、必死になって「おかしい奴を見下せ」路線に軌道修正しているお子様なのかもしれません。あたし自身だってきっと、無意識のうちにそうなっている瞬間はたくさんあるに違いないと思います。「くだらんプライド維持のために『自分の周りの小集団こそ世界標準』と決め付けちゃうのは、『顔を割って話し合おう』とか書いちゃう小学生と同レベル」と常に認識できるようでありたい、と思っています。
Summary : Search engine users click the results listings ' top entry much more often than can be explained by relevancy ratings .
Once again , people tend to stick to the defaults .
How gullible are Web users ?
Sadly , the answer seems to be " very . "
Professor Thorsten Joachims and colleagues at Cornell University conducted a study of search engines .
Among other things , their study examined the links users followed on the SERP ( search engine results page ) .
They found that 42 % of users clicked the top search hit , and 8 % of users clicked the second hit .
So far , no news .
Many previous studies , including my own , have shown that the top few entries in search listings get the preponderance of clicks and that the number one hit gets vastly more clicks than anything else .
What is interesting is the researchers ' second test , wherein they secretly fed the search results through a script before displaying them to users .
This script swapped the order of the top two search hits .
In other words , what was originally the number two entry in the search engine 's prioritization ended up on top , and the top entry was relegated to second place .
In this swapped condition , users still clicked on the top entry 34 % of the time and on the second hit 12 % of the time .
The Top Hit's Attraction
This study goes far to address why users tend to click on the top hit .
There are two plausible explanations :
Search engines are so good at judging relevancy that they almost always place the best hit on top .
Users click the top hit not because it's any better , but simply because it 's first .
This might be due to sheer laziness ( after all , you start from the top ) or because users assume the search engine places the best hit on top , whether that 's actually true or not .
As the study shows , the answer is clearly a little of both .
If users always clicked the best link , then swapping the order of the two links should also swap the percentages , and this did n't happen .
The top hit still got the most clicks .
On the other hand , if users trusted the search engine implicitly and clicked the top link simply because it 's first , then swapping the links should n't change the percentages .
This did n't happen either .
The top link 's click rate dropped from 42 % to 34 % .
In other words , 8 % of users clicked elsewhere : 4 % clicked the second hit ( which was originally first ) and 4 % clicked other options .
The researchers also assessed whether the search engine in fact placed the best hit on top .
Obviously , this can only be determined by having humans judge which websites are best , and there is no objective criterion for " best website to answer a given question . "
Still , the researchers derived relevancy ratings by averaging the judgments of five people , and that 's probably as good as you get in terms of estimating information relevance .
On average , the top hit in the original search listings was judged as being the most relevant 36 % of the time ; the second hit was most relevant 24 % of the time ; and the two hits were equally relevant 40 % of the time .
In other words , the search engine tended to be right , but was wrong one - fourth of the time .
( If the two hits are equally relevant , it does n't matter which one is placed on top , so I counted these as being right . )
Given how often the search engine was wrong , users clicked the top hit far too frequently .
And when the two top hits were swapped , too few users changed their behavior .
In other words , we can conclude that there is a strong bias in favor of clicking the top link , though not so strong that link quality is irrelevant .
The actionable consequences for search engine marketing are not particularly surprising :
It 's extremely important to be listed first , to the extent that you can achieve this .
But it 's also important to have good microcontent to increase the likelihood that users will perceive your site as relevant to their needs .
Good page titles and article summaries are a must .
Unfortunately , summaries are difficult to control in most search engines .
This study was conducted on Google , which is notorious for displaying bad snippets that are difficult to read and not particularly descriptive of page content .
At least you can do better in the internal search engine on your own website or intranet — assuming you can persuade your content contributors to produce good abstracts .
Default Values Beyond Search
Users rely on defaults in many other areas of user interface design .
For example , they rarely utilize fancy customization features , making it important to optimize the default user experience , since that 's what most users stick to .
In forms and applications , pre-populate fields with the most common value if you can determine it in advance .
For example , on the registration form for our UX Conference , if people register for an event in New York , the country field will say " United States " by default , but if they register for London , it will say " United Kingdom . "
Obviously , many people come from other countries , and they 'll have to change this entry to specify their own country — but they'd have to specify it anyway if we 'd left it blank .
By choosing the most common country as the default , we save many users that bit of work .
Defaults make two essential contributions to usability :
By showing a representative value , they serve as just - in - time instructions to help users understand how to complete a field .
, they serve as just - in - time instructions to help users understand how to complete a field .
By showing a frequent value , they help users understand the commonly expected response , as opposed to more atypical ones .
You can use this knowledge for sales purposes — for example , by pre-selecting the one - year option in a subscription interface that also offers monthly payments .
But , if you consistently pick the most expensive option as the default , you 'll lose credibility , so do n't overdo it .
By educating and guiding users , default values help reduce errors .
It 's therefore important to select helpful defaults , rather than those based on the first letter of the alphabet or whatever the first option on your original list happened to be .

IF PRESIDENT BUSH HOPES the “ shake - up ” of his administration initiated last week will re-energize his listless presidency , he ’s bound to be disappointed .
A far more audacious makeover is needed -- one that sends Vice President Dick Cheney into early retirement .
Second terms are notoriously difficult for presidents .
For President Bush , it has been disastrous .
His swaggering November 2004 news conference -- at which he bragged “ I earned capital in the campaign , political capital , and now I intend to spend it ” -- seems from another era .
Whatever political capital existed he has squandered with the Iraq war , the Valerie Plame leak inquiry and his ill - advised plan to partly privatize Social Security .
His one victory -- getting two reliable conservative jurists on the U.S. Supreme Court -- is no doubt an enduring one .
But there ’s nothing else .
Hence the yearning for a fresh start , the illusion of a third term .
Ronald Reagan , another president hobbled by a second - term scandal , did manage to jump - start his presidency in its last years by bringing new players into his inner circle and engaging in ambitious arms - reduction talks with the Soviets .
Alas , Bush does n’t seem inclined to be that bold .
The president has named a new chief of staff and budget director , but this is a merely a case of old loyalists getting new titles .
The White House also sent much - pummeled press secretary Scott McClellan packing and , in what seems more like truth in packaging than a real change , relieved arch - political operator Karl Rove of his responsibilities for domestic policy .
Advertisement
It ’s expected that other heads will soon roll from the Cabinet Room -- but not that of seemingly fireproof Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld .
The ax is rumored to fall on Treasury Secretary John W. Snow , considered a lackluster evangelist for the president ’s economic policies .
Regardless of one ’s political bias , premature presidential lame - duckitis is not healthy for the nation .
And Bush has been on the right side of some important policy debates -- namely , in fighting senseless protectionism in cases like the Dubai ports deal , in strengthening the nation ’s trading relationship with China and , more broadly , in supporting immigration reform .
To his credit , Bush has broken with conservatives in his party , especially in the House of Representatives , who take a purely punitive approach to illegal immigration .
But if he was once reluctant to use his political capital to win enactment of a balanced immigration bill , Bush now may be too weak to carry the day at a time when some Republicans in Congress will be tempted to move even further in an anti-immigrant direction .
A stronger president also would be in a better position to lead the international community on such issues as Iran ’s nuclear program .
It ’s foolhardy to expect Bush to resurrect his popularity by changing his political stripes entirely .
But a return ( or a first - time visit ) to the principles of “ compassionate conservatism ” would go a long way .
His stance on immigration is appropriately compassionate and conservative , and a reawakening to the evils of huge deficit spending would strengthen the administration ’s credibility on economic matters .
Bush also should strive to complete ongoing global trade talks , and for that he would have to take on politically popular farm subsidy programs .
Advertisement
But the remaking of the president in the public eye likely will require more than last week ’s game of musical chairs .
Bush has acknowledged that he has spent much of his political capital on Iraq , and the way to replenish the reserves is to replace the officials most associated with the overreaching that led to the tragedy in Iraq -- and with the administration ’s broader disdain for diplomacy .
Yes , that means dismissing Rumsfeld .
The secretary should go not because he has been criticized by a group of retired generals but because he embodies the smugness and inability to acknowledge error that has characterized both the Iraq war and the wider war on terrorism .
Rumsfeld has been the pinched public face of an administration that has cut legal and humanitarian corners in dealing with people -- including U.S. citizens -- suspected of involvement with terrorists .
Suppose Bush did n’t stop there .
Suppose he also asked Cheney , his mentor and friend but an even more polarizing figure than Rumsfeld , to step down .
We know the objections .
The vice president is not a mere presidential appointee but an elected constitutional officer .
In choosing a replacement , Bush might be pressured to predetermine the outcome of the 2008 Republican presidential race by anointing one would - be successor over another .
Throwing Cheney overboard would be an implicit repudiation of the excessively hawkish foreign policy with which the vice president , even more than Rumsfeld , has been associated .

Unlike most vice presidents ,
Cheney does not aspire to be president , and he is the consummate Bush loyalist .
He would not be giving up a political birthright by agreeing to retire ( citing health reasons or a concern about the publicity surrounding the trial of his former chief of staff , I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby ) .
And the problem of taking sides in the 2008 election is easily solved .
Bush could nominate as Cheney ’s successor an elder party statesman -- Bob Dole , anyone ? -- with no interest in the 2008 nomination .
We even have an answer to the complaint that in jettisoning Cheney , Bush would be repudiating his own record .
The truth is that the president , however grudgingly , has recognized that he and the administration made mistakes in the run-up to the war in Iraq and in its aftermath .
He has not confessed that the invasion of Iraq was a mistake , but he has acknowledged with increasing explicitness that he was wrong to believe that Saddam Hussein harbored weapons of mass destruction .
No longer proclaiming “ mission accomplished , ” Bush has been pursuing a sadder - but - wiser policy in Iraq that many Democrats also endorse .
It involves ramping up the training of Iraqi troops to take over from U.S. forces while leaning on Iraq ’s feuding sects to join , however unenthusiastically , in a government of national unity .
Having changed his tune , the president should also think about changing the company he keeps -- big time , as Dick Cheney would say .
President Bush and the new Congress have an opportunity to boost U.S. automakers , reduce dependence on foreign oil and produce more environmentally friendly vehicles , according to a clean vehicles expert .
Incentives for the production of higher fuel economy vehicles alone is n't sufficient , says Michelle Robinson , Washington director , Clean Vehicles Program , Union of Concerned Scientists .
" Americans need something in return ; they need better fuel economy across all vehicle models to help fight high gas prices and America 's oil addiction , " she says .
Automaker CEOs emerged from a meeting today at the White House announcing an intention to increase production of flex - fuel vehicles ( FFVs ) to 50 percent by 2012 .
" There are already close to 6 million FFVs on the road today , but less than 1 percent actually run on the alternative fuel .
Therefore , the increased production of FFVs must be coupled with significant progress in fuel availability and superior fuel economy across the vehicle fleet in order to achieve our energy security goals , " Robinson says .
" According to the National Academy of Sciences , automakers have the technology available today to produce 37 miles per gallon ( mpg ) minivans , 34 mpg SUVs , and 42 mpg family cars , all with the same size , acceleration and safety as we have today , " she says .
" This technology could take today 's fleet fuel economy from 25 mpg ( worse than it was 20 years ago ) to 35 , 37 or even 40 mpg over the next decade .
This would create 160,000 new jobs nationwide , including 40,000 in the automotive sector , and save consumers billions of dollars .
" Instead , we are importing 60 percent of our oil and sending $ 500,000 every minute to other countries to feed our addiction .
Meanwhile , the domestic auto industry is struggling , " she adds .
" The public wants this problem solved and leaders should recognize that a comprehensive effort is required .
There is no silver bullet , and the problem is too big to be solved with ethanol , hydrogen , or any other single solution .
But if we use less oil by increasing fuel economy , reducing the distances that people drive , and switching to cleaner , sustainable alternative fuels , we can create jobs , increase our security , and reduce the contributions that vehicles make to global warming . "
Extreme Programming Refactored : The Case Against XP
by Matt Stephens , Doug Rosenberg ISBN : 1590590961
Publisher : Apress
Pages : 432
Over the last couple of years , I ’ve become more and more convinced that most problems in the software industry are social and not technical .
This book strengthens my belief .
Many of the ideas in XP are sound and will , if properly applied , improve most software projects .
And the authors of this book , even if they run a “ case against XP ” , seem to agree .
So , what ’s wrong with XP then ?
Well , to judge from the size of this book there should be plenty but as I started to summarize my reading , I derived three main problems from all the symptoms described :
No one really follows XP , yet expects it to work as if they did .
Mandatory pair programming is evil .
Hype .
The first point is clarified by several from - the - trenches stories of XP projects .
At first I did n’t quite get them ; I mean , creating a huge unit - test suit tightly coupled to a real database as Robin Sharp ’s team did , is clearly missing the point with Test - Driven Development and not even questioning the resulting design is , well , surprising to put it mildly .
How could that possibly be an argument against XP ?
At best it is an argument against bad design and dysfunctional teams , is n’t it ?
At least I thought so , before another view arose as I worked through the book and this is one of the best points the authors make : XP is a high - discipline methodology .
All practices of XP are highly dependent on each other and each one requires the other ones to be in place .
For example , remove unit testing and the continuous integration turns a nightmare .
Remove pair - programming and the design knowledge does n’t spread in the team .
The underlying problem is of course that as XP hits the mainstream , practices get dropped or , perhaps worse , only receive lip - service .
XP requires support from the whole organization and , as Matt and Doug puts it : “ XP is likely to be unsuited to the local culture or the local organization , or the type of project , because so many of its organizational practices are inflexible . ”
Mandatory Pair - programming is one of the few ideas in XP that I dislike .
My own experience tells me that it is great with a second pair of eyes during debugging and as feedback , but requiring all production code to be written by constantly changing pairs is n’t a good idea .
It fails to recognize the fact that humans ( yes , most programmers really are species of this kind ) are inherently different .
What works for you wo n’t necessarily work for me .
I also find it very hard to think design decisions through in pairs ( probably another reason why XP puts so much emphasis on refactoring ) .
The book lists this and several other not always obvious problems like the ergonomic aspect of pair - programming .
The productivity gains by pair - programming promised in XP literature are questionable ; the frequently quoted study “ The costs and benefits of pair programming ” by Cockburn and Williams was conducted in a university using students and not professional programmers .
Thus , the study actually covers pairing of novice - novice programmers , which obviously is n’t representative of real - world development .
By all means , program in pairs ; I just believe that in a productive environment pairing happen naturally as needed and forcing it does more damage than good .
Hype is a notorious problem in software and XP has gotten more than its share .
Matt and Doug make a good job at dissecting the hype around XP .
The best example is the Chrysler C3 project , praised as an XP success - story , yet it was cancelled before completion !
There is probably more than one side of the coin here , but the fact remains : the XP flagship got sunk and every professional developer has to ask oneself how that fact affects his or hers view and implementation of XP .
Unfortunately , the authors fall in their own trap and try to sell you a methodology of their own .
Their silver - bullets are Use Cases and Sequence diagrams .
This is hardly surprising , as Doug has written two books about it .
Sure , great tools and convincing arguments , but again : these are technical solutions .
A team that has stopped refactoring code or slip with their unit - testing are just as likely to produce piles of useless ( ab) use cases and stop maintaining their Sequence diagrams .
Bottom line : you can fail miserably with any methodology , be it XP or a more traditional one .
While I enjoyed the technical content in this book , it stands out for other reasons : it is really fun to read ( in case you do n’t religiously believe in XP and mind having it ripped into shreds and ridiculed ) .
The text is littered with quotes from XP authors .
While Matt and Doug are careful to provide references and ensures that they are n’t quoting out of context , the quotes sometimes made me hope they did ; many quotes are from authors I highly respect and reading their quotes is either incredibly sad or hilarious depending on your point of view .
Or what can one say about “ Schedule is the customer ’s problem ” and the pair programming booster “ Concentration is the Enemy ” ?
Another goodie is the Songs of the Extremos .
These are mainly rewritten Beatles songs , now titled things like “ While Management Gently Weeps ” ( “ While My Guitar Gently Weeps ” ) and “ Just Hack ” ( “ Get Back ” ) .
The style of the book guarantees that it will be either love or hate and I do wish more technical books were like this and actually made you care about what they tell .
The point is not whether you agree with the authors or not ; if you ’re working on an XP - like project or even plan to run one , critically reading this book will help you avoid the pitfalls and perhaps even XP as a process on its own .

Pinochet could be placed under house arrest
Judge Alejandro Solis requested the arrest of Gen Pinochet , 90 , for 36 cases of kidnap , one of homicide and for 23 cases of torture .
The crimes allegedly took place in the years following his 1973 coup .
The Villa Grimaldi centre was run by his secret police , where thousands were tortured between 1974 and 1977 .
Gen Pinochet will be placed under house arrest at his home on Monday , the Reuters news agency reported .
The former leader was under house arrest for seven weeks last year , over the disappearance of three leftists during his rule .
More than 3,000 people were killed when Gen Pinochet was in power from 1973 to 1990 .
Science & Exploration Cydonia - the face on Mars 21/09/2006 48537 views 74 likes
ESA 's Mars Express has obtained images of the Cydonia region , site of the famous ' Face on Mars . '
The High Resolution Stereo Camera photos include some of the most spectacular views of the Red Planet ever .
Cydonia region context map
After multiple attempts to image the Cydonia region from April 2004 until July 2006 were frustrated by altitude and atmospheric dust and haze , the High Resolution Stereo Camera ( HRSC ) on board Mars Express finally obtained , on 22 July , a series of images that show the famous ' face ' on Mars in unprecedented detail .
The data were gathered during orbit 3253 over the Cydonia region , with a ground resolution of approximately 13.7 metres per pixel .
Cydonia lies at approximately 40.75° North and 350.54° East .
" These images of the Cydonia region on Mars are truly spectacular , " said Dr Agustin Chicarro , ESA Mars Express Project Scientist .
" They not only provide a completely fresh and detailed view of an area famous to fans of space myths worldwide , but also provide an impressive close - up over an area of great interest for planetary geologists , and show once more the high capability of the Mars Express camera . "
Cydonia is located in the Arabia Terra region on Mars and belongs to the transition zone between the southern highlands and the northern plains of Mars .
This transition is characterized by wide , debris - filled valleys and isolated remnant mounds of various shapes and sizes .
' Human face ' first seen in 1976 ' Face on Mars ' illusion as seen by Viking 1
One of these visible remnant massifs became famous as the ' Face on Mars ' in an image taken on 25 July 1976 by the American Viking 1 Orbiter .
A few days later , on 31 July 1976 , a NASA press release said the formation " resembles a human head . "
However , NASA scientists had already correctly interpreted the image as an optical illusion caused by the illumination angle of the Sun , the formation 's surface morphology and the resulting shadows , giving the impression of eyes , nose and mouth .
Nonetheless , the ' Face on Mars ' was the subject of widespread speculation on the possible origins and purpose of artificial structures on the Red Planet , with the face being the most talked - about formation .
The array of nearby structures has been interpreted by some space enthusiasts as artificial landscapes , such as potential pyramids and even a disintegrated city .
The idea that the planet might have once been home to intelligent beings has since inspired the imagination of many Mars fans , and has been expressed in numerous , more - or - less serious , newspaper articles as well as in science - fiction literature and on many Web pages .
Cydonia region , colour image Despite all this , the formal scientific interpretation has never changed : the face remains a figment of human imagination in a heavily eroded surface .
It took until April 1998 , and confirmation with additional data from the Mars Orbiter Camera on NASA 's Mars Global Surveyor , before popular speculation waned .
More data from the same orbiter in 2001 further confirmed this conclusion .
Significance for planetary geologists
While the formations are n't of alien origin , they are nevertheless of significant interest to planetary geologists .
Cydonia region , black and white
In areas adjacent to Cydonia , gently sloping areas surrounding hills or reliefs , so - called ' debris aprons , ' are frequently found .
They form at the foot of such remnant mounds and probably consist of a mixture of rocky debris and ice .
In Cydonia itself , such aprons are often missing in smaller massifs .
The formation of debris aprons is considered to be controlled by talus formation , a sloping mass of rock debris at the base of a cliff , and landslides .
At the Mars ' face , ' such characteristic landslides and an early form of debris apron formation can be seen .
' Face on Mars ' in Cydonia region , perspective Former larger debris aprons might have been covered by later lava flows in the surrounding area ; the western wall of the face moved downslope as a coherent mass .
The location of the detachment zone is reflected by a large scarp extending from North to South .
The results of large mass wasting , or downslope movement of rock , are also visible at the foot of the pyramid - like formations .
Between April 2004 and July 2006 , the HRSC gathered data from the Cydonia region numerous times .
However , high flight altitude , resulting in poor data resolution on the ground ( orbits 0262 , 2533 , 2872 ) , as well as dust and haze in the Martian atmosphere , leading to heavily reduced data quality ( orbits 1216 , 2872 ) prevented the acquisition of high - quality Cydonia images .
' Skull - shaped ' structure appears in some images Naturally ' skull - shaped ' formation in Cydonia region
On 22 July , the HRSC finally met success during orbit 3253 , and a wide area in Cydonia was imaged at the best possible resolution and in 3D .

In fact , in addition to the well - known ' face ' and ' pyramids , ' a naturally skull - shaped structure also appears in some of the Mars Express images .
As the famous scientist and writer Carl Sagan said : " Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were .
But without it we go nowhere . "

Stratospheric
City bonuses announced last week and an influx of international financiers have created a fresh echelon of British super - rich living lives of unheard of affluence .
In what has been termed the ' Marie Antoinette ' syndrome , this breed of the mega - wealthy inhabit a world of riches reminiscent of the French royal court just before the revolution .
Personal worth of £ 500 m and above is common .
' The gap between the rich and the super - rich is getting ever larger , ' said William Cash , editor of the new quarterly journal Spear 's Wealth Management , itself so exclusive that one has to be invited to subscribe - and only those with liquid assets exceeding £ 5 m need bother inquiring .
' The super - rich inhabit a world the rest of society can hardly dream of .
It 's a parallel universe . '
Since 2000 , the wealth of Britain 's richest 1,000 individuals is estimated to have doubled to more than £ 250bn between them , thanks to rising property prices , buoyant financial markets and an influx of super - rich from Russia .
Last week the investment bankers Goldman Sachs - known as ' golden sacks ' - announced record profits , with large bonuses for senior staff .
One was said to have got £ 50 m .
Hundreds of other staff have collected £ 1 m payments while senior traders are believed to have earned up to £ 10 m each .
Last week another bank , Morgan Stanley , set a new benchmark for anyone aspiring to be considered rich , indicating that it was no longer interested in taking on UK private clients with less than £ 3 m in liquid assets .
' Because it is no longer anything special to have a liquid wealth of up to £ 5 m , those in that wafer - thin upper echelon of wealth are having to emphasise their status by spending their money in increasingly imaginative and extraordinary ways , ' said Frank Rejwan , UK managing director of Quintessentially , the global concierge service whose ' elite ' membership is by invitation only and costs a basic £ 24,000 a year .
' The super - rich are n't interested in conventional ways of displaying their wealth any more ; they 're no longer looking to emulate their parents ' opulent way of living , added to which they are incredibly competitive with each other and do n't want to do anything that they think has been done before .
Instead , they are looking for ways to spend their money that demonstrates how savvy , quirky and imaginative they are , ' he added .
Rejwan reels off examples : the businessman who demanded that a Premiership footballer was found to play a game with his son ; the 12 albino peacocks sought for a party - at three hours ' notice ; being asked to redesign a London hotel room and organising a trip to Hudson Bay , Canada , in the one month of the year when the world 's largest concentration of polar bears gathers on the ice .
' That little black book the English rich have followed so closely for years has been completely rewritten , ' said Emad Ghobrial , co-founder of the Preferred Group , a global concierge company so exclusive it limits its membership to 30 families .
' There are so many people in Britain who have suddenly and recently come in to money who want to ostentatiously demonstrate their wealth .
' Those with " new money " do n't have the example of their parents or forebears to follow , so they are making the rules up as they go .
It is striking that in Britain they 're seeking to infuse their lives with the exclusivity that can only be achieved through vast but imaginative spending .'
At the opulent offices of Concierge London , co-founder Lady Cosima Somerset , daughter of the Marquess of Londonderry and known as ' Cozzy ' - will sack your cook in Portuguese and have your shoes put into boxes with photographs of them on the outside .
' Our members are beyond rich , ' said Somerset .
' They want the sort of access and experiences that money alone can't buy .
Gone is the time when they were only interested in finding the right luxury villas , the best yacht , or entrance to the Guards Polo Club and the Automobile Club of Monaco . '
The Designer
Esther Dakin Poole , 30 .
Started her interior design firm six years ago .
My customers are all quite young , and for many their unimaginable degree of wealth is pretty new .
My clients buy single curtain ties that cost £ 2,000 each , fabrics from the people who make the garments for archbishops ' coronations and silk from the people brought in to reupholster Venice 's opera house after it burnt down .
I source the most exquisite hand - pressed and hand - gilded kid skin leather wallpaper from a tiny shop in Paris .
It costs £ 1,000 for 70 cm square .
They have been making it in the same way for over 200 years .
My clients export the walls for entire rooms covered in it that are then reconstructed and installed in their homes .
Once a family trusts you , they often use you to design all their properties .
I have worked on eight homes for one family and built a lodge on a private island on the Zambezi .
The Employment Agent
Lynda Weatherhead founder her firm , LJW recruitment six months ago to supply staff to private homes .
Those with new money might ask for a chef on special occasions but they have n't got used to the idea of employing permanent staff yet .
Our clients often have very quirky tastes , but never kiss and tell .
Even I often do n't get to hear about what their staff are asked to do , though I do know we once interviewed for a maid to a titled lady who wanted someone to pick up the poo from her Pekingese dog which had never been house - trained .
The Gardener
Richard Creswell , founder of London - based Scarletts Garden Services .
I founded the firm two years ago and never stop being amazed at how much money people have and are prepared to spend on their gardens .
We have been asked to create a cat pen for a family in south Kensington for £ 30,000 .
Their two Bengali cats were not allowed to mix with other animals , so we created their own universe .
I 've also spent £ 7,000 finding the perfect piece of driftwood from New Zealand beach near the childhood home of a businessman who had moved to London and was homesick .
We mounted it for him and wrapped it around his garden .
Then there was the £ 18,000 playground we built in the garden of a family so that it conformed to every possible European Union safety regulation .
Their children will have grown out of it in four years - then they 'll want it completely redesigned .
A former American occupation official in Iraq is expected to plead guilty to bribery , conspiracy , money laundering and other charges in federal court on Thursday for his actions in a scheme to use sexual favors , jewelry and millions of dollars in cash to steer reconstruction work to a corrupt contractor , according to papers filed with the court .
The official , Robert J. Stein Jr. , served as a comptroller and funding officer in 2003 and 2004 for the Coalition Provisional Authority , which governed Iraq after the American - led invasion .
Four Americans , including Mr. Stein and the contractor , Philip H. Bloom , have been arrested in the case .
Mr. Stein 's plea , apparently with the understanding that he will cooperate with prosecutors , is the first to be made public .
The court papers depict a sordid exercise in greed and corruption that was spread much more widely that previously known .
Including the four people already arrested , the papers indicate that a minimum of three other still unnamed co-conspirators also played a role in the scheme .
In order to give more than $ 8 million in contracts and millions more in stolen cash to Mr. Bloom , the papers say , the conspirators accepted bribes , valuable goods and other favors .
Two of the Americans already arrested , Lt. Col. Debra Harrison and Lt. Col. Michael Wheeler , are senior Army reserve officers .
The court papers indicate that the remaining unnamed co-conspirators are also Army reserve officers , for a total of at least five officers involved .
But the papers suggest that others , identified only by opaque designations like " person H , " may also have been involved in one way or another .

この人がマイクロソフトに入社したのは1992年になっています。私の記憶では、入社の前、大学の先生時代、David Weiseと共同でSSTデバッガを開発し、その縁で、夏休みにマイクロソフトのコンサルタントとして働いていた時、ガーデン・パーティの最中に、Windowsのプロテクト・モードのきっかけとなるアイデアを出したそうです。その頃、MicrosoftはWindowsの開発で640KBのメモリの壁を破ることができずに、苦しんでいたのですが、この壁を破るきっかけが彼のアイデアだそうです。
これによって 、Windows3.0のエンハンスト・モードが可能となり、さらには、Windows95へとつながって、Microsoft Windowsの大成功への道を開いたことになります。その時のエピソードが、確か、Andrew Schulmanの 「 Unauthorized Windows 95」に載っていました。（昔の本を置いてある書庫が遠隔地なので確認できないのですが）。

Next , consider the day and time .
This is simply an exercise .
There is no time that you can go to Costco when it will not be crowded .
Accept this .
Stage one of your journey is the parking lot .
The people are not looking .
Do not hit them .
Drive very very slowly .
First gear .
Slow , deep breaths .
This will prepare you for the deeper stages .
Patience is key in finding a parking spot .
And if you are willing to back up an entire row length at 2 mph , a spot near the door can be yours .
As you enter , do not be distracted by the flat screen tv's .
These are not the droids you 're looking for .
Proceed with caution .
Your cart can not be steered forcefully .
A light touch is needed .
And be prepared to shift directions at a moment 's notice .
Practice cart ju jitsu .
Feint .
Pause .
Look out for small women moving briskly .
You do not need to be in their hurried way .
Items will not be where you expect them .
One brand of toilet paper will not be sitting near the others .
But allow your eyes to be open , for you will discover unexpected delights , such as a 10 - cup fuzzy logic rice cooker for $ 89.99 .
Be flexible , and let go of your expectations .
Knowing that the 64 - oz .
Johnnie Walker Black Label wo n't fit ( or look respectable , for that matter ) in your liquor cabinet , choose the 750 of Glenlivet 12 .
Choose a few wines that you 've never had before , trusting in the wisdom of the Costco wine buyer , who purchases more wine than anyone in America .
Relax into your poses , and do not allow the needs of others to influence you .
Do not line up for the schmear of canned chicken salad on white bread that is being passed out .
Your hunger needs can be met later .
Allow yourself to enjoy the beauty of the flowers .
They are temporary .
Pick a checkout line .
It does n't matter which one .
This is an opportunity to practice patience .
Be friendly to the cashier .
Allow the noises and shapes to soften .
It is peaceful .
Next , allow your body and brain to come back slowly to the real world as you face the geometry problem of loading up a 2 - seater convertible with all your purchases .
Will the toilet paper fit in the front seat ?
Spatial awareness is important .
This exercise will prepare you for re-entry .
Reflect on your experience as you slowly exit the parking lot .
Did you find what you Need ?
Were you pleasantly surprised ?
Has the Costco experience created a sense of abundance ?
And where are you going to put the 10 - pack of Kleenex ?
Sir Antony Hoare , 1980
In academia , in industry , and in the commercial world , there is a widespread belief that computing science as such has been all but completed and that , consequently , computing has " matured " from a theoretical topic for the scientists to a practical issue for the engineers , the managers and the entrepreneurs , i.e. mostly people — and there are many of those ! — who can accept the application of science for the obvious benefits , but feel rather uncomfortable with its creation because they do n't understand what the doing of research , with its intangible goals and its uncertain rewards , entails .
This widespread belief , however , is only correct if we identify the goals of computing science with what has been accomplished and forget those goals that we have failed to reach , even if they are too important to be ignored .
I would therefore like to posit that computing 's central challenge , viz .
" How not to make a mess of it " , has not been met .
On the contrary , most of our systems are much more complicated than can be considered healthy , and are too messy and chaotic to be used in comfort and confidence .
The average customer of the computing industry has been served so poorly that he expects his system to crash all the time , and we witness a massive worldwide distribution of bug - ridden software for which we should be deeply ashamed .
For us scientists it is very tempting to blame the lack of education of the average engineer , the short - sightedness of the managers and the malice of the entrepreneurs for this sorry state of affairs , but that wo n't do .
You see , while we all know that unmastered complexity is at the root of the misery , we do not know what degree of simplicity can be obtained , nor to what extent the intrinsic complexity of the whole design has to show up in the interfaces .
We simply do not know yet the limits of disentanglement .
We do not know yet whether intrinsic intricacy can be distinguished from accidental intricacy .
We do not know yet whether trade - offs will be possible .
We do not know yet whether we can invent for intricacy a meaningful concept about which we can prove theorems that help .
To put it bluntly , we simply do not know yet what we should be talking about , but that should not worry us , for it just illustrates what was meant by " intangible goals and uncertain rewards " .
And this was only an example .
The moral is that whether Computing Science is finished will primarily depend on our courage and our imagination .

It 's TV Turn Off Week - - can you do it ?
April 24-30 is the official TV Turn Off Week !
I 've been TV - free for more than six years , along with my co-authors Bert , Eric , and Beth , and none of us will ever go back .
Imagine what you might do with that time ?
It 's usually a misperception that one is too tired to do anything but television , but many people have to lose electricity or have their TV break before they realize that .
[ Many researchers claim that people do n't watch television because they 're too tired to have sex , but rather become too tired to have sex because of television . ]
For Turn Off
Week , I do n't think it 's cheating too much if you , say , download a show from iTunes and watch it on your computer while you 're waiting for something to render ... ; )
Or , get your movie fix by going to a theater .
It 's a different thing ( at least according to film critic Roger Ebert - - not an expert on the brain ! ) who refers to it as something like , Television has a passive hypnotic effect , but watching a film at the theater is absorbing -- you are completely engaged .
But many of us intuitively feel this -- when you finish watching television , you usually feel even more tired .
When you finish watching a film , you often feel at least mentally energized -- wanting to think and / or talk about it .
( There are several different explanations for the difference , including the technology of non-digital film projection vs. television , the environment , the mindfullness , etc . ]
I wo n't repeat everything I said in my earlier post Kill the TV , Keep the Shows , but a few of the quotes from the Scientific American Mind piece on television addiction include :
" Most of the criteria of substance dependence can apply to people who watch a lot of TV . "
" ... University of British Columbia studied a mountain community that had no television until cable finally arrived .
Over time , both adults and children in the town became less creative in problem solving , less able to persevere at tasks , and less tolerant of unstructured time . "
" To some researchers , the most convincing parallel between TV and addictive drugs is that people experience withdrawal symptoms when they cut back on viewing . "
" Even researchers who study TV for a living marvel at the medium 's hold on them personally .
Percy Tannenbaum of the University of California at Berkeley has written : ' Among life 's more embarrassing moments have been countless occasions when I am engaged in conversation in a room while a TV set is on , and I cannot for the life of me stop from periodically glancing over to the screen . ' "
At the Conference on World Affairs , Dr. Thomas Lewis , who I referenced in the Why face to face still matters post , talked at length about how drops in social and community involvement track closely with the arrival of cable to an area with no TV reception ( most heavily documented in the Canadian studies mentioned earlier ) .
He mentioned scenarios where a community loses power for several days in a row , cutting off their nightly TV ritual , and they suddenly get to know their neighbors for the first time .
( Other factors are at work there as well , but it 's not that hard to imagine that the lack of TV played a role . )
Throwing out my television has made a greater difference in my life than anything else I 've ever done .
But again , I recognize that there are some people who have the discipline to watch only very specific programs , using time - shifting to skip ads and news promos , as opposed to saying , " Let 's see what 's on TV ... "
For me , I found television to be too much of an event horizon ; the only way for me to break free was to get rid of it completely .
Of course , getting rid of TV just means I have more time to obsessively check my email .
So , is there anyone here who is n't already diligent with their Tivo , who is willing to disable the TV tuner ( unplug cable / antennas , etc. ) for a week and watch DVDs or shows on the computer ?
( Under the assumption that for most , viewing habits change dramatically when you shift from having television available 24 - 7 vs. watching specific shows -- as mindful choices - - on a computer . )
Note :
If you have kids who might really struggle with this , there are more resources on how to do this at tvturnoff.org .
Be sure to stock up on Sudokus .
Although ...
I think those evil little number puzzles are far more addicting than TV .
That said , they 're better for your brain and do n't do that whole " orienting response " described in the article I referenced :
" The effects of the orienting response include dilation of the blood vessels to the brain , slowing of the heart , constricting of the blood vessels to major muscle groups , blockage of alpha waves to the brain for a few seconds , etc . "

Kathy ,
I 've been TV free for a full year now , and only get occasional glimpses of it when I 'm at a friends house or at a bar .
The commercials actually make me mentally queasy now that I 'm not longer desensitized to them .
It 's particularly jarring for me when I can't hold a conversation with someone in a restaurant because they keep glancing at a nearby TV .
As for Sudokus , they 've become my morning " brain stretching " in the morning before I get down to work .
Taking 10 - 30 mins to solve one of the little buggers has proven to be a great way to wake up my brain at 7 am and I get into the zone easier for programming .

Me and my wife , we got a TV as a marriage present .
We got rid of it 6 months later .
Now it 's 4 years and we never regreted .
We go to cinema , we watch movies on a laptop like twice a month and it's just enough :)
What I do n't understand , everytime I tell somebody we do n't have a TV , they either think we 're so poor or so crazy .
And noone ever believed me life is better without TV ...

Great post .
I recently decided to completely give up television .
Although I did not watch a lot of television before , giving it up completely prevents that inevitable " Lets see whats on ... " to pop up into your head .
With dvd's and the internet , avoiding television completely probably wo n't have a huge impact anyways .

I have a TV but only use it to watch DVDs .

Another very good resource for how television affects the brain and learning is Joseph Pearce 's Evolution 's End .
Very interesting information about how the medium affects how you 're stimulated and the related content of the shows .

Whose idea was it to schedule " TV Turn Off Week " when there are only six hours left to go in 24 ?
Sorry , maybe next year ;)

We have a TV but we rarely watch it .
We made a conscious choice not to have it in our primary living room , but instead put it downstairs .
We use it almost solely for watching DVDs .
The hard part though is being a GB Packer fan ; for me the TV is generally only on during the NFL Season , even then I feel guilty and often try to do something else productive while the Packer game is on .

Just under two years and ( not really ) counting .
I do n't even miss missing it .
Every once in a while ( every couple months ) I get the urge to watch / rent a movie .
But that 's what the Mac's 23 " LCD is for :)

Kathy ,
I too have been TV and commercial radio- liberated for 2yrs now and it 's just plain better way of life .
Sometimes you feel out of the loop when people are discussing their favorite characters from the OC or Biggest Loser , Survivor , or whatever the latest reality crapshow is .
But those are n't the people I want to associate with anyways - Books , DVDs and coffee shops are where it 's at .
Actually del.icio.us and digg are my equivalents of veging out and " channel surfing . "
You are spot on with this post as always .
I also recommend tuning out FM radio and replacing it with satellite ( i use Sirius ) and podcasts via the iTalk on your iPod .
I wrote a prescription for how to handle the daily " mental fragmentation " that occurs from being blitzed with so many clips and soundbytes here ->

There are definitely different levels of " TV watching . "
I watch an average of one hour a day ( The Daily Show , Colbert Report , South Park , and Drawn Together ) plus the occasional stand - up special .
My parents probably watches as many hours of TV shows as I , but they do n't even have cable , they get DVDs through Netflix .
So who watches more TV ?
I write this while staring at well over 50 RSS feeds and a dozen Firefox tabs .
TV may be worse for the brain , but at least it 's possible to not have anything to watch .
Posted by : Adam Bloom | Apr 24 , 2006 6:04:49 PM
I did n't need to make an effort to quit watching television .
It started to bore me .
The news is always at least several hours behind the Internet , and the gossip / rumors are even further behind , lol .
I do think it works fairly well for comedy , and occasionally there 's a documentary that 's worth catching ( although its stunning how little information is conveyed via the typical television documentary , compared to what you can learn by spending a half hour with a book ) .

Kathy this is SO true , I 've * only * watched movies and TV shows for the past 4 - 5 years on the computer and the experience is 100 % different , actually my monitor is bigger than my TV !
( TV is a * very * old 14 " , monitor is a pretty 21 " flat CRT , and a secondary 19 " old moni where i can track the progress of important mails or anything I 'm waiting for )
Watching " TV " ( that is , watching " cable " ) is a passive activity , you change the channels to see if you find anything worth watching , usually w/o luck , AND you waste 18 minutes per hour watching commercials .
99 % of them totally non-intersting for you ( worse than google ads )
Instead , if you say " I want to see X tonight " , its proactive , you see it when you want it , how you want it , no commercials .
Also , when I first stopped watching " cable " , I watched a lot of movies , and I mean a LOT of them .
And I learned a lot , I got to see the classics etc .
Its really simple :
Around 18 mins per hour while watching TV shows on prime time are commercials , the length of a normal movie is 90 minutes aprox , so if you watch 5 hours a day of " TV " , you 're thowing away the chance to see the classics ( Hitchcock etc ) , european movies ( those that ironically never are on TV ) , or just doing something more productive .
To the point : even if you 're a movie gore or a TV addict ( you follow 15 tv shows from 6 different TV Networks ) , do n't do it on the cable ! , watch it on the computer , you 'll get to see stuff of your choice and better .

Thanks for this , Kathy !
This week I had already decided to cut down on my kids ' screen time and I feel even more motivated now .
I told my ten - year - old " hey , it 's TV turnoff week " and he said " that sounds like fun !
Do you want to play Scrabble ? "
We had only a 13 " tv when we lived in California and had just one kid ... we rarely , if ever , watched anything .
Now we watch almost every night .
Whatever 's on .
Pretty enervating .
Maybe we 'll ditch our TVs .

I 've been TV free for about just over six years now .
My son is 9 and he 's been able to watch parent selected videos or DVDs - so I 've been spared the begging for every toy advertised on television .
I feel like I THINK so much more now - I actually think of television watching as a waste of my time .
I 'd rather research ideas and information on the internet and then read books or journals to dig deeper into the subject matter .
I find televison shows , commercials and newscasts so friggin ' irriating .
All gloss and no no substance - just flash and soundbites to catch your attention and create stress and worry .
There 's never an exploration of the deeper reasons behind anything .
TV ?? * shudder *
I 'm MUCH happier and a much better person without it .

Right on !
I have been without ownership of a TV for 3 years now .
Reason being , I moved to Japan .
Hard to pack a TV in your luggage .
After I arrived , my work schedule was such that every 6 months I would be living in a different city , so I figured it would be best to minimize any luggage I would have ...
So no TV .
Well I got used to it .
Really used to it .
I think if Japanese TV was n't in Japanese , it would be of nearly no value to me to watch .
Days feel longer .
I have more energy .
I only watch what I want to watch when I want to watch it by renting movies ...
Will never look back !

I 've been off TV for over a month now since I moved to the new place wihtout a TV , and I have n't had the desire to get one .
And I must say I could n't feel better now , I rest better , eat better , think clearer , gain control back of my own life and , most of all , pick up on reading again !
I say , it 's TV turn - off year !
Really , who needs a TV if all it offers is nothing but negative and entertainment news , scandals , shameful political bigotry , and all sum up in one word : noise .

I 've been pretty much TV - free for 5 years , and I love it .
Along with becoming vegetarian , one of the best things I ever did !

I run two board game blogs , write articles for board game journals , and host a weekly board gaming group .
Whatever am I going to do with my time ?
I 've had no TV for more than ten years now , although I sometimes watch TV episodes on the computer or rent a DVD .
And I have kids , too .

After moving out from my parents house I never owned a TV , and in this 18 years I never missed it .
Posted by : Sam | Apr 25 , 2006 1:46:28 AM
TV really is like crack .
There 's so much good stuff on Sky at the moment , I really have to wrench myself away from it for other stuff .
It 's mainly the 8 - 11 pm part of the evening , when they have excellent series like " Thief " which has just taken over from " Over There " following the latter 's season finale a fortnight ago .
I love these series , but they 're such a thief of time .
I 'm torn between upgrading to a new high - def TV and jacking TV in altogether .
The worst thing is though , without it , I think my 3 year old would drive my wife mad .
This morning , he woke up at 6 after my 7.5 month old daughter who has a cold had kept my wife up most of the night .
She was so exhausted , but he was insistent on getting up , so I , on my way out to work , got him his breakfast & sat him in front of the TV downstairs .
If he'd been left , he'd have woke up Melissa & that would have been it for my wife for the morning .
How do you train a 3 year old boy to sit quietly & play alone or read his picture books ?

I wonder what the results would be of the study you cite if computers and the internet were introduced into the community instead of cable TV . ;)
Computers can be just as mindless , junk filled , robbers of time , that isolate members of a family .
One technology is not inherently better than the other .
Sometimes we just replace one addiction with another .
It all depends on how you use it .
I try to limit myself on both , and spend more face - to - face time with the people in my life .
What we really need is technology turn off week .
Can you do that ? ;)

The other benefit is losing weight !
( No , this is not some post about getting out and doing some exercise , although that is of course a good thing ) .
There was a study recently in Oz that concluded that you burn more calories staring at a TV that is turned off , than staring at one that is turned on - apparently related to the hypnotic effect you referred to - everything slows down .
Posted by : Connor McDonald | Apr 25 , 2006 7:25:49 AM
What a great post !
Because I do n't watch TV , I have noticed that I am a bit of a social outcast at work .
It seems that the only thing that gets people talking to each other is American Idol .
I try to talk to them about the latest exciting technologies and how they 're affecting society and culture , world news , etc , and I get no response , but they light up when Lost comes up .
I do n't want to sound judgemental , but it is sad to see how the TV - watching that people do in their private time creates a social rift , and makes it very difficult to make meaningful social connections with one another .

Astronomers are to do battle with the time lords of the International Telecommunications Union over plans to scrap leap seconds , the markers occasionally added to a year to give timescales relying on the slowing spin of the Earth a chance to catch up with atomic clocks .
Without these seconds the sun rises " later and later " , confusing sensitive telescopes tuned to the sun 's position in the sky .
The union says the seconds are creating differences between the timescales used by various groups .
But the Royal Astronomical Society says those who want the ban are " exporting " their problems .

BETA or tau ?
That is the question .
On it hang both the health of many of the baby - boomer generation as they reluctantly stare old age in the face and the financial health of rich countries ' medical and social - security systems .
For , as the 10th International Conference on Alzheimer 's Disease and Related Disorders , held recently in Madrid , heard , the relentless growth in the number of people with Alzheimer 's threatens health - care provision in the developed world .
Medical advance means that other diseases are failing to cull the population before Alzheimer 's destroys people 's minds .
And Alzheimer 's is both expensive and lingering .
In America , the average cost of looking after someone with the disease between diagnosis and death is at least $ 174,000 .
At the moment , 4.5 m Americans have Alzheimer's .
By 2050 , if nothing changes , that number will have trebled .
But if a treatment that delayed the disease 's onset by seven years were to be available by the end of the decade , the number of sufferers would decline by 40 % by the middle of the century .
Hence the importance of understanding how Alzheimer 's works , the better to devise a treatment .
Beta ( in the form of beta - amyloid plaques ) and tau ( in the form of tau tangles ) are the physical manifestations of Alzheimer's .
The plaques are globs of rogue protein in the spaces between nerve cells .
The tangles are made of a different rogue protein , and form inside nerve cells .
The smart money says that plaque formation triggers the disease , and that the tangles are a secondary effect .
This is known as the amyloid - cascade hypothesis , and most searches for treatment are based on it .
But there are dissenters who reckon that this is the wrong conclusion .
Some think that the role of the tangles is being underplayed , others that something altogether different has gone wrong .
It 's all Greek
Amyloid plaques form when a molecule called amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) is chopped up by two enzymes known as beta - secretase and gamma - secretase .
One of the products , with the long - winded name amyloid beta-peptide 42 , has the unfortunate property that its molecules like to stick to each other .
The resulting plaques , reckon supporters of the cascade theory , trigger the brain damage that manifests itself as memory loss , behavioural and personality changes , and general and irreversible cognitive decline .
So , stop the plaques forming — or get rid of them once they have formed — and you should be able to control the disease .
One way to do so might be to develop a vaccine that stimulates antibodies against amyloid beta-peptide 42 .
That is the path being pursued by Elan Pharmaceuticals and Wyeth Research .
In 2000 , these two firms began a clinical trial of such a vaccine .
Unfortunately , they had to halt it when 18 of the 300 patients involved developed severe inflammation of the brain .
In the time that the trial had run , however , the researchers noticed that those patients who had reacted to the vaccine , but whose brains had not swollen up , showed a marked slowing of cognitive decline .
This suggested they were on the right track , and the companies are now testing what they hope is a less toxic vaccine .
An alternative to vaccination is to make the antibodies in a factory , and then inject them .
This is called passive immunisation .
Preliminary trials suggest it is safe , and a study carried out by Wyeth showed that treatment with a single dose of antibody produced significant cognitive improvements over the course of four months .
In other words , the drug does not just slow the disease , it reverses it .
Nor is the immunological approach the only one under investigation .
For the past decade there has been a lot of work on drugs called secretase inhibitors , which alter the activity of the enzymes that create amyloid beta-peptide 42 .
Researchers have known for some time that the long - term use of aspirin and ibuprofen , which belong to a group of drugs called non-steroidal anti-inflammatories , roughly halves a person 's risk of developing Alzheimer's .
This has nothing to do with their anti-inflammatory properties , though .
It is because they also act on gamma - secretase .
They alter the way it cleaves amyloid precursor protein .
Instead of producing amyloid beta - peptide 42 ( so called because it has 42 of the amino - acid units of which proteins are composed ) , they make peptides 37 or 38 amino acids long .
These do not stick to one another .
Kenton Zavitz and his colleagues at Myriad Genetics presented the firm 's latest findings on a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory derivative called R - flurbiprofen .
Like many other molecules , flurbiprofen has a left - handed and a right - handed form .
Normally , when the drug is synthesised , these are made in equal numbers .
But it is possible to separate them .
Right - handed flurbiprofen lacks the anti-inflammatory effects of the left - handed version .
This means it is less likely to cause the gastrointestinal problems associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories , so it is safe for long - term use .
It still retains its APP - cleaving properties , though .
The results of a trial with 200 Alzheimer 's patients are encouraging .
Patients with a mild version of the disease who took a high dose of the drug had a slower rate of decline than those who did not .
Hedging bets
Not everybody believes that focusing on amyloid is the right way to go , however .
That is because there is , in fact , no clear correlation between the deposition of the plaques and the development of cognitive problems .
Some dissenters think that tau tangles play a more central role than the cascaders have been willing to admit .
There are also those , like Larry Goldstein , a professor of cellular and molecular medicine at the University of California , San Diego , who believe the triggering event is unrelated to either beta or tau , and is , in fact , a defect in the way that materials are transported through the filamentary protrusions , known as axons , that connect nerve cells to each other in the brain and to other cells a long way away in the body .
For tau , at least one drug is being tried out .
Memantine has been prescribed for more than 20 years for various brain disorders , including dementia , because it is believed to protect against high levels of a neurotransmitter called glutamate .
But there is evidence from several animal studies that it also prevents the modification of tau protein that leads to the formation of intracellular tangles .
Work by Malin Gunnarsson and her colleagues at Uppsala University in Sweden recently confirmed that this is true in people , too .
Such bet - hedging is sensible .
Alois Alzheimer 's original paper , identifying both plaques and tangles , was presented in November 1906 .
A century later , the disease that bears his name is still a mystery — as is the question of how to treat it .
What Kind of Deodorant Does Mathias Want ?
In Freakonomics , we wrote a good bit about first names — how popular names move their way down the socioeconomic ladder , how “ high education ” names differ from “ low education ” names , how black names differ from white names , etc .
It ’s only natural , therefore , that someone would take a look at data on names and try to profit from it .
That ’s the goal of the Dutch direct - marketing agency WegenerDM .
It would sure seem to make sense that if people with “ high end ” names buy very different stuff than people with “ low end ” names , you should target your sales efforts accordingly .
Thanks to Sebastian Paauw for this information ; I reprint here his e-mail with all the necessary details :
Hi ,
On the group weblog Marketingfacts.nl , where I contribute , I just read about a Dutch direct marketing agency / publisher , WegenerDM and the university of Utrecht doing research on first names .
I was n’t very surprised about the outcome of the research because I read your book but it is pretty interesting though .
You can read all about the research here .
Because your Dutch may not be as good as it used to be and I assume that most Dutch did n’t read your book ( yet ) I ’ll give you a bit of
translation .
The university does research on first names just like in your book .
They researched millions of names and found several trends and
frequency in names given to children and coherence in names within family households .
With this information they defined eight different
name groups .
WegenerDM owns enough research about all Dutch consumers to give accurate information about the whole country , that ’s basically their business .
Most direct marketing research included first names .
( You must be drooling about the opportunities at this point )
Basically WegenerDM shared all their research material with the University of Utrecht .
They coupled the name groups to geographical ,
demographical , lifestyle and psycho graphical information .
They found out there was a lot of coherence in each name group .
They found all
kinds of typical lifestyle information .
Coherence in for example in what each name group would buy by mail - order , what they ordered
through postal services , the number of cell phones per family , what kind of magazines they read and in what state of the pyramid of Maslov
they where .
Now they are able to do segmentation on first names .
Companies can use this information to find their consumers and find out how to approach them .
They can also filter the information or use it for more research .
Many e-mail addresses contain a person ’s first name and
therefore they can find their target audience just by knowing their e-mail addresses .
Dec. 14 , 2005  --
When your car costs more than $ 1.2 million , travels over 230 mph , and hits 62 mph in 2.5 seconds , you do not sit in a passenger cabin -- you sit in a " survival cell . "
The " survival cell " is the heart of the Bugatti Veyron , billed as the world 's fastest , most expensive and most exclusive factory - built car .
It will arrive in the United States beginning early next year .
The Veyron is a short , curvy two - seater with massive power .
Its 1,001 horsepower engine has four turbochargers .
The car 's features sound like those on a jet : diffuser flaps , air - intake scoops , a tail wing that acts like an airbrake and 1.7 miles of cable to power onboard electronics .
Bugatti , owned by Volkswagen , can only produce one Veyron per week in its newly built factory in France , and will only produce the two - tone vehicle when one is ordered .
The company will also stop when it hits 300 orders .
Bugatti has sold 45 Veyrons so far , the majority in the United States , said Georges Keller , Bugatti's head of communications .
" Now that the car has become real as opposed to virtual , the interest has been absolutely tremendous , " Keller said .
Veyron took Bugatti seven years to build .
' Work of Art ' on Wheels
" It 's a work of art that 's meant to be driven , " said Richard Koppelman , president of Miller Motor Cars in Greenwich , Conn. , one of six U.S. dealerships that have been selling the car since the fall .
" It 's like a race car that has a tremendous amount of torque but it gets you there comfortably .
But also , you can drive it around town and pick up your dry cleaning . "
Koppelman said he had sold six cars to high - end clients , including one to Michael Fux , an avid collector who test - drove the car during a trip to Pebble Beach in August .
Fux said he bought the car " because I love the way it looks and I love the drive .
I test - drove it , and it's a magnificent automobile . "
The editor in chief of Car and Driver , who broke 250 mph during his test drive , agrees .
" It 's a magical car to drive because it has so much power .
You floor it at 180 and it shoves you into the seat harder than a standard car does in third gear at 20 mph , " Csaba Csere says .
The seven - gear , all - wheel - drive Veyron is so fast that its designers customized three different suspension modes : a mode for " standard " driving below 136 mph ; a " handling " mode engaged when the front diffuser flaps open , the body drops closer to the ground and the tail wing and spoilers are " deployed " ; and a third " top speed " mode , used for speeds above 233 mph , that has to be manually activated with a separate key .
Bugatti admitted it wo n't make money off the Veyron , but Keller said that 's due to the costs of re-establishing the brand -- including building a new multimillion - dollar factory for the first Bugatti in over 50 years .
The company is even sending two technicians to the United States to be on call for American Veyron owners .
Regular tune - ups like oil changes will be done by the six local Bentley dealerships dealerships selling the car : three in California -- San Diego , Beverly Hills and Pasadena -- and three others in Miami , Greenwich and Troy , Mich . , outside of Detroit .
As for how Fux will use his two - tone grey Veyron , he says he wo n't just keep it in his garage .
" If I want a hamburger at McDonald 's , I 'll drive it through the drive - thru at McDonald's . "
Though you would n't know it from watching the election night and post-election coverage on the Cable news shows , preliminary reports from local papers and from a host of electronic voting activist groups and researchers indicate that there were widespread and significant problems with the new electronic voting machines used in the November 7th mid-terms .
The many groups who 're working on collecting and summarizing the information gleaned from nationwide hotlines and poll watching efforts have a ton of data to sort through , but a few of the broader outlines are clear already .
In a nutshell , the kinds of problems highlighted by the two post - mortems done on Cuyahoga County , Ohio's May 2nd primaries proved exemplary — in terms of the types of problems and their relative frequencies — of what the nation as a whole faced on November 7th .
Many activist groups kept logs , like this one , of problems that cropped up on election day .
Among the most publicized collections of problems is the database run by Common Cause .
Common Cause logged 16,000 calls on the 1 - 866 - MYVOTE1 hotline .
The calls registered all sorts of problems , with registration problems being the most common .
The biggest change from their 2004 hotline was the percentage of calls reporting mechanical failures , up from 3 percent to almost 17 percent .
Poll access was also a big problem , and one that was greatly exacerbated by the mechanical failures .
There were reports of people waiting in line for three and four hours , due to issues like poor machine allocation and voting machines that did n't work .
Most of the House and Senate races on Nov. 7th were very , very close , with many being decided by a few thousand ( or in some cases , a few hundred ) votes .
With margins of victory so narrow , the kinds of problems I 'll describe below are simply unacceptable , and in some instances these problems could 've decided the race .
( Whether they actually did decide a race or not is impossible to determine , which is the problem . )
Voting machine failures
Problems with voting machines that either would n't start or would stop working surfaced across the country .
In many cases , these problems caused delays in the opening of polling places , and in others the poll workers were forced to fall back on paper and / or provisional ballots .
Michigan , Maryland , Pennsylvania , Indiana , Ohio had some of the most widely reported problems of this type , but there were many other states that also reported machine failures .
For instance , in Cuyahoga County , Ohio , 43 out of 573 precincts reported problems getting machines started and working .
This resulted in poll opening delays and the use of paper ballots .
There were also reports from Cleveland of machines that stopped working in the middle of voting , and calls from other many other parts of Ohio reporting a litany of problems that range from registration and voter ID confusion to printer jams and vote flipping .
You can get a quick list of some of the reports from this site .
( If the state of Ohio decides to do the kind of independent post - mortem analysis of the mid-terms that Cuyahoga did of the primaries , those reports will make for even more miserable and embarrassing reading than the Cuyahoga reports . )
In Pennsylvania , polling hours were extended after some polling places opened late due to problems getting the machines started .
There were also reports of machines not going through all of the election screens , machines that were not functioning at all , machines automatically shutting down early due to timing problems , and so on .
Indeed , Pennsylvania was another state that saw extremely widespread problems with electronic voting machines across multiple counties .
Like Ohio , it will yield an embarrassing batch of lengthy post - mortem reports if state officials opt to investigate .
In Cook County , Illinois , where I voted , there were multiple reports of problems with the touchscreen voting machines from Sequoia .
The one touchscreen machine at my precinct was frozen , and the poll worker that I talked to said that other precincts in the area were reporting the same problem .
The BOE was so swamped with calls , though , that they could n't get a technician out to the site to fix the machine .
All of us ended up voting with the optical scan ballots .
Other e-voting activist sites are also investigating the problems in Cook County , as is the state .
At any rate , I 'm not going to go on here , because you get the idea .
You can find much more of the kinds of these kinds of stories by checking the links in the " Further reading " section at the end of this post .
If you take a look at Election Protection 365 's short , preliminary , and very incomplete ( I can vouch for that ) state - by - state run-down of election problems , then you what you get is a picture of a massive , distributed denial - of - service ( DDoS ) attack .
A lot of machines in a lot of precincts across the country just did not work as advertised , and far too many voters were either forced to leave without voting or given provisional ballots .
Before moving on from the DDoS theme , let me ask you this : if you were fired up about voting in this election , and you were turned away from the polls two or three times in the morning before giving up because you had to go to work , would you feel like the mid-terms were a success ?
I know I would n't , regardless of what I thought about the outcome of the election .
Vote flipping
I concur with computer scientist and voting activist David Dill 's assessment of the prominent reports of stories that machines across the country were flipping votes on Nov. 7 : this problem is a national disgrace .
The most basic thing that a voting machine should be able to do is register the proper vote for the proper candidate , but time and again voters in many states found that the ballot summary screen indicated that they 'd voted for a different roster of candidates than they had actually voted for .
In some instances , repeated attempts to go back and correct the problem were to no avail , and those voters ' votes simply were not counted correctly .
Texas , Florida , and New Jersey were the sources of the majority of these reports , but voters in other states ( Ohio , Louisiana , Maryland , South Carolina , Georgia , and others ) reported instances of it .
These vote - flipping problems were so widespread and so well - documented , that statements like the following from e-voting machine vendors just boggle the mind .
From a new Computerworld article on vote flipping :
E-voting machines are far more secure , accurate and auditable than the mechanical lever - operated voting machines and other systems they replaced , the [ Sequoia ] spokeswoman contended .
She called vote - flipping concerns a " conspiracy theory from activists and bloggers . "
A spokesman at e-voting equipment vendor Diebold Election Systems also said that e-voting machines do n't cause vote flipping .
" It 's not a problem , " he said .
" It does n't exist .
This again falls into the ' what if ' scenario . "
The two leading candidates for the cause of vote - flipping reports are touchscreen calibration and user error .
Most researchers reject the idea that deliberate fraud is to blame .
( As I said in a previous article , if you 're smart enough to compromise a machine to steal votes , then you would certainly write your vote - stealing Trojan so that it shows the voter his or her correct vote choices on the summary screen . )
Nonetheless , there are enough reports of voters who tried multiple times to cast a correct ballot , and even called poll workers over for help , that I think it 's impossible that user error is to blame for all the cases .
Touchscreen calibration may turn out to be the ultimate culprit , but what 's needed is a full investigation into this phenomenon .
Missing votes in Florida
The Miami Herald reports that 18,382 votes either were n't cast or were n't counted in the race for House District 13 , Katherine Harris 's old seat .
What this means is that of all of the voters who went to the polls in that district , signed in , and cast ballots , 18,382 of them either did n't vote in the House race or did n't have their votes recorded .
So one out of every seven ballots cast in that race did not register a vote for the House seat ; this is an extremely high number of undervotes .
From the Herald :
But on Election Day on touchscreen machines , voters had a 14 percent undervote rate and 18 percent undervote rate in the early - voting week before , when complaints surfaced .
Dr. Richard Malkin said he and his wife voted early and realized their votes in the congressional race were n't recorded just before electronically casting their ballots .
So they re-voted .
'' The lady right next to us had the same problem .
So many people said the same thing , '' said Malkin , a Democrat who sits on a SunTrust bank board with Buchanan .
" It 's like 2000 all over again . ''
The Republican in this race , Vernon Buchanan , has declared victory on the basis of a 368 - vote margin and stated that it 's " time to move on . "
Yeah , I bet he'd like to move on and forget about the 18,000 + missing votes , but his opponent , Christine Jennings , is going to fight it out .
Right now , the official plan is to conduct a " recount , " but of course a legitimate recount is impossible to conduct for touchscreen machines with no paper trail , where a vote was never recorded in the first place .
So the recount idea is going nowhere .
There 's certain to be litigation here , but there 's just no way to recover the intent of the voters with these machines .
The only thing that will work here if these votes are n't somehow recovered from the machines is a new round of voting in Sarasota County .
Supervisor of Elections Kathy Dent has now done a 180 and will comply with voters ' demands to scrap the electronic machines entirely and return to paper ballots .
Dent had previously accused proponents of a voter - verified paper audit trail ( VVPAT ) of trying to obstruct the vote and " disenfranchise " voters .
But in light of a newly passed referendum demanding a return to paper ballots ( at least those referendum votes were counted ) , and in light of the embarrassingly large number of undervotes in Sarasota County , Dent has thankfully changed her tune .
Conclusions : the meltdown that was n't ?
I watched the election night coverage on the major news networks , coverage that Matt Tabbi has brilliantly ( if vulgarly ) lampooned at Rolling Stone , and amid all the sports analogies and talking heads I do n't recall hearing much ( if anything ) about the electronic voting problems that I knew had gone on all day long .
If such problems were referenced , it was in passing — I certainly did n't see a segment dedicated to them as we waited for the returns to come in , but perhaps I just missed that part of the coverage .
After the election , as many of use feared and expected , election officials and e-voting vendors rushed to assure the public that everything had gone smoothly , and that any reports of problems were either " conspiracy theory , " " urban legend , " or user error .
For the most part , the media has bought this narrative .
The party that came out ahead on Tuesday , many members of which were worried about electronic voting problems prior to the election , have moved on to bigger and more important issues , like who will be the new Senate majority leader .
The problems in Florida , however , threaten the " move along , nothing to see here " narrative , and you can be certain that this issue will take center stage again in 2007 , as official , detailed reports of what happened last week start to surface and the 2008 presidential campaign gets under way .
By way of conclusion , I want to link this truly excellent post by VotersUnite.org , entitled " What , Exactly , IS an Election Meltdown ? "
The post first cites pundits and commentators stating that things went smoothly , or better than expected , and that the forecast meltdown did n't materialize .
It then runs down a long litany of major problems , some of which resulted in large - scale disenfranchisement , and others that cast doubt on the outcome of critically important races .
Here are just two of the items in the list :
What if lots of electronic ballot boxes ( memory cards ) were missing in a major city , and only 23 had been found after an extensive search , and the election director said she loses them all the time and normally no one pays any attention , but this time four local races hung in the balance ?
Is this " smooth " to the people whose ballots were lost in Indianapolis ? ?
And then ... what if partisan control of the United States Senate depended on one race in one state , where the reported margin of victory was three - tenths of a percent , and a recount was impossible because there was no way to recover voter intent from the electronic tallies ?
In what world is this " better than expected " ?
Be sure and read the whole thing , and do n't let this issue die .
There 's a whole lot to do before 2008 gets here , and relatively little time to do it .
Postscript
On election day , a major piece of the mystery of " how did we let things get this bad ? " became very clear to me .
People that used the touchscreen voting machines , including my wife , who 'd read my report and was duly skeptical of the DREs , raved about the experience .
The touchscreen machines make fantastic demo units that really sell you on the idea of e-voting .
So it 's no wonder that states and counties across the country went gaga over these machines and just opened up their wallets when a vendor rep showed them a product demo .
This positive user appraisal accords with the exit polls from the Cuyahoga primaries , where over 90 % of voters reported being pleased with the experience of voting on a DRE .
The elderly were among most satisfied with the new machines .
So if you watched an e-voting documentary like " Hacking Democracy , " or you 've been following my coverage of e-voting , and you 're wondering how all of this happened , then here 's your answer : DREs are awfully pleasant to use , in spite of the fact that they 're not worth much as actual voting machines .
Ultimately , the story of the triumph of the touchscreen DRE is really a story of the triumph of style over substance , a story that participants in our democracy are all too familiar with .

It does n’t seem to matter how big of a hard drive you have , it will eventually fill up .
Many times just seeing which directory is using the most space can help you find space that can be freed .
For example , the other day I was running low on drive space , but looking at the size of several directories , I noticed that my download directory was over 10 GB .
I turned out that I had downloaded several Linux ISOs and burned them to DVDs , but forgot to erase the downloaded files .
Just seeing that the size of the directory was abnormally large made it easy to free up the space .
This article is going to look at several ways to look at the size of directories in OS X .
Figuring out how much data is being stored in a particular directory seems like a simple problem , but from the standpoint of the operating system , it is surprisingly difficult .
Basically the idea of a folder that contains files and other folders is a concept created for the users and has very little to do with the way data is actually stored on the hard drive .
For the operating system to figure out how much data is in a particular folder , it has to look at every file in the folder , add the size to a running total , and then present the result to the user .
Since each folder can contain other files and folders , this process can involve looking and hundreds and even thousands of files .
The simplest way of finding the size of a folder is to simply select the folder and press Apple +
I . This will pop up an informational window that contains a field labeled size .
If the folder has a bunch of information in it , the computer may need to do some calculations before it can give you an answer .
This method is great if you want to just find the size of one folder .
If want to look at the information for several folders , just select all the desired folders and push Apple +
I . This will bring up an info box for each selected folder .
Obviously this method is n’t good for checking the size of more than a few folders simultaneously because you ’d end up with your entire screen full of Info windows .
The next way you can check the size of folders is using the command line shell .
Bring up the terminal ( usually located in your Utilities folder under applications ) .
The du command will give you the disk usage for a particular item .
By default it will show you the disk usage for your current directory recursively .
Recursively means it will show you all the information for and sub directories and sub sub directories of your current directory .
For simplicity we ’ll tell the command to only show 1 level deep .
This is done by using the -d 1 switch to only show a depth of 1 .
Here is the command and result :
$ du -d 1
35735224 ./ Movies
27834488 ./ Music
9526128 ./ Pictures
40 ./ ScriptTools
332960 ./ Sites
Obviously that is n’t very useful .
We can get better information by telling du to make its report human readable with the -h switch .
So the results look like :
$ du -d 1 -h
17G ./ Movies
13G ./ Music
4.5G ./ Pictures
20 K ./ ScriptTools
163M ./ Sites
This makes it much easier to find out which folders are taking up the most space .
By setting the -d option to a different depth you can get information about the folders deeper down in the heirarchy .
For people who do n’t want to deal with the command line there is a program call OmniDiskSweeper .
This little program comes in a free version ( which lets you view your file system along with the size of each file or folder ) and a $ 15 version ( which adds a delete button so you can erase files without needing to find them in the finder ) .
The application can be started by clicking on the icon or by selecting it from the Services menu in the Finder .
This makes it easy to find the size of a particular folder and subfolders without needing to go find the program in the Applications folder .
Since the program still has to wait for the operating system to check the sizes of each file and folder , the program may take a little while to run .
The numbers change as the size is calculated .
These three methods will all accomplish about the same thing , but each of them is useful in different situations .
Olfaction ( smell ) is the most mysterious of senses , and is wrongly regarded as insignificant by most people .
The sense of taste , for example , consists in large part of smell – try holding your nose next time you eat – and the recent identification of putative pheromone receptors in humans suggests that olfaction affects behaviour in as yet unknown ways .
The human nose , while not as sensitive as , say , that of a dog , can still detect very low concentrations of odorant molecules as they diffuse through the air .
The initial event in the process of olfaction is the recognition of an odorant molecule by the olfactory receptors , which are proteins found in the olfactory epithelium .
Olfactory receptors are transducers – they convert the ‘ information ’ in odorant molecules into electrical signals that are sent to the brain .
It is only when these signals are processed in the olfactory cortex that we experience the smell .
While the higher order processing of the signals generated by olfactory receptors is relatively well understood , very little is known about how the receptors transduce the information contained in odorants into electrical signals .
It has always been assumed that olfactory receptors function in the same way as other receptors – via the ‘ lock and key ’ mechanism .
According to this well established model for the interaction of a receptor with its ligand ( the molecule which binds to it ) , the receptor recognizes the three - dimensional shape of the ligand , and can only be activated by that specific molecule .
Thus , in most cases , signal transduction begins with a molecular recognition event .
In the case of olfaction , however , there is a problem .
A finite number of olfactory receptors recognize a seemingly infinite number of odorant molecules .
So , although the shape and size of odorants is known to be important , olfactory receptors must also be detecting some other property of the odorants .
In the mid-1990s , Luca Turin , a biophysicist who was then at University College London , proposed a novel mechanism for olfactory receptor transduction .
Few people know more about how the nose knows the difference between one odorant and another than Turin .
He is , to borrow the title of a recent book about him , “ the emperor of scent ” .
It is because of his expertise in olfaction that the French perfume houses consulted Turin about their new fragrances .
At UCL , Turin ’s office doubled up as a makeshift laboratory .
He spent much of his time in the long , narrow room , its walls lined from floor to ceiling with bottles of perfume , tirelessly investigating the relationship between the structures of thousands of aromatic compounds and their odours .
His hypothesis was published in the journal Chemical Senses :
… olfactory receptors respond not to the shape of the molecules but to their vibrations .
[ The theory provides ] a detailed and plausible mechanism for biological transduction of molecular vibrations : inelastic electron tunnelling .
In a non-biological system , inelastic electron tunneling is “ a non-optical form of vibrational spectroscopy [ which ] relies on the interaction between electrons tunneling across a narrow gap between metallic electrodes and a molecule in the gap ” .
In a biological system , such as the olfactory system , this would involve the tunneling of an electron between a suitable donor molecule and specific , electrically - charged amino acid residues within the olfactory receptor .
Turin ’s hypothesis was not controversial – he says it was “ ignored rather than criticized ” .
But now , in a paper to be published in Physical Review Letters , Marshall Stoneham and colleagues , of UCL ’s Department of Physics and Astronomy , report that they have performed calculations which suggest that Turin ’s hypothesis is feasible :
We test the viability of [ Turin ’s ] mechanism using a simple but general model .
Using values of key parameters in line with those of other biomolecular systems , we find the proposed mechanism is consistent both with the underlying physics and the observed features of smell , provided the receptor has certain qualities .
News of the paper has generated some interest in Turin ’s hypothesis .
And Turin himself , of course , has always been adamant that his theory is correct .
Several years ago , he set up Flexitral , a company which designs odorant molecules for use by the perfume industry .
At the company ’s headquarters in Chantilly , Virgina , Turin and his colleagues have been using the theory to predict the smell of odorant molecules before synthesizing them .
Turin ’s hypothesis explains not only how a limited number of olfactory receptors can detect a far larger number of odorants , but also why odorants with very similar molecular structures can smell very different , and , conversely , why molecules with different structures can have similar odours .
In order to gain some understanding of Turin ’s hypothesis , we first need to look at the structure of olfactory receptors .
Olfactory receptors were first cloned by Buck and Axel in 1991 .
In mammals , olfactory receptors are G - protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) .
The GPCRs constitute the largest known protein superfamily .
Mice have approximately 900 odorant receptor genes encoding 1,200 receptors , and humans have about 350 receptor genes .
GPCRs are embedded in the membrane of olfactory cells , and have a distinctive structural motif : the string of amino acids of which they are composed winds back and forth within the membrane , spanning it seven times .
GPCRs are named because they recruit intracellular proteins called G - proteins to transduce sensory signals .
The exact mechanism of action of GPCRs is unknown , but very basically , it occurs as follows .
When the receptor is inactive , it has an inactive G - protein bound to its intracellular surface .
The binding of a ligand to the receptor ’s extracellular surface causes a conformational change in the receptor , which results in the G - protein being activated .
The activated G - protein is released from the olfactory receptor , and then binds to , and activates , other protein molecules within the cell , initiating a chain of biochemical reactions .
According to Turin ’s hypothesis , olfactory receptors act like biological spectroscopes , with the transduction of olfactory stimuli depending on the detection of activity on the subatomic scale .
Turin proposes that the binding of an odorant mediates inelastic electron tunneling , whereby an electron is transferred from a donor molecule to the receptor .
Tunneling of electrons across the odorant ’s binding site activates the receptor and causes the odorant to vibrate .
It is these patterns of vibrations which are specific to the odorant , and which are detected by the olfactory receptors .
Even the slightest difference in molecular structure therefore produces a different vibrational spectrogram .
Together , the series of receptors in the olfactory epithelium cover the vibrational spectrum , and therefore can detect all possible odorants .
So what evidence is there that electron tunnelling takes place in olfactory receptors ?
As mentioned earlier , Turin is successfully using his model to predict the odor of chemicals before they are synthesized .
Turin ’s also theory makes a number of predictions about the functional properties of olfactory receptors .
Firstly , because most odorants cannot undergo reduction - oxidation ( or electron exchanging ) reactions , the receptors must obtain the electrons used for tunnelling from another source , perhaps a soluble electron carrier or an enzyme .
And , because many enzymes which transfer electrons require binding of metal ions , olfactory receptors may also be expected to have metal binding sites .
Analysis of DNA sequences of olfactory receptors shows that these predictions are correct .
The olfactory receptors which have been sequenced are now known to contain a binding site for a molecule called nicotanamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NAD ( P ) H ) , a cofactor molecule which binds to enzymes and exchanges electrons with them .
Sequence analysis also shows that olfactory receptors have sequences that are closely related to , and that function as , zinc binding sites .
Zinc is known to be involved in olfacation , as a deficiency of the metal results in temporary , reversible anosmia ( the inability to smell ) , but its exact role is unclear .
Turin suggests that the zinc binding sites in the olfactory receptors are involved in binding G - proteins , and that the zinc ions themselves contribute to a molecular ‘ bridge ’ through which electrons tunnel during the transduction process .

No , Dr. Rees is braver .
He gives odds on doomsday and offers to bet on disaster .
In his 2003 book , “ Our Final Hour , ” he gives civilization no more than a 50 percent chance of surviving until 2100 .
Dr. Rees is not a knee - jerk technophobe — he expects great advances as researchers around the world link their knowledge — but he fears that progress will be undone by what he calls the new global village idiots .
He ’s sure enough of himself to post an offer on Long Bets , a clever innovation on the Web that Stewart Brand helped start with money from Jeff Bezos , the founder of Amazon.com .
Long Bets is a nonprofit foundation that calls itself an “ arena for competitive , accountable predictions . ”
It lets anyone make a prediction and take wagers on it , with the proceeds going to a charity named by the winner .
The bets made so far are from $ 200 to $ 10,000 , on topics ranging from the driving habits of Americans in 2010 to whether the universe will stop expanding .
Mitchell Kapor , the software guru , is betting that in 2029 no computer will have passed the Turing test ( by conversing so much like a human that you could n’t tell the difference ) .
The physicist Freeman Dyson ’s money is on the first extraterrestrial life ’s being found somewhere other than a planet or its satellite .
Five years ago , Dr. Rees posted this prediction : “ By 2020 , bioterror or bioerror will lead to one million casualties in a single event . ”
He reasoned that “ by 2020 there will be thousands — even millions — of people with the capability to cause a catastrophic biological disaster .
My concern is not only organized terrorist groups , but individual weirdos with the mindset of the people who now design computer viruses . ”
He did n’t get any takers on LongBets.org , which seems to me a missed opportunity .
So I ’ve posted an offer there to bet him $ 200 — not a huge sum , but enough to put both our reputations on the line .
I realize that betting on disaster may sound ghoulish , but neither of us will personally profit ( if I win , the money goes to the International Red Cross ) .
And I think bets like this serve a purpose .
Since then , the entertainment industry has put pressure on electronics manufacturers to limit the consumer ’s ability to make copies .
And as a result , many of the tens of thousands of products displayed last week on the Vegas expo floor , as attractive and innovative as they are , are designed to restrict our use .
DVDs are not so easily copied as videotapes .
And the two rival formats for high - definition video on disc — HD - DVD and Blu-ray — are equipped with even more sophisticated copy - prevention technology .
Americans pay significant monthly fees to enjoy cable television , but cable companies also tightly control all of their content .
They have been at war with electronics companies over the CableCard , a device that allows cable subscribers to record shows without having to buy a special set - top recording box .
Cable companies want to make sure that the only way for consumers to get their hands on CableCards is to buy them directly from cable companies .
Even children are bothered by the increasing restrictions .
One electronics show attendee told me his 12 - year - old recently asked him , “ Why do I have to buy my favorite game five times ? ”
Because the company that made the game wants to profit from each device the user plays it on : Wii , Xbox , PlayStation , Game Boy or phone .
At this year ’s show , the president of the Consumer Electronics Association , Gary Shapiro , spoke up for “ digital freedom , ” arguing that tech companies should n’t need Hollywood ’s permission when they design a new product .
Consumers , he said , should have the right to enjoy the content they buy at whatever time and on whichever device they like .
They should also enjoy “ fair use ” to the extent that they can , without asking , copy movies for themselves , or copy a few seconds of a song and post it on a personal Web page .

Amazon looks set to plough into the digital music market next year .
The retailer started romancing music labels last week .
We talked to an Amazon spokesman today , who said the company was positive about the " massive growth " in the download market .
He confirmed that providing digital music was " definitely an area of interest " for the retailer .
Already the internet 's number one destination for physical music sales , the most shocking thing about the news is that it has taken them so long .
One explanation being touted is that Amazon will launch DRM - free , which will have required delicate and drawn out negotiations with nervous major record labels .
For Amazon , an empire built on slashing overheads , logic dictates any music store will be extended to include movies , TV shows and games .
The FT reported Sunday Amazon is also in talks with Sony to provide movies for transfer to PSP , for example . ®
The worries about extremism are real .
The Belgian far - right party , Vlaams Belang , took 20.5 percent of the vote in city elections last Sunday , five percentage points higher than in 2000 .
In Antwerp , its base , though , its performance improved barely , suggesting to some experts that its power might be peaking .
In Austria this month , right - wing parties also polled well , on a campaign promise that had rarely been made openly : that Austria should start to deport its immigrants .
Vlaams Belang , too , has suggested “ repatriation ” for immigrants who do not made greater efforts to integrate .
The idea is unthinkable to mainstream leaders , but many Muslims still fear that the day — or at least a debate on the topic — may be a terror attack away .
“ I think the time will come , ” said Amir Shafe , 34 , a Pakistani who earns a good living selling clothes at a market in Antwerp .
He deplores terrorism and said he himself did not sense hostility in Belgium .
But he said , “ We are now thinking of going back to our country , before that time comes . ”
Many experts note that there is a deep and troubled history between Islam and Europe , with the Crusaders and the Ottoman Empire jostling each other for centuries and bloodily defining the boundaries of Christianity and Islam .
A sense of guilt over Europe ’s colonial past and then World War II , when intolerance exploded into mass murder , allowed a large migration to occur without any uncomfortable debates over the real differences between migrant and host .
Then the terror attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , jolted Europe into new awareness and worry .
The subsequent bombings in Madrid and London , and the murder of the Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh by a Dutch - born Moroccan stand as examples of the extreme .
But many Europeans — even those who generally support immigration — have begun talking more bluntly about cultural differences , specifically about Muslims ’ deep religious beliefs and social values , which are far more conservative than those of most Europeans on issues like women ’s rights and homosexuality .
“ A lot of people , progressive ones — we are not talking about nationalists or the extreme right — are saying , ‘ Now we have this religion , it plays a role and it challenges our assumptions about what we learned in the 60’s and 70’s , ’ ” said Joost Lagendik , a Dutch member of the European Parliament for the Green Left Party , who is active on Muslim issues .
DISCLAIMERS
We are the only cancer clinic we know of to publish all of our data , anonymously , on all patients up through 2014 , and topic - focused questionnaires of all current patients since then , because we think you want to know the whole truth about what has happened at our clinic , rather than only cherry - picked success stories .
That information is at this link .
This kind of full disclosure is considered unorthodox procedure for any kind of clinic , including cancer clinics .
Please remember that past performance is no guarantee of future results .
Your results may or may not differ from results obtained by others .
Actual clinical results may vary by co-morbidities , stage of cancer , exposure to toxins , diet , activity level , lifestyle , among other factors , seen and unforeseen .
No one in this clinic will guarantee whether you will achieve remission , or how long your treatment would need to be to achieve remission .
Our clinic is 14 years in existence , with 6 decades of combined health care experience among our doctors .
Our data consist of all patients who were treated by us for at least 2 weeks from 2006 to 2014 , with ongoing focused questionnaires of all current patients since then .
We publish on this site all of the data we have ever gathered at our clinic .
Traditional oncology is much larger and has far more patients in their history .
Please plan on a * maximum * of one visitor with the patient in the consult .
We have found that family dynamics distract from the patient , their concerns and their needs .
Conventional cancer treatments may also be used by our patients , and you may read or consult elsewhere about the risks / benefits of those .
You , as the patient , are always free to explore all of those treatment options at any time .
Every clinic has difficulty getting late stage cancer patients into remission .
The more widespread your cancer when you start our metabolic treatments , the harder it is to be successful .
We cannot emphasize strongly enough how important it is to start treatment early in the cancer journey , not late .
It is much harder , sometimes impossible , for us to get late stage cancer into remission .
There 's been a recent surge of announcements from projects mixing Ruby on Rails with Adobe Flex .
The latest news is the release of the Flex scaffold generator from e-Genial , a pioneering Rails company in Brazil .
The product is open source , and is hosted at RubyForge as flexscaffold .
Carlos Eduardo , the author , has published a screencast to demo it .
The presentation has a few captions in Portuguese , but it can be easily followed by anyone who can click on the button labeled " continuar " ( continue ) .
To summarize , a very simple contact manager is built with RadRails , and the Flex scaffolding is generated and compiled to SWF by a rake task that is bundled with the flexscaffold generator .
If you are in a hurry , skip to the last 10 % of the screencast to see the finished Flex form and contact list working .
Mike Potter from Adobe has blogged about that and other developments as well .
Cairgorm , Adobe 's framework for Flex - powered RIAs ( Rich Internet Applications ) , also has an open source Rails generator , developed by Ilya Devers .
A new release of this package was made last week , and can be found in Google Code .
Besides code , new tutorials explaining Rails and Flex integration have been published .
Flexible Rails , a PDF - only book , can be bought online , and the Flexonrails blog has been alive with posts about how to connect Rails to Flex through WebORB , a plugin that provides Flex RPC and Flash remoting functionality to Rails apps .
How does a 37 - foot - tall robotic elephant run amok ?
Very slowly , and with lots of help .
The Sultan ’s Elephant , seen here in central London at a performance by the French street theater company Royal de Luxe , weighs 46 tons – five times heavier than an actual African elephant – and needs 22 operators to tame its diesel - and - electric - powered animatronics , which can make it “ gallop ” at 1 mph , shuffle sideways , and spray water from its trunk .
Industrial artist François Delarozière built the jumbo Dumbo for a Royal de Luxe show celebrating the anniversary of author Jules Verne ’s death .
The pachydroid is scheduled to stampede back to France this fall .
Guess he ’s just big in Europe .
Pachyderms by the Numbers
• Weight of an adult male elephant ’s trunk : 290 pounds
• Weight the trunk can lift : 550 pounds
• An elephant ’s top speed : 25 mph
• Peanuts grown in the US in 2005 : 4.8 billion pounds

Most vertebrates have continuous tooth generation , meaning that lost teeth are replaced with new teeth .
Mammals , however , including humans , have teeth that are generally only replaced once , when milk teeth are replaced with permanent teeth .
Researchers from the Institute of Biotechnology at the University of Helsinki and their collaborators from Berlin and Kyoto have now shown that continuous tooth generation can be induced in mammals .
The research results were published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , USA ( PNAS ) .
The researchers activated the Wnt signalling pathway in mouse tissue ; this signalling pathway is one of those used for cell communication and plays an important role in embryonic development .
As a result of stimulating this particular signalling , one mouse molar developed dozens of new teeth with normal dentin , tooth enamel and developing roots .
The crowns were , however , simple and cone - shaped , unlike the typically more complex multiple cusps of mouse molars .
The development of the new teeth was studied through tissue culture , and it became clear they were the result of germination from previously developed teeth , just like the teeth of lower vertebrates .
The evolutionary trend in mammalian dentition has generally been toward a decrease in tooth generation , as well as towards a more complex shape of the crowns of teeth .
The research indicates that Wnt signalling could have played a crucial role in these changes during evolution .
The results also suggest that mice have retained incipient potential for continuous tooth generation and that it can be unlocked by activating Wnt signalling .
It is reasonable to conjecture that the potential for continuous tooth generation may also have been retained in humans .
Who knows : perhaps dentists in the distant future may be able to use this million - year - old regenerative potential to make their patients grow new teeth to replace lost ones .

The excerpts were selected by the office of US Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte .
Subheadings have been added by the BBC .
United States - led counterterrorism efforts have seriously damaged the leadership of al - Qaeda and disrupted its operations ; however , we judge that al - Qaeda will continue to pose the greatest threat to the Homeland and US interests abroad by a single terrorist organization .
We also assess that the global jihadist movement - which includes al - Qaeda , affiliated and independent terrorist groups , and emerging networks and cells - is spreading and adapting to counterterrorism efforts .
Although we cannot measure the extent of the spread with precision , a large body of all - source reporting indicates that activists identifying themselves as jihadists , although a small percentage of Muslims , are increasing in both number and geographic dispersion .
If this trend continues , threats to US interests at home and abroad will become more diverse , leading to increasing attacks worldwide .
Greater pluralism and more responsive political systems in Muslim majority nations would alleviate some of the grievances jihadists exploit .
Over time , such progress , together with sustained , multifaceted programs targeting the vulnerabilities of the jihadist movement and continued pressure on al - Qaeda , could erode support for the jihadists .
' Diffuse '
We assess that the global jihadist movement is decentralized , lacks a coherent global strategy , and is becoming more diffuse .
New jihadist networks and cells , with anti- American agendas , are increasingly likely to emerge .
The confluence of shared purpose and dispersed actors will make it harder to find and undermine jihadist groups .
We assess that the operational threat from self - radicalized cells will grow in importance to US counterterrorism efforts , particularly abroad but also in the Homeland .
The jihadists regard Europe as an important venue for attacking Western interests .
Extremist networks inside the extensive Muslim diasporas in Europe facilitate recruitment and staging for urban attacks , as illustrated by the 2004 Madrid and 2005 London bombings .
Iraq
We assess that the Iraq jihad is shaping a new generation of terrorist leaders and operatives ; perceived jihadist success there would inspire more fighters to continue the struggle elsewhere .
The Iraq conflict has become the " cause celebre " for jihadists , breeding a deep resentment of US involvement in the Muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement .
Should jihadists leaving Iraq perceive themselves , and be perceived , to have failed , we judge fewer fighters will be inspired to carry on the fight .
We assess that the underlying factors fuelling the spread of the movement outweigh its vulnerabilities and are likely to do so for the duration of the timeframe of this estimate .
Four underlying factors are fuelling the spread of the jihadist movement : ( 1 ) Entrenched grievances , such as corruption , injustice , and fear of Western domination , leading to anger , humiliation , and a sense of powerlessness ; ( 2 ) the Iraq . jihad ; .
( 3 ) the slow pace of real and sustained economic , social , and political reforms in many Muslim majority nations ; and ( 4 ) pervasive anti-US sentiment among most Muslims , all of which jihadists exploit .
' Slow the spread '
Concomitant vulnerabilities in the jihadist movement have emerged that , if fully exposed and exploited , could begin to slow the spread of the movement .
They include dependence on the continuation of Muslim - related conflicts , the limited appeal of the jihadists ' radical ideology , the emergence of respected voices of moderation , and criticism of the violent tactics employed against mostly Muslim citizens .
The jihadists ' greatest vulnerability is that their ultimate political solution - an ultra-conservative interpretation of Sharia - based governance spanning the Muslim world is unpopular with the vast majority of Muslims .
Exposing the religious and political straitjacket that is implied by the jihadists ' propaganda would help to divide them from the audiences they seek to persuade .
Recent condemnations of violence and extremist religious interpretations by a few notable Muslim clerics signal a trend that could facilitate the growth of a constructive alternative to jihadist ideology : peaceful political activism .
This also could lead to the consistent and dynamic participation of broader Muslim communities in rejecting violence , reducing the ability of radicals to capitalize on passive community support .
In this way , the Muslim mainstream emerges as the most powerful weapon in the war on terror .
Countering the spread of the jihadist movement will require coordinated multilateral efforts that go well beyond operations to capture or kill terrorist leaders .
' Exploit '
If democratic reform efforts in Muslim majority nations progress over the next five years , political participation probably would drive a wedge between intransigent extremists and groups willing to use the political process to achieve their local objectives .
Nonetheless , attendant reforms and potentially destabilizing transitions will create new opportunities for jihadists to exploit .
Al - Qaeda , now merged with Abu Musab al - Zarqawi 's network , is exploiting the situation in Iraq to attract new recruits and donors and to maintain its leadership role .
The loss of key leaders , particularly Osama Bin Laden , Ayman al - Zawahiri and al - Zarqawi , in rapid succession , probably would cause the group to fracture into smaller groups .
Although like - minded individuals would endeavour to carry on the mission , the loss of these key leaders would exacerbate strains and disagreements .
We assess that the resulting splinter groups would , at least for a time , pose a less serious threat to US interests than does al - Qaeda .
Should al - Zarqawi continue to evade capture and scale back attacks against Muslims , we assess he could broaden his popular appeal and present a global threat .
The increased role of Iraqis in managing the operations of al - Qaeda in Iraq might lead veteran foreign jihadists to focus their efforts on external operations .
Other groups
Other affiliated Sunni extremist organizations , such as Jemaah Islamiya , Ansar al - Sunnah , and several North African groups , unless countered , are likely to expand their reach and become more capable of multiple and / or mass - casualty attacks outside their traditional areas of operation .
We assess that such groups pose less of a danger to the Homeland than does al - Qaeda but will pose varying degrees of threat to our allies and to US interests abroad .
The focus of their attacks is likely to ebb and flow between local regime targets and regional or global ones .
We judge that most jihadist groups - both well - known and newly formed - will use improvised explosive devices and suicide attacks focused primarily on soft targets to implement their asymmetric warfare strategy , and that they will attempt to conduct sustained terrorist attacks in urban environments .
Fighters with experience in Iraq are a potential source of leadership for jihadists pursuing these tactics .
CBRN capabilities will continue to be sought by jihadist groups .
While Iran , and to a lesser extent Syria , remain the most active state sponsors of terrorism , many other states will be unable to prevent territory or resources from being exploited by terrorists .
Internet
Anti-US and anti-globalization sentiment is on the rise and fuelling other radical ideologies .
This could prompt some leftist , nationalist , or separatist groups to adopt terrorist methods to attack US interests .
The radicalization process is occurring more quickly , more widely , and more anonymously in the Internet age , raising the likelihood of surprise attacks by unknown groups whose members and supporters may be difficult to pinpoint .
We judge that groups of all stripes will increasingly use the Internet to communicate , propagandize , recruit , train , and obtain logistical and financial support .

Every so often , I get asked what my strategy is for " getting things done " .
This morning , I had a short session of mass productivity , and on my ride into work , got inspired to jot down a few tips productivity tips .
Keep in mind that I grew up in the back woods of Montana with no electricity and I 'm mostly Irish .
Write stuff down .
The first and most important means to getting things done is to keep a todo list .
I keep mine on Ta-da List and update it daily , if not hourly .
My two most important lists are " When I have time " and " This Week " .
I regularly re-order " This Week " for the current day .

Quit reading e-mail and blogs .
One of the ways I can tell I 'm in uber - productive mode is my unread ( or starred ) mail piles up and I have n't read any blog posts ( or blogged myself ) in a couple days .
I like GMail because I can easily star an e-mail after briefly skimming it .
For some reason , flagging e-mail in Thunderbird or Mail.app does n't work for me - I rarely go back and find those e-mails .
With GMail , I 'm always conscious I need to revisit starred messages .

Work on open source late at night , with a beer on your desk .
While I do get the opportunity to work on open source at my day job , I still find that I 'm most productive at night .
Maybe this is because no one bugs me via e-mail or IM , or maybe it 's just because the world is asleep .
The strange thing is I often find myself motivated at 3 p.m. for my 11 p.m. workload .
However , when I get to 11 p.m. , I 'm not motivated to work on anything .
I 've found that cracking open a beer at 11 when I start helps me focus and quit worrying about all the other computer - related tasks I need to do .
Also , on beer # 2 or 3 , you 'll start to forget what time it is and really start getting things done .
NOTE : this is n't for rookies .
If you 're a lightweight and get hammered on two beers - just go to bed when you start coding with one eye shut .
It helps to sleep in the next day after doing this .
If you finish off a six - pack before going to bed , it 's probably best not to check your code in - you 're probably going to spend the next day fixing it anyway .
Regardless , this is a great way to get started on a new feature because you 're less concerned about the details and more concerned about the big picture .
I 've also found that " bug fixing juice " can be great for fixing bugs - it gives you a different perspective on the problem .
I told you I was Irish did n't I ? ;-)

Work disconnected .
To further facilitate not checking e-mail or reading blogs , I 've found that going to a coffee shop w/o connectivity is my most productive environment .
They have liquid motivation in the form of coffee , and you can feed your brain with breakfast / lunch or some kind of snack .
My most productive days are the ones where I show up at my local Einstein's ( bagel shop ) at 6 a.m. , have two cups of coffee , and work with my headphones on .
After the coffee and uber - productivity , I often have an awesome ride to work and barely notice the miles .
NOTE : I 've found that I 'm more productive writing code late at night and authoring articles / books in the early morning .

Listen to music while you work .
Some noise - cancelling headphones and your favorite music can do wonders for your productivity .
Of course , earbuds work just as well - whatever makes the music sound good .
Good music can really help you " get into the groove " of what you 're working on , regardless of whether it 's writing or coding .

Work long hours on Monday and Tuesday .
This especially applies if you 're a contractor .
If you can only bill 40 hours per week , working 12 - 14 hours on Monday can get you an early - departure on Friday .
Furthermore , by staying late early in the week , you 'll get your productivity ball - rolling early .
I 've often heard the most productive work - day in a week is Wednesday .

Avoid meetings at all costs .
Find a way to walk out of meetings that are unproductive , do n't concern you , or spiral into two co-workers bitching at each other .
While meetings in general are a waste of time , some are worse than others .
Establish your policy of walking out early on and folks will respect you have stuff to do .
Of course , if you are n't a noticeably productive individual , walking out of a meeting can be perceived as simply " not a team player " , which is n't a good idea .

Sleep .
While working late nights can be productive in the short term , doing it consecutively will burn you out quickly .
Getting a good night 's sleep can often lead to greater productivity because you 're refreshed and ready to go .

Work on something you 're passionate about .
If you do n't like what you 're doing for a living , quit .
Find a new job as soon as possible .
It 's not about the money , it 's all about happiness .
Of course , the best balance is both .
It 's unlikely you 'll ever realize this until you have a job that sucks , but pays well .
To follow up on that last point , I think one of the most important catalysts for productivity is to be happy at your job .
If you 're not happy at work , it 's unlikely you 're going to be inspired to be a more efficient person .
Furthermore , if you like what you do , it 's not really " work " is it ?
Here is some general advice I give to folks about jobs and careers .
I realize that I 'm biased here because I have a good job and I 've been fairly successful in my career .
However , I also grew up with virtually nothing , and learned all my computer skills on my own .
Therefore , I believe that anyone can be successful ( meaning : happy with that they do , and financially stable at the same time ) if they put their mind to it .
If you 're not happy at work , quit .
I got into contracting early - on in my career ( 6 months out of college ) , so I got spoiled with good rates early on .
It was also the late 90s , so you could easily switch jobs if you did n't like the one you were in .
However , I 've always had the policy that if you hate your job for more than 2 weeks , quit .
It 's just not worth it .
Some people enjoy bitching about their jobs and complaining about their co-workers , so this does n't apply to everyone .
However , if you 're truly miserable - quit .
I 've done this a couple times , and it 's always led to better opportunities ( even if I had to wait 3 months ) .
Julie 's done it once or twice and it's always worked out for the better .
Once she even got a 20 % raise by quitting her traveling - consultant gig with KPMG and going back to her old company , Qwest .

Always try to be a contractor before a full - time employee .
This especially applies to younger folks who do n't need the security of insurance for the family , stock plans , etc .
Contractors typically make 50 % more than full - time employees and tend to be excluded from company politics that might make the workplace difficult to deal with .
While you wo n't get billable vacation time , you will get the freedom to take however much vacation you want - as long as you get your stuff done .
The higher rates can generally make up for the unbillable time while on vacation .
However , if you travel too much for fun ( or conferences , etc. ) , it 's likely your year - end salary will equal that of a full - time employee .
If you make good money as a contractor , you 'll also get the opportunity to start your own company ( to save money on taxes ) .
This can be a great learning experience .
The biggest fear that folks have about " going independent " is they 'll have a hard time finding their next gig .
If you 're productive and blog about what you 're doing , this should n't be a problem .
I have n't had an " interview " since 2002 and have n't updated my resume since then either .
Networking at your local JUG and conferences is key .

The higher rates can generally make up for the unbillable time while on vacation .
However , if you travel too much for fun ( or conferences , etc. ) , it 's likely your year - end salary will equal that of a full - time employee .
If you make good money as a contractor , you 'll also get the opportunity to start your own company ( to save money on taxes ) .
This can be a great learning experience .
The biggest fear that folks have about " going independent " is they 'll have a hard time finding their next gig .
If you 're productive and blog about what you 're doing , this should n't be a problem .
I have n't had an " interview " since 2002 and have n't updated my resume since then either .
Networking at your local JUG and conferences is key .
Do n't work at a company with a two - week vacation policy .
I 've never worked at a company with a two - week vacation policy , and I hope I never will .
The two full - time gigs I 've had in my career have had no vacation policy .
This is usually only found in startups - but it generally amounts to " get your shit done , and you can take off all the time you want " .
My parents both work for the BLM ( government agency ) and they get 6 weeks off a year .
Furthermore , they can earn " comp time " ( more days off ) by simply working overtime .
If you have the ability to take time off whenever you want , it 'll likely lead to you being more motivated to work long and hard - b/ c you know when you finish that project , you 're heading to Cancun for a week .

Do n't travel if you have kids .
If you 're single , traveling for work is pretty cool .
New places , new people to meet - and seeing the world can be very cool .
If you have a spouse , it 's likely your desire to travel will decrease , but it 's still not that bad .
If it helps your career , it 's probably a good move .
It also helps to save money since everything you do is generally expensible .
When Julie and I first met , she traveled 100 % and made $ 20 K more per year b/c of it .
When you have kids , everything changes and traveling sucks .
You miss their first steps , and when they get to toddler - age , they 'll want to go with you .
Hearing your daughter say " Daddy , can I go with you ? " can be heart wrenching when you 're leaving on a Sunday afternoon to spend a week with people you 've never met before .

Ask for more responsibility .
If your job sucks , but the company is pretty cool - you may want to ask for a shift in responsibilities .
I was once an HTML Developer at a .com .
It sucked because we were constantly waiting on the Java Developers to fix bugs we found in their code .
Finally , I got tired of waiting and asked my boss to show me how to fix the Java bugs .
Granted , I wrote some pretty horrendous code at first , but my boss and co-workers helped a lot and w / in a year I was doing 80 % of the Java Development .

Most things can be learned by reading .
If you want to learn something new ( for your current or next career ) , the best thing to do is read .
The world 's knowledge resides in books and you can learn a lot .
Of course , the best way to retain that knowledge is by doing , but reading is a great first step .
Those are my tips , many of them off the top of my head .
I may add more as time goes on - but hopefully this helps in the meantime .
Please share yours if you have any .
Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Jobs have their roots in Silicon Valley ’s second generation , the engineers and innovators who came after the early era of semiconductor pioneering .
Their acquaintance dates from the early 1990 ’s , when Mr. Schmidt , heading software at Sun , approached Mr. Jobs , then running Next Computer , about technical cooperation between the companies .
While Mr. Schmidt ’s credentials include a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of California , Berkeley , his early outlook on the industry was shaped when he worked at the Palo Alto Research Center , the legendary Xerox outpost known as PARC , where the first personal computers and modern networks were created in the 1970’s .
In contrast , Mr. Jobs , a college dropout , started out as a brash hobbyist who in the mid-70 ’s foresaw a market for the cobbled - together computer that his friend Stephen Wozniak had built to show off at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto .
The result was Apple , which they founded in 1977 .
PARC was also a touchstone for Mr. Jobs , whose visit there in the late 70 ’s exposed him to the graphical user interface and the computer mouse , two concepts he eventually brought to market with the Lisa and then the Macintosh .
Both men experienced long periods of relative adversity outside of the limelight of computing .
Mr. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 by his handpicked chief executive , John Sculley .
He then founded Next , which he ran without great success until he sold it to Apple in 1996 and rejoined the Apple fold .
Mr. Schmidt left his position at Sun Microsystems in 1997 to take over as chief executive at Novell , a network computing pioneer that , like Apple , had been a victim of Microsoft ’s rise to dominance in desktop computing .
After four years of trying to turn the struggling company around , he left to become chief executive at Google , where his experience was meant to offer balance to the two young founders , Sergey Brin and Larry Page .
Now Mr. Schmidt will bring his experience into play at Apple , in part helping Mr. Jobs add to the independence of his board while the company investigates possible irregularities in stock option grants to Mr. Jobs and other Apple executives .
Executives who know the two men say they have not been close in the past , but are part of a tightly knit fraternity that draws their companies together at the executive level .
Former Vice President Al Gore is a special adviser to Google and also holds a seat on Apple ’s board .
Another link between the companies is William V. Campbell , chairman of Intuit , the financial software company whose Quicken and TurboTax products have prevailed against Microsoft ’s challenge .

Why Google makes everyone else nervous Firm 's ad - based software is changing the media landscape MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif . -- Google Inc. first gained notice early in the decade , as a small and quirky start - up with a disarmingly simple Internet search engine and an idealistic slogan , ``Do n't Be Evil . "
Today the maverick company , adored by online shoppers and Internet surfers , has emerged as one of the most disruptive forces in the business world .
Its secret sauce : a technology that lets business customers link targeted ads to search results and Web content .
By rolling out a spate of free search products , from Google Maps to Google News to Google Calendar , the company is doing more than building its consumer base .
It 's also building an alternative environment for software , advertising , and Internet content that is challenging the business models and eroding the revenue of everyone from publishers to software makers to Internet service providers .
``Google is causing disruption in a variety of areas , " said Anthea Stratigos , co founder and chief executive of Outsell Inc. , a Burlingame , Calif. , research firm .
`` It 's pushing advertising revenue online .
It 's creating a model where software can be hosted by ad funding .
Because of Google , things that have long been fee - based now have the potential to be free to consumers and supported by ads . "
The effect can be seen in falling profits , staff cutbacks , and programming changes in the media industry , but the changes brought about by the Google model may be only beginning .
`` As they go forward , you 're going to see the corporate jets disappear for the executives of NBC and the Internet service providers , " predicted John Katsaros , principal at the Internet Research Group in Los Altos , Calif .
`` You 're going to see slow , agonizing deaths or reevaluation of businesses . "
At a Google press day held earlier this month at the company 's Googleplex campus here , the presentations focused almost entirely on new search products and services the company is offering at no charge to consumers : Google Co- Op for specialists , Google Trends for researchers , Google Notebook for people who like to scribble notes .
Google executives avoided talking about their competitors , other than to profess that there is room for more than one company in the expanding Internet market .
``I do believe the winner , or winners if there 's more than one , will be those companies that innovate most rapidly , " said Eric Schmidt , the company 's chief executive .
So far , Google , whose rapid - fire product releases have dazzled and dizzied computer users , has been the clearest winner .
At the same time , many of its rivals -- from Microsoft Corp. to traditional print media companies -- have seen their growth rates flattening .
Shares of Google , while down from their peak , have more than quadrupled in the less than two years since its initial public offering , which was a celebrated event from Wall Street to Silicon Valley .
With its profits enjoying double - digit growth , up 26 percent in the first quarter , Google has grown into a financial juggernaut .
Last year , its operating income climbed 33 percent to $ 2 billion , its revenue 92 percent to $ 6.1 billion , and its employee rolls 88 percent to 5,680 .
The once cuddly image of its founders , Sergey Brin and Larry Page , the Stanford University grad students who developed their search technology in dorm rooms and incorporated Google in 1998 , has been largely erased by their newfound success and assertiveness .
That assertiveness was notable at the press gathering at Google earlier this month , when Brin addressed his company 's concern that Microsoft would use its operating system to unfair advantage by steering customers to Microsoft 's search engine .
Brin said that Google recognized it was dealing with ``a convicted monopolist " with a history of ``behaving anti competitively . "
In lobbying to prevent Internet service providers from charging content companies for access and refusing to apologize for bowing to Chinese government restrictions on Internet content , Google has been demonstrating a greater willingness to throw around its weight in the political arena and put its commercial interests front and center .
Research firms are only now beginning to take the measure of the company 's influence .
A recent study by Outsell showed that 80 percent of advertisers now use the Internet , with the adoption rate projected to hit 90 percent by 2008 .
While search engine advertising is expected to increase 26 percent this year , with Google raking in the largest share , spending is projected to grow 2 percent for newspaper and magazine ads and 2.4 percent for radio and television ads .
Similarly , the Google effect has reduced Internet service companies -- who 'd once hoped to be gateways to the Internet that profited from Internet services -- to ``pipe companies " that build networks and charge businesses and consumers for access .
And , Google 's e-mail , calendar , and word - processing products are pioneering an ad- supported Internet delivery model that threatens the desktop licensing model of Microsoft and other proprietary software companies , and could appeal to their ``enterprise " market of businesses and other organizations .
Aiding Google 's efforts to deliver robust software on the Internet , and faster search results , is a worldwide network of between 300,000 and 1 million servers , according to analysts ' estimates ;
Google itself declines to specify its number of servers .
Microsoft and Yahoo Inc. are working to counter Google , with Yahoo concentrating more on original content and Microsoft developing its own search capabilities and ad- supported Internet software .
But the biggest threat to Google could be the proliferation of local and smaller vertical search engines -- in fields like travel , finance , and retail -- that could offer even more targeted advertising .
Many newspapers , among others , are developing local search technology .
`` If you want to attack Google , you 're more likely to succeed by peeling off searches that are vertically oriented , " said Fredrick Marckini , chief executive of search engine marketing firm iProspect of Watertown , a division of London - based Aegis Isobar Worldwide .
Marckini said Google is fighting back by deputizing ``contributors , " specialists who can provide niche - oriented searches , and by offering advertisers more information on what people search for .
Google 's newest product offerings could be especially attractive to advertisers , said Sapna Satagopan , search analyst for JupiterKagan Inc. , a San Francisco research firm .
``Every one of these new releases seems to be going in that direction of creating small groups of consumers so they can offer them to advertisers , " Satagopan said .

Hi everybody .
We 've been working on this website update on and off for several months , and most of it was written before the coronavirus crisis exploded .
Reading this now , it all feels a bit strange –– like it was written in a different era , when different things mattered .
But maybe our new post can provide some diversion to all our friends and family who are stuck in " lock down . "
And maybe it will help us all remember the way things used to be –– and hopefully will be again in the future .
At the end of this update , we will describe our own plans for surviving the coronavirus .
We 're in a unique position here in the Marshall Islands –– we can avoid getting the virus , while still doing pretty much what we want to do .
But if we do get sick we are totally on our own -- very little chance of medical help .
So we 're determined not to get sick !
Eagle 's Wings has become a survival capsule .
*******************************************************************************************
This is a long update , so we will just mention a few highlights that you should n't miss .
Our descent into the twilight zone in the Marshall Islands , for example .
And the Rosie the Riveter picture in the " Rose " section .
Plus some interesting sailing and boat tips .
And underwater pictures from Vanuatu .
And we have produced our first videos !
We 're not ready to compete with Attenborough yet , but check them out .
If you are going to read the website , then it probably makes sense to watch them as they come up in context .
But if you are the impatient sort , then here are the links ( we shot these in 4 K , but only uploaded 1080 p , due to the slow internet at our end ) .
Snake ( 39 seconds ) Sailing ( 2:07 minutes ) Teamwork ( 2:57 minutes ) Killing Dragons ( 15:59 minutes ) November 12 , 2018 - November 28 , 2018 Anyway , in our last episode we had left our wanderers in New Caledonia , awaiting a weather window to New Zealand .
We waited for a few days in very pleasant Port Koube on the west side of Ile Ouen , a much more tranquil spot than Noumea .
November 28 , 2018 - December 4 , 2018 Strategic Sailing
And then it was finally time to shake the famous red clay of New Caledonia off our anchor .
Here Ken knocks the mud off .
If you get this stuff on your clothes , or on the deck , you will wish you had n't .
We motored out in very light conditions .
Yes , that 's right , we left on a sailing voyage when there was no wind at all .
But it gets worse –– here 's the prediction for two days out .
The small gray boat icon shows where we would be at that time –– namely getting in front of a rapidly developing low .
So why did we leave on a window with no immediate wind , followed by a storm ?
Here 's the answer .
This is a completely different storm –– a tropical cyclone forecasted to develop about 10 days out .
Had we stayed in New Caledonia this thing could 've landed right on top of us .
The weather models are not very good at predicting tropical storms , so there was an excellent chance that this thing would not develop , at least not as forecast .
But the model is telling us that the conditions are dangerous .
And that it 's time to get out of Dodge .
So , what to do ?
Here 's the plan that we worked out with our fantastic weather router , Bruce Buckley .
We would take the light northerlies generated by the developing low and use them to sail ( slowly ) eastward toward Fiji .
And then once the big low passed underneath us we would turn right and head for New Zealand .
This strategy should also get us to New Zealand before that tropical cyclone can catch us .
So , once the wind built a little bit , we sailed slowly eastward in light winds and calm seas , waiting for the first storm to go by .
We were n't fast , but we also were not in a hurry .
Note that we are not even sailing at full hoist –– just lazing long .
Life could be worse .
Ken sets up the fishing lines , and also demonstrates his tropical fashion statement .
Hat , sunglasses , PFD and harness , underwear , and sea boots .
We still arrived at our waypoint a little bit early .
There was n't even enough wind to heave - to , so we just dropped our sails and lay a -hull .
And got thoroughly miserable as Eagle 's Wings wallowed in the light air and seas .
Sailboats really like wind pressure !
With the storm past , we made our right turn and headed toward New Zealand in the light westerlies left behind by the storm .
We always know that we were getting to within a few hundred miles of New Zealand ( in the spring ) when we tie into a nice albacore .
Does Ken look happy ?
Sushi !!!
Unfortunately , this is another sign that we were close to New Zealand .
The fronts get more intense .
Here 's what this looks like on the radar .
Beth was on watch , and for a while she was able to maneuver the boat and change course to avoid the worst of these things .
Until she was n't .
Eeek !
But Beth really earned some bragging rights here , as she reefed the sails , jibed and tacked repeatedly , and finally hove - to .
She turned off the navigation computer and put it in the oven to protect it from a lightning strike .
A good thing , as we got a nearby lightning strike which momentarily knocked the lights out of the instruments .
Fortunately there was no lasting damage .
She finally got back underway when the squalls passed .
All without waking Ken up !
Beth still can't figure out how Ken slept through the thunder and lightning .
Tips To Avoid Abandoning Your Boat Shortly before we made this passage some good friends of ours had to abandon their boat at sea , off the Pacific Northwest Coast of the US .
They were very experienced sailors – – had been out for 20 years –– and were actually within 200 miles of finishing their circumnavigation .
Our friends encountered some big winds and waves when they got up on the continental shelf of North America , and they decided to run off –– heading downwind .
But they " broached " –– meaning that the the rudder lost control , and the boat turned suddenly sideways to the wind and waves .
And got knocked down hard .
The husband got a serious facial cut from flying debris -- probably wood that had broken off the cockpit coaming .
His wife was temporarily trapped in their sleeping cabin amidst all of the gear that came tumbling out of lockers and cabinets .
Even worse , lots of seawater ended up down below , mixing with the chaotic jumble of gear .
And then the books came off the bookshelves and dissolved to pulp in the seawater .
And plugged the intakes for all five bilge pumps .
So our friends had no way to get the water out .
Faced with an injury , lots of seawater on board , and no working pumps , our friends reluctantly made the decision to trigger their EPIRB satellite rescue beacon .
But , during the hours - long wait for rescue , they reevaluated the situation and decided they could save their boat .
Then the helicopter showed up , at the absolute limit of its fuel supply , and there was no time to debate things .
The Coast Guard rescue swimmer prevailed on them to jump in the water and get winched up into the bird .
And so they flew away , leaving their boat bobbing along by itself .
But this story has a happy ending , because the boat survived and was found less than 2 months later by the Coast Guard .
They towed it into port -- and , because the Coast Guard does not claim salvage rights , our friends got their boat back !
This event made us revisit own preparations .
We had obsessed about these things before we left the US , but that was fifteen years ago .
Anyway , here are our precautions .
First of all , you have to keep the water out .
Most boats sail with their companionway hatch open .
For those of you who are n't boaties , the companionway is the main entrance to the boat , and gets closed up with a vertical hatch board ( or boards ) and a horizontal slider .
( This picture shows our setup in port , with screens and a security hatch board that lets air through . )
When it 's open , it 's a very big hole in the boat -- which no doubt seems even bigger when the boat is upside down ...
This is something that we are pretty diligent about .
We always have the full , watertight hatch board in place and locked when we are at sea .
A lot of boats do n't do this , because it 's awkward to get up and down the companionway .
But we have just made a point of learning to climb over this thing .
Now we can do it without thinking .
We do n't usually close the horizontal slider .
But we 've revisited our plan -- the slider should be closed and locked when conditions get scary .
This is a companionway lock which allows the slider to be secured , but still be opened from both the cockpit and the interior of the boat .
The metal tab slides through a slot in the hatch board , so that it can be secured from the outside with a lock , or , at sea , with a small carabiner .
And then if a person inside the boat needs to get out , they can just pull on that ring , which removes the pin and allows the slider to open up .
Next , we have the question of securing gear .
It 's pretty clear that locker latches and settee cushions can't be expected to contain heavy tools and provisions in a knockdown .
Almost all of the lockers which contain heavy objects like tools get this kind of treatment .
As do the drawers .
But we are reconsidering whether the webbing buckles are adequate .
We might upgrade these -- say by using spectra line instead of webbing .
This is an example of Spectra line used as a tie .
That line does n't look like much , but it 's as strong as steel wire of the same diameter .
And no buckles to pop open .
And there is more going on here .
A previous owner installed four of these nice cabinets , using wood screws fastened vertically to the shelf .
It seemed pretty obvious to us that a hard knock down –– imagine the boat falling off a wave for 15 or 20 feet and landing on her side –– would tear those screws right out of the shelf .
So before we set out from Chicago , Ken bolted the top of each cabinet to the wall behind it .
Here is our solution for settee cushions .
Lots of heavy stuff stored under those cushions ...
And the bookshelves get this treatment .
This netting is held in place by strong bungee cords that hook into fairleads .
In port we just unhook the bunjees and drop the netting back behind the books .
This is part of Dashew 's basic design –– strong , positive locks on all of the reefer and freezer hatches .
Otherwise you add food to the mess .
This heavy toolbox gets strapped down and also sits behind screwed - down cleats that keep it from sliding around .
Again , we might upgrade to spectra line .
And then there are a myriad of small details – – basically everything not in a locker needs to get strapped down .
Okay , so we make a few exceptions .
We have a nice flat screen monitor for watching movies .
It mounts on the wall , but we do n't remotely trust the wall mount at sea .
So it gets strapped down on a settee .
Even the navigation computer needs a strap .
Finally , the floorboards on our friends ' boat may not have been fastened down .
So the pulpy books got down to the bilge pump pickups .
Again this is part of Dashew 's design –– all of the floorboards are screwed down .
This is particularly important for us because we store lots of heavy stuff -- spare pumps and such -- down low under the floorboards .
( Vacuum sealed and wrapped in padding so that they do n't corrode . )
And we 'll finish with a few other details .
Like having strongly fitted lee cloths that will keep you in bed even if you get thrown against them violently .
Again , we 're using lots of spectra here .
Bottom line -- you can't prevent every bad event on a passage ( or in life ) .
But it helps to have a plan .
And to learn from other people 's experience , both good and bad .
December 4 , 2018 - March 3 , 2019 , April 11 , 2019 - July 5 , 2019 Back In New Zealand Again
Do we have to explain why we keep coming back here ?
This is Urquhart 's Bay , at the mouth of the Hatea River leading to Whangarei .
Back at Riverside Drive Marina –– always feels like home .
This was our 12th summer at Riverside .
And Beth gets to re-acquaint herself with her " favorite " tree .
Technically this is called a Pohutukawa , but we just call it a Puka - puka - puka tree .
Unfortunately , Beth seems to be very allergic to these bright red flowers .
She swears that she starts to get stuffed up at least 400 miles out as we approach New Zealand !
Ken is dubious ...
First thing is to get the boat cleaned up after passage .
Like getting rid of this squid that had jumped aboard .
We would consider eating him , but he 's probably past his use - by date …
We also had to solve a few problems that cropped up on passage .
Here Ken disassembles one of the fuel filters .
Evidently we took on some bad fuel , probably in Vanuatu .
It also turns out that new - style Racor filters have a check valve which keeps water from getting to the engine .
That little white ball is supposed to sink in diesel fuel but float in water .
Nice concept , except that Ken is holding a container of diesel fuel here –– and that ball is floating .
Our mechanic tells us that the balls change density after they 've soaked in diesel for enough years .
And when they start to float they completely stop the fuel flow .
Ken registers his feelings .
We just took the ball out of the valve -- after all , this is our polishing filter , so there are other filters protecting the engine .
Plus , this failure wrecked the polishing pump .
And of course we needed to catch up with our many friends in Whangarei .
Here our friend Don introduces his granddaughter Maddy to some new buddies .
Maddy is quite the pistol .
Her favorite thing is leaping off high places into the waiting arms of her dad .
We also got to meet Fatty Goodlander , a famous cruising author who happened to be in town .
Fatty is what you call a raconteur -- with a constant supply of funny stories .
We started trying to get our bodies back in shape after six months on the boat .
Ken peers into an abandoned goldmine .
Which we decided not to explore .
And we stopped to smell the flowers .
We also stopped to admire the improvements that Graham , the new Riverside Drive Marina owner , is pushing forward .
With his own hands .
Graham is a prominent businessman , and quite well off , but he sure is n't afraid to get his hands dirty .
In fact , he may be the hardest working person that we 've ever met .
His staff despairs of keeping up with him .
He 's in his 70's and officially retired !
And when Graham builds something , it stays built .
This is going to be the new barbecue patio , but it has enough steel reinforced concrete to survive a nuclear war .
Rose Riverside had a new resident when we arrived –– a 23 - year - old American woman named Rose .
Who had purchased an old wooden sailboat she planned to sail to the tropics .
It turned out to need quite a lot of work -- surprise !
In fact , Rose ended up replacing all 94 ribs , with help from a ( famous ) local boat builder named Mark Webby . .
Which required driving 3000 new copper rivets !
With hammers !
( The red drips are from traditional red lead paint . )
Hence the " Rosie the Riveter " pose .
Rose is quite a story –– left home at 17 , and spent the last six years riding the rails on trains in the American Southwest .
It turns out that there is a whole subculture of people who do this –– dodging the railroad detectives , who are still called " bulls . "
Rose can expound at length about how to stay camouflaged –– mainly 1 ) do n't move , 2 ) stay in the shadows , and 3 ) do n't wear bright colors .
And she can also explain how to pick the right trains to ride , so that you do n't end up in the wrong place or get stranded somewhere .
Keep in mind that you have to pick the train at night , in the dark , using a red flashlight , while dodging the bulls .
But here 's the thing , underneath the tough exterior , Rose turns out to be thoroughly likeable -- a smart , reasonable person with a good set of values .
We do n't know ( did n't ask ) exactly what set her on this unconventional path .
But she 's come through it remarkably undamaged .
She also listens to advice .
Which makes people want to help her .
When word spread through the New Zealand wooden boat grape vine about Rose 's plight –– a plan to make a very difficult cruising passage in a boat that was presently not seaworthy –– Mark stepped up to help out .
Mark is another person where appearances can be misleading .
He looks like a surfer dude , but he turns out to be one of the most skilled and respected wooden boatbuilders in New Zealand .
Here he slides a plank for Rose 's new bulwark into a propane - fired steaming box .
And after the plank has softened up , Mark and Rose work to clamp it in its new home .
Although Rose is savvy about trains she really did n't know much at all about sailing .
So we tried to help out where we could , with advice and surplus equipment .
Here Beth helps her fit some used foul weather gear that another friend had given to us .
We might say that we took Rose under our wing , except it 's pretty clear from this picture that she would n't fit under our wings !
( This picture may be slightly exaggerated by a wide angle lens .
But we could n't resist ...)
At one point Rose saw the two of us carrying a scuba tank , each holding one end of it .
So she grabbed it , did two or three presses over her head with it , and then carried it to the car for us .
This may explain how she survived her train riding adventures –– who the heck was going to mess with her ?
Rose shows off her answer to the perennial boat yard problem -- you can't get anything done , because everybody who goes by wants to stop and chat .
She makes her living as an artist ( although she now has a sideline in boatbuilding ) .
Here Rose displays an inlay that she is making for her salon table .
Mark 's Concordia Yawl Mark invited us to visit his workshop , where he is building a Concordia Yawl -- possibly the most iconic sailboat ever .
He is the only boat builder outside of the Concordia business who was ever allowed a copy of the plans .
And this may become the last Concordia ever built .
Mark has been working on this boat , in between paying projects , for 25 years .
And it was now within a few weeks of completion .
All of the fittings are bronze , and most are cast and machined by hand .
Mark does n't do the casting himself –– he draws on a network of traditional New Zealand craftsman .
It was quite an honor for us to be invited here , as Mark generally discourages visitors .
He and his wife live almost off the grid , growing most of their own food and surviving without such modern necessities as telephones and computers .
Ken likes to say that Mark lives in the Bronze Age .
Here 's the builder 's plate -- bronze , of course -- awaiting only the completion date .
Update From New Zealand Anyway , here 's the latest word from New Zealand as of 12 months after these pictures were taken .
Mark has launched his boat .
Rose has postponed her voyage while she completes the interior of her own boat and applies for residency in New Zealand .
And gets some coastal sailing experience , thank heavens !
Rose is now working for Mark as a boat builder .
That all seems just great to us .
Getting Back To Real Cruising --
In The Boat Yard Real cruising means doing projects on your boat .
So lots of boat nerd stuff coming up here -- very exciting !
We did n't plan to do much this year .
But you know what they say about the plans of mice and men …
Those two boxes hold 1000 watts of solar panels , fresh from China .
Our old ( semi- flexible ) solar panels had gotten a bit cloudy –– this happens with the soft panels –– although they were still producing plenty of power .
But since the Chinese panels are very cheap , and we were in a good place to get them , we decided to go ahead and put new panels on .
The plan was to just take off the old panels , use their holes as a guide to drill mounting holes in margins of the new ones .
And then mount the new ones .
Should take maybe two days .
But here 's what we found when we removed the old panels .
Because the soft panels mount directly to the carbon fiber bimini , they do n't get a cooling airflow underneath them .
The intense New Zealand UV had evidently caused teeny air pockets in the fairing under the paint to expand until they literally blew craters in the paint .
None of this damage was structural –– the carbon fiber layers were n't involved .
But we needed a repair .
And we needed to keep this from happening again .
Since the damage would all be hidden under the new panels , Ken decided to do the work himself .
Here 's some of the fill , before it gets sanded .
Ken says he can do perfectly fine repair work , as long as it does n't have to look good …
Ken sands away at the fairing , while trying to prevent the UV from blowing holes in his head .
And when we finished repairing the paint , we decided to fit double - skin Lexan panels under the solar panels to insulate the panels from the bimini top .
The open air channels in this material might provide a little bit of cooling for the solar panels as well , but unfortunately polycarbonate is a lousy heat conductor .
But it 's light and strong enough to walk on , which is important .
This whole experience points up the drawbacks of the semi- flexible panels , despite their low cost and light weight .
Anyway , by the time Ken finished all this , a two day job had ended up taking at least four weeks .
This is the normal rule in boat work -- estimate the time needed , then double it and raise it one time unit .
And unfortunately , the drama was n't over , although we did n't know that at the time …
The next chapter to this story happens in Vanuatu , later in this update .
Here 's another " little " project .
Our Spectra water maker has an " ionizer " which puts copper and silver ions into the flush water –– inhibiting marine growth on the membrane and in the filters .
( We clear the ionized water out before we make water -- so we do n't drink the stuff . )
But our ionizer was retrofitted on top of our older system , and it never worked very well –– Ken just could n't slow the water flow down enough to get a strong ion content .
So he finally gave up , and built his own flush control box using an " Arduino " logic board and parts .
That technology let him write a little computer program which controls things in the real world ( via relays ) -- and then download the program into this logic board .
Very cool .
Ken says that he felt like a total nerd –– putting together his teeny circuit board and relay system .
We also bought new chain .
We use high strength G7 chain , which gives us a good strength to weight ratio .
Unfortunately , it 's dangerous to re-galvanize this stuff , so we end up replacing it every few years .
Here Ken works on marking the new chain , so that we can tell how much we have let out when we anchor .
We 've experimented with lots of different marking systems , and finally invented our own .
We tie small bits of uncovered Spectra line onto the chain at 10 meter intervals .
A short bit of line indicates 10 m .
Two short bits indicate 20 m .
And the longer piece means 30 m .
And then we start repeating , so a long and a short means 40 m , and so on .
We just tie a square knot , and then seize the knot with superglue .
These marks never fall off , and you can read them even when they are dirty or covered with mud .
We also use spectra to seize our anchor shackles , again locking our knots in place with superglue .
We use two separate bits of line on each shackle for redundancy .
The point is to keep the shackle pin from unscrewing and falling out on some dark and stormy night at anchor .
Most sailors use wire for this purpose , but we have found that wire can get pinched and broken between the chain and the shackle .
Here is an illustration of the problem .
These are the old seizings that just came off the anchor shackle ( we renew them about once a year , since they will eventually degrade in the UV over a period of 5 or 6 years ) .
You can see that one of the two pieces of line has been drastically pinched and squeezed .
If that were wire , it would have broken –– but the Spectra line just spreads out and takes it .
This line is still plenty strong .
And the backup looks pristine .
Here 's another useful idea .
Most sailors clamp their SSB antennas directly onto the backstay .
Unfortunately , the stranded wire of the backstay will inevitably wick water down into the connection .
As a work - around , sailors will lead the antenna wire downward to the connection , in an attempt to keep the water from working its way up inside the antenna cable .
But even if that succeeds , the actual connection between the backstay and the antenna wire still gets wet and corroded .
We avoid this problem completely .
We always attach our SSB antenna to the swage rather than to the wire itself .
The swage is completely smooth , which allows our tape wrap to make a waterproof seal .
And the swage forms an excellent electrical connection to the wire .
Works great –– our antenna wire usually looks pristine at the end of the season .
And the SSB transmits just fine .
We also used our time in New Zealand to order lots of useful stuff .
Here Beth models a new lycra suit –– we were planning to go to the Marshall Islands , as we thought we might need something lighter than our wetsuits .
Beth also ordered some new eyes .
She had cataract surgery , and loves the results .
She 's back to driving at night again !
Finally , this is someone else 's project , but we thought we 'd show it to you .
It 's an alternative to painting –– shrinkwrap .
Here 's the finished product .
( The vertical streaks are just watermarks from rain –– they will wash off . )
A close - up .
Apparently , you can repair this stuff relatively easily .
We 're not sure how you would go about removing it , however .
March 3 , 2019 - April 9 , 2019 Back In The USA Time to make our annual pilgrimage back to see family and friends .
Culture Shock In San Diego
This time , however , we had another mission .
We need to find a place to retire when we stop working .
( Working on the boat , that is . )
San Diego has always been very high on our list , because of the great climate .
But recently Ken has been getting cold feet –– kind of worried about the crowds and the traffic and the general scene .
So we decided to spend a week in San Diego to see if we could envision living there .
We stayed in an Air B&B rental in a really nice little neighborhood not too far from the water .
One point for Beth .
You could definitely tell we were in California !
And then we started noticing these little blue and white signs down by the curb .
Of course we were staying in a vacation rental !
Seems that we had walked into the middle of a local dispute .
We even heard stories of tourists getting their tires slashed .
We totally get this .
We probably would n't want to live next to a vacation rental either .
But Ken took this as a point on his side .
This is what happens when the place gets too crowded , and touristy .
We took an evening stroll and walked by this car dealership .
Yup –– that 's right .
The price is 1.5 million .
And if you really squint at the fine print , you will notice that this is a used car !
Another point for Ken. Hmmm ...
Have we got a deal for you !
Only nine dollars to have someone inject botulism into your mouth !!
Ken is pulling ahead .
In desperation , Beth took us to the grocery store .
Every fruit and vegetable you can imagine , plus 5000 varieties of coffee .
Point to Beth .
And a convenient store so that you always have something to wear to parties …
Point to Ken .
Okay , that 's worth at least three points for Beth !
Hmmm ...
We have felt for a while that it is stupid to put people in prison for marijuana .
But we did n't quite imagine billboard advertisements …
No points awarded .
Some of our longest - term friends –– Bob and Pauline –– came out to visit us in San Diego .
They live up in the San Francisco Bay area , but at least we would be in the same state with them .
That 's worth a lot of points .
Could almost be the same couple that sailed out of Chicago 15 years ago .
As long as you do n't enlarge the picture !
We took a hike with Bob and Pauline in the Torrey Pines State Reserve .
Stunning scenery .
And also , we got to talking with some of the " docents , " who look after the park and show visitors around .
And we realized that we had a lot in common with those people .
Retired people with an interest in the outdoors , and the time and energy to be proactive .
Not bunkered down .
We could probably find some friends in that community .
Points for Beth .
And flowers .
More points for Beth .
But , if you look closely , you will see the wire guardrail holding us back from the edge of the cliff .
The whole place is pretty heavily regulated -- docents , after all -- and you are n't going to find any solitude –– not exactly wilderness .
So that has to subtract a few points from Beth 's score .
Then we wandered down onto the beach .
Several points for Beth .
But of course , the camera always lies .
Because it only shows what is directly in front of it .
And if you step back , and look at the bigger picture , you can see what Ken is worried about .
So no net points awarded at the beach .
And we visited the aircraft carrier Midway –– now a Naval Museum .
Ken got to see a real Dauntless dive bomber –– the plane that won the battle of Midway , and one of Ken 's all time favorites .
And Beth got to play around with the electronic equipment in the Combat Information Center ( CIC ) in the carrier .
Reminded her of the CIC on Eagle 's Wings !
The Cruising Information Center , that is ...
The carrier was fun , but not the sort of thing that you would do often if you lived there .
No points awarded .
Anytime we 're back in the States , we have to go shooting .
This is really Ken 's thing , but Beth was looking to humor him .
So this is a point for Beth .
But , there 's always this side to the shooting scene .
Much as he loves to shoot , Ken admits that this is a bit over - the - top .
In the end , none of this has anything to do with California or San Diego anyway –– this is general to the whole USA .
So no net points awarded at the range .
We took a hiking trip with Bob and Pauline in the Anza - Borrego Desert State Park east of San Diego .
The recent rains had set the desert alive with flowers .
This is a pretty nice resource , and a place we could visit frequently –– although not in the summer .
But it 's a long car ride to get there .
One point to Beth .
We only scratched the surface , but that 's our summary of San Diego so far –– a lot of pluses and minuses .
The jury is still out .
Then we moved on to Chicago to visit our friends Debbie and David .
David shows off a new skill at a local wildlife center .
We decided not to try that trick with this guy .
This video shows why : Snake ( 39 seconds )
And , as usual , Debbie and David took us to the Orchid Show at the Highland Park Botanical Gardens .
Always really special .
And we visited the local supermarket .
Which includes a " bone bar " for your dog .
Hmmm ...
And here 's another place which is becoming a tradition for us when we visit Chicago –- the local Abt Electronics -- an over - the - top appliance store .
Here 's the perfect range to cook your morning eggs .
And a bargain , too .
Marked down $ 4,000 for some scratches .
So basically , the $ 4,000 markdown is about 50 % more than we paid for our first car .
Hmmm ...
Then we moved on to Wisconsin to visit our friends Debbie and Tim .
Here
Tim shows what it takes to win on the ice .
And here he shows what it takes to be able to walk after winning on the ice .
This pneumatic thingy squeezes the juices up out of your legs and back where they belong .
Ken wonders if they make something like that to squeeze the juices back into your brain …
We have deep ties to the midwest , with lots of very good friends in Wisconsin and Illinois .
Now if they could just do something about the weather ...
April 11 , 2019 - July 5 , 2019 Good Bye To New Zealand
We flew back to New Zealand to make ready for sea .
But in the back of our minds we knew that we were coming to the end of our long relationship with New Zealand .
We plan to sail back at least one more time –– but we can see the writing on the wall .
We stopped for a few nights in Auckland , to enjoy the energy and the fantastic restaurant scene .
It 's a seafaring town .
With an amazing racing tradition .
Here is KZ - 1 , the famous " aircraft carrier " which Dennis Connor beat with the first America 's Cup catamaran .
Now they race for the Cup on foiling catamarans that hit 40 knots !
And the Kiwis are still big players .
Auckland has a blooming , booming nightlife .
A beautiful and exciting city .
But honestly , we prefer the more provincial attractions of Whangarei .
This is a traveling caravan / circus –– about 40 homemade camper vans traveling as a group and giving shows throughout the North Island .
Offering the locals mysterious and sometimes badly needed elixirs .
Along with entertainment for the kids .
If you look closely , you can see how this homemade merry - go - round gets its power .
The operator powers it with a bicycle pedal !
Traveling artisans hammer out their art .
And weave their magic .
This girl gets to do what a lot of teenagers probably dream about –– stick swords through her father 's head …
Oddly enough , he survived !
And once the show is over , they pack it all up to move on to the next town .
This was great fun –– a carnival without the sleaze .
These are our long - term cruising buddies Steve and Lindsay of s/v Jemellie .
They are Brits , although actually they hail from the Jersey Channel Islands .
That 's an important difference these days , particularly since the Islands have a special relationship with the EU .
They get all the commercial and trade benefits , but are exempt from the rules about freedom of movement for workers .
That 's probably a deal that Britain would 've loved …
Steve and Lindsay were housesitting a place about an hour 's drive from Whangarei , and we drove up to spend the night .
And do some fantastic hiking along the coast .
And the thing is , this time the camera does n't lie .
This is the way life is out there , and there 's nothing hiding just outside the frame .
Except some sheep .
But Steve and Lindsay are looking to sell their boat and move back to Jersey .
And so it 's goodbye –– hopefully not forever .
Here 's a little music back at Riverside .
These musical cruisers called themselves the " Barnacle Pickers . "
They had some serious musical talent .
Delivered with some serious enthusiasm .
They included our friend Nancie , who is a concert violinist .
( As well as her husband Art , who was a symphony conductor . )
We 've been friends for years with Art and Nancie , on s/v " Second Wind . "
But now they too are planning to pack it up and head back to the US for good .
" Second Wind " pulls away from the dock at Riverside for the last time .
This is a well - known downside of cruising –– you are always saying goodbye to your friends .
Hopefully we will meet up again in the States .
But we have to focus on getting ready for our own trip , making last - minute fixes and gathering our provisions .
We hope to summer in the Marshall Islands next season -- which would mark the first time in 12 years that we have not returned to Whangarei .
Here Beth stocks up on spices to last the duration .
And , because we are n't coming back next summer , we decided to finally sell our little Toyota station wagon .
Derf , as she is affectionately known ( because of the first three letters in her license plate ) , had been in our family since 2006 .
She was built in 1997 , making her at once the oldest car we have ever owned and the car we have owned for the longest time .
And basically trouble - free !
Toyota knows how to build them .
Our friends Don and Janet kindly offered to sell her for us , so that we could keep using Derf right up until we left the dock .
Ode to Whangarei Seeing the end of the run makes you appreciate things more .
Like Whangarei .
Whangarei is an unassuming working town –– a supply hub for the surrounding dairy farms .
Which gives it a delightfully high ratio of hydraulic shops , machine shops , electrical and plumbing supply outlets and such compared to less essential services like Saks Fifth Avenue …
Turns out that dairy farmers need a lot of the same technology that sailors use !
Whangarei is n't known for its architecture , although the Town Council tries .
Here 's a major " tourist attraction " in town –– the new lifting bridge , which dutifully opens at noon so tourists can snap pictures .
Tourists ?
Well , actually , there will soon be a new " Hundertwasser " art gallery which should be spectacular , and will hopefully draw more visitors .
And we admit , as bridges go , the Hatea River bridge is pretty cool .
Even if it gets stuck closed on hot days , and also can't be opened in over 30 knots of wind .
The Town Council may have put form a little bit ahead of function on this one .
The nightlife might not compare to Auckland , but it suits us -- Tuesday night at McMorrisey 's Pub .
And , of course , Riverside Drive Marina has been our home for a long time .
A bit more personal and friendly than those big marinas in Auckland .
A spot light projects a perfect image of s/v Hydra on the back end of the paint tent .
( You can always recognize Hydra by her namesake -- the twin wind vanes . )
Even when Whangarei tries to be intimidating , it can't quite pull it off …
Here 's that dock in action , with the Shackleton Sea Scouts presiding .
Another Whangarei landmark -- the canopy bridge .
Home to Saturday art and food festivals in the summer .
The Town Council created a 3 mile path which connects the canopy bridge , the lifting bridge , and this pedestrian bridge into a very inviting walking loop .
It gets lots of use , in all seasons and all times of day .
When we hike the loop , we usually have to budget extra time for talking to all the friends that we are sure to encounter .
Here 's Riverside 's competition , the Town Basin Marina , viewed from the walking trail .
And the Council has been adding artwork along the way , like this sculpture of a Maori war club .
The giant sundial at the clock museum .
And finally , a couple of views from the Hatea bridge at sunset .
Our kind of town .
But enough sentimentality .
We have places to go and adventures to seek .
( And we will indeed find some ... )
" A ship in a harbor is safe , but that is not what ships are for . "
July 5 , 2019 - July 11 , 2019 Sailing To Vanuatu
We left in mild conditions .
Except for squalls .
But those can give you rainbows !
And some nice sunsets .
Mostly we had some pretty nice sailing .
With the wind vane keeping us on course .
Ken was still experimenting with his new camera equipment , and put together a short video to show what sailing feels like on passage in nice conditions : Sailing ( 2:07 minutes )
We log our position every hour , and Beth marks our progress every 6 hours on a paper chart .
We mostly navigate with electronic charts , but we think it 's very important to have paper charts and keep our position updated on them .
Electronics can fail .
And then we ran out of wind , and had to turn the engine on .
Fortunately , Don and Janet had given us this emergency signalling kit in case we ran out of fuel .
It 's a chocolate bar , of course .
A Harbinger Of Trouble
And then , as we approached Vanuatu after an uneventful passage , something bad happened .
How bad , we did n't realize …
We suddenly felt a strong vibration when the propeller was turning .
It went away when we took the engine out of gear , and got worse when the engine was in gear and revved up .
We had experienced something like this in the past , when part of our propeller zinc had fallen off , unbalancing the prop .
So we figured that was the most likely explanation .
We were able to control the vibration by slowing the engine down .
And then the wind built back in , so we decided to wait until we got to port to address the problem .
But , oddly enough , when we got to port the propeller zinc was intact .
And the cutlass bearing and shaft couplings were fine .
And the vibration seemed to have disappeared .
We really did n't know what to think about this …
Maybe something had fouled the propeller for a while ?
Weird ...
With hindsight , we should of treated this like a VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM , and gotten to the bottom of it .
Complacency is the enemy ...
July 11 , 2019 - July 25 , 2019 Back In The Tropics Beth had finagled special permission for us to stop at the southernmost island of Vanuatu –– Aneityum -- before we finished our official check - in in Port Vila , further north .
So we anchored in the bay off the village of Aneghowhat , on the southwestern tip of the island .
The people here live a semi-traditional village life .
But Aneityum has also become a favorite destination for cruise ships –– looking to show their passengers what a traditional village life looks like .
" Traditional " villages that get thousands of visitors every few weeks .
Hmmm ...
But actually , the villagers here have figured out how to handle this .
They stage all the cruise ship events on Mystery Island –- an uninhabited island out in the bay .
On " cruise ship days , " people converge from the several villages on the island to put on shows , sell their handicrafts , and cook food for the tourists .
The tourists end up quarantined ( but entertained and happy ) , and the villages do n't get overrun by thousands of visitors .
As a result , the villagers have remained friendly and unjaded .
Which is also good for business , of course .
And then they return to their nice quiet villages with a little bit of money in their pockets .
So the locals get to enjoy village life without the financial strains that a lot of the more isolated villages are feeling now .
People in Vanuatu pay to send their children to elementary school .
The fees do n't sound like much to Americans , but for villagers with absolutely no cash economy , they can be a real problem .
But the people here do n't have to worry about that .
So we have to admit that the cruise ships can be a good thing , sometimes .
[ Except when a pandemic hits -- ed. ]
We were eager to get back into the water –– remember , Ken needed to check out that prop zinc .
Plus Ken was eager to test out his new Nikon Z7 underwater camera gear .
We found some interesting diving , although the conditions were a bit challenging .
The reefs off Aneghowhat are pretty exposed in strong trade wind conditions .
We had heard there was good diving on the north side of the island -- in more sheltered water .
So we took Eagle 's Wings around to Anawamet Bay .
The local chief 's son , Noke , immediately came out to greet us .
And initiate trading .
We ended up with quite a collection of produce , including these giant beans .
All of it was very welcome after a passage at sea .
We traded an old rope –– still quite serviceable and worth some money –– for a bunch of fruits and vegetables .
That seemed like an ok deal .
You do have to know where to draw the line , however .
On the last day of our stay , Noke came out to visit again .
And this time he asked for some gasoline , explaining that it had n't been available in Anaeghowhat on his last trip over there on cruise ship day .
Now there was another cruise ship day coming up , and he did n't have enough gasoline to get there .
So could we possibly spare some ?
We said yes , but explained that we would have to charge the market price .
We said that gasoline was expensive , and we could n't afford to be giving it away .
Also , if the word got around , then every time a cruising boat pulled into a village somewhere everyone would line up waiting for their free gasoline !
Noke took this under advisement and said that he would check and see if he could find some in the village .
If not , he would come back .
Amazingly enough , he found some in the village .
In any event , we were happy to be diving again .
This creature is a type of sea cucumber or beche de mer .
And this is an Eagle Ray .
Which gave us a really good look .
Beth has had a very persistent problem with mask fogging .
She breathes a little bit through her nose , despite her best efforts –– Ken can often see bubbles coming out of the top of her mask .
So we experimented with the nose plug , improvised from a small Carpenters clamp .
Unfortunately , this was not a great success …
We also found a few interesting nudibranchs , like this Phylidia Picta .
And then there is this guy –– a Blue Dragon –– who is incredibly ornate and weird looking .
Ken gets frustrated photographing Blue Dragons , because they blend in so well with their background .
You have to look really closely at this picture , particularly just right of the center , to see what 's going on .
This Dragon has horns like a Texas Longhorn , just to the right of the black widow - style white mark on the dragon 's head .
Against a plain background this critter would be unforgettable .
But in his native environment you can barely see him .
Of course , the diving community considers it very bad form to molest the wildlife –– say by inserting a black card underneath a Dragon !
Some of the aquatic wildlife does n't wait for you to molest them –– these sea snakes like to take a snooze on something dry .
Like our swim platform .
Since their venom is usually fatal , it seemed like a good idea to chase this one off .
We 've done this many times .
In reality they are not aggressive , and their mouths are too small to pose much of a danger to humans .
July 25 , 2019 - November 19 , 2019 Port Vila
After about two weeks in Aneityum , we headed north to Port Vila , with quick overnight stops at Erromango and Tanna on the way .
And took the opportunity to do some productive fishing !
Ken demonstrates how it 's actually possible to sleep in our pilothouse …
Vila has become one of our favorite places –– a safe harbor , with good markets and good restaurants , practically no crime , and within easy reach of good diving .
Here is the view from the Iririki Island Resort –– which has some nice restaurants that are open to cruisers .
We took a walk along the coast to stretch our legs after all that time on the boat .
And encountered this inquisitive mama pig .
With a bunch of little ones .
( What do you call a group of pigs , anyway ? )
She wanted to know if our camera tasted good …
Our immediate passage repairs were very minor –– just this broken Antal batten car .
We 've had a lot of trouble with these things , and we now carry a full set of spares –- one for each batten .
And this Whale solid - state water sensor failed inside of our gray water box .
We replaced it with a spare , but we have subsequently discovered that these things have a flaw –– they tend to develop a leak between the plastic body and the potted electronics , which lets enough water in to kill the switch .
It 's a shame , because we love the Whale pumps , and find them highly reliable .
But the switches are n't ready for prime time .
But there were bigger issues out there , some of which we knew about , and some of which we did n't …
For one thing , our new solar panels stopped working !
The power output just slowly dropped off , and then basically quit altogether .
After a week or so in Vila we only had one panel that was actually working .
This is a bad problem .
Without the panels , we end up running our little Kubota diesel 3 to 4 hours a day .
With the panels our runtime drops to about an hour in Vila , and to nothing at all in a sunny location .
Also , it 's very difficult to get lead acid batteries fully charged without solar panels , as you end up running a diesel engine for hours at a stretch just to put in tiny amounts of power .
( And if you do n't get lead acid batteries fully charged about once a week , they will " sulfate " and lose capacity . )
Let 's just say that solar panels are " mission critical " on Eagle 's Wings .
We did a little exploratory surgery on one of the failed panels –– by opening up the connector box .
Warning : some boat nerd stuff follows here .
The panels use very simple construction –– the cells are tied together with foil strips inside the plastic laminate .
And then the strips come together and exit under the connector box .
This picture shows one of the foils sticking up out of the plastic , but the other foil just crumbled and broke off at the surface , leaving only a small black spot .
And here 's what the fitting looked like inside the connector box .
The foil on the right looks clean and shiny –– right up to where Ken had cut it off .
While the foil on the left looks like it's been through a nuclear war , and just fell apart without cutting .
Here 's what we think happened .
When Ken installed the new panels back in New Zealand , he had intentionally shorted the positive and negative leads together for each panel , in order to protect them from moisture .
Although it sounds weird , this is something that you should be able to do with solar panels –– unlike alternators or batteries or generators , solar panels can't output more than a fixed number of amps .
And their hardware should be sized to take the maximum output .
Ken had done this plenty of times in the past with other panels .
But the Chinese company had upgraded the power on these panels , and evidently had n't upgraded the foil .
So , running at maximum output in the intense New Zealand summer heat and UV , the foils had burned right up .
We were disappointed at this failure , and we wo n't hook the leads together again .
But this should n't be a problem in normal service , since it 's almost impossible to reach maximum output once you put a load on the system .
In any event , we decided our best option was to order a new set of panels for shipment to Port Vila .
As always , Shine Solar in China allowed us to place a custom order for a wide border and a special orientation of the control boxes .
We used DHL to bring them in .
It took more than a month to get the panels manufactured and shipped , but they got to us intact .
And Ken drilled yet another set of holes in yet another set of panels .
We like to work on projects like this under our tent on deck .
Much better than working out in the sun and rain .
And soon we were cooking again .
There are a lot of numbers in these solar panel control displays , but the ones that count are on the second line , on the right - hand side in each display .
The controller on the left is putting out 34.1 Amps , and the controller on the right is putting out 31.2 Amps .
Not bad for a sailboat !
This meter shows the net power going into the batteries ( after some gets siphoned off by various boat systems . )
We were very happy .
And so far , about six months later , we are still happy .
At least with the solar panels ...
We had intended to explore the northern islands of Vanuatu , but the problem with the solar panels kept us in Vila .
But no matter –– because the diving is great around Vila .
An Ornate Butterflyfish .
At first , Ken had a lot of problems getting his new Nikon Z7 to focus quickly and accurately underwater .
For a couple of weeks he felt that he had made an expensive mistake with the new camera and housing .
But eventually he discovered some obscure menu settings that made all the difference .
So now the camera focuses better than our previous camera .
And Ken loves the fact that he can shoot video .
Plus the ergonomics are exceptional , both in and out of the water .
This Whip Gobi was hiding on a mooring chain only about a meter below the surface .
It was a windy day , and Ken was getting surged around by the waves .
But , obviously , the camera grabbed perfect focus .
We wo n't talk about the camera settings here , but anyone who wants to use a Z7 underwater should contact us .

The big fish goes into a kind of trance , opening its mouth and gills .
And the wrasses will crawl right in amongst the predator 's teeth without any fear of being eaten !
Some Highfin Blennies .
You have to squint at this picture a little bit – – but this shows a Spotted Shrimp Goby and his shrimp partner .
The shrimps are good at digging holes , but they have terrible eyesight .
So the Goby stands watch while the shrimp digs .
And then they both share the same hole .
Notice how the Goby is giving Ken the evil eye , while the shrimp is oblivious .
If the Goby twitches his tail , then they will both disappear instantly into their burrow .
Here 's another look at the partners .
And here 's a little video that we think you will enjoy : Teamwork ( 2:57 minutes ) A Blackspotted Puffer .

An adult Spotted Boxfish .
Coral close - up .
And a predator .
The local dive shop –– Big Blue –– had been doing a fantastic job of fighting the Crown of Thorns starfish outbreak near Port Vila .
So for a while we were n't seeing any of these vicious coral eaters .
But eventually , as we moved out to more remote dive sites , we found them .
Heaps of them .
There are probably 8 or 9 big COTS in this picture .
These guys can lay waste to an entire coastline of coral in just a few seasons .
And the coral will take decades to come back , if it ever does .
The outbreaks used to happen maybe every 50 years in most places , but they seem to be more frequent now .
Combined with all the other stress that coral faces they can be a real gut punch .
But areas with a dedicated dive community can stop them .
And the Port Vila area has a lot of great coral to protect .
We could n't just walk away from this .
So we dug out our killing equipment .
And mixed up our witches brew of bile salts .
Ken always uses a mask when he 's working with this stuff .
It 's easy enough to handle in small quantities .
But he got a scare back in New Zealand while decanting a 5 kg container into smaller packages .
That raised a lot of very lightweight dust .
And then Ken went off into a corner , lifted his mask for an instant to use his phone , and breathed .
He coughed for six weeks –– and for a while felt that he might never dive again .
Ken is fully recovered now .
But we are VERY careful .
The bile salts are pretty harmless once they 're mixed up –– you could probably drink the stuff , as your stomach lining can take it .
But it 's an enzyme which digests meat , and your lungs are just meat .
And it only takes a 10th of a gram of the powder to kill a COTS the size of a turkey platter .
So , yeah , do n't breathe the stuff .
Or get it in your eyes …
Beth prepares for the hunt .
It was always gratifying to return to the same area the next day to find only bits and pieces of the COTS that we had injected on the previous dive .
The COTS become agitated within a couple of minutes of being injected .
And as soon as they show distress , fish of all kinds begin to attack them .
By the next day there 's almost nothing left except fat fish .
Very quickly , the fish began following us around –– looking for their next meal .
Beth even thought that some of the fish were trying to show her where the COTS were hiding .
Ken is a bit dubious about that …
But for sure , in the animal kingdom it does n't pay to show weakness !
The COTS killing took over , and we ended up staying in Vila and just hunting for the rest of the season .
Sometimes , we would both take injection guns –– when we felt we had a particularly large concentration to attack .
But most of the time Ken carried the camera , scouted for COTS and shot video , while Beth did most of the actual execution .
Ken was shocked that his wife of 38 years turned out to be a real hunter - killer .
He used to bow hunt for deer , and Beth would never have any part of that .
But COTS bring out her killer instinct ...
By the end of the season , we had killed about 500 of them .
That 's just a drop in the bucket compared to what Big Blue has done , but we felt good about it .
And Ken put together his first serious video effort .
We call it : Killing Dragons ( 15:59 minutes )
Peering into every nook and cranny in the coral offers some unexpected payoffs .
Like these baby white tip sharks hiding under a big plate coral .
Plus dramas like this nudibranch trying to get out of the way of an agitated , distressed COTS .
Killing COTS began to feel a bit like a job –– but an important job that we looked forward to tackling .
And then we could enjoy some well - deserved time off with our friends Wendy and Dave on " Elysium " -– exploring the restaurant scene in Vila .
And observing the local boat scene .
This is " Dragonfly , " which belongs to Sergey Brin , one of the founders of Google .
We 're not big on powerboats , or super yachts , but you had to admire this one .
She has an extremely efficient hull shape .
And and even larger length to beam ratio than Eagle 's Wings .
Which allows her to easily exceed her theoretical hull speed of a little over 20 kn .
Apparently she can cruise –– efficiently –– at more than 25 kn .
Definitely more appealing than your typical gin palace .
And we had to deal with the usual unexpected breakdowns .
The mounting feet on our dive compressor suddenly all failed at the same time .
That caught us by surprise –– a spare part that we did n't carry !
That wo n't happen again !
We were using our wonderful new four - stroke , 20 horse Mercury engine to dinghy an 8 mile round - trip every day to our dive site .
And we started cracking the false floor in our dinghy –– scuba tanks bouncing up and down when we flew off waves .
So Ken decided that he needed to beef up the dinghy floor with some plywood panels .
Here 's a finished product in the bottom of the dinghy –– it 's totally stopped the problem .
And it 's really been necessary , since our poor dinghy now has to accommodate our dive tanks , camera gear , and two underwater scooters !
But that 's a story we 'll get into in a later update .
We also had to deal with the shortcomings of the supermarkets in Port Vila .
Namely that the toilet paper was too luxurious .
We like to use single - ply toilet paper .
Because double - ply can plug up a marine head , with unspeakable results .
We have pictures , but you do n't want to see them …
So , anyway , we ended up having to split double - ply roles in order to make our own single - ply toilet paper .
If you had told us 15 years ago that we would be spending our time like this , we would n't have believed it .
[ Actually , in light of current conditions , our readers might find our technique useful .... ed. ]
Here 's another kind of repair we might 've found surprising .
Although , actually , Beth has always been a frugal Wisconsin girl !
And here 's another shortcoming of the local supermarkets .
They carry knockoff Oreo cookies ( made in India ) .
Definitely inferior to the real thing .
Compare the cream filling on the package to the reality !
A quick tip .
Do n't tie your mooring lines on like this !
Just visualize what will happen as this boat starts to horse back and forth in a stiff breeze , drawing the boat 's two mooring lines through the rope eyes .
This set up could chafe through and break loose in one blustery night .
It 's much better to take the starboard line back to the starboard cleat , and the port line back to the port cleat .
We spoke to the family on board about this , and they changed their set up .
They were very nice people –– just a little inexperienced .
And we do n't mean to pick on them , either , as we see this kind of thing all the time .
But we have a policy –– if we see something that is safety - related , we always speak up .
Even if it 's none of our business …
We will end our discussion of Port Vila by talking about this amazingly versatile beauty shop .
We watched in awe , as they advertised a new specialty every week .
With something for everybody .
This probably would n't cut it with the politically correct crowd in the US .
But blackface was never a thing in Vanuatu –– basically everybody here is black , except for the tourists and a few ex-pats .
So nobody got offended .
And here 's the pièce de résistance .
We are n't quite sure what this is all about .
But whatever this is , you probably do n't want to get it in the same shop that will also slather mud on your face …
November 19 , 2019 - December 2 , 2019 Ken and Beth Step Into The Twilight Zone
And then life got surreal .
And it has n't really stopped ...
December was here , and the cyclone season started to loom over us .
We had a new plan this year –– instead of going back to New Zealand , we would head north , across the equator to the Marshall Islands .
The Marshalls can get occasional cyclones , but it would be winter up there in the northern hemisphere –– so not the cyclone season .
We had planned to follow the blue route on the right , heading almost straight north .
But at the last minute we diverted instead to the blue route on the left , toward the Solomon Islands , adding about 400 miles to the trip .
Why ?
We went out of our way on the advice of our weather router , Bruce Buckley .
He alerted us to a developing cyclone that would cross our path if we sailed due north .
And he was right .
This forecast shows the expected weather three days ahead .
At the time we downloaded the forecast our boat was located at the purple boat icon .
And we were expecting to reach the gray boat icon in three days , when this weather pattern would apply .
Heading straight north from Port Vila would have taken us into the path of this developing tropical cyclone .
There was a reasonable chance that this thing could come to Port Vila , so we really did n't want to remain passively on our mooring .
So we went around it !
We would never have had the confidence to try this on our own , without advice from Bruce .
This is n't the first time that we had danced with a tropical cyclone .
But we had never before tried to predict exactly where one would form up , and how it would move .
We do n't have that expertise …
Our plan was to get behind the cyclone , and then turn right and ride the South winds on the backside of the low -- it 's called doing a slingshot .
We ended up getting really close to the Solomon Islands –– close enough to see some shore birds -- because the developing storm had gotten huge , and we wanted to give it some elbow room .
The key to dancing with cyclones is not getting your toes stepped on !
And then we made our turn , with nice strong winds on the starboard quarter .
It was a bit spooky -– heading straight for this thing .
The models are n't tuned for cyclones , so the winds at the center will be much stronger than what shows here .
But the cyclone ( named Rita ) was moving away to the southeast at a pretty rapid rate .
So our real problem was to stay close enough to keep some good winds for as long as possible .
In the end , it worked out beautifully .
We had a lot of good wind and all we saw of Rita were a few squalls .
This had been a weather routing tour de force on Bruce 's part .
The Worst Advice Ever And Bruce 's performance looked even more spectacular when we compared it with advice from a different weather router .
Through a combination of circumstances , we ended up hiring two routers for this passage .
( Because Bruce had a scheduled vacation , which ended up not being a problem . )
And the other guy ( who operates out of Hawaii ) routed us right in front of the storm , with the following comment :
At the present time there is no tropical cyclone warnings or suspect areas over your sailing area .
There is some deep convection over the Solomons , but that is insufficient to develop a tropical cyclone .
We would never complain because the weather does n't follow a forecast -- that goes with the territory .
Except that Bruce had already predicted the storm .
And the other guy never corrected his advice , even when the cyclone was in full swing !
Plus he still insisted on getting paid !
And in his last email to us , he said that we had sailed " unnecessary miles " because we did n't listen to his advice -- this was after the cyclone had fully brewed up and gotten an offical name !
Yikes !
By the way , his motto is " PREDICT , PROVIDE , PROTECT . "
We decided his $ 100 fee was worth it for the entertainment value .
We did have one serious problem as we squeezed by the cyclone .
Beth got thrown into a counter in our aft head , breaking the toilet paper holder and cracking a rib in her back .
So she had to wear a padded life jacket for the rest of the trip .
Kind of miserable , as it got hotter and hotter .
Ken was very impressed that Beth did n't miss a single watch as a result of her injury .
But we did have to plan things so that he could help out with sail changes , since Beth really could n't pull on ropes or work the winches for a few days .
The toilet paper holder did n't fare so well either …
Disaster After 5 1/2 days of terrific sailing , our wind ran out as we sailed into the dead zone or " col " on top of the cyclone .
Time for the " iron genny . "
And that 's when disaster struck .
Ken started the engine just as Beth came on deck for her night watch .
And when he put it in gear , we heard a horrible grinding , screeching noise coming from the engine room .
Kind of like your car muffler had come loose and was dragging on the pavement .
At 50 mph !
The noise stopped as soon as Ken went to neutral .
Ken checked the transmission fluid and all of the couplings , rotated the shaft by hand , and then tried again to put the engine into gear .
This time it worked , but with a very strong vibration .
Clearly a transmission problem .
Probably related to that event from six months earlier , on the way to Vanuatu .
We managed to keep it running ( slowly ) for the next few days -- but one time it brought the engine to a crashing halt when we tried to start it .
This was bad !
Ken got it started again .
At this point we had a decision to make .
Our destination , Majuro , in the Marshall Islands lay about 600 miles north of us .
New Zealand lay about 2000 miles to the south .
With the tropical cyclone season in full swing down there ...
On the other hand , we knew that we could get good mechanical help in New Zealand , whereas we were n't likely to find much in Majuro .
We made an Iridium call to our mechanic back in New Zealand , Tim Brown .
Tim thought our best bet would be to replace the transmission entirely .
Majuro has very good shipping connections to the United States , and we were confident we could get a new transmission shipped there .
And Tim told us that the transmission could be swapped out in the water .
Unfortunately , he thought we would probably have to move the whole engine in order to do that .
Here 's our engine installation .
The transmission sits at the far end of the engine , back in the corner , right up against the bulkhead .
You can't even see it in this picture .
( We have a reversing transmission , so the shaft runs under the engine and out of the boat to the left in this picture . )
And the tranny weighs 130 pounds .
So you can see why Tim wanted us to shift the engine in order to get to it .
But there 's no direct overhead access to hoist the engine , which weighs an additional 478 lbs .
This was n't going to be easy …
We made some Iridium calls to contacts in Majuro , who told us that other cruisers had managed to swap out their transmissions there .
We decided to press on .
Across the Equator
And we finally crossed the equator , for only the second time in our 15 years of sailing !
This was less exciting than it looks on the computer . :-)
For a long time , we kept enough wind to sail slowly .
( Those are our watch ducks , Hughie and Louie . )
This Equatorial zone is famous for having lots of squalls and no real wind .
But it turns out that cyclone Rita had sucked most of the thunderstorm energy out of the ITCZ .
So , while we got chased by a few squalls , they mostly just gave us beautiful sunsets .
And sometimes no wind at all .
But at least the engine cooperated and we were able to keep going .
With no engine , this would be a very long trip .
And Now the Sails Don't Work !
Then things got worse .
The night before we arrived in Majuro , we ran into some squalls on Ken 's watch , at about one in the morning .
The wind built to about 25 kn , so Ken decided to roll in our big headsail –– called the Genoa .
And all at once , the clew ring pulled completely out of the sail , allowing it to flog madly in the strong winds .
Here 's a picture of our Genoa in nicer conditions .
It 's the forward sail .
You can just barely see the clew ring in this picture –– it 's the small steel ring where those lines attach .
With those lines released , the Genoa will begin to flap like a giant flag .
This can quickly destroy it .
Ken furled the sail , but with the clew no longer attached , there was no way to keep it from unrolling .
So Ken had to go up on the bow , in the squall , in the middle of the night , and wrap the Genoa like a maypole , using our three spare halyards –– two spinnaker halyards and one spare Genoa halyard .
Ken says the whole thing was kind of surrealistic .
There was an icy rain pouring down from the squall , and lightning all around on the horizon –– although too far away to hear the thunder .
And then periodically he would get drenched by a wave .
But the seawater was about 85 °F , so getting hit by the wave was kind of nice in the cold rain .
Ken was wearing his usual tropical uniform –– a PFD , boxer shorts , and sea boots .
He stayed clipped in to a fitting in the center of the boat –– so even if he got knocked off his feet by a wave , he could n't go overboard .
Anyway , he got the thing under control without having to wake Beth up .
Beth was very impressed !
Here 's what the damaged sail looked like up close .
The clew ring had broken right through five pieces of Spectra webbing .
And that webbing had been protected by a Sunbrella UV cover , which completely hid it from the sun .
Here 's the picture once we removed the Sunbrella cover .
We do n't know what to say about this –– the Spectra should have been strong enough .
Well , at least we know how to repair this , and we can double up on the Spectra tapes so that this will never happen again !
But this will be a big job ...
And so we limped into Majuro , in maybe our worst shape ever after a passage .
With a broken transmission , a broken sail , and a broken rib .
And things were going to get worse before they got better …
December 2 , 2019 - March 22 , 2020 Majuro Majuro has a mixed reputation among cruisers .
The Marshall Islands cover about 180,000 square miles of ocean , and include 29 major atolls .
It has a population of about 58,000 -- up from just 15,000 in 1960 , and many fewer in 1946 .
Practically the entire population lives on just two of those atolls , mostly in " urban " areas .
And a majority -- maybe 40,000 people -- currently live on Majuro .
That 's a lot of people , for an island where you can often stand in the middle of the narrow strip of land and see the shoreline on both sides .
( All of the blue and white area on this chart is water -- the land is the light brown strip .
The lagoon is about 21 miles long . )
With a traditional economy , this place might have supported , maybe , 1000 villagers .
Basically , Majuro seems kind of unsustainable , in many ways .
The economy gets it support from two places –– foreign aid and foreign tuna fleets , which come here to transfer their catch to factory ships and to re-provision .
The tuna boats use helicopters and telescoping lookout platforms to find schools of tuna .
And then they extend their giant nets around the school , draw it tight at the bottom , and take the entire school out of the ocean .
This technology , called " purse seining " can capture tuna faster than they reproduce .
These fleets have already made Bluefin Tuna almost commercially extinct , and now they are working on other species , like Yellowfin .
It 's hard to watch .
But , for as long as it lasts , Majuro is cashing in .
At any given time there could be up to 15 purse seiners reprovisioning in this atoll , along with half a dozen factory ships .
So we cashed in as well .
Fresh Yellowfin Tuna for less than five dollars a pound .
The people who actually do the fishing get paid peanuts -- most of the cost seems to be in the distribution .
That makes tuna very cheap in Majuro .
And makes hypocrites of us ...
Anyway , for the moment there are still fish around here .
Two big Yellowfin Tuna taken in local fishing contest .
Foreign Aid The US took the Marshall Islands away from Japan in World War II .
But that liberation turned out to be a mixed blessing for the Marshallese .
Because , starting in 1946 , and running up through 1958 , the US tested its atomic weapons in these islands , mostly on the atolls of Bikini and Enewetak .
This involved the –– officially " voluntary " –– relocation of villagers from those places .
And , worse , the US military got the numbers wrong for the " Castle Bravo " test of a hydrogen bomb , which ended up being about twice as powerful as expected .
The resulting fallout sickened and poisoned many villagers on the downwind atolls .
More beneficially , the US has established a permanent military installation on Kwajalein atoll , which now houses an important missile - defense radar installation and employs a lot of Marshallese .
For all those reasons , the US has a deep relationship with the Marshall Islands and contributes a large amount of foreign aid –– amounting to about $ 80 million in 2019 .
Which is big money in a country with total GDP of roughly $ 200 million !
The Marshalls also get foreign assistance from Taiwan –– which sees the island chain as one of its last allies –– in addition to help from places like Japan , Australia , and New Zealand .
Anyway , everything about this place has been shaped by the US and by foreign aid .
For better or worse …
From the abundance of American products in the supermarkets ... ... and hardware stores ... ... to daily traffic jams on the island 's single main road … ... to the huge , growing , unmanageable trash dump –– known locally as " Mount Trashmore . "
Keep in mind that the base of Mount Trashmore is only a few feet above sea level –– and that the coastline is only a few hundred meters in both directions !
Eventually a cyclone will put all of this into the ocean .
Of all the world 's cities , Majuro may be the most threatened by rising sea levels .
Even moderately large waves now cause " inundation warnings . "
Meaning that the lower stories of many buildings will get swept by seawater ...
Dogs
Here 's another charming feature of Majuro -- we always carry a heavy stick when we go out in the evening – – as protection against the packs of aggressive dogs .
The first time we were attacked , Ken had to fight them off by kicking ( and swearing ) .
We were lucky -- we know several people who have been bitten .
After that experience he went out and bought this sledgehammer handle .
The stick does n't actually stop the dogs from coming after us , but they stay out of range .
So there 's a lot of growling and snarling but no real action .
( Sometimes the dogs make some noise as well … :-)
In any event , Majuro is a complicated story , and we will spend more time on it in a future update .
But , for the minute , we will just tell our own story …
Things Get Even Worse
We immediately ordered a new transmission from the States .
Fortunately , ZF Marine , the new owners of Hurth , still made a drop - in replacement for our 25 year old unit .
Thank heavens !
While we waited for the new transmission , Ken spent several weeks trying to figure out how he was going to move the engine .
Tim Brown suggested making a " lifting frame " to support a block and tackle .
But the incredibly tight space made that very difficult .
It got worse when one of the local cruisers -- who has lived in Majuro for a long time , knows everybody around here , and has done a lot of this kind of work –– came on board to look at the problem .
He took one look at our installation , threw up his hands , said it was impossible and that no one would want to work on it …
He 's actually a nice guy , and we get along fine with him -- he just made a hasty judgment .
But it sure was n't what Ken needed to hear at the time .
This felt lonely .
Beth Gets Hurt
Then Beth lost the use of her left hand .
She dropped our heavy refrigerator lid on her thumb .
We did n't get a picture immediately , but this is what the wound look like after several days .
And here 's the other side –– Beth is actually lucky that she did n't cut tendons or break bones .
We treated the wound with antibiotic ointment and kept it bandaged .
Here 's the debris from just one change of bandages .
It looked okay at first , but with the benefit of hindsight we probably did not get it clean enough .
In any event , it got infected .
This is a very serious event in the tropics –– infections are a big deal out here .
So we immediately put Beth on a course of Cipro from our medical supplies .
She also went in to see a doctor in the hospital .
He did n't like our bandaging job ( steri- strips covered by regular bandages ) .
He said we should have used guaze , allowing the wound to breathe .
But he agreed that Beth needed Cipro and he gave us a new prescription to replenish our inventory .
The whole visit cost $ 35 , including the Cipro , a bunch of gauze , antibiotic ointment , and iodine rinse !
The Cipro helped with the infection , but then Beth developed a secondary problem .
If you really squint hard at this picture , you can see a very slight bulge on Beth 's wrist .
This turned out to be a fluid buildup , resulting from the infection .
You can also see that her fingers and hand are swollen .
It does n't look like much , but the swelling pressed on the nerve bundle going to her hand .
And she ended up losing the feeling in some of her fingers .
And completely losing the use of her hand .
This picture shows her best attempt to make a fist .
And she started waking up at two in the morning , with her arm numb and yet on fire at the same time .
Beth would jump out of bed and pace around the boat in distress , shaking her arm .
Ken says that he has never seen his tough , cheerful wife of 38 years be quite that agitated .
And it was getting worse .
This was a crisis .
So we went back to the hospital .
And after waiting for several hours , finally got in to see an orthopedist .
Who diagnosed Beth as having " peripheral neuropathy " -- a result of " being old . "
He said there was n't much we could do about it , and prescribed vitamin B .
That was about as useful as the comments we had gotten on our transmission !
We got out of there in a hurry …
A Friend In Need We had reached the low point of our entire 15 year voyage .
We had to contemplate leaving our disabled boat on a mooring in a somewhat dicey anchorage ( the bottom of the lagoon is filled with the wrecks of boats sunk by the occasional westerly blow ) while we flew off to look for help in the States .
( And probably gotten trapped there by coronavirus . )
We talked to our GP back home , and started looking at flights to Hawaii , where we would try to get an appointment with a specialist .
A neurologist or an orthopedist –– we were n't even sure .
Ken kept repeating " we 've got to stay positive , we 've got to stay positive … "
And then we remembered our friend Pauline –– the same Pauline that we had seen in San Diego earlier in this update .
Pauline is a physical therapist extraordinaire .
So we sent her the picture of Beth 's wrist , and she immediately diagnosed the problem .
And set us up with a program for dealing with it .
First , Ken had to gently " milk " the fluid out of Beth 's fingers and hands and wrist and upper arm toward her shoulder .
Then he had to wrap each of Beth 's fingers with a shoelace , getting just the right amount of pressure –– not too much and not too little .
Then he had to wrap Beth 's hand and arm with an ace bandage , again getting just the right amount of pressure .
And then we put an ice pack on her wrist for 20 minutes .
Followed by mobility exercises , gradually trying to get her flexibility back .
And we had to repeat all of this five times a day !
So we got right down to it .
And , the very first night after we started doing this , Beth slept through the night –– getting rest for the first time in days !
From there she just steadily continued getting better .
As of now , about eight weeks after her injury , she is almost completely back to normal –– just some lingering numbness in her fingers .
Those nerves take a long time to get over a trauma .
We can't say enough about Pauline 's help .
And Some More Friends To Help Cruisers
In Need ( Us ! ) And then Dave of " Dignity " showed up , saying that he had heard we had an " impossible " project , and that he wanted a look at it .
We ended up hiring him on the spot .
Years ago , Dave was a long - range reconnaissance scout / commando in the South African Army , who operated on his own behind Cuban / Angolan lines in the border war with Angola .
He has lived on his sailboat " Dignity " with his wife Glyn for something like 25 years , and they are now planning to make their way back to South Africa .
Let 's just say that he's not put off by a challenge …
He was a great guy to work with .
One more piece of the story –– Beth and Ken had been on the phone with Ken 's sister Cathy just before Dave showed up .
We had been describing our plight –– this was at the point where we still did n't have a solution to Beth 's hand , or to our transmission .
Cathy is quite religious , and promised to pray for us .
We told her we would take whatever help she could arrange …
So then we hung up the phone , and , within a few minutes , heard Dave knocking on the boat .
Needless to say , Cathy takes this as clear evidence of intervention by the Almighty .
We are less convinced , but we have to admit that it 's a data point …
The new transmission arrived courtesy of DHL .
An expensive thing to air freight –– but when you need it , you really need it .
Beth fends off while Dave cranks it on board .
Ken helpfully takes pictures ...
Beth and Dave admire our shiny new transmission .
And CJ of " Holiday " also offered to help out .
His advice and help were invaluable .
And then Ken made two conceptual breakthroughs .
First , he calculated that there would just barely be enough space behind the transmission to remove the tranny without moving the engine .
Provided that we opened that submarine hatch visible in the picture , and also cut away a section of the engine room insulation .
As the spline came out of the engine , the transmission ended up clearing the bulkhead with about 30 mm to spare !
And , second , he realized that the overhead mount for our very heavy automatic fire extinguishing system was probably strong enough to take the weight of the transmission .
He rigged up a hoist , and tested it , and sure enough –– it could hold more than 130 pounds .
Now we had a way to support the transmission while we pulled it off the back of the engine .
And from there , it was possible to rig a series of hoists so that we could gradually shift the heavy unit out from behind the engine and then up through the engine room hatch .
And we also needed to support the engine , because the engine mounts attached directly to the transmission .
Dave solved this with some carpentry and a hydraulic lift .
And of course , we had to prepare the engine so that we could get at the transmission .
Here 's the " before " picture .
We removed just a " few " engine components –– like the exhaust elbow , the intercooler , the turbo , the transmission oil cooler , the shaft brake , the transmission control cables , and the propeller shaft stub ( which bolts into the transmission ) .
Plus all those filters and hoses that you can see on the bulkhead next to the engine .
Plus Ken had to drain the coolant out of the engine and the oil out of the transmission .
Ken and Dave worked for more than a week on this -- lots of tight corners and hard to reach bolts .
And here 's the " after " picture , with the transmission ready to come off .
Ken demonstrates the working conditions .
You have to squeeze inside a locker to get to this submarine hatch .
Dave peers through the other submarine hatch –– this is the one that 's easy to access !
Fortunately , Ken and Dave are both pretty compact …
And then finally , after more than a month of head scratching and hard work , we got to " T " day .
Amazingly , the old transmission came off without a fight , and the new one went right on .
Well , there was a little fighting , but CJ got it done .
CJ is less compact than Ken and Dave -- but has more oomph !
CJ and Ken maneuver the old transmission out of the way .
We ended up donating the old transmission to a local shipyard that services the tuna fleet –– they thought they might find some uses for it .
Dave tightens the new damper plate to the engine –– prior to putting the new transmission on .
And then it was done .
And we took her out and ran her up , and the vibration was gone !
This felt like a monumental victory , which it was .
We were back in business .
The Genoa
And by this time , Beth 's hand had recovered enough that she could tackle the Genoa project .
She started by tearing out all five of the old spectra tapes .
That took days .
Then she began hand stitching the new tapes back on .
She had hoped to use her powerful Sailrite sewing machine , but there was just no way .
The sail was too thick and the access was too difficult .
So she ended up using this cute little device called a " Speedy Stitcher . "
Peter on " Ahaluna " lent us his and we had one as well .
The Speedy Stitcher acts just like a sewing machine needle –- it pushes a loop of thread through the material , which allows Beth to pull a second , locking thread through the loop .
Just like a sewing machine , except about 1000 times slower .
And Beth created a machine - like zigzag stitch by hand .
Using two tapes instead of one , so that we do n't have to do this again .
She started off trying to push the Speedy Stitcher through the material by hand .
Then she started trying to hammer it through with a mallet .
But after breaking a couple of needles , she decided that the right thing to do was to use two Speedy Stitchers –– one with a big fat heavy needle on it that could stand up to hammering , and one with a thinner needle that could push the thread through the prepunched hole .
( We had originally tried using a power drill to make the holes , but the drill bits got hopelessly wound up in the Spectra tape , so that did n't work at all . )
Here 's another innovation .
Beth found it was very hard to keep the tapes aligned on both sides of the sail .
She tried clamps , but that did n't work .
So we started pre-gluing the tapes in place with superglue .
The superglue can't replace the thread , but it holds the tapes just fine for sewing purposes .
And superglue does n't gum up the needles .
We also used the glue to seize the knots when Beth finished a row of stitches .
Anyway , here 's the final result –– five tapes ( including three doubles ) , each with three rows of zigzag stitches .
Each row of zigzag stitches took Beth about two hours of work .
Not counting all of the set up time .
Or the time spent ripping out stitches when something did n't work out …
And then , she sewed the UV cover back in place .
But before we put the sail back up we thought we should take a look at the other two corners of the sail –– the head and tack .
And found more incipient failures …
So Beth got back to work again .
Since these tapes have n't actually failed , Beth decided to just put one more tape over the top of each eye for security .
We 'll have a sail maker to a more permanent repair on the head and tack when we get to New Zealand again .
We would actually like to get some time to do what we came to do out here –– get out to some uninhabited atolls and do some diving .
So that 's where we stand now .
Ready to do what we came to do !!
Surviving the Brave New World
And then , just as it seemed that we were exiting the twilight zone , coronavirus entered the world scene .
But the virus has n't entered the Marshall Islands .
( Yet . )
The government here has a bad reputation for corruption , and the place seems pretty dysfunctional .
But , although they have n't mastered dog catching , this government has done a fantastic job so far of keeping the virus out .
This is one of the only places in the world that does n't have it ... yet .
By late January , they moved quickly to limit traffic from infected countries .
And by early March they moved to prohibit all human entry –– by ship , airplane , or yacht .
Basically no one has been allowed in for weeks -- well before most other countries acted .
And , at the same time they have been able to keep supply ships coming in –– requiring them to quarantine for 14 days ( increased to 30 days at one point ) , and then setting up protocols so that the stevedores do n't interact with the crew .
Airplanes are allowed to land but no passengers can disembark .
It 's working so far .
But the virus will probably get here sooner or later .
And if / when it does , it will be bad .
Majuro is a crowded place , with sketchy healthcare .
( Half the adult population has diabetes , and they also have a big problem with dengue fever . )
The only hospital would be overwhelmed almost immediately in an outbreak .
And the island would run out of food in a heartbeat if supply ships decided not to come here .
Not totally sure what would happen to the social fabric in that event …
Plus we 're not spring chickens anymore -- we are now in our mid-60's , so our chances of getting through the virus without lung damage are n't all that great .
Especially with no medical help .
So , for all those reasons , we 've decided to get the heck out of Dodge .
We 've loaded Eagle 's Wings with so much food that she barely floats .
Beth shows off a tiny fraction of her provisions .
That 's a bag of navy beans ...
Part of Ken 's coffee inventory .
And then there are the reserves stored under the floorboards !
Unfortunately , the beer supply will be a problem .
Some other sailboats have onboard breweries , but we never bothered to do that .
Ken is kicking himself .
Beth does n't mind at all …
We figure that we could eat for six months without setting foot on shore .
Notice that we say " eat " -- not " eat well . "
Lots of beans !
( Plus fish , of course . )
We can make our own drinking water and we have over 1000 watts of solar power .
Plus we carry almost 1000 liters of diesel .
So we can be self - sufficient for a very long time .
And , totally by coincidence , the virus caught us in a place where we can stay indefinitely if we need to .
US citizens do n't need a visa to stay in the Marshall Islands , and the southern atolls do not usually get cyclones .
Plus , we are close enough to the equator that we could make a run for it if a cyclone did brew up .
For technical reasons ( lack of Coriolis force ) -- cyclones can't get into the Equatorial zone .
So we plan to leave Majuro within a week or so and head north to some of the less inhabited or even uninhabited atolls .
Where we will self quarantine , dive , do our underwater photography and kill COTS until the world develops a vaccine .
It 's a tough job , but somebody has to do it !
Our survival capsule .
We 've heard about some billionaires heading for their bunkers to wait out the coronavirus –– sounds dank , dark , and damp .
We like our little white fiberglass survival capsule –– seems like the best place in the world right now .
Applications Breath of the dragon : ERS - 2 and Envisat reveal impact of economic growth on China 's air quality
01/09/2005 3440 views 0 likes
China 's spectacular economic growth during the last decade has brought many benefits – and some challenges .
Global atmospheric mapping of nitrogen dioxide pollution performed by ERS - 2's GOME and Envisat 's SCIAMACHY reveals the world 's largest amount of NO 2 hanging above Beijing and northeast China , as reported in Nature this week .
As part of ESA 's Dragon Programme , European and Chinese researchers are using results returned from the Global Ozone Mapping Experiment ( GOME ) on ERS - 2 and the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography ( SCIAMACHY ) on Envisat to monitor and forecast Chinese air quality .
In this context , researchers at the University of Bremen , the Max - Planck Institute of Meteorology in Hamburg and France 's Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique ( CNRS ) have been studying the retrieval of nitrogen dioxide variability from space and modelling its global behaviour .
Average annual NO2 changes 1996 - 2002
The team have published an article in the 1 September 2005 edition of the science journal Nature about the global changes in nitrogen dioxide observed in the last decade from space and highlighted the dramatic changes over China .
Nitrogen dioxide ( NO 2 ) is associated with nitrogen oxide ( NO ) in the atmosphere and the sum of the two is called NO X .
This is released into the troposphere from power plants , heavy industry and road transport , along with biomass burning , lightning in the atmosphere and microbial activity in the soil .
The emission of nitrogen oxides has increased about six - fold since pre-industrial times and in cities above a thousand times more NO X is present than in the pristine and remote marine boundary layer .
Envisat optical view of China haze Exposure to nitrogen dioxide in large quantities is known to cause lung damage and respiratory problems , although little is known about the consequences of long term exposure to elevated atmospheric amounts .
The presence of this gas is a significant driver of the production of low - level ozone , which , within the troposphere ( the lowest part of the atmosphere , extending eight to 16 kilometres in height ) is itself a harmful toxic pollutant , a major ingredient of photochemical smog .
" While nitrogen dioxide vertical column concentrations above central and eastern Europe and parts of the East Coast of the United States have been either static or exhibiting a small decrease , there is a clear and significant increase over China , " explains John Burrows of the University of Bremen 's Institute of Environmental Physics , SCIAMACHY 's Principal Investigator .
Annual changes in nitrogen dioxide for selected areas " Before SCIAMACHY was flying we previously retrieved NO 2 data from its precursor instrument , GOME on ESA 's ERS - 2 mission .
Although GOME had lower resolution , the article shows that China 's nitrogen dioxide retrievals from the two instruments overlap seamlessly .
" What the combined data show are that nitrogen dioxide levels have risen by around 50 % since 1996 , and this behaviour is continuing . "
Monthly averages over East Central China Space - based sensors are the only way to carry out effective global and regional monitoring of the atmosphere .
While GOME demonstrated the first satellite sensitivity to tropospheric nitrogen dioxide , SCIAMACHY possesses superior performance , with a spatial resolution of 60 x 30 kilometres compared to 320 x 40 km for its predecessor .
SCIAMACHY also observes the atmosphere in two different ways – downwards or nadir - sounding ' as well as ' limb - sounding ' along the direction of flight – and with a larger spectral range than its predecessor .
The increase in nitrogen dioxide levels seen is an unfortunate side effect of economic success .
China 's industrial boom has seen it become the world 's largest consumer of copper , aluminium and cement and the second bigger importer of oil .
Car ownership within the country has been doubling every few years .
" China 's nitrogen dioxide concentration varies according to season , " Burrows adds .
" There is more in the winter as a result of differing emission patterns and meteorology .
For example more fuel is burned for heating and nitrogen dioxide persists longer in the atmosphere at that less sunny time of year – lasting around a day rather than hours , as in the summer .
Envisat - artist 's impression " Meteorology also plays a role .
There is a peak before Christmas : this is not because industrial activity , domestic heating or transportation is suddenly reduced after the holiday season but because there is an eastward outflow of air that was previously revolving around Asia .
This is the same type of phenomenon that carries dust from the Gobi Desert across to the West Coast of the US . "
China is reliant on coal to meet 75 % of its national energy needs , and that means high levels of another atmospheric pollutant called sulphur dioxide ( SO 2 ) also detectable by SCIAMACHY .
Large SO 2 sources over China that overlap with nitrogen dioxide plumes are linked to power plants .
Further to the west there is also sulphur dioxide produced from smouldering underground coal seam fires .
Nitrogen dioxide over Europe Burrows is the scientist who – supported by an international team – proposed both GOME and SCIAMACHY to national space agencies and ESA in the first place .
He explained that the two instruments were originally chosen to fly because of their ability to measure stratospheric ozone , but were also selected in order to investigate the amount of useful information that could be retrieved from the troposphere .
" The instruments are now being used to monitor a significant number of key tropospheric trace gases including formaldehyde , methane , sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide and dioxide , " Burrows remembers .
" Back when we were starting out , many people thought it would be impossible to get any useful results out of the troposphere .
There are many important issues to deal with , such as cloud cover and the highly variable reflectivity of the surface , as well as having the absorption or emission of stratospheric and upper atmospheric species situated between the troposphere and the instrument .
" First with GOME and now much better with SCIAMACHY we are demonstrating it can be done .
The success so far is an important step on the way to establishing an operational global observing system for the Earth 's atmosphere .
This is something we need as we enter the geological age of the Anthropocene , where the activities of mankind and its interactions with natural phenomena are the driving force in global climate change .
" Next we are hoping for follow - up satellite missions , in particular from geostationary orbit to monitor atmospheric pollution , which has a strong diurnal variation and thereby determine objectively the changing atmospheric composition . "
SCIAMACHY : surveying the world in six days Nitrogen dioxide over the United States SCIAMACHY is a spectrometer , and it works by measuring sunlight – either transmitted , reflected or scattered by the Earth 's atmosphere or surface in the ultraviolet , visible and near infrared regions .
Mathematical inversion of these data yields the amounts and distribution of trace gases , ozone and related chemicals , clouds and dust particles throughout the atmosphere .
With a 960 - km swath and alternate limb and nadir observations , SCIAMACHY covers the entire world every six days at the equator and more often at high latitudes .
This versatile instrument represents a national contribution to ESA 's Envisat mission .
It was funded by the German government through the German Aerospace Center ( DLR ) , the Dutch government through the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programmes ( NIVR ) and also the Belgian government through the Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy ( BIRA - IASB ) .
SCIAMACHY is part of a family of atmospheric sounders that also includes GOME on ERS - 2 and also the forthcoming GOME - 2 instrument due to launch next year aboard ESA 's and EUMETSAT 's first Met Op spacecraft .

Desperate father convicted of killing hukou- less son
By Echo Shan ( chinadaily.com.cn )
Updated : 2006-09-04 13:13
A father was convicted of murder and sentenced to ten years in prison for murdering his 43 - day - old son on Sunday , writes the Huxia Times .
Liu Ruiliang sobs while standing for trial in Beijing on September 3 , 2006 .
He was convicted of killing his own son and sentenced to ten years in prison .
[ sina ]
On the Chinese New Year 's Eve of this year , while firecrackers popped outside Liu Ruiliang 's home in suburban Beijing , tragedy loomed inside .
Liu Ruiliang threw his infant son to his death , preferring to end his son's life than to let him live without a Beijing hukou , or residence permit , which was denied to the boy , as Liu and his wife Shi Xiuwen do not own property in the city .
Hukou affects many aspects of life , including status , rights and educational opportunities .
According to residence registration regulations , Liu , who has a collective Beijing hukou , could not register his child for a Beijing hukou without owning property .
A temporary worker , Liu fed his family of three with meagre earnings .
Making the 130 yuan per month for the ten -- square - meter rented room they shared was hard enough for Liu , let alone making enough to buy a home in the capital where housing prices have skyrocketed in recent years .
After several failed attempts to get a Beijing hukou for his child , Liu became abnormally pensive , and would laugh out loud for no reason .
" I did not imagine that he might have had a mental problem .
I thought that he was just over - tired from taking care of me and our baby , " Shi recalled regretfully .
" I should have saved my little son . "
Neighbor Wu Xiuqing remembers the boy as having " big eyes , double eyelids , a small round face and a really pretty little chin , " and Liu as being a reticent caring father who led an extremely frugal life .
The story is a another tragedy resulting from the hukou system , and many in the general public are deeply sympathetic to the poor , trapped father .
Currently the hukou system in large cities acts as a fence controlling the population , keeping city - dwellers in , and others out , through the many complicated relationships among the internal interests of the city and the hukou system .
For some years , the National Ministry of Security has attempted to reform the hukou system .
Three years ago , they established a well - thought - out proposal , which has yet to be implemented nationwide .
Hukou experts point out that a breakthrough in hukou reform has to be proceeded by the severing of special job and education privileges from the hukou system .
Some netizens posting on sina.com say the baby coming into the world without a chance of getting a Beijing hukou was in fact a mistake .
Many posts refute that all are born equal and deserving of Respect , but in this case the hukou system gravely insulted the dignity of human life .
Shi no longer cares about the hukou issue now that the baby is gone .
Currently her greatest hope is for her husband to be released soon .
" He deserves pity .
If he gets out early , he can get treatment for his mental problems .
After he gets well , I still want to have another child with him , " she said .
" If he lives , I live too .
If he is ruined , I am ruined too , " she said .
Why Should You Use GNU Emacs Instead of Vi ?
GNU Emacs comes with a complete manual available online with a hypertext viewing facility .
GNU Emacs has numerous other help facilities : a tutorial ; commands to describe functions , variables , keybindings , major modes ; commands to look up commands , functions , and variables by patterns in their names .
GNU Emacs does multiple windows even on dumb terminals .
You can look at many different places in one file in different windows .
You can split the screen horizontally or vertically , as many times as there is space on the screen .
GNU Emacs runs under several window systems and has mouse support .
GNU Emacs has less mode confusion than vi , where you have to remember whether or not you 're in " insert " mode .
New users find this less confusing .
( Please folks , do n't try to tell people that Emacs is " modeless " .
That 's just plain false . )
( Some versions of vi can be told to display a string in the corner of the screen indicating which mode is active . )
GNU Emacs can edit an unlimited number of files simultaneously .
GNU Emacs correctly edits binary files , including files with NUL characters ( ASCII code 0 ) and files with arbitrarily long lines ( or no newline characters at all ) .
GNU Emacs displays the screen in an unambiguous manner ; you can always know where the line breaks are .
( However , tab characters are not unambiguously displayed !
Arrgh ! ) GNU Emacs saves up - to - date " autosave " copies of files on which you are working every 300 ( user- configurable ) keystrokes .
It also does this automatically if the terminal connection is lost .
GNU Emacs keeps backup copies of files it saves , and can be told to keep any number of older versions of a file .
GNU Emacs provides unlimited undo capabilities .
By default Emacs keeps at least 15000 ( user- configurable ) and not more than 20000 ( user- configurable ) bytes worth of undo data per buffer .
( Since undo data is only discarded at garbage - collection time , you temporarily can have much more undo data available . )
GNU Emacs saves the last 30 ( user- configurable ) items you have deleted for later recall .
GNU Emacs automatically does locking on modified files and will warn users trying to edit the same file .
( WARNING : This has never been fixed to work across NFS file systems . )
GNU Emacs warns you if the file you are about to write has changed since you read it in .
When you work at multiple terminals or multiple windows within a terminal , or when you work with other people on a single source file , this can prevent you from trashing valuable changes .
GNU Emacs allows * all * of its keybindings to be changed .
GNU Emacs has an extension language , Emacs Lisp , and in fact is largely written in this language , so it is easy to change ( and fix if necessary ) .
GNU Emacs has an interactive debugger for Emacs Lisp .
GNU Emacs comes with source code so you are n't vulnerably dependent on your vendor .
GNU Emacs is free and can be shared with anyone .
GNU Emacs provides a more complete software development environment .
For example , M-x compile , M-x grep , M-x shell , etc .
After doing a M-x compile , GNU Emacs can parse the error messages in the output and visit the appropriate lines of the appropriate files .
GNU Emacs can record your keystrokes into keyboard macros .
GNU Emacs provides many mechanisms to reduce your need to remember and type long names .
For example , abbrevs ( abbreviations you define ) , dynamic abbrevs ( look for similar things already in the buffer ) , program identifier completion , filename completion , etc. GNU Emacs provides major modes that are custom tailored for each different editing need , for example : C , C++ , Indented Text , Outline , TeX , Nroff , etc. GNU Emacs Lisp packages have already been written to do almost any imaginable task , so you do n't need to .
GNU Emacs or other Emacs variants are available on far more types of computers than vi .
In addition , more and more programs are using Emacs - style keybindings .
( This is n't necessarily a good thing , it just means spending time in learning default Emacs key bindings can be a good investment . )
GNU Emacs comes on some Unix systems instead of vi. GNU Emacs will come with the next release of BSD Unix .
GNU Emacs comes with major modes to emulate vi. ( vi ca n't emulate Emacs . )
( See the latest release of vip.el for the best vi emulation . )
GNU Emacs has Shell mode .
You can run shell commands in an Emacs buffer , call up previous commands , cut and paste command output , review results that have scrolled off the screen , etc. GNU Emacs has incremental search .
This minimizes the number of keys you need to press to find a string in a buffer .
You can usually find the exact occurrence of a 20 character identifier you are looking for in 5 or 6 keystrokes .
You can also incrementally search for a regular expression .
GNU Emacs has superior , configurable , language sensitive indentation .
( vi has " : 1 , $ !cb " , but this is slower and less flexible . )
GNU Emacs has " query replace " .
This is like a global search and replace , except Emacs will show you each occurrence in its entire context within the file and ask you what to do .
You can even edit the occurrence without interrupting the query replace operation .
GNU Emacs has a spell checker .
GNU Emacs can " fill " paragraphs , either manually or automatically .
This evens up the length of the lines .
It will also right - justify .
GNU Emacs has a status line for every window showing the file name , relative position within the file , if the file is modified , etc .
( This is all user - configurable . )
GNU Emacs has support for reading , composing , and sending e-mail and news .
GNU Emacs has rectangular cut and paste --- this works on columns of text .
GNU Emacs recognizes sentences and can cut and paste them .
You can change the patterns that are used to find the beginning and end of sentences .
GNU Emacs has Dired , a file directory editor .
GNU Emacs updates the screen with every keystroke .
( Some versions of vi do not update deletes while in insert mode . )
GNU Emacs will calculate a minimal cost sequence of characters to update the screen on slow terminal lines .
In addition , it checks whether input is available before redrawing the screen , and if input is available it processes it first to avoid unnecessary screen redrawing .
GNU Emacs prompts for commands that need parameters ; thus you do n't need to memorize syntax .
GNU Emacs adjusts when a terminal emulator window in which is it running is resized .
( Many versions of vi do n't . )
GNU Emacs has real word wrapping .
There are also some reasons why you might prefer vi :

Dairy co-operative Calon Wen is behind the ' Fancy a Farmer ? ' campaign , reports the Daily Post .
Stickers on Calon
Wen 's organic milk will feature three men and two women looking for a date .
Among them is 30 - year - old Iwan Jones , of Groes Bach , Groes , near Denbigh , who dreamt up the idea .
He said : " It 's a bit of a laugh really - but if I was approached by an attractive young lady I would n't turn her away .
" Mr Jones is a director of Calon Wen , a co-operative of 20 Welsh organic dairy farmers , which has joined forces with a Welsh online dating agency .
By logging onto www.pishyn.com, shoppers can discover how to meet the farmer of their dreams .
Mr Jones -
" The Welsh countryside is a great place to live , with stunning scenery , but it can be a hard place to find a date as I 'm finding out !
" Mr Jones admitted the two young women were recruited to the campaign " after a bit of arm - twisting " .
" We did n't want to be accused of being sexist . "
I was lucky enough to go to a screening of Marie Antoinette in Sydney last week curtsey of Sony Pictures Australia , the movie staring Kirsten Dunst , about the 14 year old Austrian princess who was crowned Queen of France at 18 .
And I loved it .
Written and directed by Sophia Coppola , it was a movie filled with beautiful scenery , amazing 18th century dÃ©cor with it ’s lavish drapery and four poster beds , and thee was the opulent Milena Kanoneros designer costumes and Manolo Blahnik designed shoes that had quite a cameo in the movie .
( There will be a limited release of the shoes featured in the movie at Blahnik ’s European stores . )
Although the movie lacked a bit in speech , it was a fantastic insight into the way of life for the French royal family .
Plus it gave me a craving for delicious French pastries â€ “ bon bons , macaroons , cup cakes and of course endless amounts of French champagne .
So perhaps this could be why the movie which has come under fire from historians for its apparent lack of authentic factual events .
The France ’s Marie Antoinette Association president Michele Lorin says , “ I ’ve seen the trailer for the film on the internet .
It is a fright .
We ’ve spent years trying to convince people that the queen was not just a libertine who told the starving to eat cake .
What do you see on the trailer ?
You see Marie Antoinette eating cake .
You see her lying naked on a chaise longue .
I fear the film is going to set us back many years . ”
However , Dunst retorts that the the movie that was previewed in LA last week by the fashion crowd should not be taken too seriously .
She says , “ It ’s kind of like a history of feelings rather than a history of facts .
So do n’t expect a masterpiece theatre , educational Marie Antoinette biopic . ”
Yep , life 'll burst that self - esteem bubble By Sharon Jayson , USA TODAY Andrea Sobel shudders at those oh - so - positive messages aimed at boosting kids ' self - esteem .
No sense of entitlement : Andrea Sobel gives her twins chores to do around the house .
By Dan MacMedan , USA TODAY
She has heard her fill of " good job " or " great picture " or any of the highly exaggerated claims that parenting experts and educators spouted as the way to bring up well - adjusted children .
Sobel , the mother of 16 - year - old twins in Sherman Oaks , Calif. , says they could tell " what was real and what was fake , " even when very young .
" I was tired of going to the sports field and seeing moms say , ' Great job at going up to bat . '
It hit me early on that kids could see through inane compliments . "
Those often - empty phrases , however , raised a generation .
Kids born in the ' 70s and ' 80s are now coming of age .
The colorful ribbons and shiny trophies they earned just for participating made them feel special .
But now , in college and the workplace , observers are watching them crumble a bit at the first blush of criticism .
" I often get students in graduate school doing doctorates who made straight A's all their lives , and the first time they get tough feedback , the kind you need to develop skills , " says Deborah Stipek , dean of education at Stanford University .
" I have a box of Kleenex in my office because they have n't dealt with it before . "
To be clear , self - esteem is important to healthy development .
Kids who hold themselves in poor stead are thought to be most vulnerable to trouble — from low academic achievement to drug abuse or crime .
For those from disadvantaged backgrounds , the stakes may be higher and the needs even greater .
But empty praise — the kind showered on many kids years ago in the name of self - esteem — did more harm than good .
" Instead of boosting self - esteem , it can lead you to question your competence , " says developmental psychologist Sandra Graham of UCLA .
Self - esteem became a buzzword more than 20 years ago , fueled by parenting experts , psychologists and educators .
Believers suggested that students who hold themselves in high regard are happier and will succeed .
That culture was so ingrained in parents that protecting their children from failure became a credo .
This feel - good movement was most evident in California , which created a task force to increase self - esteem .
" At the time my children were raised , we were suffering from a misguided notion that healthy self - esteem results from something extrinsic that tells you you are a good person , " says Betsy Brown Braun , a child development specialist in Pacific Palisades , Calif. , and the mother of 26 - year - old triplets .
It was n't limited to the West Coast .
Raising self - esteem became a national concern , and educators thought it could help raise academic achievement .
But schools got sidetracked into worrying more about feelings , says Charles Sykes in Dumbing Down Our Kids : Why American Children Feel Good About Themselves But Can't Read , Write , or Add .
" Self - esteem has virtually become an official ideology , " he writes .
A 1991 teacher training session in the Houston area taught the evils of red ink and told teachers to pick another color , says Pat Green , a teacher since 1982 .
" They said it had a very negative impact , because red is so symbolic of wrong answers , " she says .
Some also said grammar and spelling errors should be overlooked so students would n't be discouraged from writing , Green says .
" It was so ' do n't damage their self - esteem ' to the point where you would praise things that were n't very good . "
Cassie Bryant , 22 , is a product of those times .
" I kind of became an award junkie , " she says .
She believes the awards motivated her and helped her get into a competitive college .
But , she recalls her first semester at New York University as " brutal . "
" I had always been in honors in high school , and the writing teacher said , ' I do n't think that 's a good place for you . '
I started crying right there .
I had never been told that before . "
Now , the tides have turned .
Schools teach the basics to improve performance on standardized tests , and self - esteem programs have evolved from phony praise to deserved recognition for a job well - done .
Girl Scouts of the USA promotes self - esteem by emphasizing strengths and skills while encouraging feelings of competence , says developmental psychologist Harriet Mosatche , senior director of research and program .
" It used to be , ' Whatever you do is great . '
That old - fashioned misuse of the notion of self - esteem is not positive .
It 's unrealistic , and not helpful , " she says .
Well - meaning parents lap up that philosophy in the movie Meet the Fockers , with Bernie Focker proudly displaying his grown son's awards when he visits to introduce his in - laws - to - be .
" I did n't know they made ninth - place ribbons , " says the future father - in - law .
" They have them up to 10th place , " Focker replies .
" There 's a bunch on the ' A for Effort ' shelf there . "
Roy Baumeister , a psychology professor at Florida State University in Tallahassee , says he had " high hopes " for the benefits of boosting self - esteem when he began studying it more than 30 years ago .
But his lengthy review of 18,000 articles , published in Psychological Science in the Public Interest , ended with the realization that only two clear benefits emerge from high self - esteem : enhanced initiative , which boosts confidence , and increased happiness .
" There is not nearly as much benefit as we hoped , " he says .
" It 's been one of the biggest disappointments of my career . "
Overall , research shows that self - esteem scores have increased with the generations , says Jean Twenge , a psychology professor at San Diego State University who compared studies on self - esteem of 66,000 college kids across the USA from 1968 through 1994 .
Such studies are typically based on self - ratings .
She also has noticed that the undergraduates she teaches tend to have an inflated sense of self .
" When you correct writing , they 'll say , ' It 's just your opinion , ' which is infuriating .
Bad grammar and spelling and sentences being wrong is not my opinion , it 's just bad writing , " she says .
So when the criticism flows , some college students are increasingly seeking counseling .
Sam Goldstein , a neuropsychologist at the University of Utah , likened some students to bubbles — on the surface they seem secure and happy , yet with the least adversity they burst .
Neil Howe , co-author of Milliennials Rising : The Next Great Generation , urges colleges and employers to better understand this group , born in 1982 and later , who are in college or recently graduated .
Howe believes " milliennials " are a very connected , team - oriented generation that could benefit society .
" It 's a positive for the workforce and possibly for politics and community life and citizenship , " he says .
But employers such as Sobel , director of recruitment for an entertainment firm , are n't so sure .
" One of the things the managers talked about is an incredible sense of entitlement for people who do n't deserve it , " she says .
" They 'll come in right out of college and do n't understand why they 're not getting promoted in three months . "
Howe blames the attitude on society 's high expectations .
" We 've become a much more child - oriented society around milliennials , " he says .
" Self - esteem for them meant you 're the focus of society 's attention . "
He was chained by one hand to the wall in a windowless cell and left with a bucket and a bottle in lieu of a latrine .
He remained there for nearly a week , he said , and then was blindfolded and bound again and taken to another prison .
" There , they put me in a room , suspended me by my arms and attached my feet to the floor , " he recalled .
" They cut off my clothes very fast and took off my blindfold . "
An older man , graying at the temples , entered the room with a young woman with shoulder - length blond hair , he said .
They spoke English , which Mr. Saidi understands a little , and they interrogated him for two hours through a Moroccan translator .
At last , he said , he thought he would learn why he was there , but the questioning only confounded him .
He said the interrogators focused on a telephone conversation they said he had had with his wife 's family in Kenya about airplanes .
But Mr. Saidi said he told them that he could not recall talking to anyone about planes .
He said the interrogators left him chained for five days without clothes or food .
" They beat me and threw cold water on me , spat at me and sometimes gave me dirty water to drink , " he said .
" The American man told me I would die there . "
He said his legs and feet became painfully swollen because he was forced to stand for so long with his wrists chained to the ceiling .
After they removed him from the chains , he said , he was moved back to the " dark " prison and a doctor gave him an injection for his legs .
Image Laid Saidi was seized while running an Islamic charity in Tanzania in 2003 .
He said he lost his Algerian passport and used a false name on his Tanzanian residency permit , above .

After one night there , he was moved to a third prison .
He said the guards in this prison were Afghans , and one told him that he was outside Kabul .
There were two rows of six cells in the basement , which he described as " filthy , not even suitable for animals . "
Each cell had a small opening in the zinc - clad door through which the prisoners could glimpse one another as they were taken in and out of their cells .
At night , they would talk .
A molecule suddenly kicked into rapid rotation in a liquid rearranges the molecules around it , destroying its own friction .
Scientists have found a molecule that can spin freely in liquid , clearing out water like a person swinging suitcases would clear a crowded room .
The molecule spins without causing friction [ Video ] .
That should n't be possible , according to a chemical physics theory .
The finding could alter the way scientists think about chemical reactions in liquids .
Researchers hit a drop of iodine cyanide and water with pulses from an ultraviolet laser , exciting one type of molecule to reconfigure into a small , peanut shape with a carbon atom on one end , a nitrogen atom on the other .
The molecule heated up to 8,000 degrees Fahrenheit ( 4,427 Celsius ) and started spinning at a furious 270 trillion rotations per minute .
Outta my way
Within the first quarter - turn , the molecule created a shock wave that kicked away surrounding water molecules .
The peanut molecule created a nearly frictionless zone for itself in the 10 - trillionths of a second the reaction lasted .
" If you give it enough spin , it pushes all the guys around it away , and it builds itself a little bubble , " said study coauthor Stephen Bradforth of the University of Southern California .
" It 's destroyed the friction in the liquid around it by completely reshaping its environment . "
After the molecule completed about 10 rotations , the shock dwindled and the water molecules rushed back in .
Despite its fleeting nature , the reaction managed to smash the linear response theory , a chemistry model that states such a thing can't happen in a liquid environment .
" You can see molecules behave this way in gases , but not in liquids , " said study coauthor Richard Stratt , a chemical theorist at Brown University .
Breaking other laws
The molecule 's activity also runs against Newton 's third law of motion , which states that for every action there is an equal , but opposite , reaction .
In the new experiment , there water molecules are displaced , but they do n't in turn do anything to the peanut molecule .
Friction is important in chemistry .
Molecules rub , grind , and bang against each other they generate heat that speeds up reactions .
Friction in gas reactions is reduced due to the relatively far distances between molecules , but the close proximity of molecules in liquid form makes friction nearly unavoidable .
Although the discovery has no immediate practical use , it changes the way scientists think about the 90 percent of all chemical reactions that take place in liquid , Bradforth said .
One potential use could be to manipulate reactions by isolating molecules from their surroundings and reducing the production of useless byproducts .
" The main reason we 're so excited by these results is that friction is how energy is shuttled around in chemical reactions , " Stratt told LiveScience .
" If it does n't operate or it operates differently than we always thought , that makes us wonder if there are entirely new ways we ought to thinking about how chemical reactions take place . "
The research is detailed in the March 31 issue of the journal Science .
The HondaJet , meanwhile , is the latest variation on Honda ’s tradition of offering any kind of product with an engine in it .
From its roots as a builder of small gasoline engines , Honda has over the years made motorcycles , lawn mowers , cars , trucks , all - terrain vehicles , portable generators and personal watercraft .
Honda has been working on the HondaJet for nine years .
Now that it has decided to bring the plane to market , Honda will face mushrooming competition in a fairly new field : the very light jet market , with planes weighing no more than 10,000 pounds that can be flown by one pilot .
They generally sell for $ 1.5 million to $ 4 million .
At least a dozen manufacturers , including Eclipse , Cessna and Embraer , have announced plans to offer very light jets , which are meant for small business owners who do not need bigger planes or do not want to pay millions of dollars more for larger business jets from Gulfstream , Bombardier or Boeing .
The HondaJet can carry seven people , including the pilot , and cruise at up to 475 miles an hour .
Honda officials estimated that the very light jet market will total about 200 planes a year , and they said they hoped the HondaJet would capture a good share of those sales .
They declined to say more specifically how many they hoped to sell , where in the United States the plane would be built , or what it will cost .
Honda did say that it hopes its jet ’s unique features will set it apart .
For one thing , the engines will be mounted over the wings , not over the tail , as on many private jets .
For another , the plane will make extensive use of composite materials instead of aluminum , which will save weight and allow the aircraft to use less fuel .
The news today illustrates just how over the top the public discourse over fat has become .
Parents across England are having to allay the fears of their children tonight .
With " obesity " frenzy reaching media saturation , it is no wonder that in a study of elementary children published in the Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology , professors Phebe Cramer and Tiffany Steinwert documented that by elementary school age , girls fear looking fat more than getting cancer , a nuclear war or losing their parents .
The parents in this article face criminal charges and their nine year old was taken away from them for being too fat .
Brothers on trial for overweight dog
While this story might be taken less seriously ... since the nine year old was a dog ... when it happens to fat children and their families in our country , which it does all too often , it does n’t seem as trivial .

In the past few days I 've been working on a generalised version of Haskell , designed for program optimisation and transformation .
I 've also implemented the start of a Haskell optimiser , but in about 100 lines of Haskell , using this generalised form of Haskell .
Generalised Haskell is very much like a normal Haskell Core language , with less restrictions in pattern matching .
In normal Haskell you would write " map " as : > map f [ ] = [ ] > map f ( x : xs ) = f x : map f xsWhich would be compiled into :> map f x = case x of [ ] -> [ ] ( x:xs ) -> f x : map f xsThe rule for pattern matching is that you take the first rule that matches .
Generalised Haskell relaxes this slightly to takerule that matches , but not necessarily in order .
The second relaxation is that when pattern matching on the left hand side , can appear as patterns .
For example , you can now define : > map id x = x > map f x= case x of [ ] -> [ ] ( x:xs ) -> f x : map f xsNote that the " map id " case looks very much like GHC's Rules feature .
The advantage for optimisation is that many activities can be encoding using these pattern matches - arity raising , specialisation , deforestation .
I am still working on a tool that uses this technique for optimisation , but initial results look quite promising , while the code remains impressively short .

Israelis Bomb Beirut , Baalbak Again
Tank Incursion in South
Massive Displacements , Humanitarian Crisis
“ Israel ’s disproportionate use of force and collective punishment must stop . ”
– UN Secretary General Kofi Annan
[ Red herring alert : Someone on the Web is questioning this quote or complaining that I did n’t mention that Kofi also condemned Hizbullah .
Oh for heaven ’s sakes .
I used the quote as an epigraph .
It is perfectly accurately quoted .
If I had been doing a report on Annan , I would have quoted the whole passage .
Using one of his phrases for an epigraph is perfectly legitimate .
The quote is here .
The Daily Star reports ,
‘ As The Daily Star went to press [ Thursday night ] , three Israeli bombs fell on the southern suburbs of the capital and additional ordnance hit the northern city of Baalbek , leaving both areas ablaze .
No casualty count was available . ’
It also reports :
‘ Israel has opened a 60 - kilometer front along the southern Lebanese border , from Naqoura to Majidiyeh , a Lebanese security source said on Thursday .
“ This front is to estimate Hizbullah ’s retaliation strength on the ground , ” the source said .
“ The fighting zone is inside Lebanese territory , which the UN itself has marked and which Israel agrees is Lebanese . ”
Although up to now Israel has only hinted that it might undertake a full - scale invasion of Lebanon , on Thursday its tanks in fact attempted to cross the UN - demarcated Blue Line .
According to a Hizbullah statement , Israeli troops met “ fierce resistance from Hizbullah fighters as the Israelis crossed into Lebanon . ”
An Israeli Army spokesperson said his troops were looking for “ tunnels and weapons for the second day . ” ‘
South Beirut courtesy Daily Star
The tenement buildings of poor , Shiite , south Beirut lie in ruins , with hundreds of thousands of the poor made homeless as they fled relentless Israeli bombing of civilian neighborhoods .
The Daily Star says :
‘ Dozens of buildings were demolished in Haret Hreik and Bir al - Abed in the southern suburbs , where 200,000 people formerly resided .
In the midst of the rubble , a few residents dared to come back to their former homes and search for possessions to salvage . ‘
Hizbullah is the main political party in south Beirut and so of course had political offices there , which the Israelis have bombed .
But they did so in complete disregard for civilian life , and what they bombed were not necessarily military targets .
There is a difference between the Hizbullah paramilitary of some 5,000 fighters and the political party and its social service institutions – which include hospitals , clinics and soup kitchens .
Or did .
Meanwhile , Shiites of South Lebanon fled Israeli bombing of their villages , coming up north to Beirut , which lacks capacity to deal with these refugees .
The Associated Press reports :
As the death toll rose to 330 in Lebanon , as well as at least 32 Israelis , Lebanese streamed north into the capital and other regions , crowding into schools , relatives ’ homes or hotels .
Taxi drivers in the south were charging up to $ 400 US a person for rides to Beirut – more than 40 times the usual price .
In remote villages of the south , cut off by Isaraeli air strikes , residents made their way out over the mountains by foot .
The price of food , medical supplies and gasoline rose by as much as 500 per cent in parts of Lebanon on Thursday as Israel ’s relentless bombardment destroyed roads , bridges and other supply routes .
The World Food Program said estimates of basic food supplies ranged from one to three months . ‘
Not satisfied to have made 500,000 out of 3.8 million Lebanese homeless already , and to have chased over 100,000 out of their own country to Syria , AP says that on Thursday ‘ Israel warned hundreds of thousands of people to flee southern Lebanon “ immediately . . . ” ‘
The Orwellian world into which Olmert and his band of manic bombers have plunged ordinary Lebanese is illustrated by Liz Sly ’s report for the Trib :
‘ Thousands of Lebanese were trying to flee the south after Israeli warplanes dropped leaflets warning people to leave , stirring fears that an Israeli ground invasion was imminent .
But hundreds of thousands more remain stranded in villages and towns across the south , unable to leave their homes because of the intensity of the sustained Israeli bombing campaign .
United Nations and Lebanese officials warned of an impending humanitarian disaster unless food and medical supplies are allowed to reach the stricken area and called on Israel to establish a “ humanitarian corridor ” to allow aid to get through . ‘
So let ’s get this straight .
The Israelis warn the small town Shiites of the south to flee their own homes and go hundreds of miles away ( and live on what ? in what ? ) .
But then they intensely bombing them , making it impossible for them to flee .
The Lebanese have awoken to find themselves cockroaches .
I repeat , this is nothing less than an ethnic cleansing of the Shiites of southern Lebanon , an assault on an entire civilian population ’s way of life .
Aside from ecology , it is no different from what Saddam Hussein did to the Marsh Arabs of southern Iraq , and the Israelis are doing it for exactly the same sorts of reasons that Saddam did .
The economy of downtown Beirut has been murdered by the Israelis .
An acquaintance passed this on ;
‘ I ’ve just heard from Christine . . . via text messaging .
She is in the Bekaa valley in a bomb shelter and Israel is bombing the village where she is at the moment .
She says they are bombing the Red Cross , food lorries , fire brigade , hospitals and emergency relief centres . . .
She is very concerned about the lack of reporting by the international media about the details of this violence . ‘
As for Israel , Haaretz reports :
‘ There was a significant drop in the number of rockets launched against northern Israel , with an estimated 35 - 40 rockets hitting empty fields in the Galilee .
IDF sources were hard pressed to explain the reason for the drop . . .
The air force carried out more than 150 sorties throughout Lebanon yesterday .
Six launchers were destroyed and 16 Hezbollah bases as well as three arms storage facilities were bombed .
The air assault destroyed 21 Hezbollah vehicles and included attacks on 100 bridges and roads throughout Lebanon .
In the upcoming days , the IDF plans to expand ground operations in southern Lebanon .
Next week , more units will be moved to the North , which will enable broader operations against villages throughout the south . ‘
I do n’t think it is nice to carry out massive military “ operations ” against “ villages . ”
I am sure they meant to say “ Hizbullah bases ” or “ missile emplacements . ”
Or maybe they really do just mean “ villages . ”

REAL ID
The United States is getting a national ID card .
The REAL ID Act ( text of the bill and the Congressional Research Services analysis of the bill ) establishes uniform standards for state driver ’s licenses , effectively creating a national ID card .
It ’s a bad idea , and is going to make us all less safe .
It ’s also very expensive .
And it ’s all happening without any serious debate in Congress .
I ’ve already written about national IDs .
I ’ve written about the fallacies of identification as a security tool .
I ’m not going to repeat myself here , and I urge everyone who is interested to read those two essays ( and even this older essay ) .
A national ID is a lousy security trade - off , and everyone needs to understand why .
Aside from those generalities , there are specifics about REAL ID that make for bad security .
The REAL ID Act requires driver ’s licenses to include a “ common machine - readable technology . ”
This will , of course , make identity theft easier .
Assume that this information will be collected by bars and other businesses , and that it will be resold to companies like ChoicePoint and Acxiom .
It actually does n’t matter how well the states and federal government protect the data on driver ’s licenses , as there will be parallel commercial databases with the same information .
Even worse , the same specification for RFID chips embedded in passports includes details about embedding RFID chips in driver ’s licenses .
I expect the federal government will require states to do this , with all of the associated security problems ( e.g. , surreptitious access ) .
REAL ID requires that driver ’s licenses contain actual addresses , and no post office boxes .
There are no exceptions made for judges or police — even undercover police officers .
This seems like a major unnecessary security risk .
REAL ID also prohibits states from issuing driver ’s licenses to illegal aliens .
This makes no sense , and will only result in these illegal aliens driving without licenses — which is n’t going to help anyone ’s security .
( This is an interesting insecurity , and is a direct result of trying to take a document that is a specific permission to drive an automobile , and turning it into a general identification device . )
REAL ID is expensive .
It ’s an unfunded mandate : the federal government is forcing the states to spend their own money to comply with the act .
I ’ve seen estimates that the cost to the states of complying with REAL ID will be $ 120 million .
That ’s $ 120 million that ca n’t be spent on actual security .
And the wackiest thing is that none of this is required .
In October 2004 , the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 was signed into law .
That law included stronger security measures for driver ’s licenses , the security measures recommended by the 9/11 Commission Report .
That ’s already done .
It ’s already law .
REAL ID goes way beyond that .
It ’s a huge power - grab by the federal government over the states ’ systems for issuing driver ’s licenses .
REAL ID does n’t go into effect until three years after it becomes law , but I expect things to be much worse by then .
One of my fears is that this new uniform driver ’s license will bring a new level of “ show me your papers ” checks by the government .
Already you ca n’t fly without an ID , even though no one has ever explained how that ID check makes airplane terrorism any harder .
I have previously written about Secure Flight , another lousy security system that tries to match airline passengers against terrorist watch lists .
I ’ve already heard rumblings about requiring states to check identities against “ government databases ” before issuing driver ’s licenses .
I ’m sure Secure Flight will be used for cruise ships , trains , and possibly even subways .
Combine REAL ID with Secure Flight and you have an unprecedented system for broad surveillance of the population .
Is there anyone who would feel safer under this kind of police state ?
Americans overwhelmingly reject national IDs in general , and there ’s an enormous amount of opposition to the REAL ID Act .
This is from the EPIC page on REAL ID and National IDs :
And this site is trying to coordinate individual action against the REAL ID Act , although time is running short .
It ’s already passed in the House , and the Senate votes tomorrow .
If you have n’t heard much about REAL ID in the newspapers , that ’s not an accident .
The politics of REAL ID is almost surreal .
It was voted down last fall , but has been reintroduced and attached to legislation that funds military actions in Iraq .
This is a “ must - pass ” piece of legislation , which means that there has been no debate on REAL ID .
No hearings , no debates in committees , no debates on the floor .
Nothing .
Near as I can tell , this whole thing is being pushed by Wisconsin Rep.
Sensenbrenner primarily as an anti-immigration measure .
The huge insecurities this will cause to everyone else in the United States seem to be collateral damage .
Unfortunately , I think this is a done deal .
The legislation REAL ID is attached to must pass , and it will pass .
Which means REAL ID will become law .
But it can be fought in other ways : via funding , in the courts , etc .
Those seriously interested in this issue are invited to attend an EPIC - sponsored event in Washington , DC , on the topic on June 6th .
I ’ll be there .

Torturing even a lifeless computer character makes volunteers upset .
Mel Slater
Researchers have recreated in a virtual world one of the most extreme social experiments ever performed in the real world .
The results suggest that virtual environments could provide a way to explore human nature in ways that ethical concerns could make impossible to do for real .
Mel Slater , who works jointly at the Catalan Polytechnic University in Barcelona , Spain , and at University College London , UK , and his colleagues set up a virtual version of an infamous experiment on obedience to authority .
In the original experiment , conducted by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s , volunteers were told by an authority figure to deliver electric shocks to another person as punishment for incorrect answers to a test1 .
The other person was n’t really receiving the shocks , but the volunteers were tricked into thinking they were by shouts of pain and protest .
Despite this feedback , some volunteers went on to deliver what would have been lethal shocks .
Slater ’s volunteers did a similar experiment , but in an immersive virtual environment where they interacted with a virtual woman .
This counters some of the ethical protests that have prevented Milgram ’s experiment from being repeated because the volunteers knew they would be interacting with a virtual woman and so , unlike Milgram ’s guinea - pigs , knew that nobody was being hurt .
Ramping up
Half the volunteers could see the woman and half could not , communicating with her only through text .
Both were told to give her ‘ electric shocks ’ of increasing voltage when she gave incorrect answers to test questions .
The woman responded to these with protests and discomfort , asking for the test to stop as the voltage was ramped up .
The group from whom the virtual woman was hidden delivered shocks up to the maximum voltage , like many of those in Milgram ’s experiment .
Those who could see her were more likely to stop before reaching this limit2 .
Almost half of those who could see the woman said afterwards that they had considered withdrawing from the study , and several actually did .
“ Of course , consciously everybody knows nothing is happening , ” says Slater .
“ But some parts of the person ’s perceptual system just takes it as real .
Some part of the brain does n’t know about virtual reality . ”
And instead of becoming accustomed to the virtual person and ceasing to empathise , many volunteers became more anxious as the study continued .
Measures of stress , such as heart rate and sweatiness of palms , increased .
These measures are nearly impossible to fake , and confirmed for Slater that the volunteers were actually feeling uncomfortable , rather than performing as they thought the experimenter would expect .
Virtual experiment
The authenticity of the experience could give scientists new ways to test their theories about extreme social situations .
It might also allow them to revisit other notorious studies , such as The Stanford Prison Experiment of the 1970s , in which students playing the role of guards became abusive towards their play - acting prisoners , with distressing consequences .
“ They ’re opening Pandora ’s Box again — in a good way , ” says Jeremy Bailenson , who researches interaction in virtual environments at Stanford University in California .
“ What Slater ’s research is showing is if you make your virtual reality good enough , you can go back and ask all these questions ” .
Slater himself hopes to use virtual environments to investigate why crowds of people stand by and watch an act of violence without intervening — the so - called bystander effect .
ADVERTISEMENT
But some suggest that there are still ethical problems to think about , even in a virtual world .
William Dutton at Oxford University ’s Internet Institute in the United Kingdom says that researchers need to think about how the participants react .
“ People may still be affected by the fact that they did these things — it ’s just as much an ethical issue in a virtual environment . ”
Slater disagrees .
“ People were perfectly able to stop whenever they want .
They were saying to themselves , ‘ I ’m only carrying on because I know it ’s not real ’ .
Why virtual reality is so good here is that you get the automatic body responses of anxiety and so on , but there ’s still that distance — it is n’t real . ”

The Bullet Nebula in Visible and X - Ray Light
For all that mankind has learned through science , the Universe has so far managed to keep most of its secrets .
For instance , we do n’t know where the Universe came from , what its fate will be , or even its most basic composition .
But over the last few decades , tantalizing clues and some very intelligent guesswork led astronomers to an astounding hypothesis : the ordinary matter that stiffens our bones and fuels our suns plays only a bit part in the grand epic of existence .
Astronomers now believe that for every kilogram of normal matter like atoms , electrons , and quarks there are five kilograms of dark matter .
Very recently , astronomers announced what many had thought impossible , the direct observation of the existence of dark matter .
Billions of years ago , two galactic superclusters collided .
The collision occurred at a relative velocity of over a million miles per hour .
Not since the Big Bang itself has the known universe experienced so violent an event .
The aftermath of this collision offered what may be a once - in - Creation opportunity to finally “ see ” dark matter itself .
Ordinary matter is organized into structures from scales as small as the nucleus of an atom to those that span much of the Universe .
The same four physical forces that bind protons to neutrons and hold our feet to the ground cause suns to organize into galaxies , galaxies to group into clusters , clusters to gather as superclusters , and superclusters to form structures astronomers call simply filaments , bubbles , and sheets .
Filaments of Galaxies Simulated with a Supercomputer
Superclusters can contain millions of galaxies in relative close proximity .
The stars within these superclusters remain bound to their native galaxies , but most of the gases are diffused throughout the cluster and heated to millions of degrees in the process .
These gases make up most of the mass of an individual galaxy , and about 90 % of the visible mass of the supercluster .
Astronomers have long been aware that superclusters do not contain enough visible matter to explain their existence .
The hot gases and galaxies orbit the cluster so quickly that the gravity of the visible mass is insufficient to hold the matter together .
Thus the theory of dark matter was born .
The theory suggests that dark matter interacts with normal matter via only one of the four fundamental forces : gravity .
Calculations and computer simulations show that clumps of dark matter lie at the centers of all large structures in the Universe , even the Milky Way .
When two clusters collide at high speeds , the visible galaxies and dark matter pass right by each other as if nothing happened .
But the gases smash into each other with enough force to slow them down considerably .
Thus most of the visible matter in the clusters is stripped away leaving two remnant clumps of dark matter behind .
This is exactly what astronomers believe happened billions of years ago in cluster 1E0657 - 56 , also called the bullet cluster .
The image at the top shows the bullet cluster in both visible light and X - rays .
The fuzzy red light is the X - ray glow of the stripped gases .
To the right and left of that glow you can see the clusters of galaxies themselves .
This animation attempts to show the collision and better explain the images as well .
Gravitational Lensing
Intense gravitational fields warp the fabric of space - time enough to bend light rays .
At galactic scales , this can cause a phenomenon called “ gravitational lensing ” that focuses and distorts the light we see from distant galaxies .
By measuring this distortion , scientists can calculate both the mass and extent of the lensing object .
The illustration on the left shows how the images of distant galaxies are brightened , distorted , and duplicated by gravitational lensing .
To the right and left of the bullet cluster , astronomers observed two very large gravitational lenses using the Hubble telescope .
The mass necessary to create such large gravitational lenses ( shown in blue in the picture on the right ) is far greater than that of the galaxies in the original clusters , therefore something very massive and invisible lies at the center of those clusters .
That something , observed now directly for the first time , is dark matter .
Bullet Nebula with Dark Matter Shown in Blue
If that all seems a bit less than a direct observation , just consider the bottom line : something completely invisible that is nevertheless more massive than a cluster of galaxies and spans millions of light years is distorting the light from behind the bullet cluster .
We do n’t yet know what the dark matter is , but we now know it ’s there .
Whether dark matter is simply the husks of failed stars , some exotic new sub-atomic particle , or something else entirely is a secret the Universe still holds from us .

Article
Last year , after MarketingSherpa published a special report on the promotional products marketing -- an $ 18 billion industry -- we received several letters from surprised readers . " $ 18 billion ?
Logo -ed pens and T - shirts are more than twice as big as search ? ! " asked one .
Well , yes .
In fact , as you can see below , many marketing tactics are larger than search .
In fact , many " old- fashioned " offline tactics are far bigger than all of online combined .
If you read the daily marketing press , you 're deluged by ceaseless articles hyping the latest hot new tactic ( podcasting , RSS , online video , Web 2.0 , you name it … ) .
It 's enough to make you feel constantly , hopelessly behind the times , no matter how far ahead of the curve you really are .
That 's why our research team decided to create the two charts you see below .
They should function as a sort of “ reality check ” for marketing - tactic hype .
You 'll find the charts , as well as footnotes on where we got each figure .
( Please note : you may hotlink to this page on Sherpa but , please , do not reproduce it .
That 's breaking our copyright . )
Several numbers overlap .
For example , some print ad spends may include an online portion that was n't broken out .
So , do n't blithely add up all the numbers and assume you have a total for all ad spend in the US last year .
In every case , we used the most trusted number at the latest date .
Some numbers are for 2005 , some are for mid-2006 , some estimates for all of 2006 are based on late fall data .
Yes , we will be adding to and updating these charts as the year goes on .
They are living documents .
If you have analysis or input , we hope you 'll post to the charts via our Comments below .
Thanks !

Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures
This web site is hosted by the Software and Systems Division , Information Technology Laboratory , NIST .
Development of this dictionary started in 1998 under the editorship of Paul E. Black .
This is a dictionary of algorithms , algorithmic techniques , data structures , archetypal problems , and related definitions .
Algorithms include common functions , such as Ackermann 's function .
Problems include traveling salesman and Byzantine generals .
Some entries have links to implementations and more information .
Index pages list entries by area and by type .
The two - level index has a total download 1/20 as big as this page .
Do n't use this site to cheat .
Teachers , contact us if we can help .
Currently we do not include algorithms particular to business data processing , communications , operating systems or distributed algorithms , programming languages , AI , graphics , or numerical analysis : it is tough enough covering " general " algorithms and data structures .
If you have suggestions , corrections , or comments , please get in touch with Paul Black .
Some terms with a leading variable , such as n-way , m-dimensional , or p-branching , are under k-.

What is Gutenkarte ?
FOSS4G2006 : A presentation on Gutenkarte was made at FOSS4G 2006 .
The presentation is available in S5 format .
Gutenkarte is a geographic text browser , intended to help readers explore the spatial component of classic works of literature .
Gutenkarte downloads public domain texts from Project Gutenberg , and then feeds them to MetaCarta 's GeoParser API , which extracts and returns all the geographic locations it can find .
Gutenkarte stores these locations in a database , along with citations into the text itself , and offers an interface where the book can be browsed by chapter , by place , or all at once on an interactive map .
Ultimately , Gutenkarte will offer the ability to annotate and correct the places in the database , so that the community will be able construct and share rich geographic views of Project Gutenberg 's enormous body of literary classics .
Gutenkarte accomplishes all this with the help of several notable pieces of Free and Open Source software , including PostGIS , MapServer , GDAL / OGR , and Python .
Gutenkarte was developed by MetaCarta Labs .
If you find Gutenkarte interesting , and would like to be notified when updates and new features are available , please drop an email to .

Home Interactive Programming
By way of Joe Marshall in comp.lang.lisp :
Here 's an anecdote I heard once about Minsky .
He was showing a student how to use ITS to write a program .
ITS was an unusual operating system in that the `shell ' was the DDT debugger .
You ran programs by loading them into memory and jumping to the entry point .
But you can also just start writing assembly code directly into memory from the DDT prompt .
Minsky started with the null program .
Obviously , it needs an entry point , so he defined a label for that .
He then told the debugger to jump to that label .
This immediately raised an error of there being no code at the jump target .
So he wrote a few lines of code and restarted the jump instruction .
This time it succeeded and the first few instructions were executed .
When the debugger again halted , he looked at the register contents and wrote a few more lines .
Again proceeding from where he left off he watched the program run the few more instructions .
He developed the entire program by `debugging ' the null program .

On Moral Cowardice
Re :
The appalling new detainee trial bill that will undoubtedly be signed into law :
President Bush is a moral coward , and has always been a moral coward , since at no point has he shown anything other than incomprehension of and contempt for the United States Constitution , particularly when it comes to his pet projects of torturing people and sham trials .
I simply can't conceive of a worse president than this one ; and I can't imagine a scenario in which , if placed in front of him , I did n't express to him in no uncertain terms the depth of my contempt of him , his policies , and the low moral position he 's placed my country .
I find it appalling that the only good thing I can say about the man is that I can't imagine he wo n't be the worst president of the 21st Century , so in that respect the worst part of the my political life will be over in two years and change .
Senators McCain , Warner and Graham are moral cowards for making a big show of having problems with Bush 's awful trial plan , and yet " compromising " with a deal that has no discernable practical difference from the president 's original trial plan .
These men postured as bulwark for the Constitution , and I for one gave them my faith , which is not something I 'll be in a mad rush to do again .
McCain in particular I hold out for special criticism , because he does have the moral standing to stop something like this in its tracks .
Instead he traded that moral standing for a bit of political theater .
The Senate Democrats are moral cowards for not filibustering this bill as they ought to have , fearing Republican retribution at the polls and figuring that it 'll be tossed out by the courts anyway .
I simply cannot understand the sort of rank and pervasive incompetence Democrats have to have in order to allow themselves to be politically flummoxed time and again by the least popular and least competent president in modern political history .
The Democrats ought to have stepped on this bill 's head and killed it , not only because they could have , but because they should have .
Someone should have stood up for the Constitution and for the moral standing of the United States and its practices .
Someone should be up there calling Bush what he is :
A tiny man so frightened of the terrorist boogyman that he 's willing to shred our moral standing to keep him away , and so dead - eyed hateful of what it means to be American that he can't find a way to protect this country without urinating on what it is that makes us great .
Merely pounding on a podium for C - SPAN is not sufficient to do this .
This bill should have been stopped .
It was n't .
I 'm proud to be an American , but I 'm tired of being ashamed of my government .
I 'm tired of having to count the seconds until this bilious waste of a president is shoved out the door in January of 2009 .
I 'm tired of hoping that some members of the president 's political party might actually put principle over political expedience , particularly when it concerns the Constitution .
And I 'm tired of waiting for the opposing party to actually grow a goddamned spine and become an opposing party .
I 'm tired of wondering why the people we elect to lead us do n't seem to actually understand what it means to be American , and to be moral , and to do what it right for us .
And I 'm tired of having to look so hard for genuine leadership as opposed to the sham idiot version we have now .
I feel like Diogenes , and I 'm coming up short .
I 'm tired of being led by moral cowards .
I want better for myself , and for my country .

Homework Rules
If you enjoy this post , make sure you subscribe to Be A Good Dad to receive new posts in your email or feed reader
I found a link from this blog pointing to this post called Why Do We Still Get Homework ?
over at RhinoTimes.com .
Interesting read that says a lot of things I believed as a kid and still mostly believe .
I especially like the Homework Rules section that they think should be the goal of every school .
I like the idea lifted from Kohn ’s “ The Homework Myth ” :
The default condition should be NO homework .
There will be times when kids need to do things at home , like interview their dad for their report entitled The Coolest Person In The World , but there should always be a reason why that assignment cannot be handled in class .
I ’m not buying the there ’s not enough time for kids to learn everything in school argument .
When I was in school , we had recess every day and another class that rotated between art , music , gym , etc. that was every day .
Two sessions of every day dedicated to having some fun .
And we seemed to learn quite a bit and did n’t have hardly any homework through grade school .
If school ’s are giving up on recess and other “ fun ” classes , there should be plenty of time for the core curriculum .
There is so much stuff in that whole article , but here are a couple thoughts that stand out .
School is a job for kids .
I do n’t take work home with me .
Ever .
Almost nobody that I know takes work home with them .
And when the situation arises where we have to work late or on the weekend or , god forbid , work on a project at home , we complain .
If it happens often enough , we start looking for a new job .
Yet , we accept a system that demands that kids spend all day in the classroom working and then more hours at home doing extra work for their job .
And when was the last time they were not doing work over the weekend , holiday , and vacation .

Parents are teachers but we have our own curriculum .
There should be no homework that ever requires the parents to teach the kids how to do anything .
I ’m not excusing parents from educating their kids .
But , us parents have our own responsibilities .
It is my job to teach the kids how to fold their clothes , take a bath , walk safely to their friend ’s house , and how to properly use the internet .
I am not certified to teach my kids English , History , Science , or Math .
That is why I pay to send them to school .
I do not have a problem working with kids on assignments from time to time to bond with them , but I should not ever have to explain how to do what they are doing .
Maybe I wo n’t know the answer .
Maybe I ’ll teach them the wrong way .
I ’ve already been warned by my mother - in - law , an excellent grade school teacher – now retired , that when we teach the kids to spell their name , we need to make sure we capitalize the first letter and none of the others .
It seems that learning upper and lower case letters together is the way to go .
I bet she learned that as part of job training that I ’ve never had .

5 + 5 = 10 no matter how many times we do it .
I used to get in trouble in school because I would do enough homework drills to understand what was going on and no more .
Once I learned how to work with the quadratic equation , I stopped doing more homework problems where the point was to work that equation again .
I always had bad homework scores , but always tested extremely high and ended up getting good grades all through school .
Any homework that is assigned should be designed to reenforce the lesson .
If the student understands the lesson , then they should be able to stop at five problems instead of the 30 that were given for homework .
There is also some good advice about how to approach the teacher and school if you have issues with the amount of homework your child has .
Definitely a good read before you head to school ready to yell at the teacher .
What do you do when your car gets stuck in the snow ?
You pull it of course .
But where do you attach the hook ?
Well , you do need some brain to figure that out .
Pulling your plastic car out of the snow by hooking the bumper to a tow strap is probably not the smartest idea .

“ From a technology perspective we can test anything , ” said Mark Hughes , director of the Genesis Genetics Institute in Detroit , who is performing P.G.D. this month for two couples who want to avoid passing on a susceptibility to breast cancer .
“ The issue becomes what is considered serious enough to warrant such testing and who decides that . ”
The process is also difficult and expensive .
P.G.D. , which requires in vitro fertilization , can cost tens of thousands of dollars .
While insurance companies often pay for the more traditional uses of the procedure , they have not done so for cancer - risk genes , fertility experts say .
The barrier to affordability , some critics fear , could make preimplantation diagnosis for cancer risk the first significant step toward a genetic class divide in which the wealthy will become more genetically pure than the poor .
Knowing that Mr. Kingsbury had tested positive for the colon cancer mutation , the Kingsburys started with the basic laws of genetics : because children randomly inherit half of each parent ’s genes , he had a 50 percent chance of passing it on .
Since the mutation raises the risk of developing the cancer by about twentyfold , that means any child of theirs conceived the traditional way would have about a one in three chance of getting it , usually around age 45 .
Those who did develop the cancer would also have a nearly 90 percent chance of surviving it , but only if it was caught early .
The jumble of odds meant little to the Kingsburys as they tried to think about starting a family while the cancer claimed Mr. Kingsbury ’s second uncle .
Then , from a cousin of Mr. Kingsbury ’s who had also fought colon cancer , they heard about P.G.D. , the technology that offered them a way to reload the genetic dice .
To do it , they had to overcome their own misgivings about meddling with nature .
They had to listen to the religious concerns of Mr. Kingsbury ’s family and to the insistence of Ms. Kingsbury ’s that the expense and physical demands of in vitro fertilization were not worth it , given that the couple could probably get pregnant without it .
They had to stop asking themselves the unanswerable question of whether a cure would be found by the time their child grew up .
It took them two months to make the decision .
But every time Mr. Kingsbury looks at Chloe , with her blue saucer eyes and her tantrums that turn abruptly to laughter — and back — he knows it was worth it .
“ I could n’t imagine them telling me my daughter has cancer , ” he said , “ when I could have stopped it . ”
WASHINGTON - Tough sentencing laws , record numbers of drug offenders and high crime rates have contributed to the United States having the largest prison population and the highest rate of incarceration in the world , according to criminal justice experts .
A U.S. Justice Department report released on November 30 showed that a record 7 million people -- or one in every 32 American adults -- were behind bars , on probation or on parole at the end of last year .
Of the total , 2.2 million were in prison or jail .
According to the International Centre for Prison Studies at King 's College in London , more people are behind bars in the United States than in any other country .
China ranks second with 1.5 million prisoners , followed by Russia with 870,000 .
The U.S. incarceration rate of 737 per 100,000 people in the highest , followed by 611 in Russia and 547 for St. Kitts and Nevis .
In contrast , the incarceration rates in many Western industrial nations range around 100 per 100,000 people .
Groups advocating reform of U.S. sentencing laws seized on the latest U.S. prison population figures showing admissions of inmates have been rising even faster than the numbers of prisoners who have been released .
" The United States has 5 percent of the world 's population and 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population .
We rank first in the world in locking up our fellow citizens , " said Ethan Nadelmann of the Drug Policy Alliance , which supports alternatives in the war on drugs .
" We now imprison more people for drug law violations than all of western Europe , with a much larger population , incarcerates for all offences . "
Ryan King , a policy analyst at The Sentencing Project , a group advocating sentencing reform , said the United States has a more punitive criminal justice system than other countries .
MORE PEOPLE TO PRISON

" We send more people to prison , for more different offences , for longer periods of time than anybody else , " he said .
Drug offenders account for about 2 million of the 7 million in prison , on probation or parole , King said , adding that other countries often stress treatment instead of incarceration .
Commenting on what the prison figures show about U.S. society , King said various social programs , including those dealing with education , poverty , urban development , health care and child care , have failed .
" There are a number of social programs we have failed to deliver .
There are systemic failures going on , " he said .
" A lot of these people then end up in the criminal justice system . "
Kent Scheidegger , legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in California , said the high prison numbers represented a proper response to the crime problem in the United States .
Locking up more criminals has contributed to lower crime rates , he said .
" The hand - wringing over the incarceration rate is missing the mark , " he said .
Scheidegger said the high prison population reflected cultural differences , with the United States having far higher crimes rates than European nations or Japan .
" We have more crime .
More crime gets you more prisoners . "
Julie Stewart , president of the group Families Against Mandatory Minimums , cited the Justice Department report and said drug offenders are clogging the U.S. justice system .
" Why are so many people in prison ?
Blame mandatory sentencing laws and the record number of nonviolent drug offenders subject to them , " she said .

Have any of you ever been in such a bad mood that when people ask you what ’s wrong it just makes you even worse .
Then then try to cheer you up and it makes you so mad that you want to kill puppies .
Anything short of them pulling down their pants and farting the star spangled banner or seeing a clown get hit by a garbage truck would n’t get you in a good mood .
That ’s how I feel all the time .
My co-workers wo n’t talk to me anymore , they started to wear bullet proof vests in anticipation of me coming in with an assault rifle .
All I did for the past two months is work , search Craigslists for apartments , look at apartments , talk to real estate agents about apartments and obsess about apartments .
I actually had dreams about apartments .
One was that I found a place that no one knew about and as I walked around I kept finding new rooms and hidden staircases and that it was right across the street from a public pool , a playground and a Daycare center .
I am going crazy .
I do n’t like the word apartment anymore .
They should call apartments
Fuck you .
“ So are you looking for a 2 or 3 bedroom fuck - you ?
That particular Fuck - you is not de-leaded , sorry . ” Maybe some of you can relate on how much the cost of living sucks around here .
I just got kicked out of my apartment because the landlord sold the place .
I moved in a little over a year ago when I got kicked out of my previous apartment because that landlord wanted to turn it into a condo .
I have lived in Boston for about 6 years and have had to move 5 fucking times all on the landlords behalf .
I also have a 3 year old which means I ca n’t rent a place unless it ’s “ de - leaded ” which basically means 90 % of the apartments on the market are unavailable to me .
It ’s just ridiculous .
This is why all of the young professionals are moving out of Boston .
You either have to be a dirt poor loser or filthy rich .
Maybe I ’m Jaded .
I know I am definitely a grumpy bastard these days .
I just found another place and I do n’t even know the new landlord but based on my previous experience I want to punch him in the face .
On top of being kicked out I had to hand over $ 650 to a rental agent just because the guy walked me through the front door and ran my credit .
I wanted to kick every real estate agent in the crotch ( man or woman I do n’t discriminate ) .
I pretty much hate every homeowner in Boston just out of the sheer envy that I can’t afford my own place .
When the overpriced bubble finally pops around here and all those fucking real estate hungry , over - charging , blood sucking fucking bastard slum lords start losing their shirts I ’ll be so happy .
You ’ll be able to spot me .
I ’ll be the guy running around wrapped in eviction notices pissing off of rooftops and hurling feces at all of the foreclosure homes .
I was actually foolish enough to consider buying property so I would n’t be at the mercy of landlords anymore .
I ’m 31 , I have a nearly perfect credit score and make a decent living .
The only thing I could afford was a condo in Dorchester , Roxbury , Lawrence or Lynn .
Hmmmm , a $ 280,000 interest only loan for a glorified apartment in some of the worst school systems in the country and where Target offers Handgun Buyback programs .
SIGN ME UP !!!!
I ca n’t wait for the day when my daughter comes home wearing hoop earrings and her boyfriends only goal in life is getting 20 ” Dubs for his pimped out Honda Civic .
What really burns me is that if I was a total dredge of society I could live for free or on the cheap .
Katrina victims are living better than I am !
I would love for a flood to take out half of Boston .
Most of my furniture looks like it came from a garage sale anyway .
You ’d see me hanging loose in my brand new trailer , playing my free play station and getting $ 300 lap dances while sipping on some champagne all compliments of the federal government .
Did any of you see the stories on how over 3 billion dollars of FEMA aid was given to inmates , spent in strip clubs and blown on entertainment .
Where is the support for people like myself .
I do n’t come from money , I put myself through college , I pay my taxes and contribute to society and some fucking baby machine tweaker is spitting out future welfare cases while cooking up a new batch of crystal meth in their section 8 housing and selling food stamps for Milwaukee 's Best .
Or I have to compete with some trust - fund baby whose parents do n’t give a shit what the rent is and have driven up the market all over the city .
I have to shell out $ 1,400 a month and have references from the Dali Lama so some spoiled bastard going to Tufts can sit around drinking wine , listening to Radio head and banging college girls .
Where is the justice .
I have been paying over $ 1,200 a month for years , never missed a rent payment and got kicked out on my ass over and over again .
Each time having to shell out an absurd amount of money for first , last , security , moving expenses and anal lubrication .
For any of you just entering into the rental market and ca n’t spend $ 2,000 a month please feel free to use my translation guide below : Cozy = SmallQuaint = BustedConveniently Located =

Paris has just announced an ambitious new push in its révolution numérique , the city 's plan to make itself into one of the world 's most wired capitals .
At the moment , nothing says " wired " quite like " wireless , " so Paris plans on blanketing the city with a free WiFi network operated by private companies .
The socialist mayor of Paris ( that 's not a perjorative statement ; he 's actually a card - carrying member of the Socialist Party ) , Bertrand Delanoe , wants the system up and running by the end of next year .
" We will act fast and firmly ... to create the most favorable conditions for Paris , " he told reporters .
" It is a decisive tool for international competition and thus important for the city . "
But free WiFi is hardly a " decisive tool for international competition . "
After all , more than 60 percent of Parisian households already have high - speed ' Net access and businesses are n't likely to be excited by the prospect of trusting the company 's access to a sometimes - flaky wireless signal with all of its security woes .
Some cities are also learning the hard way that reliable WiFi is easier dreamed up than implemented .
Still , the system promises Internet access in public places like parks and libraries , and it's hard to imagine anything better than reading Ars from a bench in the Jardin du Luxembourg on a fine spring day .
What 's more intriguing than the WiFi announcement is the second part of the plan , which is designed to ensure that 80 percent of Parisian addresses are wired with fiber by 2010 .
The ambitious goal will be aided by a government tax cut on companies that lay fiber over and through city - owned rights - of - way ( think sewers ) .
The resulting system should deliver super - fast ' Net connections to citizens and businesses across the City of Lights .
The city also plans to open Espaces publics Numériques in many arrondissements that will allow people to use computers and take classes on computing and Internet technology .
The goal is to make Paris one of the top digital cities on earth in the next decade , a move that could help the city stay competitive in the global labor market .
Paris is n't alone in its ambitions .
It faces competition from most major cities , including London , San Francisco , Chicago , and others , though most cities have so far only announced plans for WiFi.
Paris ' aggressive fiber rollout plans could give it an edge , potentially making the " Socialist City " one of the best places in Europe to do high - tech business .
In Australia it was a case of one newspaper out reporting another on fashion news .
On Wednesday the Sydney Morning Herald published a piece questioning why Gemma Ward was not in Milan for fashion week .
They reasoned that it was “ fuelling speculation about just what might have kept her away from the estimated five - figure per show earnings . ”
The backstage gossip at Burberry was that she had been dropped because she had put on weight .
A Burberry spokeswoman declined to comment but Ward ’s friend , the British model , Lily Donaldson , said Ward was absent because “ she has things to do ” .
Other reports had Ward acting in a horror film called Strangers .
Seriously , does everything have to be focused on how much a model weighs and if she eats these days ?
As it turns out , according to the Australian newspaper , that Ward was in America to work alongside Liv Tyler for her film debut with The Strangers .
The world No. 2 catwalk model has also been linked to an upcoming Australian movie , The Black Balloon , which is due to star Toni Collette .
Burberry creative director Christopher Bailey , who chose Ward to front the label during Kate Moss ’s spell in the sin-bin last summer , said he had begged her to lead his Milan parade .
“ I could n’t have gotten on my knees more , ” Mr Bailey said yesterday .
“ She had something very important going on in LA .
I was devastated . ”
It was probably a good thing that Ward missed the Milan shows , as there have been more than a handful of PETA protesters protesting at the Burberry Prorsum and Roberto Cavalli .
If your iPhone is locked to a carrier outside the USA , UK , or Canada , use DirectUnlocks .
They have a HUGE range , responsive service and support , but are a little more expensive than UnlockBase .

Getting your iPhone 6s unlocked has become increasingly popular since fed - up consumers discovered they did n’t have to put up with sub- standard phone reception and service .
With the rise in demand , the range of unlocking options has also increased .
The initial software hack that was so effective and popular on the iPhone 3 expanded into hardware unlocking and then into IMEI unlocking .
So , what do you use ?
There are now three options on the table , which one is right for you ?
And which unlocking service provider should you choose once you ’ve decided which method you ’re going to use ?
These are the questions we ’re going to answer today .
First of all , let ’s start with the unlocking options .
Get your iPhone 6 unlocked – Type 1 : Software Unlocking
( Do not use it )
Software unlocking is where you download a piece of software to your device that changes the internal configuration and allows you to make calls from any carrier .
Sounds great and simple in theory , except the loophole used by hackers to unlock your iPhone 6 was closed when Apple released the iPhone 4 and has n’t worked since .
If you ’ve got an iPhone 3 , great , go ahead and download your software hack and unlock your device .
If you ’re using an iPhone 6s , 6 Plus , 6 , or 6s Plus , this wo n’t work for you .
Stay away from software unlocking as you ’re just wasting your time .
Type 2 : Hardware Unlocking
( It can work , but there are a few downsides )
Hardware unlocking is where you have to alter the physical hardware of your iPhone to redirect calls through an alternate path inside your device and hopefully allow you to use the sim card of a different carrier .
To do this , you pay some dodgy looking guy in the back alley of a shady area of town to physically crack open your device and fiddle with its internal workings .
Yes , it ’s as dangerous as it sounds .
Best case scenario is you pay $ 200 + unlocked iphone 6 with a completely voided warranty , that ’s been exposed to dust , dirt , greasy fingers .
That ’s the best case .
Hardware unlocking works in about 30 % of cases .
Worst case ( and typically more common ) scenario is you pay $ 300 + for a broken iPhone with a voided warranty and end up in a heated argument with an angry looking Russian with large friends .
So yes , it can work , but is it really worth risking destroying your device just to make calls from another provider ?
No , I did n’t think so either .
The bottom line is : stay away from hardware unlocking .
Unlocking Type 3 : IMEI Or Network Unlocking
( The only safe unlocking method for iPhone 6 , 6 Plus , 6s , and 6s Plus )
The final , and only that actually works , is IMEI or Network Unlocking .
This is far simpler than downloading dodgy software or paying an even dodgier guy to play around with your phone ’s internal workings .
Every iPhone 6 ever made has a unique identifying code called an IMEI ( short for International Mobile Equipment Identifier ) which is stored on Apple ’s database , along with other details about your device , including the year it was produced , the memory size , the colour , the model number , and also , whether or not it ’s unlocked .
IMEI Unlocking is where someone who has access to the IMEI database changes your device status from locked to unlocked .
No software to download and no physical work to do .
They click a button , you reset your device , and you ’re free to go to any carrier you want .
Obviously , this is the only iPhone unlock method you should use .
There ’s no software to download , and no - one has to change the internal mechanics of your device .
All they need to do is change the status from locked to unlocked , and you can change to any carrier you want , whenever you want .
It avoids all the potential problems the other methods pose and lasts for the lifetime of your iPhone .
Steps needed to unlock your phone .
Its takes less than a few minutes .
1. Find your IMEI code .
This is the unique identification for your iPhone 6 that the 3rd party services need to unlock your device .
Its easy to find :
Method 1 : Dial *#06 #
Method 2 : For iPhone 5 or newer , your IMEI is located on the back of the device
Method 3 : For non-activated devices , there is a little “ i ” button on the activation screen , click it and you ’ll see the IMEI on the screen
2 . Do you know the model of the device you want to unlock ?
Such as the iPhone 4 , 5 , 5c , 5s , 6 , 6 plus , 7 , 7 plus , iPad 2 etc .
3 . Select our recommended services we review below in the article and provide the IMEI number
4. Click the Unlock now !
button then , 5 .
Pay the unlock phone charge – using your credit card .
6 . Enter your email address for updates to the unlock status .
7 . You should hear back within a few days about the completion of your unlock .
Choosing the right IMEI unlock provider
Like any service , not all IMEI unlock providers are created equal .
Some have cheap prices , but ca n’t deliver the unlocks in the time frame they ’ve quoted .
Some have a unlocks for a huge number of providers but no customer support .
And , worst of all , some are just plain scams .
To make sure you end up with the right provider , we ’ve gone through a process of vetting and testing the various providers available .
But , before I get into that …
Click here to skip the methodology and go straight to the reviews
Why I ’m qualified to tell you this
As you can probably guess , there are no formal qualifications for iPhone unlocking or any related fields , but there is a better reason than tertiary qualifications to trust me : I ’ve been unlocking devices for almost 8 years .
I grabbed an iPhone 3G back in 2008 and immediately regretted signing up with AT&T .
Their service was lousy and their customer support was even worse .
My online research yielded software unlocking and I was away .
From that point on , I was the guy my friends came to when they needed advice about unlocking their device .
I lost an iPhone 4 to hardware unlocking in early 2011 and have been sold on IMEI unlocking ever since .
So no , I do n’t have a degree or anything like that , but I ’ve made every mistake you can when it comes to iPhone unlocking and so can at least tell you how to avoid the same ones I made .
IMEI Unlocking Test Methodology
The process for testing the unlock providers was simple .
I started with a Google , forum , and blog search to create a list of all the iPhone 6 Unlock providers available .
I found 11 .
I then started an extensive online review review process ; combing through sites like Trust Pilot and Ripoff Report to whittle the list down to the most reliable sources .
This left 3 services to test .
The next step was to put each of these service providers through their paces .
I put a call out to my mailing list for anyone who had an iPhone 6 , 6 Plus , 6s , or 6s Plus who wanted them unlocked and got 68 responses .
Of these , I chose 9 iPhone 6 ’s to unlock .
These were chosen to cover the represent the three different unlock categories :
Out of contract with no money owing
In contract with no money owing
In contract with money still owing
We tested each of the 3 IMEI unlock service provider in each of these three categories with an iPhone 6/6 Plus and iPhone 6s / 6s Plus .
How we judged their performance
Each unlock service provider was judged on the following 6 categories :
Customer service
Some people are jerks — that ’s a fact .
And no one likes dealing with jerks .
To make sure you were n’t dealing with a bunch of jerks , I tested each company ’s customer service three times : once before placing my order , once after placing my order but before the unlock was complete , and once after the unlock was complete .
Success
And now the critical category : whether they were able or not able to unlock the iPhone ?
Unfortunately , we had more ‘ No ’s ’ than we thought were possible for a well - reviewed service provider , but it was better we find this out now than you have to go through it .
Range of unlocks
Not every unlock service provider can unlock iPhones from every carrier .
Some have an extensive list in North America ( AT&T , Sprint , Telus ) but ca n’t do anything in Australia ( Vodaphone , Telstra , Optus ) .
Some are great in the UK ( O2 , Orange , T - Mobile ) , but have nothing available in Japan ( KDDI , Softbank ) .
A solid unlock service provider will have a wide range of unlocks available .
Payment methods
What good is a great range of unlocks at cheap prices if you can only pay by Western Union bank transfer ?
None .
Payment methods are taken into account but were n’t a deciding factor in our test .
Every provider had a wide enough range of payment options available .
Speed
No one likes to wait around , wasting their time , paying for services they do n’t want while their order is being processed .
Because of this , we included unlocking speed as the final judgement category .
Price
Like any service , the prices between services providers vary greatly .
Some are cheap whilst others will charge an arm and a leg .
Price is taken into account when reviewing these providers , but only as a factor .
Success , support , and speed are also critical .
The Top 3 IMEI Unlock Services For iPhone 6 / Plus & 6s / Plus
After 2 weeks of collecting and reviewing data , testing , and waiting for results , we finally were able to judge the service providers against each other .
Here ’s how they turned out :
# 1. IMEIDoctor– 9.5/10
( Use if you ’re inside the USA , UK , or Canada )
IMEIDoctor are my # 1 recommendation because the do the one thing we paid them to do : unlock the phones .
Yes , I know that sounds like an obvious benefit of paying someone to do something for you , but after reading hundreds of reviews of other services , this is actually a rarity in the market .
But that ’s not the only reason they ’re # 1 .
They did other things right as well .
PROs : First of all , and most importantly , they unlocked all three iPhones .
And not only that , they did it in the time frame they said they would .
Amazing .
I know that if you have n’t tried to get an iPhone unlocked before , you might struggle to see just how amazing this is , but this is a rarity .
Secondly , they ’re reasonably priced .
Yes , ‘ reasonably ’ is n’t the most glowing endorsement possible , but when everyone who ’s cheaper is a scam , then reasonably is a good place to start .
Their unlocks start at around $ 19.99 and go up from there .
You can pay by credit card without any drama and it ’s not going to cost you an arm and a leg .
Thirdly , their support is great .
You can email them anytime , day or night , and their response is usually never more than a few hours away .
Our pre-sale question was answered in 2 hours and 11 minutes , our post - sale but pre-unlock question was answered in 3 hours and 18 minutes , and our post - sale post - unlock follow up question was answered in 3 hours and 9 minutes .
CONs :
The only drawback with IMEIDoctor is that they have a limited range of unlocks .
If you ’re in the US , UK , or Canada , you should be able to find your carrier on their list ( some of the more obscure carriers are missing ) , but outside that , you might struggle .
OVERALL : Overall , IMEIDoctor is my # 1 choice because they do what they say they ’re going to do , when they say they ’re going to do it , at a reasonable price , and are willing to answer your questions along the way .
What more could you want ?
And in an industry renowned for dodgy operators , this makes them a winner .
If you ’re in the US , UK , or Canada and need to unlock your iPhone 6 , 6 Plus , 6s , or 6s Plus , go to IMEIDoctor .
# 2 DirectUnlocks – 9/10 ( Use if you ’re outside the USA , UK or Canada )
Official iPhone Unlock are the # 2 rated unlock provider we found .
Just like IMEIDoctor , they were able to unlock all three iPhone unlocks we sent , but they ’re behind enough to make a difference in who you should use .
PROs : Just like IMEIDoctor , they tick a lot of boxes ( they would n’t get a 9/10 rating is they did n’t ) .
Firstly , they have the biggest range of unlocks on the market .
Is your iPhone locked to Softbank in Japan ?
Great .
They can unlock it .
T - Mobile in Poland ?
Done . Claro in Panama ?
Problem solved .
Their range is SUPER impressive , and they carry unlocks that no - one else has .
Secondly , their support is excellent .
Unlike IMEIDoctor they not only have email support but phone support as well .
You can call them anytime you want , day or night , and there ’ll be someone there to answer your questions .
We called for our pre-sale question and spoke to one of their support agents within 7 minutes .
Our post - sale but pre-unlock question and post - sale post - unlock questions were both sent by email and answered in less than 2 1/2 hours .
Thirdly , they ’re fast .
The majority of their massive range of unlocks are completed in 24 – 72 hours , with only some of the rarer unlocks taking longer than that .
CONs :
There are two drawbacks with DirectUnlocks , and one of the reason them ranking behind the competitor imeidoctor.com .
Firstly , they ’re a little more expensive than iPhoneIMEI .
It ’s not much , only 15 % - 20 % , but it ’s enough to make a difference to your bank balance at the end of the day .
And secondly ( and this is more of a pet peeve than anything ) , their prices are all in Brittish Pounds .
It means that you do n’t actually know exactly what you ’re going to pay until your credit card is charged .
Yes , you have a vague idea ( you can find up - to - date exchange rates here ) , but you do n’t know exactly until your bank decides on what rate they ’re going to charge you .
I guess that ’s the price you pay for being able to unlock your iPhone from just about every carrier in the world , though …
OVERALL : If you need your iPhone unlocked and you use DirectUnlocks to do it , you ’re not going to be disappointed .
Yeah , their USA , UK , and Canadian unlocks are a little pricier than iPhoneIMEI and their prices are in British Pounds , but they have a range or unlocks you just ca n’t beat .
If you ’re outside the USA , UK , and Canada and need your device unlocked , go to DirectUnlocks .
# 3 . IMEI Codes ( 5/10 – Not very impressive )
IMEI codes are the last pick on my list , and the results led me to believe their online reviews might have been a little dishonest .
They failed to unlock two of the three unlocks we tested and we had to file chargebacks to get our money back for the other two .
Not a great way to make a solid first impression .
PROs : I like to think of myself as a positive person , but there ’s very little positive to write about IMEI Codes .
Sure , they unlocked one of the three IMEI ’s we sent them , but they made life difficult in just about every other area including iPhone keyboard apps .
CONs : For starters , they ’re very expensive when I compared their prices , they came in 50 % more than DirectUnlocks and 70 % than iPhoneIMEI for iPhone ’s locked to carriers in North America .
And look , the higher prices would be justified if they offered something that the other guys did n’t , but they do n’t .
Their customer support is sloppy .
They eagerly and enthusiastically responded to my presale question ( obviously have a good sales team ) , but I did n’t hear back to my post - sale but pre-unlock question till 4 days after my unlock was due to be completed .
And even when they did respond , their English was terrible , they did n’t answer the question , and they were rude about it .
That ’s not the level of support I expect from what ’s claimed to be a premium service .
Like I said , they were only able to unlock one of the three phones and their lack of customer support meant we had to file a chargeback to get a refund for the other two .
I do n’t recommend you deal with them .
OVERALL : If you ca n’t find your unlock on IMEIDoctor or if DirectUnlocks is down , then you could try IMEI Codes , but I would definitely only use them as a very last resort if you ’re in an emergency situation .
If you want to know more about IMEI Codes , you can visit their website here .
Wrapping it all up …
There are three different kinds of iPhone 6 and 6 plus unlocks available .
i Phone 6 software unlocking is simply a scam Hardware unlocking can occasionally work , but can ruin your iPhone and void your warranty IMEI or network unlocking is the only way to unlock and keep your warranty intact
We reviewed 11 IMEI unlock providers and tested three providers with 3 unlocks each .
Our test results show :
If you ’re inside the USA , UK , or Canada , unlock your device with IMEIDoctor .
They only have a limited range , but they ’re fast , cheap , and their customer support is excellent .
If you ’re outside the USA , UK or Canada , unlock your device with DirectUnlocks .
They ’re a little pricier , but they have every unlock under the sun and the speed and support to back it up .
The Apple iPhone has come a long way since it ’s release back in the year 2007 , and one of the best attributes about the smartphone is that it is good to use for several years , which is why there are plenty of iPhone 6 users around , despite the device being around 5 years old now .
Whether you have kept a network - locked iPhone 6 around long enough or purchased a used one on the cheap side that needs to be unlocked before use with a different network carrier , this guide should help you do the trick .
Have fun with your unlocked iPhone !

Windows Genuine Advantage is a controversy wrapped in an enigma buried inside a migraine headache .
Or at least that 's what it is for the millions of users who have been falsely identified as software pirates as a result of WGA 's attempt to root out piracy .
Since July 2005 , one in five computers running Windows have failed so - called Windows Genuine Advantage tests according to data from Microsoft .
More than 22 percent of over 500 million systems that were subjected to the browser - based validation scheme were identified as invalid copies of Windows .
All told , some 114 million systems failed the test , which , in terms of retail sales of Windows XP , accounts for over $ 5 billion in lost potential revenue .
The problem with such estimates is that it is unclear why all of these systems failed .
Less than 0.5 % of these systems were reported as having counterfeit software .
Were the rest necessarily pirated by end users ?
No .
Last summer Microsoft admitted that over 20 % of WGA failures were caused by something other than key piracy , that is , piracy involving either a product key generator or use of a volume licensing key .
The company would not reveal the exact nature of these results , other than to say that a portion of them stemmed from unauthorized use of OEM keys on non-OEM hardware ( i.e. , someone using a Dell copy of XP on a non-Dell machine ) .
At the time , Microsoft refused to comment on the rate of pure false positives , that is , the rate of verifiably incorrect identifications of pirated software .
With the release of this latest data , Microsoft said that WGA had a false positive rate " under 1 percent . "
A more precise number has not been forthcoming .
This is an impressive figure until you realize that this means that as many as 5 million people were wrongly accused of being software pirates .
From Microsoft 's point of view , the error rate appears to be acceptable .
1 percent sounds pretty low , does n't it ?
That slice grows to almost 5 percent if you talk only about false positives as a total share of all " hits " on pirated software .
The concern , of course , is scale .
WGA is not in use all over the globe yet , but one can easily see how this 1 percent could bloom into truly astounding numbers .
Add to this the fact that Microsoft has big plans for Office Genuine Advantage , and we start to see a world in which being accused of software piracy becomes statistically more probable than winning the Pick 5 .
Regardless , Microsoft is touting these numbers as showing the need for Windows Genuine Advantage .
There 's certainly something to be said for the high numbers of pirated software found via the process , and Microsoft 's right to expect to be paid for its products is not in question .
The company does risk something of a public relations mess with all of this , however , and it is disheartening to see technology being used once again to " stomp out piracy " with little care for how it treads on the backs of honest folks .

It 's the film Quentin Tarantino fans have spent the best part of a decade waiting for .
The latest word from Michael Madsen is that the proposed Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs spin - off , featuring Madsen and John Travolta as the Vega brothers , could be heading for production after all .
The idea originally formed in Tarantino 's mind because Vincent Vega from Pulp Fiction and Vic Vega from Reservoir Dogs had always been conceived as siblings .
But with both characters having been killed in their respective films , the only possibility appeared to be a prequel , which was looking less and less likely given the advancing years of Travolta , 51 , and Madsen , 48 .
According to Madsen , however , the maverick director has come up with an ingenious plan to make the film happen after all .
He told Moviehole.net : " Well , first he said he would do it , then he said he was n't going to do it .
Then he called me and said , ' You know , I 've figured out a way to do it .
It ca n't be a prequel because you and John do n't look the same .
" It would n't make sense as a sequel because you 're both dead . '
And he gave me an idea that would be really outrageous - that John and I would be the twin brothers of Vic and Vincent .
We come from Amsterdam to LA to avenge the deaths of our brothers .
I think that 's pretty interesting .
For me , I 'd love to do it . "
In the meantime Madsen fans will have to be content with the fact that the actor is currently preparing to reprise his role as Bob in Sin City 2 .
Dawkins relies here on two premises : first , that a creator is bound to be more complex , and hence improbable , than his creation ( you never , for instance , see a horseshoe making a blacksmith ) ; and second , that to explain the improbable in terms of the more improbable is no explanation at all .
Neither of these is among the “ laws of probability , ” as he suggests .
The first is hotly disputed by theologians , who insist , in a rather woolly metaphysical way , that God is the essence of simplicity .
He is , after all , infinite in every respect , and therefore much easier to define than a finite thing .
Dawkins , however , points out that God ca n’t be all that simple if he is capable of , among other feats , simultaneously monitoring the thoughts of all his creatures and answering their prayers .
( “ Such bandwidth ! ” the author exclaims . )
If God is indeed more complex and improbable than his creation , does that rule him out as a valid explanation for the universe ?
The beauty of Darwinian evolution , as Dawkins never tires of observing , is that it shows how the simple can give rise to the complex .
But not all scientific explanation follows this model .
In physics , for example , the law of entropy implies that , for the universe as a whole , order always gives way to disorder ; thus , if you want to explain the present state of the universe in terms of the past , you are pretty much stuck with explaining the probable ( messy ) in terms of the improbable ( neat ) .
It is far from clear which explanatory model makes sense for the deepest question , the one that , Dawkins complains , his theologian friends keep harping on : why does the universe exist at all ?
Darwinian processes can take you from simple to complex , but they ca n’t take you from Nothing to Something .
If there is an ultimate explanation for our contingent and perishable world , it would seemingly have to appeal to something that is both necessary and imperishable , which one might label “ God . ”
Of course , it ca n’t be known for sure that there is such an explanation .
Perhaps , as Russell thought , “ the universe is just there , and that ’s all . ”
This sort of coolly speculative thinking could not be more remote from the rococo rituals of religion as it is actually practiced across the world .
Why is it that all human cultures have religion if , as Dawkins believes he has proved , it rests on a delusion ?
Many thinkers —
Marx , Freud , Durkheim — have produced natural histories of religion , arguing that it arose to serve some social or psychological function , such as , in Freud ’s account , the fulfillment of repressed wishes toward a father - figure .
Image Credit ... Ray Bartkus
Dawkins ’s own attempt at a natural history is Darwinian , but not in the way you might expect .
He is skeptical that religion has any survival value , contending that its cost in blood and guilt outweighs any conceivable benefits .
Instead , he attributes religion to a “ misfiring ” of something else that is adaptively useful ; namely , a child ’s evolved tendency to believe its parents .
Religious ideas , he thinks , are viruslike “ memes ” that multiply by infecting the gullible brains of children .
( Dawkins coined the term “ meme ” three decades ago to refer to bits of culture that , he holds , reproduce and compete the way genes do . )
Each religion , as he sees it , is a complex of mutually compatible memes that has managed to survive a process of natural selection .
( “ Perhaps , ” he writes in his usual provocative vein , “ Islam is analogous to a carnivorous gene complex , Buddhism to a herbivorous one . ” )
Religious beliefs , on this view , benefit neither us nor our genes ; they benefit themselves .
Dawkins ’s gullible - child proposal is , as he concedes , just one of many Darwinian hypotheses that have been speculatively put forward to account for religion .
( Another is that religion is a byproduct of our genetically programmed tendency to fall in love . )
Perhaps one of these hypotheses is true .
If so , what would that say about the truth of religious beliefs themselves ?
The story Dawkins tells about religion might also be told about science or ethics .
All ideas can be viewed as memes that replicate by jumping from brain to brain .
Some of these ideas , Dawkins observes , spread because they are good for us , in the sense that they raise the likelihood of our genes getting into the next generation ; others — like , he claims , religion — spread because normally useful parts of our minds “ misfire . ”
Ethical values , he suggests , fall into the first category .
Altruism , for example , benefits our selfish genes when it is lavished on close kin who share copies of those genes , or on non -kin who are in a position to return the favor .
But what about pure “ Good Samaritan ” acts of kindness ?
These , Dawkins says , could be “ misfirings , ” although , he hastens to add , misfirings of a “ blessed , precious ” sort , unlike the nasty religious ones .
But the objectivity of ethics is undermined by Dawkins ’s logic just as surely as religion is .
The evolutionary biologist E. O. Wilson , in a 1985 paper written with the philosopher Michael Ruse , put the point starkly : ethics “ is an illusion fobbed off on us by our genes to get us to cooperate , ” and “ the way our biology enforces its ends is by making us think that there is an objective higher code to which we are all subject . ”
In reducing ideas to “ memes ” that propagate by various kinds of “ misfiring , ” Dawkins is , willy - nilly , courting what some have called Darwinian nihilism .
Vista and the Altair
In the midst of the biggest train wreck in PC business history ( maybe even bigger than the disastrous OS / 2 collaboration ... ) , I have been thinking about my prior employer : what they have done wrong , what they could do differently .
My conclusion : Microsoft has lost its way .
But not recently .
It lost its way back in 1995 or so , when it started to think of itself primarily in terms of its thriving finances , and when it began to define itself above all as a permanent " growth " company .
It lost its way when it forgot its original mission , its corporate DNA .
Is Sinofsky going to save them ?
I do not think so .
But I think Microsoft can find its way again if it scares up the courage return to its roots and take charge of its own mission again .
My thoughts below ....
Messy Code is a Symptom not a Cause
In the wake of the latest Vista delay it is interesting to read the Mini blog and hear engineers say ( when they 're done ranting about their managers ) they wish they could " throw out everything and start again . "
But being focused on some messy code ( or ineffective managers ) is like seeing some fallen trees and missing the fact that the whole forest has been on fire for some time .
When you are energized , you will fix , work around , or remove bad code .
And when you are on a roll , do you listen to your manager ?
No , there is a bigger issue .
What is really going on ?
The problem : Microsoft does not understand itself .
It continues to choose the wrong mission for itself .
Even to the extent that the executives are driving any coherent strategy , the company strategy is wrong , and has been wrong since 1995 .
The company has been spending too much time listening to outsiders and not enough time understanding itself .
Microsoft 's strategy does not fit with its own people .
Enslavement to the Quarter
The only comprehensible vision I can really see at Microsoft today is a complete and utter enslavement to their 10 - Qs .
It may seem strange for a company with tens of billions in the bank and the strongest bottom line in the industry to be worred about its financial health .
But financial myopia is a sickness that can afflict even the wealthiest .
The true mission driving the company in 2006 ?
" Seek out revenue growth wherever we can find it . "
Why is revenue growth such an imperative ?
Because with 95 % PC market share and global saturation of the desktop business , there does n't seem to be any more than a few drops of money to squeeze out of that tired old lemon called the PC industry .
Yet Microsoft has been growing for so long that it has fooled itself into thinking that " growth " is its main mission , and so the company is on the hunt for more profits .
To the extent that the company can't find organic growth , they must cut costs and increase prices - and everybody knows neither of those things is terribly fun .
So the strategic mission at Microsoft is to find a fresh source of high - margin high - growth sustainance like the PC - software - business - of - old .
Find money anywhere !
At any cost .
But " seek out revenue " is not an inspiring mission for a company who has hired 20,000 engineers who dream of changing the world .
Programmers just do n't think in terms of dollars .
Alright , maybe that 's not totally true - but programmers who do think in terms of dollars tend to go work for DE Shaw or some investment bank where they get to deal with money directly .
And I think that 's the key .
Programmers go to companies based on the kinds of problems that inspire them .
Microsoft attracts , retains , and nurtures a certain kind of programmer , a person who is inspired by a particular vision of the world .
What motivates a Microsoft engineer ?
Give me an S - Q- L , Give me an M - S - N , Rah Rah !
Somehow management at Microsoft has fooled itself into thinking that they can work backwards from rich sources of revenue to ways of motivating its people .
For example one day management woke up and noticed that IBM and Oracle were making quite a bit of money on databases .
What to do ?
Learn something about relational databases and get a team to work on SQL Server .
Netscape went public and in a fit of insanity Wall Street drew big neon lights to money in the internet sector .
Ok , survey says ?
Build a web browser too .
And recently they have noticed that Google is making money on search .
So what now ?
Learn a little about information retrieval and chase the dollars with MSN Search .
It 's all just software , right ?
So naturally it should be easy to find ways of getting all those software people to work on databases or browsers or websearch or whatever is needed to follow up on Today 's Big Strategy .
And if motivation is a problem Microsoft can always hire a few VPs to figure out how to get people psyched up .
What to do if the team slows down ?
Put Steve on stage , have him jump around a bit .
Hand out some lucite trophies , lead some cheers .
Rah rah rah , software is a football game .
Have no fear !
We will win !
We 're the biggest and the baddest , so go in there and kill 'em !
But we 're talking a bunch of geeks here .
That sort of thing does n't really work .
Microsoft's DNA
At its heart , Microsoft is not really about chasing revenue .
And despite investors ' deepest wishes , Microsoft is not really about growth .
Microsoft does have a very distinctive culture , but it seems to have long forgotten what it is .
Yet still after more than three decades it is still there , unchanging , and it is something that can't be altered .
In 2006 , Microsoft is still the company that , in 1975 , dreamed about one very big thing :
A computer in every home .
When Bill and Paul hacked away at the first Altair , they were n't motivated by the idea of sending their computer into space or into corporations or onto aircraft carriers or making a big artificial intelligence .
I guarantee what psyched them up most was the idea of getting things to the point where you could bring it home , plug it in on the dining room table , and play an adventure game on it .
The home computer .
The personal computer .
That 's Microsoft's DNA .
That lifeblood from 1975 still courses through the veins of the entire company .
Even as the company tries to bolt on extra body parts to continue to increase its bottom line , Microsoft is still that old Altair company at its core .
Microsoft Keeps Wandering Home
There is ample evidence that original vision is the only thing that gets Microsoft really fired up .
For example , take a look at what the Microsoft VPs come up with when given the charter of working on something decidedly non-Altair like , such as SQL or the Internet or MSN Search :
Internet : NCSA TCP HThuh ?
Boring ...
But hey a browser would be cool as the Windows 98 shell !
Databases : Relational ACIDwhat ?
Yawn .
Oh , but imagine if we use it for the Longhorn filesystem !
Search : Indexing , crawlingzzz .
Not even a desktop app .
Hey , now that 's an idea !
Make a list of Microsoft 's bizarre technology failures , and you will find a pattern .
Whenever faced with a team who can't get itself motivated to win a software battle that lies outside the home , what does Microsoft do ?
Instinctively , like a noncognitive animal ( and like all large coporations ) , Microsoft keeps returning to its roots , guided by its genetics , trying to find its way home , cramming its technology into the old trusty Altair .
" Integrated Innovation . "
Microsoft sees all software in terms of its impact on the dining room table .
The Real Microsoft
Is the real Microsoft still around today ?
Oh sure .
The true Microsoft was in danger of vanishing after the 1995 Netscape IPO spun everybody 's head around with thoughts of equity market dollars .
But in 1999 , old TCP engineer and rising star J Allard left IIS and the whole Internet thing to revive the old Microsoft again .
Maybe J understood the truth about Microsoft .
The company is not about growth , or the enterprise , or " information at your fingertips . "
The true Microsoft is about setting up a cool box of technology in your house to show off to your buddies .
In 1975 , it was about the Altair ; later the Apple II , TRS - 80 , Atari 800 , Commodore 64 ; then the Macintosh ; and then for a very very long time the IBM PC and its clones .
In 2006 , we call it the Xbox .
In the Zone , Leave me Alone
I find one distinctive trait of the Xbox team very interesting .
While all the other divisions at Microsoft have the instinct of " running home to mother " - that is , integrating their software with the old Windows business , everybody at Xbox has the opposite instinct .
Sure , the Xbox team does look to the rest of Microsoft as a resource .
But not as a safety net or distribution channel or integration point or source of vision .
The Xbox team goes around the company stealing the best code and best people and best ideas .
They bring these treasures back to their own private campus to use for their own projects .
And then they close their doors and tell the rest of the company , " now leave us alone . "
Why ?
Because Xbox is the only division at the company that is capable of motivating itself for the long haul .
And why is that ?
Because Xbox is the only division of the company that is still working on the Altair vision : a computer in every home .
Got a computer in your home already , you say ?
That 's not enough .
That old PC is not a a computer you 'd whip out on the dining room table .
You need an Xbox in every home too .
More computers in every home .
More , more , more .
More of something different .
More of the same .
The Right Haiku for Microsoft
Computers in the home .
That 's what Microsoft is all about , and that is what their corporate vision should be .
Notice that when Vista stumbles , the engineers at Microsoft instinctively do n't look to Google or Yahoo or RIMM or Palm or Pixar or Amazon or whoever to say " why ca n't we be more like them ! "
They look at Apple .
They look at Xbox .
Apple and Xbox are delivering on the vision that everybody at Microsoft wants to work on .
While most of Microsoft is stumbling to try to integrate new sources of revenue into the lumbering Windows operating system , Apple and Xbox are making their customers happy , making their partners happy , making their employees happy .
How ?
By playing Microsoft 's original game , just a bit evolved for 2006 .
A computer in every home
on every desk
in every room
for every person
for every moment .
Personal computers everywhere .
Sure , in 2006 they might start to look like a TV or a game machine or something .
Make no mistake .
Those devices are all Altairs .
Computers in the home .
A Computer for Every Moment
All the industry pundits are wringing their hands about the death of growth in the PC industry , and they have scared Microsoft off to try to look for money in different corners of the world .
But what is missing , and what is needed , is a real vision .
Microsoft needs to be bold .
The company needs to believe in something that nobody else believes .
It needs to believe that there are not enough personal computers in the world .
By Personal Computers I do n't mean PC clones that you can get from Dell and Gateway today .
I mean computers for every person , for every moment .
Microsoft needs to tell everybody : there are not nearly enough computers in every home .
It seems pretty clear that Apple still believes in this vision .
Apple is well on its way to delivering more " Personal Computer Television Moments " in every home .
It seems pretty clear that the Xbox team still believes in this vision .
It is well on its way to delivering more " Personal Computer Game Playing Moments " in every home .
Meanwhile , we have to ask : what is Vista for ?
The right path for Microsoft is not too hard to figure out .
But there is one hard part : the path cannot be found by just chasing the money .
Microsoft needs to rethink .

Claim : A Medal of Honor carried by a World War II veteran aroused suspicion among airport security forces .
TRUE
Examples : [ Collected via e-mail , March 2002 ]
“ They just kept passing it around there were eight or nine or ten of them who handled it before it was over , ” he said .
“ They had found it in my pocket at the airport , and they thought it was suspicious .
It ’s shaped like a star , and they were looking at the metal edges of it , like it was a weapon .
I asked for it back , but they kept handing it to each other and inspecting it .
I was told to move to a separate area .
“ I told them — just turn it over .
The engraving on the back explains everything .
But they thought they must have something potentially dangerous here .
“ I told them exactly what it was — I said , ‘ That ’s my Congressional Medal of Honor . ´ ”
The man relating that story was retired Gen. Joe Foss , 86 .
His experience last month in Arizona at the international airport in Phoenix — may be the ultimate symbol of the out - of - kilter times we are going through .
We are so afraid of terrorists in our midst that what happened to Foss is not only believable , but perhaps even inevitable :
The Congressional Medal of Honor will be taken from its recipient because it looks vaguely ominous .
I spoke with Foss because I wanted to hear it from him directly .
He told me that he holds no animosity about the incident —
“ I ’m just as interested in defeating the terrorists as anyone is , I promise you that ” and that he is mostly sad that no one knew what the Medal of Honor was .
Foss was awarded the medal by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II after shooting down 26 enemy planes as a Marine fighter pilot in solo combat in the Pacific .
He grew up in South Dakota — after the war he would become governor of that state — and took flying lessons as a young man , then went to war .
He lives in Scottsdale , Ariz. , and when he travels he is patted down in airports instead of going through the metal detectors , because of a heart pacemaker .
At the airport in Phoenix , he said , he was being searched manually and he put his jacket through the X - ray machine .
A couple of things caught the attention of the screeners — rightly so .
Foss has a key chain made out of a dummy bullet , with a hole drilled through it to make it evident it is harmless ; he also carries a small knife / file with the Medal of Honor Society ’s insignia on it .
The screeners took both of them from Foss — traveling during these nervous days with items that look like bullets , or with even a small knife , will , and should , invite scrutiny .
Even if you ’re 86 .
Even if you ’re a war hero .
That ’s not what frustrated him .
The screeners , he said , allowed him to mail the key chain and the little knife back to his home from the airport .
But for 45 minutes , he estimated , he was passed from person to person , made to remove his boots and tie and belt and hat three different times , and prevented from boarding his flight ( he was eventually allowed on ) because the security personnel , he said , had misgivings about his Medal of Honor .
( America West Airlines , in whose terminal in Phoenix the incident allegedly took place , said through a spokeswoman shortly after the misunderstanding that the airline ’s objective is to ensure safety and security for all passengers and employees . )
“ I want you to know , ” Foss told me , “ that I do n’t go around wearing my Medal of Honor , or carrying it with me .
The only reason I had it with me on this flight was that I was supposed to give a speech to a class at the United States Military Academy at West Point , and I thought the medal was something the cadets might be interested in seeing . ”
I asked him what he remembered about being presented the Congressional Medal of Honor .
“ I was right fresh out of combat when I was called to the White House , ” he said .
“ FDR was behind his desk , and he pinned the medal on my uniform .
He said it was for actions above and beyond the call of duty .
“ I was nervous , being in the presence of the president .
I think I may have been more nervous there than I was in combat .
My wife and mother were with me — it was quite a day .
I think President Roosevelt called me ‘ young feller . ' ”
After the White House ceremony , Foss had his photograph taken with the medal — the nation ’s highest military honor for valor in action — on his uniform .
That photo was the full front cover of Life magazine , the issue of June 7 , 1943 ; the cover caption was : “ Captain Foss , U.S.M.C. America ’s No. 1 Ace . ”
And now , almost 60 years later , the Medal of Honor was being handed from one skeptical security screener to another in the Phoenix airport , while Foss , at 86 , took his boots and belt off as ordered .
“ I was n’t upset for me , ” he said .
“ I was upset for the Medal of Honor , that they just did n’t know what it even was .
It represents all of the guys who lost their lives — the guys who never came back .
Everyone who put their lives on the line for their country .
You ’re supposed to know what the Medal of Honor is . ”
Here we go again  another “ serious escalation ” has begun in the Middle East , or so BBC World was telling audiences throughout Sunday .
So what prompted the BBC ’s judgment that the crisis was escalating once more ?
You can be sure it had nothing to do with the more than 130 Lebanese dead after five days of savage aerial bombardment from at least 2,000 sorties by Israeli war planes that are making the country ’s south a disaster zone and turning Beirut into a crumbling ghost town .
Those dead , most civilians and many of them women and children , hardly get a mention , their lives apparently empty of meaning or significance in this confrontation .
Nor is it the Lebanese roads and bridges being pounded into dust , the petrol stations and oil refineries going up in smoke , the phone networks and TV stations being obliterated , the water and electricity supplies being cut off .
The rapid transformation of a modern vibrant country like Lebanon into the same category of open - air prison as Gaza is not an escalation in the BBC ’s view .
No , the BBC proffered a first , hesitant “ escalation ” on Thursday night when Hezbollah had the audacity to fire a handful of rockets at Haifa in response to the growing Lebanese death toll .
The worst damage the Katyushas inflicted was one gouging a chunk of earth out of the hillside overlooking the port .
But the BBC felt confident to declare the escalation had turned “ serious ” on Sunday when Hezbollah not only fired more rockets at Haifa but one killed a group of eight railway workers in a station depot .
Now that Israeli civilians as well as Lebanese civilians are dying  even if in far smaller numbers  the BBC ’s battalions of journalists in northern Israel finally have something to report on .
So BBC World ’s broadcast at 9 a.m GMT ( noon Israel / Lebanon time ) hardly veered out of Haifa or Jerusalem .
After the presenter ’s headline declaration that the Hezbollah strike on Haifa was a “ serious escalation , ” the news segued into a lengthy and sympathetic interview with an Israeli police spokesman in Haifa by Wyre Davies ; followed by another lazy interview , lasting the better part of five minutes , with an Israeli government spokesman in Jerusalem ; followed by Ben Brown in Beirut interviewing a British holidaymaker about her night of horror in her hotel .
And in those 15 minutes that was about as close as we got to hearing what the Lebanese had been enduring from a night and morning of Israeli aerial strikes on Beirut and the country ’s south .
If there was any mention of the suffering of Lebanese civilians  and doubtless the BBC will tell me there was  the reference was so fleeting that I missed it .
And if I missed it , then so did most BBC World viewers .
The true nature of the “ serious escalation ” was soon apparent  or at least it was if one watched Arab TV channels .
They showed an urban wasteland of rubble and dust in the suburbs of Beirut and Tyre that was shockingly reminiscent of New York in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks .
They cut intermittently to local hospitals filled with Lebanese children , their faces a rash of bloody pockmarks from the spray of Israeli shrapnel .
More terrible images of children burnt and lying in pools of blood arrived in my e-mail inbox from Lebanese bloggers .
But in the BBC ’s lexicon , escalation has nothing to do with the enormous destruction Israel can unleash on Lebanon , only the occasional , smaller - scale blow Hezbollah scores against Israel .
Switching from the Arab channels back to the BBC for their 11 a.m. broadcast in the hope of finding the same images of devastation in Tyre and Beirut , I stumbled on yet another timid interview with Israel ’s ubiquitous spokesman Mark Regev .
It was followed by two headlines : Nine dead in Israel after a “ barrage ” of attacks on Haifa , and foreign governments prepare to evacuate their nationals out of the region .
At noon , James Reynolds as good as gave the game away : the Hezbollah strike on Haifa , he said , proved that the rockets are “ no longer just an irritant . ”
Now it was clear why a “ serious escalation ” had begun : Israel was actually being harmed by Hezbollah ’s rockets rather than just irritated .
Until then the harm had been mainly inflicted on Lebanese civilians , so no escalation was taking place .
As I regularly flicked to the BBC ’s coverage all afternoon , I found almost no mention of those dead in Lebanon .
They had become “ non-beings , ” irrelevant in the calculations not only of our world leaders but of our major broadcasters .
It was n’t till the 7 p.m. news that I saw meaningful images from Lebanon , as Gavin Hewitt followed a fire crew trying to put out an enormous oil refinery blaze in Tyre .
Although we saw some of the suffering of the Lebanese population , the anchor felt obliged to preface the scenes from Lebanon with the statement that they were Israeli “ retaliation ” for the Haifa attack , even though Israel had been launching such strikes for four days before the lethal rocket strike on Haifa .
In the same broadcast , an Israeli cabinet minister , Shaul Mofaz , was given air time to make the claim that parts of the rockets that landed in Haifa were Syrian - made .
Allegations by the Lebanese president , Emile Lahoud , widely shown on Arab TV that Israel had been using phosphorus incendiary bombs  illegal under international law  received no coverage at all .
On the 8 p.m. news , one of the headlines was a menacing quote from Sheik Hassan Nasrallah , the Hezbollah leader , that “ Haifa is just the beginning . ”
Mike Wooldridge in the Jerusalem studio made great play of the quote , taken from a broadcast Nasrallah had made several hours earlier .
The BBC may have lifted the sentence from the Israeli media because they missed out the important conditional context inserted by Nasrallah  it was only the “ beginning ” of what Hezbollah could do if Israel continued its attacks .
They could have found this out even from the Israeli media if they had taken the care to look more closely : “ As long as the enemy pursues its aggression without limits and red lines , we will pursue the confrontation without limits and without red lines , ” Nasrallah was quoted as saying by the daily Ha’aretz newspaper .
In other words , Nasrallah was warning that Hezbollah would give back as good as it gets  a standard piece of rhetoric from a military leader in times of confrontation .
The BBC is no worse than CNN , Sky and , of course , Fox News .
It is possibly far better , which is reason enough why we should be outraged that this is the best international broadcast coverage we are likely to get of the conflict .
The reporting we are seeing from the BBC and the other broadcasters is racist ; there is no other word to describe it .
The journalists ’ working assumption is that Israeli lives are more precious , more valuable than Lebanese lives .
A few dead Israelis justify massive retaliation ; many Lebanese dead barely merit a mention .
The subtext seems to be that all the Lebanese , even the tiny bleeding children I see on Arab TV , are terrorists .
It is just the way Arabs are .
That is why the capture of two Israeli soldiers is more newsworthy to our broadcasters than the dozens of Lebanese civilians dying from the Israeli bombing runs that have followed .
The eight Israelis killed on Sunday are worth far more than the 130 - plus Lebanese lives taken so far and the hundreds more we can expect to die in the coming days .
There is no excuse for this asymmetry of coverage .
BBC reporters are in Lebanon just as they are in Israel .
They can find spokespeople in Lebanon just as easily as they can find them in Israel .
They can show the far vaster scale of devastation in Beirut as easily as the wreckage in Haifa .
They can speak to the Lebanese casualties just as easily as they can to those in Israel .
But they do n’t  and as a fellow journalist I have to ask myself why .
My previous criticisms of British reporters over their distorted coverage of Israel ’s military assaults in Gaza a few weeks back appear to have struck a raw nerve .
Certainly they provoked a series of e-mails  some defensive , others angry  from a few of the reporters I named .
All tried to defend their own coverage , unable to accept my criticisms because they are sure that they personally do not take sides .
They are not “ campaigning ” journalists after all , they are “ professionals ” doing a job .
But the problem is not with them , it is with the job they have to do  and the nature of the professionalism they so prize .
I am sure the BBC’s Wyre Davies cares as much about Lebanese deaths as he does about Israeli ones .
But he also knows his career at the BBC demands that he not ask his bosses questions when told to give valuable minutes of air time to an Israeli police spokesman who offers us only platitudes .
Similarly , we see James Reynolds use his broadcast from Haifa at noon to show emotive footage of him and his colleagues running for shelter as Israeli air raid sirens go off , only to tell us that in fact no rockets landed in Haifa .
That nonevent was shown by the BBC every hour on the hour all afternoon and evening .
Was it more significant than the images of death we never saw taking place just over the border ?
These images from Lebanon exist , because the Arab channels spent all day showing them .
Matthew Price knows too that in the BBC ’s view it is his job as he stands in Haifa , after we have repeatedly heard Israeli spokespeople giving their version of events , to repeat their message , dropping even the quotes marks as he passionately tells us how tough Israel must now be , how it must “ retaliate ” to protect its citizens , how it must “ punish ” Hezbollah
This is not journalism ; it ’s reporting as a propaganda arm of a foreign power .
Can we imagine Ben Brown doing the same from Beirut , standing in front of the BBC cameras telling us how Hezbollah has no choice faced with Israel ’s military onslaught but to start hitting Haifa harder , blowing up its oil refineries and targeting civilian infrastructure to “ pressure ” Israel to negotiate ?
Would the BBC bother to show prerecorded footage of Brown fleeing for his safety in Beirut in what later turned out to be a false alarm ?
Of course not .
Doubtless Brown and his colleagues are forced to take cover on a regular basis for fear of being hurt by Israeli air strikes , but his fear  or more precisely , the fear of the Lebanese he stands alongside  is not part of the story for the BBC .
Only Israeli fears are newsworthy .
These reporters are working in a framework of news priorities laid down by faceless news executives far away from the frontline who understand only too well the institutional pressures on the BBC  and the institutional biases that are the result .
They know that the Israel lobby is too powerful and well resourced to take on without suffering flak ; that the charge of anti-Semitism might be terminally damaging to the BBC ’s reputation ; that the BBC is expected broadly to reflect the positions of the British governmment if it wants an easy ride with its regulators ; that to remain credible it should not stray too far from the line of its mainly American rivals , who have their own more intense domestic pressures to side with Israel .
This distortion of news priorities has real costs that can be measured in lives  in the days and weeks to come , hundreds , possibly thousands , of lives in both Israel and Lebanon .
As long as Israel is portrayed by our major broadcasters as the one under attack , its deaths alone as significant , then the slide to a regional war  a war of choice being waged by the Israeli government and army  is likely to become inevitable .
So to Jeremy Bowen , James Reynolds , Ben Brown , Wyre Davies , Matthew Price , and all the other BBC journalists reporting from the frontline of the Middle East , and the faceless news executives who sent them there , I say : you may be nice people with the best of intentions , but shame on you .
I 've worked a little more on clbuild .
The current status is that it should help people who 're already comfortable with Lisp to keep up - to - date on the bleeding edge versions of a lot of related packages .
This will hopefully save a lot of people 's time in chasing dependencies and guessing what needs to be upgraded when there is a problem .
You need a platform that supports SBCL with threads .
Here 's the usage :
$ ./ clbuild Usage : world download and compile SBCL and the applications afresh build download / update and compile the applications buildsbcl download / update and compile SBCL clean delete all compiled object files mrproper delete all downloaded source and fasl files slime run the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode in a fresh Emacs sbcl run SBCL in the terminal ( with all packages available to REQUIRE ) listener run the McCLIM listener gsharp run the Gsharp score editor closure run the CLOSURE web browser ( requires Debian packages gif2png and libjpeg - progs or equiv )
If you do ' world ' or ' buildsbcl ' then SBCL will be installed in target / and used for future commands .
If you do n't run these commands ( or you remove target / ) then clbuild uses the ' sbcl ' in your PATH .
The NASA library in Greenbelt , Md. , was part of John C. Mather ’s daily routine for years leading up to the astrophysicist ’s sharing of the 2006 Nobel Prize for shedding new light on the big bang theory of creation .
He researched existing space hardware and instrumentation there while designing a satellite that collected data for his prize - winning discovery .
So when he learned that federal officials were planning to close the library , Mather was stunned .
“ It is completely absurd , ” he said .
“ The library is a national treasure .
It is probably the single strongest library for space science and engineering in the universe . ”
Mather is one of thousands of people who critics say could lose access to research materials as the government closes and downsizes libraries that house collections vital to scientific investigation and the enforcement of environmental laws .

Across the country , half a dozen federal libraries are closed or closing .
Others have reduced staffing , hours of operation , public access or subscriptions .
In Washington , books are boxed at an Environmental Protection Agency library that helped toxicologists assess health effects of pesticides and chemicals .
The General Services Administration headquarters library where patrons conducted research on real estate , telecommunications and government finance was shuttered this year , as was the Department of Energy headquarters library that collected literature for government scientists and contractors .
Officials say the cutbacks have been driven by tight budgets , declining patronage and rising demand for online services .
And they say leaner operations will improve efficiency while maintaining essential functions .
“ We are trying to improve access and ... do more with a little less money , ” said Linda Travers , acting assistant administrator for the EPA ’s office of environmental information .
Although hundreds of federal libraries remain open , critics say the downsizing , especially at the EPA , demonstrates the Bush administration ’s indifference to transparent government and to scientific solutions to many pressing problems .
Advertisement
“ Crucial information generated with taxpayer dollars is now not available to the public and the scientists who need it , ” said Emily Sheketoff , head of the American Library Assn . 's Washington office .
“ This is the beginning of the elimination of all these government libraries .
I think you have an administration that does not have a commitment to access to information . ”
Opponents of the EPA ’s reductions say they are likely to slow the work of regulators and scientists who depend on librarians and reference materials that are not online .
They fear that some publications will never be digitized because of copyright restrictions or cost .
They worry that important material will be dispersed , discarded or lost .
And they contend that many people will lose access to collections because they cannot navigate online services .
In addition to shutting its headquarters library and a chemical library in the nation ’s capital , the EPA has closed regional libraries in Chicago , Kansas City and Dallas that have helped federal investigators track sources of fish kills and identify companies responsible for pollution .

The plans prompted the EPA ’s own compliance office to express concern that cuts could weaken efforts to enforce environmental laws .
EPA employee unions decried the severity of a proposed $ 2.5 - million cut in a library budget that was $ 7 million last fiscal year .
And , at the request of three House committees , the Government Accountability Office now is examining the reductions .
“ Congress should not allow EPA to gut its library system , which plays a critical role in supporting the agency ’s mission to protect the environment and public health , ” 18 U.S. senators , nearly all Democrats , said last month in a letter seeking restoration of library services until the issue can be reviewed .
The EPA said the president ’s proposed budget had accelerated efforts to modernize the system , and they said that library visits were declining .
“ I think we are living in a world of digitized information , ” said Travers of the EPA .
“ In the end there will be better access . ”

Travers said all EPA - generated documents from the closed libraries would be online by January and the rest of the agency ’s 51,000 reports would be digitized within two years .
The EPA , she said , would not digitize books , scientific journals and non-EPA studies but would keep one copy of each available for inter-library loans .
The Library of Congress has digitized more than 11 million items in its collection of 132 million , and it retains the originals .
But Deanna Marcum , associate librarian for library services there , said maintaining library space with staff provides important benefits , especially at specialized libraries .
“ The librarians are so accustomed to doing searches and know the sources so well , and it would be difficult for scientists to have the same level of comfort , ” she said .
“ So , will they take the information they get and use it rather than being exhaustive in their searches ? ”
An EPA study in 2004 concluded that the libraries saved millions of dollars a year by performing time - consuming research for agency staff members .
The general public also uses EPA ’s libraries .

When a sanitary district proposed a sludge incinerator along Lake Michigan in Waukegan , Ill. , a few years ago , activist Verena Owen went to the EPA library in Chicago , and with help from a librarian researched how much mercury comes from incinerators and its toxicity .
Owen said her findings helped a successful campaign to relocate the plant .
When she recently heard the library had gone dark , Owen was outraged : “ If I had known about it , I would have chained myself to the bookcase . ”
The EPA ’s chemical library in Washington assisted scientists who developed drinking water standards and studied the effects of pesticides .
“ It allowed scientists to check on what they were being told by companies registering new chemicals , ” said Linda Miller Poore , a longtime contract librarian there .
In May , after learning the library would close , Poore took a job at NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center library in Greenbelt , Md. , a facility that supports space exploration and global warming research .
Advertisement
But Poore said she was notified recently that the Goddard library would be closed Jan. 1 , leaving its collection available only online .
She said she was fired Nov. 17 after telling patrons about the plans .
The company that employed her declined to comment .
Mather , the Nobel - winning astrophysicist , said the library ’s paper collection is indispensable .
“ If we ended up moving into an age where paper did not exist , we would need the equivalent to reach all the texts and handbooks , and until the great library is digitized , I think we need the paper , ” he said .
In the wake of complaints from scientists and engineers , the center ’s operations director , Tom Paprocki , said the library was being funded through March and that officials were exploring whether to preserve part of it .
The discovery of discarded scientific journals last year in a dumpster at NASA ’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley prompted a union grievance .

Plans to slash library space later were scaled back , said union president and scientist Paul K. Davis .
“ If not for our efforts , about three - quarters of the library materials would have been gone , ” he said .
At the Energy Department ’s headquarters , people researched radiation exposure of family members who worked with atomic energy or weaponry .
And the library staff helped DOE employees and contractors .
This summer the library closed , except the law section , and became an online service .
“ By taking our headquarters library and making it virtual , more people can access it than just being in Washington , ” said Energy Department spokeswoman Megan Barnett , adding that the department ’s labs often have their own libraries .

God Is In The Magic Mushrooms /
This just in : Psychedelic drugs could be very good for your mind , heart , soul .
Can you believe ?
H ide the children .
Pour some absinthe , fluff the pillows , take off your pants .
It is time .
Because now we know : Getting nicely and wholly high on illegal but completely natural hallucinogenic drugs might , just might open some sort of profound psychological doorway or serve as some sort of giddy terrifying rocket ride to a higher state of consciousness , happiness , a sense of inner peace and love and perspective and a big , fat lick from the divine .
It 's true .
There 's even a swell new study from Johns Hopkins University that officially suggests what shamans and gurus and botany Ph.D.s and alt - spirituality types have known since the dawn of time and Jimi Hendrix 's consciousness : that psilocybin , the all - natural chemical found in certain strains of wild mushrooms , induces a surprisingly large percentage of users to experience a profound -- and in some cases , largely permanent -- revolution in their spiritual attitudes and perspectives .
Not only that , but the stuff reportedly made a majority of testers feel so much more compassionate , open - hearted , connected to and awestruck by the world and the universe and God that it ranks right up there with the most profound and unfathomable experiences of their lives .
I know .
Stop the presses .
But let us sidestep the face - slapping obviousness .
Let us look past the fact that you are meant to react to this study 's findings like it 's some sort of revelation , like it does n't merely reinforce roughly 10 thousand years of evidence and modern research and opinioneering and responsible advocacy by everyone from Timothy Leary to Terence McKenna to Huston Smith to the Tibetan Book of the Dead with yet another study to add to the pile in the Science of the No Duh .
You know the type -- studies that merely reinforce ageless common sense , that simply reiterate something that 's been said and understood for eons .
There have been , for example , recent studies that prove that meditation actually reduces blood pressure ( no ! ) and that MDMA ( Ecstasy ) is amazing at releasing inhibition and tapping the deeper psyche ( shocking ! ) and that marijuana is roughly a thousand times less harmful than Marlboros and nine vodka tonics and smacking your family around in an alcoholic rage .
You know , duh .
Because one thing painfully redundant studies like this do provide is a nicely clinical framework , a structured context from which to view a long - standing phenomenon .
But here 's the fascinating part :
In the case of something like psilocybin , it 's not so much the astounding findings that can make you swoon , it 's also , well , the illuminating shortcomings of science itself .
Put another way , they are trying , once again , to measure enlightenment .
They are attempting to put a frame around consciousness , cosmic awe , God .
And of course , they can not do it .
Or rather , they can only go so far before they hit that point where the sidewalk ends and the world spins off its logical axis and the study 's participants cannot help but deliver the death blow every scientist dreads to hear : " You can not possibly understand . "
Witness , wo n't you , these revelations :
The psilocybin joyriders claimed the experience included such feelings as " a sense of pure awareness and a merging with ultimate reality , a transcendence of time and space , a feeling of sacredness or awe , and deeply felt positive mood like joy , peace and love . "
What 's more , for a majority of users , the experience was " impossible to put into words . "
It does n't stop there .
Two months later , 24 of the participants ( out of a total of 36 ) filled out a questionnaire .
Two - thirds called their reaction to psilocybin " one of the five top most meaningful experiences of their lives .
On another measure , one - third called it the most spiritually significant experience of their lives , with another 40 percent ranking it in the top five .
About 80 percent said that because of the psilocybin experience , they still had a sense of well - being or life satisfaction that was raised either ' moderately ' or ' very much . ' "
You gotta read that again .
And then again .
Because those statements are just a little astonishing , unlike anything you will read in some FDA report on Prozac from Eli Lily .
The most profound experience of their lives ?
One of the most spiritually significant ?
Can we get some of this stuff into Dick Cheney 's blood pudding ?
Into the Kool - Aid at the American Family Association ?
Into Israel and Lebanon ?
But this is the amazing thing :
Here , again , is hard science running smack into the hot cosmic goo of the mystical .
Here , again , is science peering over the edge of understanding and jumping back and saying , " Holy crap . "
It is yet another reminder that our beautiful sciences have almost zero tools with which to quantify something like " transcendence of time and space " or " a feeling of sacredness and awe . "
And watching them try is either tremendously enjoyable or just depressing as hell .
Or a little of both .
It all depends , of course , on how you see it .
Here then , are your choices .
Here are the three ways to look at the effects of magic mushrooms on the consciousness of humankind .
Which angle you choose depends a great deal on how nimble you allow your mind , your heart , your spirit to be .
Or maybe it 's just how much wine you 've had .
The first way is to simply presume that the lives of the study 's participants had obviously been , up to their psilocybin joys , tremendously mediocre .
So bland and so limp that something like hallucinogenic mushrooms could not help but be , in contrast , as profound as being licked by angels .
This is a clinical interpretation .
The gorgeous experience itself means nothing except to say that normal life is terribly drab and crazy drugs temporarily scramble your brain in occasionally positive and interesting ways , but never the twain shall meet , so oh well let 's go back to work .
But you can also take it one step further .
You may conclude that the study underscores the harsh fact that we as a species are so divorced from deeper meaning , so detached from the mystical and the divine and the universal in our everyday instant - gratification lives , that it takes something like a powerful hallucinogen to show us just how meek and limited and far from merging with God we still very much are .
This is the pessimistic view .
And it is , by every estimate , a very primitive and sour place to be .
Ah , but then there 's the third way .
This is to suggest that it 's exactly the other way around , that perhaps at least some of us are , as Leary and his cosmic cohorts have suggested for decades , just inches from the celestial doorway , already on the precipice of realizing that we are , in fact , the divine we so desperately seek .
Problem is , we can't see the edge through the tremendous fog of consumerism and conservatism and quasi-religious muck .
But even so , every now and then we manage to take a tiny , unconscious , clumsy step ever closer to the edge , stumbling toward ecstasy without really knowing or understanding that we 're doing so .
And ultimately , sly entheogens like psilocybin are merely nature 's way of clearing the fog for a moment , of letting us know just how close we are by smacking us upside the scientific head and tying our cosmic shoelaces together .
And does n't that sound like a fascinating way to spend the weekend ?

Was human skin really used in book binding ?
Asked by Jill Pascoe of Hobart , Tasmania , Australia
The use of human skin to bind books would disgust us today , but it was fairly widely practiced up until about 200 years ago , particularly with medical books .
In centuries gone by , doctors who wrote medical books would sometimes specify that they be bound in human skin .
Some doctors even participated in the preparation of human skin for use in book binding .
Dr John Hunter ( 1728 -1793 ) , the famous anatomist , father of British scientific surgery , and the person after whom the London Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England is named , reputedly commissioned a textbook on dermatology to be bound in human skin .
The skin used was often that of a flogged prisoner who was later executed , particularly a murderer .
In 1821 , John Horwood was hanged for murder in Bristol , England in 1821 .
Horwood 's skeleton became a prized exhibit at the Bristol Royal Infirmary .
A book containing details of his crime , trial , execution , and dissection was published and retained at the Infirmary .
The book was bound with Horwood 's skin .
The tanning of the skin was the work of Dr Richard Smith , the distinguished chief surgeon at the Infirmary for nearly 50 years .
The classic medical text , Tables of the Skeleton and Muscles of the Human Body by Bernhard Albinus ( translated from Latin into English in 1749 ) , not only was bound in human skin , but the original white skin was dyed black .
This was intended to reflect one of the subjects within : " On the location and cause of the colour of Ethiopians and of other peoples . "
Dr Victor Cornil ( 1837-1908 ) , the famous professor of pathological anatomy in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Paris and author of Syphillis ( 1882 ) the definitive work on the subject at the time , possessed a piece of tattooed human skin from the time of Louis XIII .
He had his copy of The Three Musketeers , set during the time of Louis XIII , bound in human skin .
Fortunately , our sensitivities are certainly quite different today .

Earlier this week I wrote about How to Help Negative People .
But what if you ’re the one who ’s feeling chronically negative ?
In this article I ’ll give you a process for helping yourself out of negative emotional states , not just temporarily but permanently .
For the sake of simplicity , I ’ll use the example of depression , but the process works for other chronic negative emotions like anger , worry , resentment , etc .
Understanding depression
Depressed people often seem to have good reasons for feeling down , and from the outside looking in , those reasons may appear perfectly valid .
If you ’re dealing with financial scarcity , health problems , or other unwanted challenges , then any reasonable person might easily look at your situation and agree , “ Yup , that ’s depressing . ”
I ’m not going to insult your intelligence by saying your problems are n’t that bad .
On the contrary I imagine that your situation may be downright awful , giving you every right to feel depressed .
I can empathize with what you ’re going through because I ’ve been there myself .
I know how horrible it is to feel bad most of the time , to have a life filled with negative results , and to feel powerless to change any of it .
I ’ll share a personal story about that later .
If you currently find yourself in such a situation , you have my compassion .
But more importantly , I have a solution to share with you .
I think you ’re smart enough to know that there ’s no shallow quick fix for what you ’re going through , but there is a workable solution .
Your depression is by no means permanent .
This solution will work if you take the time to understand it and apply it , using whatever energy you ’re still able to muster .
This is n’t an all - or - nothing solution , so even a partial implementation will yield partial results .
Best of all , you do n’t even need to take any direct physical action .
You can do the whole thing lying motionless on your bed .
The upside is that once you permanently overcome your depression , you ’ll be able to use your experience to help many other people .
So as difficult as it may be to endure right now , there may come a day when you look back on these times as a tremendous gift .
That has certainly been true for me .
This quote from Kahlil Gibran ’s
The Prophet contains some deep truths :
The deeper that sorrow carves into your being , the more joy you can contain .
Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter ’s oven ?
And is not the lute that soothes your spirit , the very wood that was hollowed with knives ?
When you are joyous , look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy .
When you are sorrowful look again in your heart , and you shall see in truth that you are weeping for that which has been your delight .
The real cause of depression
Let me be very direct .
It is n’t your situation that ’s causing you to feel depressed .
What depresses you is the attention you give to that situation .
Your life may indeed be filled with circumstances you do n’t want , but that is n’t the real source of your depression .
Negative circumstances can only induce depression when you focus your attention on them .
If you withhold your attention , your circumstances are powerless to affect you , regardless of how bad they seem .
Consider a simple example .
Suppose you ’re deep in debt with no end in sight , and you hate being in debt .
The debt is only depressing when you think about it .
If you think about something else that makes you happy , something good about your life , then at least temporarily , you wo n’t be depressed .
So it ’s not the existence of the debt that depresses you .
It ’s only your noticing the debt and not wanting it that depresses you .
Another example : Suppose you ’re feeling lonely .
You notice you do n’t have an intimate relationship , and that makes you feel lonely .
But is it the absence of the relationship that makes you feel lonely ?
Or do you only feel lonely when you pay attention to the fact that you do n’t have the relationship you desire ?
When you ’re engrossed in a really good movie or a compelling book , you completely forget that you ’re lonely , do n’t you ?
But if you stick your head up and notice you ’re all alone , or if you notice a happy couple and contrast it with your own situation , then your loneliness quickly returns .
I know this sounds overly simplistic and perhaps even useless , but just humor me for a moment .
I think you can agree that you only feel depressed while you pay attention to negative circumstances , such as your lack of money , lack of a relationship , or lack of good health .
But here ’s the key point :
Your circumstances are NOT the true source of your depression .
The true source of your depression is your attention … specifically your habit of putting your attention on what you do n’t want .
In the case of chronic depression , it ’s likely that what you do n’t want is what you ’re already experiencing right now .
So the simple act of noticing what you ’re already getting is what ’s really making you depressed .
Understanding the insidious trap of depression
This is why depression is such an insidious trap .
Once you sink to the level where you ’re not getting what you want , and you keep paying attention to the fact that you ’re not getting what you want , your depression becomes self - reinforcing .
You ’re seriously stuck .
You see… the mistake you ’re making that ’s causing you to remain stuck in depression is so devious that you ’ll probably think you ’re just being intelligent , when you ’re actually being quite dumb .
You probably think it ’s just common sense that you should observe your circumstances , notice what you ’re getting , and react within reason .
And you ’d be wrong .
If you ’re depressed , that is perhaps the worst strategy you could possibly use .
I know it seems completely counterintuitive , but that ’s why depression is such a bear for millions of people .
Common sense thinking is part of the trap .
This is why some of the most intelligent people can get stuck in long - term depression and even commit suicide .
Their best attempts to use their intellect to reason their way out of their depression only ensnares them more deeply .
The more you struggle to reason your way out , the worse your depression gets .
After endless frustration trying to reason their way out of depression , many people settle for temporary relief through medication , alcohol , drugs , TV , video games , or other habits that lower their awareness .
Of course none of these things actually resolve the underlying negative circumstances .
They usually make it worse .
Running from your problems wo n’t help you get out of debt , build loving relationships , or improve your health .
The solution to depression
The solution to depression is actually quite simple , but it ’s totally counterintuitive for most people ( unless you ’re immersed in living in congruence with the Law of Attraction , that is ) .
The solution is to withdraw your attention from what depresses you and place it on what makes you feel really , really good .
If you ’re chronically depressed , however , it ’s possible that virtually nothing in your life makes you feel good .
Your whole situation may be unpleasant from top to bottom .
So in that case you need to withdraw your attention from your external environment and plug into your imagination .
Within your mind ’s eye , you must construct completely imaginary circumstances that make you feel good when you think about them .
Then spend more of your time focusing your attention on your imaginary creations and less of your time observing external reality .
This may sound like escapism , but you ’re not trying to escape .
Your goal is to construct new , realistic circumstances within your imagination that are attractive to you .
Picture yourself experiencing financial abundance , loving relationships , good health , a fulfilling career , and more .
At first this may be very difficult , but you ’ll improve with practice .
Obviously you ’ll still need to attend to your basic needs and deal with certain external problems as best you can , but only devote the bare minimum attention to them .
Give your problems no more attention than is absolutely necessary to keep your head above water .
Then spend the rest of your time withdrawing into your imagination .
Within your imagination you are free to do anything you want .
There are no limitations whatsoever .
Think whatever thoughts make you happy .
Imagine them as real , and enjoy them .
Build your imaginary dream home .
Travel around the world .
Create your ideal friends .
Imagine the perfect relationship for you .
Give yourself superpowers and save the world .
Be patient with yourself .
If you catch yourself worrying about your problems , keep going back to your positive mental creations and expand them .
I find it best to focus on constructing locations first .
The more I think about them , the more detail I add .
I keep modifying them to make improvements .
In my imagination I ’ve built a huge 100 - acre estate that I can mentally walk through .
I can swim in the imaginary pool , play tennis , work out in the gym , sit in my private office , run along the perimeter wall , relax in the meditation lounge , stroll through the beautiful gardens , or dip my feet in the stream .
I can even have interesting conversations with the persistent characters who live there .
The place has become so stable in my imagination that I remember it more vividly than most real locations I ’ve been to .
And it ’s accessible to me whenever I want .
I often load it up when I ’m meditating and spend time building it out a bit more .
How does this resolve depression ?
As you remove your attention from negative external circumstances and refocus it on positive imaginary thoughts , you ’ll spend a lot more time feeling good than bad , so your depression will soon lift .
The more you shift your thoughts , the faster your depression will lift .
This is a rather obvious consequence of spending more time thinking about what makes you feel good and less time thinking about what depresses you .
Now it ’s nice to feel good again , but what about your negative circumstances ?
Even though you ’re feeling better , you may still be trapped under a pile of problems .
Do n’t worry .
This approach will help you improve your circumstances too .
Your circumstances will improve in two ways .
First , because you ’ll be feeling better , you ’ll be more motivated to take action to help yourself directly .
Depression is disempowering , but positive emotions are empowering .
So you ’re far more likely to take appropriate action to get yourself out of debt when you ’re feeling good than when you ’re depressed .
Depressed people dwell on their problems , but as your depression lifts , you ’ll begin to think about solutions .
Secondly , you will find that when you ’re feeling good , through the Law of Attraction you will begin manifesting more positive results in your life almost effortlessly .
I ca n’t claim to understand the mechanism by which this works , but I ’ve seen it work too many times to doubt it .
When you think about what you desire and feel good about it , you attract it to you in ways that cannot be explained as a result of your direct action .
It ’s as if you become luckier .
Through the combination of your own direct action as well as the activation of the Law of Attraction , your depressing circumstances will completely turn around .
For this to work you must think about what you want AND feel good about it .
A real - life example
Here ’s a true story from my own life that explains how this entire process works .
At the age of 19 , I was arrested for felony grand theft .
After spending three days in jail , I returned home to learn I ’d been expelled from school too .
My court date was months away , and it seemed the most probable outcome was that I ’d be spending the next year or two of my life behind bars , since this was my third offense in less than 18 months .
If I recall correctly , I was still on probation from my previous offense .
This was not a happy time in my life .
I had a hard time dealing with the situational stress .
My expectation that I was about to spend a good part of my life in jail shut me down emotionally .
I slipped into a period of darkness and depression .
I slept each day until 2 pm , ate mostly fast food , and devoted my waking hours to escaping through video games , alcohol , and poker .
But as my court date approached , I began to shift my focus .
I stopped resisting what was about to happen and finally surrendered to it .
I began going for long walks to contemplate my situation .
I said to myself , “ Well , I ’m going to jail , and that ’s really going to suck . ”
But since it was too unpleasant to imagine what jail would be like ( three days was more than enough for me never to want to go back ) , I began to imagine beyond that point , thinking about what I ’d do after I got out .
I saw this event as a total life reboot .
After jail I ’d essentially be starting my adult life over from scratch .
I imagined myself going back to school to earn my computer science degree .
I saw myself eventually working as a computer programmer , which is what I wanted to do for a living ever since I learned BASIC programming at age 10 .
What I was imagining seemed so positive that I began thinking about it more and more , spending less time worrying about what was going to happen with my impending jail time .
In my mind I nearly blotted out the impending jail experience and mentally fast forwarded to where I wanted to be .
Since I was n’t in school and did n’t have a job , I spent a good deal of time thinking about what it would be like to return to school and become a programmer .
I figured that even while I was in jail , at least I ’ve have something positive to look forward to .
When I eventually went to court , what happened was almost miraculous .
By mistake the court treated my case as if it were a first offense when it was actually my third .
They had no record of my priors .
Even my own lawyer thought the case was a first offense .
When I realized what was happening and wondered if I should say something , I swear I heard a voice in the back of my head saying , “ Keep your damned mouth shut ! ”
I had to check the courtroom docket to verify they had the right case , but everything else was accurate .
I knew from experience that a first offense was likely to get just a slap on the wrist , so it did n’t surprise me that I was offered a deal whereby the charges would be reduced to misdemeanor petty theft instead of felony grand theft , and my sentence would be 60 hours of community service and no jail time .
I tried to hold back my enthusiasm as I pled “ no contest , ” and the case was closed .
I was just a little too happy during the couple weeks I spent picking up trash .
It was n’t until I learned about the Law of Attraction that I really understood these events .
Even though I was in a bad situation , by focusing my thoughts on what I wanted and finding a way to feel good , my whole situation transformed in a way that I did n’t think was objectively possible .
After these events I took a year off to get a job , save up some honest money , reconnect with friends , cure my kleptomania , and rebuild my life .
Then I went back to college , starting over as a freshman and earning B.S. degrees in both computer science and mathematics in only three semesters .
I wrote about that experience in the articles Do It Now and 10 Tips for College Students .
After that I did indeed achieve my dream of working as a computer programmer and even started my own game development company .
My life was completely transformed for the better , and I left my negative thinking in the past .
This seemingly dark experience turned out to be one of the most valuable gifts I ’ve ever received .
It made me much less fearful and more willing to take ( legal ) risks .
As long as I would n’t end up in jail if I failed , the risk seemed minor .
I began to jump on opportunities that previously intimidated me .
I still enjoy these benefits today .
If I had n’t been through this ordeal 15 years ago , I ’m sure I ’d be a much more timid person today , ruled by imaginary fears instead of inspired by imaginary wonders .
I shudder to think what might have become of me if I did n’t accidentally stumble upon the Law of Attraction back in 1991 .
For all I know , I could be sitting in prison right now .
Perhaps in some alternate universe , I am .
From chronic depression to lifelong joy
Do you realize what an incredible gift your freedom is ?
Regardless of your physical freedom , you always have your mental freedom .
You ’re free to hold any thought you can imagine — so free that you can turn your life into a depressing hell if you fail to understand your power … or into a joy - filled heaven if you master it .
Are you still hurting yourself by thinking about what you do n’t want ?
Even the mere act of observing and noticing the presence of what you do n’t want in your life can trap you in a negative state .
Turn your attention away from such thoughts , and concentrate on what you do want , even if your only viable option is to withdraw into your imagination .
Let your imagination become your private refuge of positive thought .
Use your creative imagination to get yourself to a state of feeling good , regardless of your external circumstances .
This will activate the Law of Attraction , and it wo n’t be long before your external reality improves to match the pattern of your thoughts .
Eventually your circumstances will become so good that simply noticing what you ’re getting will make you feel terrific .
Instead of the downward spiral of depression , you ’ll shift your life onto the upward spiral of joy .
If you want to change your outer reality , you must first change your inner reality .
Given the massive media coverage of the Iraq War , and the pop-culture fashion of being opposed to it , one could be led to think that this is one of the most major wars ever fought .
Therein lies the proof that we are actually living in the most peaceful time ever in human history .
Just a few decades ago , wars and genocides killing upwards of a million people were commonplace , with more than one often underway at once .
Remember these ?
Second Congo War ( 1998 - 2002 ) : 3.6 million deaths
Iran -Iraq War ( 1980 - 88 ) : 1.5 million deaths
Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan ( 1979 - 89 ) : 1 million deaths
Khmer Rouge ( 1975 - 79 ) : 1.7 million deaths from genocide
Bangladesh Liberation War ( 1971 ) : 1.5 million deaths from genocide
Vietnam War ( 1957 - 75 ) : 2.4 million deaths
Korean War ( 1950 - 53 ) : 3 million deaths
This list is my no means complete , as wars killing fewer than one million people are not even listed .
At least 30 other wars killed over 20,000 people each , between 1945 and 1989 .
If we go further back to the period from 1900 - 1945 , we can see that multiple wars were being simultaneously fought across the world .
Going further back still , the 19th century had virtually no period without at least two major wars being fought .
We can thus conclude that by historical standards , the current Iraq
War is tiny , and can barely be found on the list of historical death tolls .
That it gets so much attention merely indicates how little warfare is going on in the world .
Why have so many countries quitely adapted to peaceful coexistence ?
Why is a war between Britain and France , or Russia and Germany , or the US and Japan , nearly impossible today ?
We can start with the observation that never have two democratic countries , with per-capita GDPs greater than $ 10,000 / year , gone to war with each other .
The decline in warfare in Europe and Asia corelates closely with multiple countries meeting these two conditions over the last few decades , and this can continue as more countries graduate to this standard of freedom and wealth .
The chain of logic is as follows :
1 ) Nations with elected governments and free - market systems tend to be the overwhelming majority of countries that achieve per-capita incomes greater than $ 10,000 / year .
Only a few oil - rich monarchies are the exception to this rule .
2 ) A nation with high per-capita income tends to conduct extensive trade with other nations of high prosperity , resulting in the ever - deepening integration of these economies with each other .
A war would disrupt the economies of both participants as well as those of neutral trading partners .
Since the citizens of these nations would suffer financially from such a war , it is not considered by elected officials .
3 ) As more of the world 's people gain a vested interest in the stability and health of the interlocking global economic system , fewer and fewer countries will consider international warfare as anything other than a lose - lose proposition .
4 ) More nations can experience their citizenry moving up Maslow 's Hierarchy of Needs , allowing knowledge - based industries thrive , and thus making international trade continuously easier and more extensive .
5 ) Since economic growth is continuously accelerating , many countries crossed the $ 10,000 / yr barrier in just the last 20 years , and so the reduction in warfare after 1991 years has been drastic , even if there was little apparent reduction over the 1900 - 1991 period .
This explains the dramatic decline in war deaths across Europe , East Asia , and even Latin America over the last few decades .
Thomas Friedman has a similar theory , called the Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention , wherein no two countries linked by a major supply chain / trade network ( such as that of Dell Computer ) , have ever gone to war with each other , as the cost of war is prohibitive to both parties .
But what can we expect in the future ?
Stay tuned for Part II tomorrow .

From the sky , it looks just like a giant oak tree lying on its side .
Gallery : Shell Wildlife Photographer of the Year
But this fascinating image is partly down to nature and partly made by man .
The remarkable shape of trunk , branches and foliage was created by a combination of storm damage and scars left on the landscape by forestry machinery used to retrieve logs .
Swedish photographer Jocke Bergland took the shot while flying over Sweden documenting damage in the wake of Hurricane Gudrun in January last year .
The image , entitled Hurricane Tree , won him The World In Our Hands prize at the Shell Wildlife Photographer Of The Year competition .
The overall winner was Beast Of The Sediment .
The photograph of a feeding walrus was taken by Gîran Ehlmé of Sweden .
It captures the creature whipping up sediment as it gorges on bivalve shells .
" It 's got everything , our attention goes straight to the eye , " said judge Mark Carwardine .
" A simple graphic image showing interesting behaviour . "
Mr Ehlm´ , an underwater cameraman with 24 years of diving experience , described the moment he took the picture .
" The walrus looked round and we made eye contact , " he said .
The competition , run by the Natural History Museum in London and BBC Wildlife Magazine , received more than 18,000 entries from 55 countries .
The winning images will go on show at the museum from Saturday .

Shin kicking is just one of many rural sports at the Olimpicks
While it may be widely acknowledged by schoolboys the world over as a useful form of playground retribution , shin kicking has largely gone unnoticed as an organised sporting activity .
But the sport has been practised on Dover 's Hill , near Chipping Campden , since the early 17th Century .
Although not as aggressive as earlier versions , where players were said to have hardened their shins using hammers in over - zealous preparation for the main event , the competition remains the highlight of the Cotswold " Olimpick " games .
Players , wearing the traditional white smocks of shepherds , grasp each other by the shoulders and attempt to land well - timed blows to their opponent 's shins .
Only then - in mid-kick - can a player attempt to bring his opposite number to the ground .
People stuff their trousers with straw and must wear soft shoes
Robert Wilson
A stickler , the ancient name for a judge or umpire , is on hand to make sure a shin is hit before a fall can be scored .
Competitors must kick their way through early qualifying rounds , and swing their legs in a three - stage final to be crowned the shin kicking champion .
" It 's part of the original games , " said organiser Robert Wilson , referring to the rural competition established by Robert Dover in 1612 .
" It was vicious in those days , there was a lot of inter-village rivalry and lads used to harden their shins with hammers and were allowed to wear iron - capped boots .
" We wo n't permit that .
People stuff their trousers with straw and must wear soft shoes .
" We never have broken bones but there are some bruises . "
In 2004 , more than 2,500 people turned up to watch the Olimpicks , which feature other rural challenges such as tug - of - war , sledgehammer throwing and Spurning the Barre , a Cotswold version of tossing the caber .
There was talk of a band of mystery challengers from outside the area
It 's a far cry from the 30,000 who are said to have gathered on the hill in the 1830s .
Then , growing popularity of the games , and associated rowdiness and thuggery - no doubt practised wholeheartedly in the shin kicking ring - eventually led to the games being outlawed in the 1850s .
Resurrected in the 1950s , the games , and the shin kicking main attraction , have attracted growing support .
Last year , 20 people turned up to compete for the crown .
It was won by local publican Joe McDonagh , 41 .
" It 's a bit crazy , " he said , as he prepared to defend his title with a cheese sandwich and can of cider .
" You need a few beers inside you to do it - you need a bit of anaesthetic . "
' Voguish '
He was facing a tough time .
There were rumours of a strong challenge from a band of mystery kickers from outside the area .
Shin kicking , Mr Wilson confided , has become " voguish " , like other oddball rural sports , such as cheese rolling .
He put this down to people 's willingness to test the limits of physical endurance in unusual ways .
So , would he class the kicking of shins an extreme sports ?
" Not the way we run it , " Mr Wilson said .
" It is interesting but certainly not extreme .
If we were to allow them to wear iron - capped shoes , it would be - but we wo n't . "

My life as an investment banker
Rohan Siddhu | December 19 , 2005
I was so sure I wanted to be a pilot .
Nothing was going to change my mind .
My family disapproved .
Totally .
My grandfather , a fabulously rich octogenarian , was a chartered accountant .
He ran his own firm along with my dad , and wanted the next generation to continue in his footsteps .
He frowned incessantly whenever I mentioned my childhood dream .
Then my older brother , whom I idolised ( then , not now ) , became a CA .
That did it .
I followed suit .
Partly , because I wanted to follow my brother 's footsteps .
Partly , because I was afraid I would be cut off from the family inheritance .
I also figured I would be more ambitious if I worked hard enough at buying my own private aircraft instead of flying someone else's .
A few months into the job , I was miserable .
I realised being a CA was the last thing I wanted to do .
That 's when I saw Wall Street .
A wild film on an ambitious young trader in the eighties in New York .
Boy , I loved that movie .
' Greed is good ' is what Michael Douglas inculcated in me .
I saw the swank apartment Charlie Sheen lived in with his perfect woman and I thought , that 's the life I want .
Forget the family inheritance , I decided .
I do n't need it .
I got in touch with a family friend and asked him to help me get a job as an investment banker .
After a dozen interviews , where I had close encounters with the inflated egos of other investment bankers , I managed to get myself a job .
I think my success at landing the job lay solely in my ability to look most interested as the guys interviewing me spoke blatantly about their lives and the deals they clinched .
My new life had begun .
Investment banking :
The hot new MBA destination
The good , the bad and the ugly I soon discovered that I did not land myself a job but a 24/7 personality referred to as the investment banker .
I was like a doctor on call .
My day would typically start by waking up early morning to chat with a client in Hong Kong .
And I ended the day staying up really late to chat with the one from US .
In between , my life was interspersed with mundane tasks of presentations and photocopying , with miniscule doses of financial engineering and power games .
Let me explain .
Investment bankers are experts at calculating what a business is worth .
To arrive at this figure , they use something known as the Discounted Cash Flow method .
For the uninitiated , this is a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of an investment opportunity .
It is such a sensitive tool that , by just changing a variable or assumption , you would be able to get a completely different figure .
You could value a company at Rs 100 crore or Rs 1,000 crore .
It actually was up to me !
This made me feel supremely important , despite the fact that I had to pore over coma-inducing spread sheets .
And , of course , when you discuss mergers and acquisitions , you only meet with the big brass .
Getting a handshake from these guys and having them listen to my every word and detailed analysis would set my adrenaline soaring .
Our job also entailed raising capital ( money ) for companies .
This was not much fun .
I had to dress up a company and then present it to private equity investors or venture capitalists and even the public , if we were floating Initial Public Offerings .
Basically , we had to sell a company , whether we truly believed in it or not .
Often , I found myself pushing deals with clients that I knew would not work .
I became a salesman to the core .
Investment bankers also excel in paperwork .
Whether it was a prospectus for an IPO or whatever deal , we had to ensure that the figures were accurate and the language legally perfect .
We had to scrutinise every word and then make hundreds of photocopies ( alright , I am exaggerating , but only slightly ) .
And , if it was merger or acquisition that we were working on , the paperwork assumed such gigantic proportions that a room had to be hired -- called the data room -- whose sole purpose was to store the photocopies .
There were periods when I managed to catch just four hours of sleep daily .
Whoever said that investment banking is not about money but about the game of acquiring it ( a popular saying among investment bankers ) was lying through his teeth .
It 's all about the money , honey What I loved about the job was the money .
The salaries and bonuses were obscenely luring .
( A fresh MBA , with absolutely no job experience , could earn between Rs 3,00,000 - Rs 6,00,000 per annum ( the latter if you are from a top - notch business school like the IIMs ) . )
The salaries gave purpose to my life and the bonuses ( which could go up to three to five times the annual salary ) made up for the crap I had to put up with .
And , yes , believe me , there was lots of crap .
Let me tell you something about the bonuses .
Like I mentioned earlier , it can be breathtakingly inflated figure .
To get it , you have to do two things .
The first : Work like a dog to contribute to the profits .
If you are passionate about teamwork , investment banking is certainly not the place for you .
It is more of a dog - eat - dog culture .
You are on your own .
Since you are paid according to the deals you cut , it works out to be a very individualistic environment with everyone jockeying for a large slice of the bonus cake .
The second : Suck up to your boss .
That 's right .
Be a sycophant , even if he is insufferable .
Smile at him .
Say the right things .
Nod when he makes a good point .
Do n't disagree too much when he does not .
Grovel at his feet .
Your bonus is not going to be calculated according to some predetermined formula .
It is solely dependent on your boss ' whims and fancies .
I 'm sorry , but ...
After my first year , I looked forward to the bonus with glee .
I was the ' hot new kid ' on the block , responsible for getting in 80 % of all new business in the past year .
One morning , my boss calls me and tells me he is quitting .
A new guy would be taking his place .
Come bonus time , the ' new guy ' calls me in for a chat .
" I believe you have done really well in the past year , " he starts .
I liked that beginning .
" Unfortunately , since I have just joined , it would not be fair for me to judge your performance or those of your colleagues . "
Warning bells began clanging in my head .
" So I am afraid , all bonuses are going to be equal this year . "
I headed to the nearest pub to drown my sorrows .
The following year , I was totally demotivated ( can you blame me ? ) .
Subsequently , I did not get in that much of business .
Come bonus time , he pompously tells me that he cannot give me a huge bonus since I did not work as well as was reported earlier .
Hit the pub again .
The travelling sucks .
Big time !
A friend once told me the easiest way to spot an investment banker in the lobby of a five - star hotel is to look for those who look sleepless and harried .
If you ever meet an investment banker who says that he / she loves the travelling , feel free to punch him / her in the face .
Hard !
The first time you travel , it is nice .
The second time too .
Maybe even the third .
The fourth time it is tolerable .
After that , it 's a drag .
You not only have to constantly travel all around the country , you even have to travel abroad .
If that sounds cool , consider yourself walking around like a zombie at some airport , looking at the ticket to figure out where you are even as your biological clock frantically tries to adjust to crossing three time zones in two days .
Has anyone seen my social life ?
The travelling and the ridiculous working hours ensured that my social life was a memory of the past .
It dropped in inverse proportion to my salary .
Moreover , there was no one interesting in office to hang around with .
In fact , the first thing that hit me when I walked into the office on my very first day was the negligible amount of women .
Where were the women ?
Did they not want to be investment bankers ?
The office was full of men : all types , the young , the balding , the paunchy relics .
So , when my trader friend invited me to his sister 's birthday bash , I jumped at it .
Finally , I cornered a nice girl .
" Hi , My name 's Rohan .
I 'm an investment banker . "
" How nice , " was her retort .
That 's it ?
How nice ?
Obviously , she had no idea who ( or what ) an investment banker is .
Later , I was later told this was one of the worst pick - up lines in the world .
After a fairly disastrous attempt at polite conversation , I was kind of relieved my friend sauntered over to join us .
" I'm a stock trader , " was all he had to say to get the glint in her eyes .
" Wow !
That 's so cool !
Your job must be so exciting ! "
Hell !
Why did I take this job ?
Does that mean I quit ?
Right now , I am on a sabbatical in Spain .
Will I go back ?
I think so ( have not figured out what else to do ) .
After all , the paycheck gives me purpose and the bonus makes up for the crap .
And , hey , on my own I can't afford to fly business class , live in executive suites in five - star hotels , holiday abroad every year and eat in the swankiest and most expensive restaurants in town .
That , along with the money , is the prime motivator as to why I am an investment banker .

Despite my dislike of gladiatorial contests , I seem somehow to have acquired a reputation for pugnacity toward religion .
Colleagues who agree that there is no God , who agree that we do not need religion to be moral , and agree that we can explain the roots of religion and of morality in non-religious terms , nevertheless come back at me in gentle puzzlement .
Why are you so hostile ?
What is actually wrong with religion ?
Does it really do so much harm that we should actively fight against it ?
Why not live and let live , as one does with Taurus and Scorpio , crystal energy and ley lines ?
Is n't it all just harmless nonsense ?
I might retort that such hostility as I or other atheists occasionally voice toward religion is limited to words .
I am not going to bomb anybody , behead them , stone them , burn them at the stake , crucify them , or fly planes into their skyscrapers , just because of a theological disagreement .
But my interlocutor usually does n’t leave it at that .
He may go on to say something like this : " Does n’t your hostility mark you out as a fundamentalist atheist , just as fundamentalist in your own way as the wingnuts of the Bible Belt in theirs ? "
I need to dispose of this accusation of fundamentalism , for it is distressingly common .
Holy Books vs. Evidence
Fundamentalists know they are right because they have read the truth in a holy book and they know , in advance , that nothing will budge them from their belief .
The truth of the holy book is an axiom , not the end product of a process of reasoning .
The book is true , and if the evidence seems to contradict it , it is the evidence that must be thrown out , not the book .
By contrast , what I , as a scientist , believe ( for example , evolution ) I believe not because of reading a holy book but because I have studied the evidence .
It really is a very different matter .
Books about evolution are believed not because they are holy .
They are believed because they present overwhelming quantities of mutually buttressed evidence .
In principle , any reader can go and check that evidence .
When a science book is wrong , somebody eventually discovers the mistake and it is corrected in subsequent books .
That conspicuously does n’t happen with holy books .
Philosophers , especially amateurs with a little philosophical learning , and even more especially those infected with " cultural relativism , " may raise a tiresome red herring at this point a scientist ’s belief in evidence is itself a matter of fundamentalist faith .
I have dealt with this elsewhere , and will only briefly repeat myself here .
All of us believe in evidence in our own lives , whatever we may profess with our amateur philosophical hats on .
*******
I am no more fundamentalist when I say evolution is true than when I say it is true that New Zealand is in the southern hemisphere .
We believe in evolution because the evidence supports it , and we would abandon it overnight if new evidence arose to disprove it .
No real fundamentalist would ever say anything like that .
It is all too easy to confuse fundamentalism with passion .
I may well appear passionate when I defend evolution against a fundamentalist creationist , but this is not because of a rival fundamentalism of my own .
It is because the evidence for evolution is overwhelmingly strong and I am passionately distressed that my opponent ca n’t see it -- or , more usually , refuses to look at it because it contradicts his holy book .
My passion is increased when I think about how much the poor fundamentalists , and those whom they influence , are missing .
The truths of evolution , along with many other scientific truths , are so engrossingly fascinating and beautiful ; how truly tragic to die having missed out on all that !
Of course that makes me passionate .
How could it not ?
But my belief in evolution is not fundamentalism , and it is not faith , because I know what it would take to change my mind , and I would gladly do so if the necessary evidence were forthcoming .
It does happen .
I have previously told the story of a respected elder statesman of the Zoology Department at Oxford when I was an undergraduate .
For years he had passionately believed , and taught , that the Golgi Apparatus ( a microscopic feature of the interior of cells ) was not real : an artifact , an illusion .
Every Monday afternoon it was the custom for the whole department to listen to a research talk by a visiting lecturer .
One Monday , the visitor was an American cell biologist who presented completely convincing evidence that the Golgi Apparatus was real .
At the end of the lecture , the old man strode to the front of the hall , shook the American by the hand and said -- with passion --" My dear fellow , I wish to thank you .
I have been wrong these fifteen years . "
We clapped our hands red .
No fundamentalist would ever say that .
In practice , not all scientists would .
But all scientists pay lip service to it as an ideal - - unlike , say , politicians who would probably condemn it as flip - flopping .
The memory of the incident I have described still brings a lump to my throat .
Fundamentalist Religion Saps the Intellect
As a scientist , I am hostile to fundamentalist religion because it actively debauches the scientific enterprise .
It teaches us not to change our minds , and not to want to know exciting things that are available to be known .
It subverts science and saps the intellect .
The saddest example I know is that of the American geologist Kurt Wise , who now directs the Center for Origins Research at Bryan College , Dayton , Tennessee .
It is no accident that Bryan College is named after William Jennings Bryan , prosecutor of the science teacher John Scopes in the Dayton " Monkey Trial " of 1923 .
Wise could have fulfilled his boyhood ambition to become a professor of geology at a real university , a university whose motto might have been " Think critically " rather than the oxymoronic one displayed on the Bryan website : " Think critically and biblically . "
Indeed , he obtained a real degree in geology at the University of Chicago , followed by two higher degrees in geology and paleontology at Harvard ( no less ) where he studied under Stephen Jay Gould ( no less ) .
He was a highly qualified and genuinely promising young scientist , well on his way to achieving his dream of teaching science and doing research at a proper university .
Then tragedy struck .
It came , not from outside but from within his own mind , a mind fatally subverted and weakened by a fundamentalist religious upbringing that required him to believe that the Earth - - the subject of his Chicago and Harvard geological education - - was less than ten thousand years old .
He was too intelligent not to recognize the head - on collision between his religion and his science , and the conflict in his mind made him increasingly uneasy .
One day , he could hear the strain no more , and he clinched the matter with a pair of scissors .
He took a bible and went right through it , literally cutting out every verse that would have to go if the scientific world - view were true .
At the end of this ruthlessly honest labor - intensive exercise , there was so little left of his bible that
try as I might , and even with the benefit of intact margins throughout the pages of Scripture , I found it impossible pick up the Bible without it being rent in two .
I had to make a decision between evolution and Scripture .
Either the Scripture was true and evolution was wrong or evolution was true and I must toss out the Bible . . .
It was there that night that I accepted the Word of God and rejected all that would ever counter it , including evolution .
With that , in great sorrow , I tossed into the fire all my dreams and hopes in science .
I find that terribly sad ; but whereas the Golgi Apparatus moved me to tears of admiration and exultation , the Kurt Wise story is just plain pathetic -- pathetic and contemptible .
The wound , to his career and his life ’s happiness , was self - inflicted , so unnecessary , so easy to escape .
All he had to do was toss out the bible .
Or interpret it symbolically , or allegorically , as the theologians do .
Instead , he did the fundamentalist thing and tossed out evidence and reason , along with all his dreams and hopes .
Perhaps uniquely among fundamentalists , Kurt Wise is honest -- devastatingly , painfully , shockingly honest .
Give him the Templeton Prize ; he might be the first really sincere recipient .
Wise brings to the surface what is secretly going on underneath , in the minds of fundamentalists generally , when they encounter scientific evidence that contradicts their beliefs .
The Doublethink of Religious Faith
Poor Kurt
Wise reminds me more of Winston Smith in ‘ 1984 ’-- struggling desperately to believe that two plus two equals five if Big Brother says it does .
Winston , however , was being tortured .
Wise ’s doublethink comes not from the imperative of physical torture but from the imperative -- apparently just as undeniable to some people -- of religious faith : arguably a form of mental torture .
I am hostile to religion because of what it did to Kurt Wise .
And if it did that to a Harvard - educated geologist , just think what it can do to others less gifted and less well armed .
Fundamentalist religion is hell - bent on ruining the scientific education of countless thousands of innocent , well - meaning , eager young minds .
Non-fundamentalist , " sensible " religion may not be doing that .
But it is making the world safe for fundamentalism by teaching children , from their earliest years , that unquestioning faith is a virtue .
UPDATE
Sen .
Harry Reid participated in a conference call with a dozen or so bloggers this afternoon .
For the first question , I asked him about the Specter bill -- specifically , what the Democrats ' strategy was for preventing its enactment ( I wanted to wait until the second question but I could n't contain myself ) .
Sen .
Reid stated flatly and unequivocally -- and I 'm paraphrasing -- that the Specter bill was not going anywhere , that it would not be enacted .
I then asked him how he could be so certain about that -- specifically , I asked where the 51 votes against the Specter bill would come from in light of the support it enjoys from both the White House and at least some of the ostensibly " independent " Republicans , exacerbated by the fact that all 10 Republicans on the Judiciary Committee voted in favor of it yesterday ( at least they voted in favor of sending it to the Senate floor ) .
In response , Sen .
Reid explained that our system does not allow every bill to be enacted simply because a majority supports it , that Senate rules allow minority rights to be protected , clearly alluding to a filibuster .
Indeed , as part of that vow , Sen .
Reid specifically referenced the fact that in the Senate , one does not need 50 % , but only 40 % , to block the enactment of a bill .
He explained that rule existed to protect minority rights .
When I asked him expressly whether the Democrats are committed to filibustering the Specter bill if doing so is necessary to defeat it , he said he thought that would not be necessary , but repeated that they would make sure the Specter bill did not become law .
He was unequivocal about that a second time .
There were numerous other questions on other topics , and Susie Madrak ended the call by underscoring the premise underlying most ( if not all ) of the questions posed to Sen .
Reid , including mine -- namely , that the Democrats ' greatest failing has been their failure to take real stands against the Bush administration and to convey to Americans that they are genuinely committed to fighting for their interests .
She was appropriately insistent with that point , not allowing Sen .
Reid to dismiss it away by claiming that he is sometimes accused of being too confrontational ( it 's probably true that he is , just like journalists are " sometimes " accused of being too hostile to the Bush administration , but they 're both besides the point ) .
Sen .
Reid is a former prosecutor who is one of those middle - of - the - road ( politically ) , basically conservative ( in the personality sense ) Americans who has become truly alienated by the Bush administration .
I have been on several calls with him and never once got the sense ( as I have with many -- actually , most -- other Beltway Democrats ) that he just spouts combative criticism of the administration because he thinks that 's what angry , rambunctious bloggers want to hear .
He really means it .
He is disillusioned and angry about what has happened to our Government and to his country .
I believe that is very genuine .
But that does n't necessarily translate into Democratic Party resoluteness , although it has the potential to do so .
And now , it should and must .
Democrats can't just hope to run out the clock between now and November by sitting around passively hoping that Americans dislike Republicans enough to defeat them , or that Republicans do n't manage to demonize Democrats sufficiently to stave off defeat .
Democrats need to be viewed as presenting a clear alternative -- and the base of the party has to be energized -- both of which will come by obstructing the Bush administration 's extremism and taking a stand .
If Sen .
Reid 's commitment that they will do what they have to do to prevent enactment of the Specter bill is a serious one -- and I believe it is -- that would be as potent an act as any .* * * * * * * As a reminder , I 'll be on The Majority Report with Sam Seder tonight at 7:45 p.m. EDT ( in about an hour ) to discuss these matters .
You can listen to the live audio feed at the link .
I should also add that before posting this , I asked two other bloggers who were on the call to review this post to ensure that they agreed that it accurately described what Sen .
Reid said .
They both did .
One is so unaccustomed to hearing such a resolute commitment on an issue this important that it seemed prudent to be extra certain of its accuracy . : McJoan of Daily Kos , who was on the call , has a post up about Reid 's comments .
She argues that " given the already expressed bipartisan opposition to the Specter legislation in the Senate , it seems that a filibuster will be unnecessary .
" That might be the case , and she makes a good argument ( referring to the letter sent by 6 Senators , including 3 Republicans ( Craig , Murkowski and Sununu ) , demanding that no vote be held on FISA until there are hearings on warrantless eavesdropping ) .
But no GOP Senator has vowed to vote against the Specter bill if a vote is held ( which , barring a filibuster , appears highly likely ) .
But McJoan 's broader argument is persuasive that there is clearly more Congressional resistance to the President 's dictates .
Do you like fridge magnets ?
A new technology being developed by British scientists could put an even bigger one inside your refrigerator .
Once Karl Sandeman , a physicist at Cambridge University , has helped resolve the practical issues , the cooling power of the 21st century fridge will come from a 19th century discovery - and it promises to cut energy consumption by 40 % and save the ozone layer .
The key is a material that cools when it is put in a magnetic field .
The idea - which is ambitious , but feasible - is to replace the present system used by refrigerators the world over .
Your kitchen fridge has a compressor , which turns a gas into a liquid , releasing heat ( which you 'll feel at the back of the fridge ) .
The liquid is then pumped round the inside walls of the fridge , where it draws heat from the contents ; that turns it into a gas , which is pumped on to the compressor .
But what if you could replace the fluid with a magnet ?
" The amazing thing about magnetism is that it 's actually a quantum mechanical phenomenon , " says Sandeman .
" It 's all down to something mysterious called spin .
The electrons act almost like a miniature bar magnet . "
Temperature change
As a quantum mechanical property of the electron , spin is usually taken to mean its rotational momentum ( like the Earth rotating around its axis ) .
That momentum - described as " up " or " down " - creates a tiny magnetic field .
When all the electrons in a material spin in the same way , their fields combine to create what we perceive as magnetism .
However , an iron magnet heated to 700C will " disorder " and lose its powers , known as a magnetic phase transition .
In 1881 , the German physicist Emil Warburg put a block of iron into a strong magnetic field and found it increased very slightly in temperature .
Scientists now know the electrons pivot in the field to align at a lower energy state , releasing surplus energy .
The metal warms up in what 's known as the magnetocaloric effect , which is greatest near the magnetic phase transition temperature .
" If you can suddenly alter the degree of ordering of all these little spins , then you get a large response , " says Sandeman .
For iron at room temperature , the response is just 0.1C .
Some materials cool in a magnetic field , a property that 's used in low temperature research .
Finding the right room temperature material is the key to a magnetic fridge , where the cooling power is derived from a positive magnetocaloric effect coupled to heat exchange .
One material works nicely : the element gadolinium ( Gd ) .
It 's a silvery - white metal that 's strongly attracted by a magnet , has a magnetic disordering temperature of 20C , and a giant magnetocaloric effect of several degrees .
A waste product from permanent magnet manufacture , gadolinium costs around £ 100 per kg ; a magnetic fridge would use 0.15 kg .
Sandeman 's current research , however , is looking at other possibilities .
" The quest is to get away from these expensive rare earth materials and look for magnetic materials which have a phase transition at room temperature , " says Sandeman , whose research job at Cambridge University is funded by the Royal Society .
He also works with Professor Derek Fray , a leading expert in materials chemistry .
" What I 'm actually working with is an alloy of two magnetic materials , cobalt and manganese , " says Sandeman .
When these elements are mixed with non-magnetic " spacers " like silicon , the cost falls to £ 5 per kg .
Strangely , his latest experimental alloy has a negative magnetocaloric effect - it cools in a magnetic field .
This could also be harnessed for fridges through a heat exchange process .
A Cambridge University spin- out company , Camfridge Ltd , has built two prototype magnetic fridges that use gadolinium .
While the latest one is little more than fridge innards , the team - which includes Sandeman as chief scientific officer , Fray and experienced business people - is striving to develop the revolutionary effect for commercial exploitation in fridges and , perhaps , air conditioning .
" It 's a sea change in thinking , " says Sandeman .
" It never ceases to amaze me how you can take a block of this stuff and stick it into a [ magnetic ] field .
The prototype is operational and has achieved a large temperature span . "
A magnetic fridge works like this .
Powdered gadolinium ( with coarse grains for good heat transfer qualities ) is put into a magnetic field .
It heats up as the randomly ordered magnetic moments - the electrons with spin - are aligned , or " ordered " , by the field .
The newly - acquired heat - a boost of between 2 - 5C , depending on the gadolinium 's original temperature - is removed by a circulating fluid , like a conventional fridge .
The magnetic field is removed and the gadolinium cools below its starting temperature as the electrons resume their previously disordered state .
Heat from the system to be cooled - your fridge interior - can then be transferred to the now cooler metal .
Then all you do is endlessly repeat .
But unlike conventional fridges , which need very toxic chemicals , the only liquid needed for heat transfer is water , alcohol or , more likely , antifreeze .
Cutting energy use
A more advanced prototype next year will optimally bring together three elements - temperature span , cooling power and efficiency - along with a faster motor .
This will allow less gadolinium to be used with a smaller magnet , saving materials costs .
Camfridge 's managing director , Neil Wilson , says : " In terms of technical specification , that prototype will get us to a domestic fridge .
Commercial manufacturers have hit the wall ; there is not much more they can do .
We 're wanting to cut the energy use by half . "
Professor Stephen Blundell , of Oxford University , also understands the issues well , as he 's written a textbook on magnetism and researches magnetic properties in materials .
Magnetocaloric effects are becoming more practical , he thinks , thanks to improved magnet technology and new materials .
A magnetic fridge would be compact , less noisy and wo n't need harmful gases .
" I think this technology has real potential , but it is still at the early stages .
The claims of 40 % efficiency savings seem a little speculative , though not completely unreasonable , " says Blundell .
Some 15 % of UK energy is used in refrigeration and cooling for air conditioning , and much more in warmer countries .
Garry Staunton , head of low carbon research at the Carbon Trust , which is financially supporting the magnetic fridge 's development along with Cambridge University and other investors , says that 22 m tonnes of UK carbon dioxide emissions annually are due to refrigeration and air conditioning .
Efficiency improvements to domestic fridges since 1990 have seen a 27 % reduction in their energy use .
Increasing energy efficiency with new technology is the key to stabilising and reducing carbon emissions .
Consumers seem willing to support and demand new energy - efficient appliances in their homes , while everyone has felt the sharply rising cost of electricity .
As the fridge magnet moves inside the fridge , it may become the exciting new green technology of the 21st century .

Two simple words of passion ...
Seattleduck 's Kevin Broidy captured the essence of user passion when he said , " Passion starts with two simple words : F***ing Cool ! "
In Kevin 's words ( and I think he nailed it ) :
" That ’s where passion begins .
Those are the words I want every user of my product to utter .
Ideally followed up by something like :
<>' Dude , you have to check this out .
It ’s so f**king cool !'
I do n’t want their reaction to be a measured , rational , dispassionate analysis of why the product is better than the alternatives , how the cost is more reasonable , feature set more complete , UI more AJAXified .
I do n’t want them to pause to analyze the boring feature comparison chart on the back of the box .
I want 'f ** king cool ! '
Period .
I want that pure sense of wonder , that kid - at - airshow - seeing - an - F16 – on - afterburners - rip - by - so - close - it - makes - your - soul - shake reaction , that caress - the - new - Blackberry - until - your - friends - start - to - question - your - sanity experience .
I want an irrational level of sheer , unfiltered , borderline delusional joy . "
But " f*** ing cool " is not a " business appropriate " phrase .
It 's unprofessional .
So while we may want our customers to feel it , sure , we certainly can't have one of our employees saying it .
Heavens no .
According to some folks within Sun , anyway .
It seems that the insightful tech blogger Tim Bray -- who happens to be a Sun employee - - used the words , " f*** ing cool " ( but without the asterisks ) to describe Sun 's Project Blackbox , and he took some interesting heat for it from both outside and inside the company .
" Out of public view , the Sun internal bloggers alias exploded , opinions ranging from those saluting me as an exemplar of New Age Marketing and Proactive Transparency to others who felt my mouth ought to be washed out ; one person related that he ’d heard from a Sun shareholder who was going to sell as a consequence . "
But this is who Tim is .
He did n't use the F - word to attract attention .
He used it because he honestly believes that Project Blackbox is , " totally drop dead f*** ing cool . "
So he said it .
And of course it brought up all sorts of issues related to honesty , authenticity , professionalism , personal vs. corporate blogs , etc .
I would be proud and thrilled to have someone describe something I made in those terms .
Those exact , most passionate , terms .
But here 's why this whole story made me smile ( in that but - I 'm - not - bitter kind of way ) ... when I was still a Sun employee , I got into serious trouble for using just ONE of the words in that phrase ... cool .
Yes , cool .
It came up as a black mark in my annual employee performance evaluation .
So Tim , times have changed when you call a Sun product " f*** ing cool " , and all they care about is the F - word .
We all have to decide what constitutes " professionalism " for our own business .
And my standards might be much lower ( or rather different ) from yours .
One of my favorite exchanges was between Hugh MacLeod and one of his commenters , some time back .
Hugh , not known for self - censorship , was told , " Maybe you 'd have more clients if you stopped using such inappropriate language . "
His response : " If that 's what I 'd have to do to win those clients , they are n't the people I 'd want to work with anyway . "
Which reminds me of Paul Graham 's Dignity is Deadly speech .

You know what I think of this post ?
It 's f**king cool !
It 's been my long term complaint that a lot of companies shoot for pleasing everyone .
It seems to me that it 's better to turn off a small percentage of your audience if in turn you get some very passionate clients out of the exchange .

YES !
This is SO appropos .
A mandatory dress code was handed down last week by the owners of this sad , sad little company .
The reasoning ...?
Slacks and a tie are the " evolution " of business ( yes , that was actually said to me ) , and we 're not selling out , " we 're growing up . "
Even though the change is about our " image , " and being " professional " , it 's not even slacks and a tie !
It 's " fitting jeans " and " collared shirts . "
Nevermind the subsidiary company in the same building with no dress code .
Nevermind the two little dogs running around the building ( property of one of the owner 's ) .
Nevermind the bathroom with the busted latrine and flickering light .
It 's all about the collared shirt .
Because , duh ! , everyone knows collared shirts increase productivity !
* gag *
If wearing uncomfortable , expensive clothing is growing up , get me a binky and throw me in diapers .
Love you , Kathy !
Keep on rockin' !

When it comes to coarse language there is no need to debate whether it is unprofessional versus passionate .
The bottom line is that it is inappropriate .
However , I know that this is my opinion .
And while I would love for everyone to share my opinion that is not realistic .
So when it comes to blogs like Hugh's , I just decide not to subscribe to them .
I do my own personal censoring .
But the real point of Kathy 's post ( I hope ) was that you want to elicit some real passion from your users ... not logical or analytical responses .
I just wish you would have said it like that Kathy .
No point in bringing the F - bomb into the picture .
Sure for some people a passionate response will involve the F - word ... but not everyone .
I believe that there is real power in the way we visual and frame things in our minds .
So to me it is far better to visualize your users skipping logic and heading straight for passion rather than to visualize them uttering profanity .

I think there is also a 2nd layer around the corporate circle .
In it should be words and phrases like " politically correct " , " compromising " , " sensible " and " safe " .

I 've got to agree with Steve Akers here .
Though I may use expletives in private to show a passionate response , I will not in public .
Just as I wo n't have sexual intercourse in public .
These things really do * offend * some people , and unlike Hugh MacLeod there are people I * enjoy * working with who would be offended by a f**k .

Good comments , and here I thought I 'd sneak this one in on a Friday when nobody is reading .
Rob : Agreed about the words , especially " politically correct "
Steve :
You 're absolutely right -- this is really about the passion , not the words .
But the words are so often a direct representation of that passion .
Still ...
Steve and Gihan :
This is definitely culturally ( and personally ) specific -- in some contexts , the F - word is neither inappropriate or even noticeably different from other words like " very " and " awesome " .
So context matters .
Gihan , I think the point about Hugh was not that he wanted to work only with people who are n't offended by his language -- it was about being himself , and not wanting to change that .
This is all quite tricky , because on one hand -- I advocate for being kind , considerate , and caring toward your users ... wearing the good shirt , etc. but on the other hand , to do something that offends NOBODY is often too restrictive , especially given that we cannot control how sensitive people are to various things .
If we stop to consider everyone 's feelings , we can be paralyzed into doing only what is safe and not offensive .
Not only is that virtually impossible to do ( avoid offending ANYONE ) , but it 's not a recipe for creating passionate users .
Still ... there 's no reason to offend people needlessly , and I do think about that .
I reckon this is about that balance between being authentic and being considerate .
And I have been known to tell Skyler that if she has to use those words to make a point , she should work on her vocabulary .
Typical do - as - I - say - not - as - I - do mom thing .
So , Steve and Gihan , you made points well worth listening to .

Gawd I love your f*** ing blog !
100 % agree .
I have an interesting twist to this one .
I am a raging geek .
I am also an Italian from the south side of Boston so I have the profane patois down pat .
My boss being a great guy who likes to get a laugh out of me ordered some f*** ing sweet software .
When it arrived he kept it under wraps and called me into his office .
He said " Guess what came in the mail today ? "
I replied " my sweet ass software ? " .
He showed it to me and waved it front of my face and said " yup .... here it is ... what do you think of that ? "
To which I promptly replied " Holy Shit that software gives me a raging f*** ing hard on !! " .
We both laughed hysterically and I left .
Two week later I got a call from HR about sexual harassment .
One of my more conservative Christian co-workers had been walking by when she heard my verbal ' O ' . I was appropriately worried .
The HR rep pulled me into and office .
She asked me if I had said what was reported and I replied in the affirmative .
She then broke down laughing and said " Did you really say software gave you a hard on ?
God you guys in IT are such GEEKS !! "
She and I laughed and she told me to shut my door when getting trying out new software from now on .

Whether it 's f**king or freaking or TOTALLY or " It 's the BOMB man ! " ... just get the response .
I was told one time that " cursing is the uneducated person 's way of expressing feelings " .
Which I can understand the rationale behind that ... but I 'm still looking for an " educated " way of saying " F__king cool " .

This post is about passion .
This post is about the freedom to express yourself .
Yet for the all the praise that self expression through edgy language is receiving , I noticed that everybody seems to be afraid to actually use the language in question .
Asterisks are fine , they make great wildcards , however the have no place in the word fuck .
So quit this shit with the puritanical punctuation , okay ?
Thanks .
Posted by : thom | Nov 4 , 2006 12:35:44 PM
My last comment came off as a bit tense , I meant it to be more tongue in cheek .
Sorry about that ; )
As a personal aside , I feel that cussing is not the best way to express emotion , and usually the least thoughtful .
Yet it does apply the necessary emotional exclamation point at times and it is certainly something we should not fear .
I do a lot of new media work in radio and once , while one of our producers was on the air , lighning struck our building .
Some of the dissipated energy from the strike actually hit the dude through his his headphones .
He yelled " fuck " right before the station went off the air and the managment later agreed that it was appropriate use of said word .
Currently for that kind of an outburst on the air the FCC can levy a " mandatory forfeiture " of several hundred thousand dollars .
Killing an engineer due to poor maintenance at the transmitter site is , I believe , closer to twenty grand .
Whereabouts are our priorities I wonder ?
I 've actually been corrected by my station 's GM for saying " poop " on the air , not " shit " , " poop " .
Ugggh , I think we could do without this canonical fear of languaage , especially with the amount of violence in popular media .
Murder is fine , poop is not ?

Totally sweet post , Kathy .
I 'm with hugh on this one ( as you might have guessed ) but I 'm refraining from profanity here for the sake of the mixed audience , and ' cause it ain't my blog .
That said , here 's the thing I really can't figure out about people that believe in magic words …
If you omit a couple letters , or use $ #@ %$@# , or cover a soundbite with a bleep , how does it change anything ?
I mean , we all know what was said , right ?
I was raised by lawyers , so I love profanity as much as I love fat , juicy , latinate polysyllabics …
I figure the point is to get the message across and some messages are served best with a bit of sauce .
The counterexample that proves the rule … I saw the movie Repo Man once on Canadian network TV .
The censor in charge mis-cued all the bleeps , so instead of " mother - bleeeeep " you got " Bleep - ( you know which profanity ) .
It was the best version of the movie I 've ever seen .
Really should 'a done it for the studio release .
Anyway , I do on occasionan get the treat of hearing that my work is f*** ing cool , " and I love it .
But I love it most when all the vowels are present .

Great post .
Evoking true passion from users is what its all about .
Unintelligent profanity does n't help any causes , but providing your honest thoughts in an uncensored manner serves much more use than subduing things in the name of " professionalism " .

For me , cursing / cussing / ' bad ' language , whatever you call it , is a cultural marker of informality .
When used between two people in the workplace , it is often a way of marking the relationship as closer , more intimate , more informal than when it 's not used in say , a larger meeting in the conference room .
But it 's not just curses , but slang in general - my Californian boss says " cool " and " dude " and " awesome " to me ( also a born Ca- girl ) , but he only lets those words out in formal meetings when he 's being " charming . "
What 's going on here with these discussions about the workplace , whether it 's about clothing or language use or taking risks , is about the changing culture of the workplace as it tries to determine if it 's going to be formal or informal .
Our culture at large , due , I think , to mass media - youth culture , has become extremely informal in the last 50 years .
We tend to not wear hats to public events , and I 've noticed that even shaking hands when introduced is considered optional behavior .
I just realized I am writing a large rant , so I 've finished the rest of this on one of my blogs , http://maiaoming.blogspot.com/
so as not to bog down the comments area any more .
I 'll probably also write about this at some point on redinked .
It 's fascinating , really .
Thanks for a great post and blog !

The point about someone saying Fuck is that it should come out of their mouths without passing through their brain .
It should be the expression of surprise , they should have been so stunned by what they saw that they just said it .
Then you have won .
If my father told me he had just seen a film that was " fucking amazing " I would want to see it ( as he is 77 and does not swear ) .
But if he told me it was " rather good " I would probably write it off .

It 's not language that I use , but I understand the emotion behind it .
I get a lot out of reading your blog ... unfortunately I really hesitate to link to it or pass it on to others , because of posts like this .
The sexually explicit graphic that you start off with is completely inappropriate .
Coarse language works for some of the younger generation , but the point of this post would be lost on my older , conservative business partners .
And much of my target market is 50 + -- phrases like " kick ass " and " f** king cool " convey an entirely different range of emotions .

The last image reminds me of a quote that I like ...
" I want to stand as close to the edge as I can without going over .
Out on the edge you see all the kinds of things you can't see from the center . "
- Kurt Vonnegut
However , I think alot of commentators here fail to see that people who do n't use words like F*** and SH*T can be passionate .
This article is a little like " THE NOD " .
You write these articles ( which I like reading ) but sort of lay it out there to say if someone does not agree , then they just do n't " get it " .
Posted by : Greg | Nov 6 , 2006 10:08:11 AM
I love the post - shock and awe .
Definitely not mediocre so people either love it or hate it .
Either way , people will remember it .
Here 's the rub -
Have you boiled down the 10 or so things that make people say " F*ing cool " versus " neato " ?
From your blog we all understand that passion in users is good .
IMHO I 'd like to see you to solidify / summarize a little on exactly how to do this .
I think creating " F*ing cool " goes beyond " Daring " and " Crazy " .
How can you consistently generate the reaction you seek ( in this case you used sex and " cussing " ) ?
" Daring " is a class of actions or mindset , not a specific action .
Is it so simple as to create the visually beautiful , sexy , dangerous , funny , powerful , discontinuous , or shocking ?
Are you speaking to my lizard - brain as you discuss in your books ?
I 'd personally like to see where your current thinking is on the " how " in all of this .
Thanks !

The comments to this entry are closed .
People like to talk about the benefit of open source 's distributed development , but I think the communal aspect is just as important .
We all already know that a successful open source developer must play well with others , much both follow and lead in different projects , must be able to handle and resolve personal and technical conflicts .
We succede when we work in public ; so why should we be so drawn to version control that encourages isolation , where everything is a fork ?
There 's great potential in version control -- but it's all in usability and tools , security and scaling , not the mathematical appeal of patch management algorithms .
But centralized version control does need to become more open .
The difference between someone with commit access and some random contributor should be reduced .
Anonymous commits should be allowed ( or commits with a very low registration threshold -- strict anonymity is n't really important here ) .
The tools should be usable enough that we can say " we do n't accept patches , we only accept pointers to branches in our repository " .
Maybe we could even say " we accept bug reports , but we prefer bug reports in the form of commits into our bug_example / directory " .
We should stop using Wikis , and just use web frontends to our version control .
Honestly I do n't know how distributed systems compare on ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .
Subversion could definitely be better , but I do n't think that has anything to do with centralization .
I find handling patches very difficult , but I think merging branches in Subversion is generally easier , and with far more room for improvement .
As an aside , I do n't see why the exchange of patches in email is even relevant in a usable and complete system -- emailing files around is a crappy interface for everyone .
Making it less crappy is missing the point ; email is not a good file transfer protocol .
But because Linus does everything in email ... sigh .
The distributed systems offer nothing for ( 2 ) .
Centralized systems allow you to list the files and branches and whatnot .
Subversion made an important improvement on CVS by making the branching and tagging very transparent , where it was somewhat invisible and mysterious in CVS .
That makes a real and practical difference in the usability of branching .
Distributed systems are a step back in this respect .
But more practically , I think distributed systems enable private work in a way that is bad for the community .
I think the private workflow so touted by distributed systems is a total non-feature , even an anti-feature .
Open source development should happen in the open ; that 's what people usually want to do , and that 's what we should encourage at every opportunity .
The distributed systems do some work on ( 1 ) , usually by not needing a " server " ( except maybe for rsync and any web server ) .
But frankly the " server - less " systems they set up are usually much more complex in practice than a single well - maintained server .
Now that Subversion has fixed many of its server problems ( with fsfs among other things ) , server maintenance is really not a problem .
And we share the work around ; there are far fewer servers than developers , and that works fine .
But I think this can be taken further .
There 's nothing wrong with the centralized model .
There is something wrong with the way we are using Subversion ( and CVS before it ) .
The wrongness is n't that you need a server , or a network connection , or disk space .
It 's that you need commit privileges .
People treat the benefit of distributed development as self - evident , but I do n't agree .
The best real justification I 've seen of the centralized model is Greg Hudson 's Why Bitkeeper Is n't Right For Free Software , which is still relevant since it was n't about the BK license or proprietary software .
All the arguments against BK on the basis of license have been clearly proven , but the model remains relevant .
The basic argument Greg makes is that the Linux development process is an anomaly and does n't apply to most projects .
If you 've paid any attention , you 'll have noticed there 's a ton of new version control systems .
It 's a little odd , really -- the community languished with CVS for such a long time .
CVS got lots of really important things right , but as we all know it also was a mess .
Then Subversion and Arch came along with two different models -- one based closely on CVS ( Subversion ) , and one based on a new distributed model .
Arch seems crufty and difficult , or maybe it 's just that its designer has a somewhat crufty and difficult personality ... but clearly that branch of design has had an explosion of implementations , where Subversion remains alone ( though far more successful ) .
I wish you would have went into this level of detail a month ago or so when we were talking about setting up a public repository for patterns .
You 're making a ton of sense here .
I think you could have a workable model w/ subversion if you could figure out how to : Self - register or distribute identity .
Anonymous write is a non-starter ...
Tier access such that newly registered users can create new branches in a sandbox area with full write access but not be able to write outside of their own branches until they were granted higher access .
I wonder if a simple web front end might not help accomplish a lot of this .
A form takes a username / password + source branch and create a new " free branch " somewhere and spits that out as a result .
This could also have a web / machine interface that you could probably wrap with five lines of bash / curl to have a nice little CLI : $ svn_share -u username http://example.com/reposhare/trunk
Hello username , we do n't know you .
Enter a password for jailed access ...
Password : *********
Your branch is http://example.com/repo/username/01/
The command might be best as a wrapper around svn co that would have basic logic for establishing the account and creating one of these " free branches " and then checking it out .
This leads to some problems : Branch bombs -
The branching mechanism is cheap but you 'd have to put some kind of basic constraints around creation .
Stale branch detection -
It would be nice to have some heuristic for determining if a branch was actually valuable and to clean up those that are n't .
At any rate , I 'm interested in hearing more on this if you 've thought about implementation at all .
I was trying to figure out how to set up Apache for this sort of situation in Apache auth -- I have n't had a chance to revisit it since then ( sysadmining , blech ) , but I think there 's a special tool for svn permissions which is pretty granuar .
For self - registration it might be sufficient simply to use some simple webapp that manages .htaccess files , maybe with a little something for forgotten passwords and whatnot ( a parrallel record of email addresses would have to be kept ) .
I am worried about security though , especially since Subversion is written in C. C does not encourage confidence in security .
Not a big issue when you trust everyone you authorize , but if authorization is opened up ... # Ian Bicking Would n't the Wikepedia model be helpful here as a model for thinking about security ?
It seems to me that some of security concerns might not be _that_ big a deal since you can just roll back to a previous version if someone pollutes the tree .
# brian I 'm thinking of security like buffer overflows , or people adding gigantic files to the repository which cause the database size to explode ( since deleted items remain in the repository database ) .
# Ian Bicking
One way to do this would be to hook the authentication into something like Bugzilla .
We did that at work so that both subversion and bugzilla had the same set of users with just one place to have to deal with them -- the username was a full email address for subversion .
This also gives the ability to self - register , reset passwords , etc .
A few changes to bugzilla would probably allow patches to point to subversion changes and allow sharing write access to branches .
# David Ward
Have you checked out < a href = " http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/ ">Mercurial</a >?
I wrote a short post about it recently .
I 'll have to throw my approval in on this one as well .
I have been using GNU Arch for some time now , and although it is a powerful SCM , it 's definitely not the easiest thing to use .
Bazaar has addressed some of these issues while remaining compatible with GNU Arch .
Tom Lord has pre-released GNU Arch 2.0 , which is another complete rewrite that borrows ideas from Linus ' Git .
It 's not a feature - complete SCM yet , but it appears to be picking up steam .
Hopefully , he 'll incoporate the usibility features in Bazaar into the new version .
I have not jumped on the Subversion bandwagon , partially because it had such a rocky start right about the time I was looking for a new SCM .
I have it installed , but only to pull your source code , at which point I slough it off to whatever SCM I might be playing with at the time .
I have not used monotone because of its dependence upon OpenSSL libraries and the inability to incorporate GPG / OpenPGP utilities ( though that 's such a little nit that I should probably reconsider ) .
I 'm also not entirely comfortable with having to cut -n - paste SHA - 1 strings just to get a branch I want .
( Git suffers from this , too . )
Mercurial incorporates a versioned tagging system that allows you to set arbitrary names to revisions and travels with the archive .
You can also set local tags that do not get transfered , which allows you to make less " official " notes about what a branch or revision represents .
+1 for Mercurial .
Codeville has some interesting merging algorithms , but ease of use is by far the more important thing to consider .
Darcs has gotten some bad press regarding its memory consumption and long operations when merging with large histories , though these might be fixed by now .
( Plus , it 's written in Haskell !?
Who uses that ?!)
Canonical is sponsoring the development of Bazaar - ng , another python - based SCM that borrows ideas from GNU Arch and Bazaar .
I do n't really know where it is in a feature - wise comparison , but it 's a relatively new project .
Now that GNU Arch 2.0 is in alpha , I 'm not sure if bazaar - ng is going to take the new direction ( I have n't been following that closely lately ) .
That brings us back to Mercurial .
It 's a mouthful to say , but the commandline is a terse hg COMMAND style .
It 's very cvs-like in the way it feels , yet shares a lot of properties with monotone and codeville .
It is self - hosting and can publish over HTTP .
A CGI front - end is provided so you can incoporate it with your favorite web server .
The CGI / web front - end looks a lot like gitweb , the Perl git front - end on kernel.org , though there have been recent patches to the list that really improve on the presentation .
Plus , it 's FAST !
( And written in Python , non - the - less . ) # Chad Walstrom
Hi ; yes , I actually saw that on del.icio.us , and it's what got me thinking about version control again .
It sounds like the developer on Mercurial has the technical parts down well .
I do n't know about usability , especially since it seems like it's a contender for Linux development , and I think Linux developers ( or maybe just Linus ) have distorted ideas about usable version control .
I do n't know what the technical foundation of Bazaar - NG is , but they seem the most concerned with basic usability issues .
Other ones can be better or worse in terms of usability -- Arch is pretty horrible from what I can tell , and Darcs is pretty straight - forward .
Many of them put so much emphasis on the distributed part , that continuous integrating ( the norm in Subversion or CVS ) is an Excersize Left Up To The Reader .
It is interesting that this latest generation of version control systems is very heavy on Python ( Mercurial , Bazaar - NG , Codeville , and I think I 'm forgetting something else ... )
# Ian Bicking From a usability perspective , Mercurial is quite similar to both CVS and SVN .
Commands that " mean the same " in CVS and Mercurial have the same names , flags , and so on .
Linus definitely has extremely peculiar notions about version control , but those are all firewalled in git / cogito , and have not bled elsewhere .
# Bryan O'Sullivan
Darcs is yet another one -- http://darcs.net/DarcsWiki
I 've just started playing with it for personal projects .
CVS is too crufy , and Subversion has too many requirements for my personal stuff ( though we moved from VSS to Subversion at the office and have never been happier ) .
Back to darcs -- the commands are easy .
It seems to be distribuated when you want it to be and centralized when you want .
The fact that you can immediately mail patches back and forth , and pull any source tree off the web and into are cool features .
" But centralized version control does need to become more open .
The difference between someone with commit access and some random contributor should be reduced "
True to a very large extent and it focusses on a very important issue .
Subversion has a very specific problem when used with free / open source projects .
It pretends that patch management is none of it's business , since all it promises to be is a better CVS .
But remember that CVS itself is probably two decades old and should not be setting the bar for any version control software beyond a certain extent .
Now we know after a decade + of distributed software development in which not everyone has commit privilieges , that there are problems with the way patches are handled .
But it probably best not to depende on the SVN project itself to do this .
As you note in another excellent point : - " There 's great potential in version control -- but it's all in usability and tools , security and scaling , not the mathematical appeal of patch management algorithms . " .
Tortoise SVN and SVK are the only two SVN based projects that have had any real impact .
I am not sure though about that bit about " patch management algorithms " .
It 's a prominent shortcoming / defect in SVN that it does have a real handle on objects through object IDs - there is no way to clearly answer the question " Is file A on branchA the same as the file A on trunk " ; also lacking is true renames .
Merge Tracking will not really be possible unless these are sorted out .
Hmmm ...
Your idea of anonymous commits seems like a possible source of unintended consequences .
I 'll throw out the term ' wikification ' to describe it .
I love wikis , but there is a significant maintenance cost , due to flaws in human nature .
You 'd almost have to automatically build on every commit , and roll back changes that no worky - worky , and then black list bogus committers somehow .
The haters of open source would likely DOS a lot of projects .
Ultimately , there is a huge learning curve before stepping into any project .
Even if I know python ( and I consider myself a medium - weight ) , I probably can't do useful work until I 've interacted significantly with the team , beyond trivial bugfixing .
So , I 'm luke - warm on the idea .
I think new people should n't be able to commit to the trunk , but they should be able to make their own branches .
There remain some DoS possibilities , no doubt , but those are all simply bugs .
There might be a lot of those bugs , of course ... # Ian Bicking
I work as a team leader in a small / medium - sized developer team , and we are using CVS / subversion successfully , but after playing around with darcs for a toy project , we also think about moving to a SCM without a central server .
May be we are a " to agile " or whatever , but sometimes it would be just nice to sync with the repository of my coworker without submitting it to a central server or using branches .
And approaching a release all my team members start to merge with a central repository .
May be I must say , that I highly appreciate the way Guido ( GvR ) and Linus manage there projects .
And I guess this can be applied to a lot of open source software too .
Well , and email is not to bad for patch " movement " , is n't it ?
I think , the way darcs does it , is the best .
Some people can commit directly , the rest has to send the patches by mail .
The ability to submit a patch directly via the version control system so that the project leader (s ) can review and merge it as desired would be a great boon .
You 'd certainly think that SVN could be given explicit support for this feature , and I think that SVN is the best candidate given how much acceptance it has gained .
One thing that should be kept in mind with regards to accepting anonymous or nearly anonymous patches is the whole Linux / SCO nonsense .
While only a project as successful as Linux is likely to gain that level of attention , it 's always good to have an idea of who is vouching for a piece of code ( and whether they wrote it themselves ) when you 're adding it to your repository .
One of my favorite features of Darcs is the " darcs send " command , which e-mails your changes to the owner of the upstream repository .
# Matt Brubeck
In some of my thoughts about building systems on top of Subversion , I 've thought about expressing workflow through custom properties , and acting on those in hooks .
So instead of patches you 'd have branches , and a submission would be a flag / property on the branch that said you were ready for someone to look at it .
The " ready for someone to look at it " is almost an indexing operation as much as anything .
Though another possibility might be special conventions .
For instance , it would be nice to encapsulate discussions of patches in the version control system as well .
Maybe a file ( discussion . txt or something ) could store that information .
This would be like pushing the Trac database into Subversion .
I 'm not sure if this would work with Subversion in practice , but that 's the kind of feature that could make me switch .
That reminds me of Subversion hooks -- there 's a lot of power there .
I do n't think that 's transferable to a distributed system .
# Ian Bicking
I believe projects that use distributed models have been using email for that type of message .
i.e. " Subject : [ MERGE ] ab327e678c8 " # Chad Walstrom
Distributed version control software is not incompatible with communal , centralized development .
In practice , most projects that use distributed software still have one central repository that everyone syncs and submits to .
They 're not using the distributed software to split development off into isolated forks ; they 're using it precisely to allow work to be shared more easily without such hard boundaries between established developers and new contributors .
+1 # Chad Walstrom Another agreement to this .
I find that distributed systems have many more features to the centralized ones and make it easy to set up a repository .
I set all of the ones on my site with an rsync command .
Also not everyone has access to public subversion repository .
Or people do n't want to use sourceforge or berilos .
# Julian Krause
The key point I see missing here is the fact that centralized development is a subset of what a distributed model can do .
At Summersault we switched from CVS to darcs , but kept the centralized development model for the most part .
darcs offers us many benefits , including spontaneous branches , interactive commits and updates , a smart patch algebra , and working on private branches we need .
You can read my full write up of our switch from CVS to darcs .
For open source work I also use darcs .
We start of using ' darcs send ' to exchange patches by e-mail , which works great .
For small projects my website works as a central public repo for read only access , and I filter commits through my e-mail .
For larger projects , we can set of a central server for darcs ( which is just copying files a web server ) , and give a group of comitters ssh access to commit there , while others contribute by e-mail .
I use svn for one project and am definitely slowed down because it does n't offer interactive commits , updates or easy cherrypicking of patches .
Try darcs .
Mark
The key point I see missing here is the fact that centralized development is a subset of what a distributed model can do .
I think there 's a good possibility that one of the distributed systems will focus on making centralized development work well .
I do n't think they 've done that yet .
They are ignoring something important as a result .
Since there 's so much competition at the moment hopefully someone will try to differentiate in this way .
I can even imagine a centralized fork ; just like svk is like fork of svn , the opposite might happen .
At least , I hope it does -- I personally am not tied to Subversion .
For larger projects , we can set of a central server for darcs I think that should be the first thing to happen for a new project .
Personally I " set up " a central server for all of my projects now , because I happen to have an svn repository at my disposal .
Keeping 1 project or 100 projects in one svn server is n't substantially more difficult .
Managing permissions is a pain ... but eh.
Easier than ssh accounts at least .
I 'm also generally fine giving people access based on informal agreements about permission .
I use svn for one project and am definitely slowed down because it does n't offer interactive commits , updates or easy cherrypicking of patches .
I do n't think these are problems with centralized servers .
There 's hard problems to be solved , and it's clear the new batch of version control systems is addressing many of those problems better than Subversion has .
( And it 's not surprising they are doing it with high - level languages . )
Subversion hooks have a tremendous amount of potential , though , and I 'd hate to lose that feature .

For darcs , there 's the " darcshive " centralized server project : http://darcs.net/DarcsWiki/RelatedSoftware # Matt Brubeck
Thanks for the response , Ian .
I think there 's a good possibility that one of the distributed systems will focus on making centralized development work well .
I do n't think they 've done that yet .
They are ignoring something important as a result .
Working with a centralized server is arguably easier with darcs than svn .
Svn recommends you think about your branches , tags , and overall layout when you create the project .
There is no need for this in darcs .
Svn has a special command , ' svn import ' for starting a project .
darcs has a syntax that is as easy to use , but more general purpose , as it can be used whenever you want to creat a new branch : darcs put mark@otherserver.com :/home/repos/my_new_project
There is nothing special to learn about users and permissions , as you can use unix permissions and ssh , or gpg- signed e-mail to transport patches .
It 's not clear to this to me why this would n't be considered " working well " .
It has the added benefit that casual contributors can still commit repeatedly offline on their laptops before sync'ing , or easily create their own branch .

As far as I can tell darcs cannot be run on anything but i386 and amd64 .
Most of the servers where I work are Linux or BSD running on sparc64 .
# Eric Radman
I 'm running it under Mac OSX , so I do n't think you 're necessarily correct there .
# Andy Todd
I do n't think current centralized SCMs can accomodate large numbers of development branches .
The problem comes when mainline development activity is merged into those branches to produce a more up - to - date branch .
In CVS and svn , such a merge duplicates the mainline changes -- even changes to unmodified files -- into the back - end storage system .
So , a hundred actively maintained development branches means your mainline development is consuming a hundred times as much space .
I 've brought up cleverer ways of representing big merges in Subversion , but there has n't been a whole lot of interest so far .
For the most part , projects seem happy storing patches in an issue - tracking system to represent small changes -- not a very elegant solution , but one which eliminates 95 % of the efficiency problem with branches .
The distributed SCM answer is to use a hundred times as many hard drives to hold the data .
That works fine , but the perception of distributed functionality as an anti-feature is not unique to you : other projects , like gcc , would much rather see development go on " in the open " in the central repository , rather than off to the side where it 's harder to find .
I just stumbled across this thread again , and noticed that something appears to have gone uncorrected here .
Subversion does do branching cheaply .
The whole tree is not copied into the branch : subversion internally stores what amounts to a symbolic link .
It may be the case that if you check out from the top of the tree , you 'll get multiple copies of the files .
I 'm just pointing out how the repository itself works .
( This is all described in the svn book . ) # Kevin Dangoor
I do n't think that 's the duplication Greg is talking about .
What 's he 's referring to is this sequence : Branch trunk -> foo ( cheap , no dup files ) hack hack hack on trunk ( modify 20 files )
Merge trunk changes to foo ( oops )
At stage 3 , we 've now got 20 modified files in foo , for which we are storing diffs in both the trunk and in foo .
Instead , the modified trunk files could be " re-branched " .
You 'd still need a new revision in the branch , obviously , but it would just be with the new pointers .
This is probably yet another issue that really needs true branch and merge history tracking .
# Steve Greenland
Changeset - based " distributed " version control systems ( like my favorite , darcs ) make patch management and integration possible in a way I have n't seen in subversion , and I see patch management as central to defining the trunk of a project .
Say you want to merge the changes I 've made over the past three days , because I just made my branch of SQLObject self - aware .
( Bouyeah . )
With a tree - based VCS you must calculate a diff between my tree three days ago and my tree now and apply that patch to your tree .
With a changeset - based VCS , you just apply my patches .
Svn 's merging is rudimentary at best for this reason .
I make mistakes with it all the time in my repositories - and I 'm the only committer !
About hooks , I see svn like a car that you can put a different spoiler on , but darcs like an engine you can hook up to a different transmission if you like , and put in a car of your choice .
I can see my way much more clearly to building more complex and wonderful things with darcs than i can with svn ( e.g. , making some sort of dynamic branch - maker - and - authorizer with apache and python and sane security and permissions and discussion , that deletes old stale branches and does n't take too much space ) .
In using a distributed version control system , I found the ability to create what you might call micro branches quite useful .
In an environment where we were juggling lots of small changes to a large system , being able to create a local staging environment and repository for each small feature is extremely helpful .
The problem with putting all of that in the central repository is that , aside from Subversion 's branch merging difficulty , it would clutter up the repository with branches .
From the POV of the main repository , each of these minor fixes were coming through as normal commits was quite nice , even though on our desktops they amounted to micro branches .
- Ken
How big of a problem is a microbranch in Subversion ?
Greg pointed out that they are n't stored efficiently , but if you make a modification in a branch and then integrate it into the trunk , it only doubles the storage of diffs , no more ( at least if I read his comment correctly ) -- that does n't seem so bad .
I know I underuse short - lived branches , but Subversion does n't disallow them ; you can delete a branch as soon as you are done with it .
The only real issue is that its merging is rather poor , so it discourages branching .
That said , I do see the usefulness of " spontaneous branching " as Mark termed it .
There is a certain oddity to the special place the checkout has in Subversion , where in distributed systems there is n't anything quite like a checkout , and there 's an opportunity to be somewhat more cohesive as a result .
# Ian Bicking
Well - centralized version control is a subset of distributed version control , since you can still upload ( or " push " ) stuff from your branches to the project 's central server .
What distributed version control adds is the voluntarity of this action , and freedom to fork the project independently while keeping the history and the possibility to merge back in the future easily .
( And some other bonuses like ability to work offline . )
So the question is whether this kind freedom is a good thing .
For the forking issue , if you want to fork , you will do that anyway and I doubt you will care that much about how hard would that be .
But at least you will retain the full history , and it will be possible to easily merge the projects back later , which I 'd say makes the situation at least somewhat better than with centralized VCS .
The " voluntary publication " is probably less clear - cut , but I think it 's better this way as well .
How does this stuff usually go ?
If you are new developer , you decide " I need this thing to do X " or " this Y thing is bothering me " .
So you can either : first ask for a branch on the central server .
No matter how low the threshold is , this forces you into some kind of a commitment , at least social - like .
" Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart " - " Or break it " .
At any rate , this will make you reconsider if you are really sure you will finish this and likely discourage you from trying .
first hack .
If you are successful , you can upload this ( and you will do that as likely as you would with the centralized version control ) , but you had no version control while hacking !
After all , this is one of the main points of distributed version control - you can version control your private development so that there is some history when you actually publish it .
If you are NOT successful hacking , noone will likely ever see your work , and that 's probably core of your argument against it .
The question is , whether it outweights all the other disadvantages , and whether that unsuccessful work is actually worth seeing - I think it is n't , up to some rather rare exceptions .
The bottom line is , I argue that the additional freedom distributed VCS gives you is a good thing and actually significantly lowers the barrier for new hacks by making it easier to do them and potentially reducing the bureaucracy .
Petr , it 's what happens after you 've worked on your modification in private and you decide to publish it to the world that 's the interesting question .
You can make a patch and post it to Bugzilla , or you can publish your repo on your own server where the maintainers can pull from .
Bugzilla is n't as attractive as some kind of anonymous micro-branch , which after all is basically what your patch is .
Publishing your own repo is not stable over time .
In reality , patches often wait many months for integration , and private repos are likely to move or go down , and you still have the problem of tracking the links to all the private repos .
It seems that the problem with turning anonymous patches into anonymous branches is that svn can't merge between repos ( e.g. main and pending - patches ) , and people are uncomfortable adding anon branches to the main svn repo .
Right ?
# Stephen
Well , I argue that centralized version control systems ain't any better than decentralized ones here .
You can make server - side anonymous branch with sensible decentralized VCSes - at least git and monotone can do that , I 'm not that familiar with the others ; but you can always just have parallel repositories at the server .
So this is NOT a problem with distributed VCSes .
# Petr Baudis
So the question is whether this kind freedom is a good thing .
For the forking issue , if you want to fork , you will do that anyway and I doubt you will care that much about how hard would that be .
But at least you will retain the full history
As of subversion 1.4.0 and its client / server support for " svnsync " , you can indeed replicate a repository with nothing more than anonymous read access .
Prior to 1.4.0 , there were hacks to accomplish more or less the same thing , and you could always use rsync if you had shell access to the server .
and it will be possible to easily merge the projects back later , which I 'd say makes the situation at least somewhat better than with centralized VCS .
That part of the problem , subversion does not solve .
# Peter Samuelson
" As an aside , I do n't see why the exchange of patches in email is even relevant in a usable and complete system -- emailing files around is a crappy interface for everyone .
Making it less crappy is missing the point ; email is not a good file transfer protocol .
But because Linus does everything in email ... sigh . "
Well that 's a shame , because emailing patches solves 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 .
1 ) It gets it out into the community .
Anyone can look at a mailing list and see the patches that have been made to a project .
A project I 'm working on currently uses gitweb , which lists all the recent commits to a repository , with the tags and commit message visible , and you can view any patch you want with a click .
2 ) We attach patches to bug reports and e-mails .
All our commit messages that are related to a bug report have the bug number and link back to the bug report from gitweb .
Similarly , each resolved bug has a git commit id .
Each author has his own repository remotely ( on a server ) as well as on their own machines .
Anyone can find work in no time by just looking up a bug , looking at gitweb , or reading the mailing list .
3 ) Seriously , what could be easier to understand than a patch ?
Sending it in an e-mail does n't mean someone is going to commit the patch straight out of an e-mail .
Sending it in an e-mail is a good way for people on a mailing list ( e.g. developers and contributors ) to verify correctness of a patch and to possibly locate more flaws .
4 ) The whole patch concept could n't be easier .
You write some code , you commit it and the patch is generated for you , you do n't even need to look at a patch at all if you do n't want to .
Then you can push it to a remote repository .
What 's more is that outside contributors can e-mail a patch or attach it to a bug report that any developer can include in their program .
The project I contribute to has dozens of contributors and they often work in this way , speeding up development .
They even get their name on the commit .
" But I think this can be taken further .
There 's nothing wrong with the centralized model .
There is something wrong with the way we are using Subversion ( and CVS before it ) .
The wrongness is n't that you need a server , or a network connection , or disk space .
It 's that you need commit privileges . "
You make no mention about how this is different for the distributed model .
Your issue with 1 ) is a non-issue with proper design .
Centralized or not , no code is useful to anyone until you push it .
Distributed systems can have one repository if you prefer , though this basically defeats the purpose of a distributed system .
Your article could say instead that not all these features are _inherent_ in distributed systems .
Distributed systems ( git/ cogito , atleast ) are a bit more low - level than CVS and SVN , which means that you have to take some sort of care when setting one up for a project .
But if you 're not completely braindead , this should be easy .
Set up a central repository for your project , then set up repositories for each author .
Make sure all authors file bugs or feature requests that they can link their commits to .
And , of course , keep commits small ( meaning solve one problem at a time ) .
As for your closing paragraph , this is plain nonsense .
The point of distribution _is_ the communal aspect .
With distribution , you allow ( and encourage ! ) anyone in the community to participate in the development process .
This tracks back to e-mail , which is a very convenient way for John Doe to send in a patch for a bug he found in your program .
It 's a lot better than having to whine to the program devs about a bug and have them solve the problem .
And it 's better than creating an account for John Doe to commit his one patch to your centralized repository .
The focus is n't on isolation , it 's on distribution ; you 're confusing these terms .
Yes , they are related terms , but the isolation here is of a specific problem , not an entire project .
There is no more encouragement to fork than with any other SCM .
Anyone can grab the source for a project and fork it no matter what SCM is used .
The encouragement is for different authors to work on problems in a _distributed_ manner towards the goals of the whole project .
Please , take a look at the kernel.org git trees .
Read their mailing list .
And try to back up your claims using their example .

Hubble confirms nearest known extrasolar planet
SPACE TELESCOPE SCIENCE INSTITUTE NEWS RELEASE
Posted : October 9 , 2006
NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope , in collaboration with ground - based observatories , has provided definitive evidence for the existence of the nearest extrasolar planet to our solar system .
This is an artist 's concept of a Jupiter - mass planet orbiting the nearby star Epsilon Eridani .
Credit : NASA , ESA , and G. Bacon ( STScI )
The Jupiter - sized world orbits the Sun - like star Epsilon Eridani , which is only 10.5 light - years away ( approximately 63 trillion miles ) .
The planet is so close it may be observable by Hubble and large ground - based telescopes in late 2007 , when the planet makes its closest approach to Epsilon Eridani during its 6.9 - year orbit .
The Hubble observations were achieved by a team led by G. Fritz Benedict and Barbara E. McArthur of the University of Texas at Austin .
The observations reveal the the planet 's true mass , which the team has calculated to be 1.5 times Jupiter 's mass .
Hubble also found that the planet 's orbit is tilted 30 degrees to our line of sight , which is the same inclination as a disk of dust and gas that also encircles Epsilon Eridani .
This is a particularly exciting result because , although it has long been inferred that planets form from such disks , this is the first time that the two objects have been observed around the same star .
The research team emphasized that the alignment of the planet 's orbit with the dust disk provides compelling direct evidence that planets form from disks of gas and dust debris around stars .
The planets in our solar system share a common alignment , evidence that they were created at the same time in the Sun 's disk .
But the Sun is a middle - aged star - 4.5 billion years old - and its debris disk dissipated long ago .
Epsilon Eridani , however , still retains its disk because it is young , only 800 million years old .
McArthur originally detected the planet in 2000 by measurements that were interpreted as a rhythmic , back - and - forth wobble in Epsilon Eridani caused by the gravitational tug of an unseen planet .
Nevertheless , some astronomer wondered if in fact the turbulent motion of the young star 's atmosphere was mimicking the effects of the star being nudged by a planet 's gravitational pull .
The Hubble observations settle any uncertainty .
The Benedict - McArthur team calculated the planet 's mass and its orbit by making extremely precise measurements of subtle changes in the star 's location in the sky , a technique called astrometry .
The slight variations are unmistakably caused by the gravitational tug of the unseen companion object .
Benedict 's team studied over a thousand astrometric observations from Hubble collected over three years .
" You ca n't see the wobble induced by the planet with the naked eye , " Benedict said .
" But Hubble 's fine guidance sensors are so precise that they can measure the wobble .
We basically watched three years of a nearly seven - year - long dance of the star and its invisible partner , the planet , around their orbits .
The fine guidance sensors measured a tiny change in the star 's position , equivalent to the width of a quarter 750 miles away . "
The astronomers combined these data with other astrometric observations made at the University of Pittsburgh 's Allegheny Observatory .
They then added those measurements to hundreds of ground - based radial - velocity measurements made over the past 25 years at McDonald Observatory at the University of Texas , Lick Observatory at the University of California Observatories , the Canada - France - Hawaii Telescope in Hawaii , and the European Southern Observatory in Chile .
This combination allowed them to accurately determine the planet 's mass by deducing the tilt of its orbit .
Although Hubble and other telescopes cannot image the gas giant planet now , they may be able to snap pictures of it in 2007 , when its orbit is closest to Epsilon Eridani .
The planet may be bright enough in reflected starlight to be imaged by Hubble , other space - based cameras , and large ground - based telescopes .
The results are being presented today at the 38th Annual Division of Planetary Sciences Meeting in Pasadena , Calif . and will appear in the November issue of the Astronomical Journal .
The Hubble Space Telescope is an international cooperative project between NASA and the European Space Agency .

The powerful ocean current that bathes Britain and northern Europe in warm waters from the tropics has weakened dramatically in recent years , a consequence of global warming that could trigger more severe winters and cooler summers across the region , scientists warn today .
Researchers on a scientific expedition in the Atlantic Ocean measured the strength of the current between Africa and the east coast of America and found that the circulation has slowed by 30 % since a previous expedition 12 years ago .
The current , which drives the Gulf Stream , delivers the equivalent of 1 m power stations - worth of energy to northern Europe , propping up temperatures by 10C in some regions .
The researchers found that the circulation has weakened by 6 m tonnes of water a second .
Previous expeditions to check the current flow in 1957 , 1981 and 1992 found only minor changes in its strength , although a slowing was picked up in a further expedition in 1998 .
The decline prompted the scientists to set up a £ 4.8 m network of moored instruments in the Atlantic to monitor changes in the current continuously .
The network should also answer the pressing question of whether the significant weakening of the current is a short - term variation , or part of a more devastating long - term slowing of the flow .
If the current remains as weak as it is , temperatures in Britain are likely to drop by an average of 1C in the next decade , according to Harry Bryden at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton who led the study .
" Models show that if it shuts down completely , 20 years later , the temperature is 4C to 6C degrees cooler over the UK and north - western Europe , " Dr Bryden said .
Although climate records suggest that the current has ground to a halt in the distant past , the prospect of it shutting down entirely within the century are extremely low , according to climate modellers .
The current is essentially a huge oceanic conveyor belt that transports heat from equatorial regions towards the Arctic circle .
Warm surface water coming up from the tropics gives off heat as it moves north until eventually , it cools so much in northern waters that it sinks and circulates back to the south .
There it warms again , rises and heads back north .
The constant sinking in the north and rising in the south drives the conveyor .
Global warming weakens the circulation because increased meltwater from Greenland and the Arctic icesheets along with greater river run-off from Russia pour into the northern Atlantic and make it less saline which in turn makes it harder for the cooler water to sink , in effect slowing down the engine that drives the current .
The researchers measured the strength of the current at a latitude of 25 degrees N and found that the volume of cold , deep water returning south had dropped by 30 % .
At the same time , they measured a 30 % increase in the amount of surface water peeling off early from the main northward current , suggesting far less was continuing up to Britain and the rest of Europe .
The report appears in the journal Nature today .
Disruption of the conveyor - belt current was the basis of the film The Day After Tomorrow , which depicted a world thrown into chaos by a sudden and dramatic drop in temperatures .
That scenario was dismissed by researchers as fantasy , because climate models suggest that the current is unlikely to slow so suddenly .
Marec Srokosz of the National Oceanographic Centre said : " The most realistic part of the film is where the climatologists are talking to the politicians and the politicians are saying ' we can't do anything about it ' . "
Chris West , director of the UK climate impacts programme at Oxford University 's centre for the environment , said : " The only way computer models have managed to simulate an entire shutdown of the current is to magic into existence millions of tonnes of fresh water and dump it in the Atlantic .
It 's not clear where that water could ever come from , even taking into account increased Greenland melting . "
Uncertainties in climate change models mean that the overall impact on Britain of a slowing down in the current are hard to pin down .
" We know that if the current slows down , it will lead to a drop in temperatures in Britain and northern Europe of a few degrees , but the effect is n't even over the seasons .
Most of the cooling would be in the winter , so the biggest impact would be much colder winters , " said Tim Osborn , of the University of East Anglia climatic research unit .
The final impact of any cooling effect will depend on whether it outweighs the global warming that , paradoxically , is driving it .
According to climate modellers , the drop in temperature caused by a slowing of the Atlantic current will , in the long term , be swamped by a more general warming of the atmosphere .
" If this was happening in the absence of generally increasing temperatures , I would be concerned , " said Dr Smith .
Any cooling driven by a weakening of the Atlantic current would probably only slow warming rather than cancel it out all together .
Even if a slowdown in the current put the brakes on warming over Britain and parts of Europe , the impact would be felt more extremely elsewhere , he said .
Poll shows 92 % of Americans want right to see ballots counted RAW STORY
Published : Monday August 21 , 2006 Print This Email
This A new Zogby poll to be released on Tuesday will reveal that 92 % of Americans , spanning every party and democraphic group , believe that the public has the right to view and verify the counting of votes , RAW STORY has learned .
When offered a choice between " Citizens have the right to view and obtain information about how election officials count votes " or " Citizens do not have the right to view and obtain information about how elections officials count votes , " 92 % of those polled agreed with the first statement .
Only 6 % agreed with the second , while 2 % were unsure .
The issue of transparency has become particularly important due to the use of electronic voting systems , most of which employ secret , proprietary code and do not allow public inspection .
For example , after a recent primary in Cuyahoga County , Ohio , it was found that 15 % of paper ballot records did not match the Diebold touch - screen electronic counts .
CNN correspondent Kitty Pilgrim called that election " a debacle . "
Although it is possible to install equipment that enables the checking of electronic vote counts against paper records in case of a disputed election , many locations have not purchased such equipment and even choose to keep their own security procedures a secret .
This sort of " security by obscurity " is widely considered a formula for inside tampering .
Soon after Tuesday 's release of the full results of the Zogby poll , the National Election Data Archive will issue a paper titled " The Election Integrity Audit , " which offers a new method of hand counting samples of ballots to reveal any corruption in the electronic count .
The paper will include a computer algorithm and spreadsheet that will calculate the percentage of ballots that have to be audited in any particular election to detect possible corruption .
NEDA hopes that this algorithm will be adopted as a standard for future election audits .
The press release is available at : Utah Counts Votes Election Archive
Flagpole Sitting
The 20th - century award for Best Center of Gravity definitely belongs to Hollywood stuntman Alvin Kelly .
In 1924 , Kelly sat atop a flagpole for 13 hours , inspiring copycats across the country to replicate his feat ( to varying degree of success ) .
Kelly returned to the pole in 1929 just in time to set the world record ( 49 days ) before the Great Depression put an end to such frivolity .

Or reason No. 452 why you should never let your elders claim that kids were more mature " in their day . "
On March 3 , 1939 , Harvard freshman Lothrop Withington , Jr. , touched off a firestorm of publicity - and imitators - when he swallowed a goldfish on a $ 10 bet .
For the next three months , students sucked down goldfish in record numbers while every authority figure from the Massachusetts State Senate to the U.S. Public Health Service tried to get them to stop .
The craze slowed down after many schools threatened to expel the fish eaters , but the stunt managed to remain popular enough to ensnare the next generation .
The current world record , 300 fish in one sitting , was set in 1974 .
Have a Nice Day
The yellow smiley face [ wiki ] and its now - ubiquitous catchphrase actually began life separately .
Smiley was originally created in 1963 as part of an insurance company campaign to improve employee morale following its merger with another organization .
For the next seven years , the face smiled silently from office posters , buttons , and desk cards until entrepreneurs Bernard and Murray Spain began publicly marketing smiley buttons - " Have a Nice Day " included - in 1970 .
By 1971 , the feel - good pair had sold more than 50 million of 'em .
No doubt , they were smiling all the way to the bank .
Hula Hoop
Although the hula hoop [ wiki ] is thought to have made its first appearance ( in wooden form ) in 14th - century England , it did n't take America by storm until 1958 .
That 's when Wham - O , Inc. , the same friendly folks who brought you the Superball and the Frisbee , released a " futuristic " plastic version and promptly sold 25 millions in only four months .
J. Fred Muggs
Lancelot Link
Bear of B.J. and the Bear I Can't Believe There are All These Monkeys on TV !
Scientific Name : Chimpanzeeus ontelevisionus Natural Habitats : Morning talk shows ( J. Fred Muggs [ wiki ] of " The Today Show " ) , campy criminal underworlds ( Lancelot Link of the 1970 series " Lancelot Link : Secret Chimp " [ wiki ] ) , and the cabs of 18 - wheeler trucks ( Bear of the 1979 sitcom " B.J. and the Bear " [ wiki ] ) .
Lifespan : Long .
Adding Muggs to " The Today Show " in 1953 saved the program from cancellation .
But the fad truly took off in 1970 , when the all - chimpanzee cast of " Lancelot Link " became superstars , spawning a chimp rock band ( The Evolution Revolution ) , complete with chimp rock album .
America 's monkey mania ended when " B.J. and the Bear " was pulled off the air in 1981 , but interest spread abroad .
" Lancelot Link " was the No. 1 show in Kenya in 1987 .
Diet : Varies .
While Lance Link and his cast mates apparently stuck to a traditional fare of veggies , Bear favored light bear ( on and off the camera ) .
J. Fred Muggs , on the other hand , had a taste for human flesh - once taking a bite out of comedian Martha Raye .
Cydia deshaisiana moth inside of the jumping beans .
Jumping Beans
Americans love a good novelty item , and nobody appreciates that fact more than Mexico native Joaquin Hernandez .
Since introducing the toy here in the 1940s , Hernandez has ruled as the " King of the Jumping Beans . "
A periodically recurring fad for more than 60 years , the beans are actually moth larvae trapped in seedpods [ wiki ] .
But their mystery continue to capture the public imagination .
In peak years , when the beans are really hopping , Hernandez has been known to sell as many as 20 million of them , employing as many as 50 people to collect , package , and export them .
The Kilroy schematic !
Kilroy Was Here
And here .
And here .
During World War II , Kilroy was everywhere .
Accompanied by a cartoon of a large - schnozzed man peeping over a wall , the " Kilroy Was Here " [ wiki ] phrase graced everything from the Arc de Triomphe in Paris to hut walls on Polynesian islands .
So who was Kilroy ?
Turns out , he was probably Navy shipyard inspector James J. Kilroy , who reportedly scrawled the phrase onto parts he'd examined .
Sailors later made a game of the enigmatic phrase , vying to be the first to impersonate Kilroy in a newly liberated era .
In fact , " Kilroy Was Here " became such a ubiquitous military fad that Apollo astronauts are said to have written it in the dust on the moon .

WE all know the bad effect of computers on our health and most of us even workout regularly to prevent such problems .
Ok , I might be exaggerating when I said " most of us " but at least we all " think of " working out or take other measures like taking regular breaks to prevent such problems which are known as Computer Related Injuries ( CRI ) .
So what exactly you do when you take that break ?
Let me guess - you raise you hands and stretch your back because your back is tired , you rub your face and runs your fingers in your hair because your head feels heavy .
And you take a little walk to give those legs some exercise .
You are feeling relaxed , and now you get back to work .
Break is over .
But wait a minute .
What about them which did all the work .
Yes your fingers which actually typed those keys and wrote those papers .
Please do n't neglect them .
Wrist , fingers , palm and back of the hand are " the most " neglected part of your body .
Hands are not just bones , they are made of nerves and muscles which produces lactic acid and which also gets tired .
So the next time you take a break do your hands some favor by doing following exercises .
And yes , just like all other exercises from me these are also simple and very less time consuming AND you wo n't need any equipment either .
This is the very first exercise I do because it helps in relaxing the muscles and thus prevents any muscles and nerve damage .
Start with both the hands , hold them straight in front of you with palm facing down and finger pointing straight .
Now Clinch your hand and make a fist with your fingers ( thumb on outside ) .
Release and repeat 10 times .
Hold your left hand straight in front of you , thumb pointing up and palm facing right .
Now with your right hand fingers hold the left hand 's thumb and squeeze gently .
Then slowly bend it toward left hand 's wrist until you feel the stretch in your thumb and palm muscles .
Release and repeat 10 times with both hands .
Just remember that while doing any kind of stretching exercises do n't over do it , listen to your body and stop it if you feel pain because the aim of stretching exercises is to stretch the muscles and not harm them .
Hold both hands in front of you , palm facing down .
Now make tight fists .
Slowly start moving your wrists up and down .
Do it for 30 seconds .
Now move your wrist to the left side and right side .
Do this for 30 seconds .
And in the end rotate the wrists clockwise and anti-clockwise and reverse ( you will notice that it ’s easier to rotate wrists in opposite direction with done with both hands together :-) Finally you have given enough workout for your wrist and fingers .
Now its time to give then some rest .
Sit comfortably on a chair or sofa .
Keep your left hand on your left thigh , palm facing down .
Now place your right hand on left hand just between the wrist and the elbow .
Slowly start rubbing your left hand with right palm by moving it straight towards the finger tips and back ( do not try to rub the wrist and forearms in churning motion because nerves can get damaged ) .
Now repeat for right hand .
Just include these 4 exercises in your daily routine ; it does n't take more then 5 minutes to do them all .
Look who came out of hiding !
What an exciting Monday !
First Ryan , then George , and now Britney ( and you have no idea what else we have in store for today so stay tuned ) .

One of the bigger controversies surrounding the PS3 is whether or not the inclusion of the Blu-ray drive was a good idea .
The upside ?
You get a ton more storage than a DVD and , if you 're Sony , you also get your format into many homes using a gaming system as a Trojan horse .
The more storage you have for games the better , right ?
Well , let 's review the oft - discussed downsides : Blu-ray drives are expensive , but they are also slow .
The 2X Blu-ray drive in the PS3 moves data at 9MB a second .
Not bad , right ?
It 's actually relatively slow .
There was some arguing over the speed of the Blu-ray player between Ozymandias and Mark DeLoura , as chronicled here , but they seem to agree that Sony 's Blu-ray drive is slow :
Admittedly , Blu - Ray looks dicey from several non-capacity angles .
Blu - Ray movies require a 1.5x Blu - Ray drive , or 54 M bits / second .
Sony announced that PS3 uses a 2x BD drive , which is 72 M bits / second or 9MB / second .
The Xbox 360 uses a 12x DVD , which should give it about 16MB / second .
That is significantly faster for games and will result in shorter load times .
And that 12x DVD drive should be a whole lot cheaper .
( Note that the PS3 drive will do 8 x DVD , and even that is faster than 2x BD . )
This is not good .
One of the ways around this slow loading time is to enable a one - time install of many of the game 's assets onto the hard drive of the PS3 .
In the case of Genji it decreases load times from 12 seconds to 4 seconds , which is a significant improvement .
However , if you buy and play a lot of games , that may lead to some troublesome data management , as even 60 GB drives may seem small after installing a few dozen games .
Who wants to install their console games anyway ?
Is n't this one of the reasons we 're not gaming on a computer ?
There is another way around this , if you 're a developer : use the extra space of the Blu-ray disc and make your data redundant .
Put important game data on multiple places on the game disc , and that way you decrease the amount of space the laser needs to travel to load the data you use often .
According to this month 's Electronic Gaming Monthly , this is how Oblivion is going to get around the slow - loading issue with its PS3 release .
Said Bethesda's Todd Howard , " Drive speed matters more to me [ than total capacity ] , and Blu-ray is slower . "
Of course , if you use data redundancy to boost speeds the way Bethesda is , you may very well eat up the extra space of that Blu-ray disc without being able to fit any more information on the disc than you would have put on a standard DVD - 9 .
The advantage of the media is compromised , and all that remains is a higher price .
So there you go : you can either install game assets on the hard drive or place redundant game data around the disc .
The problem with both of these solutions is that one of the advantages of Blu-ray become less compelling .
Why bother with a large Blu-ray disc when you 're putting that data on the hard drive before you play anyway ?
You could have simply put that extra information on a DVD and then moved it onto the hard drive .
The same can be said about the redundancy approach : why not just use a standard DVD and have it load quickly in the first place instead of doubling or tripling up your data on a slower but larger disc ?
The Blu-ray drive is useful for movies , of course , but for gaming , Blu-ray does n't look like it 's the best choice until faster drives are released .
There is every possibility of a future PS3 revision with a faster Blu-ray drive , but that wo n't help current PS3 owners .
Blu -ray may be the future for storage that 's both large and fast , but right now it seems shoe - horned into gaming applications .
It seems like developers may actually do better by shipping some of their PS3 games on DVDs .
Games will load faster and manufacturers will save money on the discs .
Would Sony allow it ?
I started escorting women at the local abortion clinic after the presidential election in 2004 .
For me , the election results were a loud wake up cry forcing me out of a life of comfortable complacency .
It seemed glaringly obvious that the country and our elected leaders were attempting to dismantle many of the rights I value including women ’s reproductive freedoms .
Equally obvious was my responsibility to do something in response .
Since I ’m not one to be easily intimidated escorting seemed like it might be a good fit .
I had no idea what to expect my first Saturday .
Of course I was somewhat familiar with the violence of Operation Rescue in addition to the murders of Dr. David Gunn , Dr. Barnett Slepian and Dr. John Britton , but I convinced myself that if massive assaults were occurring at our community 's clinic there would have been some coverage by local media .
Fortunately the other volunteers encouraged me to merely observe until I was comfortable with the process .
I ’ve tried to describe the scene before but with little success .
It ’s like some sort of bizarre circus or a hallucinogenic freak show .
There are usually 50 or so anti-choice protesters lining the sidewalk holding rosaries or crucifixes and reciting prayers .
Interspersed among them , leaning against trees or propped in the back of pick up trucks , are large vivid signs of innocent looking babies , depictions of Jesus accompanied by scripture , or bloody pieces of human remains .
But the sign which will forever win the award for flexibility was the one which read GOD HATES and below the word HATES was a strip of velcro , to accommodate the various options .
One morning it read GOD HATES FAGS and then on another GOD HATES CATHOLICS ( which was rather comical since there was a nun dressed in full habit sitting a mere 10 feet away ) .
To be fair most of the anti-choice protesters are content to stand outside the clinic and pray the Hail Mary incessantly .
Their presence is undoubtedly intimidating but I do n’t consider them threatening .
Unfortunately , there are on any given Saturday up to half a dozen people who choose to actively badger , menace and scare the women seeking medical treatment .
They scream hateful words , accuse them of murder , impede their path and never ever back off .
As escorts we attempt to surround the patients with support , provide words of encouragement and stand beside them as they walk the gauntlet .
Fortunately the experience is not as physically aggressive as I initially feared .
Occasionally there is bumping , blocking and the stepping on of toes but most of the aggression is verbal .
" You ’re a fag " " You ’re killing your baby " " Murderer " " You ’re going to be harmed forever " .
My past employment includes stints at a psychiatric hospital and correctional facilities so the verbal barrage bounces off of me .
It ’s obvious though that it impacts many of the women .
I watched a woman run a city block , the distance from her car to clinic door , in an attempt to avoid her tormentors .
Others will place their fingers in their ears , try to explain their circumstances or on some occasions tear up .
From time to time , they choose to walk in the three lane street , preferring to dodge approaching cars than endure the incessant harassment and palpable hatred .
Several weeks ago one of the clients turned around on an anti-choice screamer and yelled back , " You ’re the meanest Christian I ’ve ever seen ! "
Personally I ’ve found that one of the most effective means of distracting the rabid anti-abortionists is by allowing them to proselytize .
I ’ll simply ask them to tell me about their religious beliefs and while they are explaining my certain damnation , women are walking into the clinic with minimal interference .
When all else fails smiling or laughing at them is also effective .
Today on the anniversary of Roe v Wade , I encourage all pro-choice advocates to visit a local clinic simply to bear witness to the insanity , that in the 21st century , in America , women are being subjected to such barbaric conduct merely because they seek legal medical treatment .
As escorts we are always outnumbered but at least our presence and words hopefully convey the message that these women are not alone .
To the Editor :
On July 6 I chose to go to jail to defend my right as a journalist to protect a confidential source , the same right that enables lawyers to grant confidentiality to their clients , clergy to their parishioners , and physicians and psychotherapists to their patients .
Though 49 states have extended this privilege to journalists as well , for without such protection a free press cannot exist , there is no comparable federal law .
I chose to go to jail not only to honor my pledge of confidentiality , but also to dramatize the need for such a federal law .
After 85 days , more than twice as long as any other American journalist has ever spent in jail for this cause , I agreed to testify before the special prosecutor Patrick J. Fitzgerald 's grand jury about my conversations with my source , I. Lewis Libby Jr. I did so only after my two conditions were met : first , that Mr. Libby voluntarily relieve me in writing and by phone of my promise to protect our conversations ; and second , that the special prosecutor limit his questions only to those germane to the Valerie Plame Wilson case .
Contrary to inaccurate reports , these two agreements could not have been reached before I went to jail .
Without them , I would still be in jail , perhaps , my lawyers warned , charged with obstruction of justice , a felony .
Though some colleagues disagreed with my decision to testify , for me to have stayed in jail after achieving my conditions would have seemed self - aggrandizing martyrdom or worse , a deliberate effort to obstruct the prosecutor 's inquiry into serious crimes .
Partly because of such objections from some colleagues , I have decided , after 28 years and with mixed feelings , to leave The Times .
I am honored to have been part of this extraordinary newspaper and proud of my accomplishments here -- a Pulitzer , a DuPont , an Emmy and other awards -- but sad to leave my professional home .
But mainly I have chosen to resign because over the last few months , I have become the news , something a New York Times reporter never wants to be .
Several countries have already banned smoking
Cafes , nightclubs and restaurants are to be given until January 2008 to adapt , said Dominique de Villepin .
Those found in breach of the ban would be fined - 75 euros ( £ 50 ) for individuals and 150 euros for the premises where the offence occurred .
Passive smoking kills about 13 people a day in France , Mr de Villepin said , calling the situation " unacceptable " .
Mr de Villepin made the announcement in a television interview .
" We started on the basis of a simple observation - two figures : 60,000 deaths a year in our country linked directly to tobacco consumption and 5,000 deaths linked to passive smoking .
" It is an unacceptable reality in our country in terms of public health , " he said .
Treatment
Public places include stations , museums , government offices and shops , but not streets or private places such as houses or hotel rooms .
Mr de Villepin added the state would take charge of one - third of the costs of anti-smoking treatments , such as a patch .
" That would represent the first month of treatment , " he said .
Several countries have already taken similar measures .
Opinion polls in France - often considered a nation of smokers - suggest 70 % of the people support the ban , says the BBC's Valerie Jones in Paris .
The European Union 's most enthusiastic smokers are in Greece , Cyprus and Portugal , according to findings published in May this year .
' Ah , but there is the difference .
We knew it was propaganda , ' replied Sacha .
That is the difference .
Russian propaganda was so obvious that most Russians were able to ignore it .
They took it for granted that the government operated in its own interests and any message coming from it was probably slanted - and they discounted it .
In the West the calculated manipulation of public opinion to serve political and ideological interests is much more covert and therefore much more effective .
Its greatest triumph is that we generally do n't notice it - or laugh at the notion it even exists .
We watch the democratic process taking place - heated debates in which we feel we could have a voice - and think that , because we have ' free ' media , it would be hard for the Government to get away with anything very devious without someone calling them on it .
It takes something as dramatic as the invasion of Iraq to make us look a bit more closely and ask : ' How did we get here ? '
How exactly did it come about that , in a world of Aids , global warming , 30 - plus active wars , several famines , cloning , genetic engineering , and two billion people in poverty , practically the only thing we all talked about for a year was Iraq and Saddam Hussein ?
Was it really that big a problem ?
Or were we somehow manipulated into believing the Iraq issue was important and had to be fixed right now - even though a few months before few had mentioned it , and nothing had changed in the interim .
In the wake of the events of 11 September 2001 , it now seems clear that the shock of the attacks was exploited in America .
According to Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber in their new book Weapons of Mass Deception , it was used to engineer a state of emergency that would justify an invasion of Iraq .
Rampton and Stauber expose how news was fabricated and made to seem real .
But they also demonstrate how a coalition of the willing - far - Right officials , neo -con think - tanks , insanely pugilistic media commentators and of course well - paid PR companies - worked together to pull off a sensational piece of intellectual dishonesty .
Theirs is a study of modern propaganda .
What occurs to me in reading their book is that the new American approach to social control is so much more sophisticated and pervasive that it really deserves a new name .
It is n't just propaganda any more , it 's ' prop - agenda '.
It 's not so much the control of what we think , but the control of what we think about .
When our governments want to sell us a course of action , they do it by making sure it 's the only thing on the agenda , the only thing everyone 's talking about .
And they pre-load the ensuing discussion with highly selected images , devious and prejudicial language , dubious linkages , weak or false ' intelligence ' and selected ' leaks ' .
( What else can the spat between the BBC and Alastair Campbell be but a prime example of this ? )
With the ground thus prepared , governments are happy if you then 'use the democratic process ' to agree or disagree - for , after all , their intention is to mobilise enough headlines and conversation to make the whole thing seem real and urgent .
The more emotional the debate , the better .
Emotion creates reality , reality demands action .
An example of this process is one highlighted by Rampton and Stauber which , more than any other , consolidated public and congressional approval for the 1991 Gulf war .
We recall the horrifying stories , incessantly repeated , of babies in Kuwaiti hospitals ripped out of their incubators and left to die while the Iraqis shipped the incubators back to Baghdad - 312 babies , we were told .
The story was brought to public attention by Nayirah , a 15 - year - old ' nurse ' who , it turned out later , was the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the US and a member of the Kuwaiti royal family .
Nayirah had been tutored and rehearsed by the Hill & Knowlton PR agency ( which in turn received $ 14 million from the American government for their work in promoting the war ) .
Her story was entirely discredited within weeks but by then its purpose had been served : it had created an outraged and emotional mindset within America which overwhelmed rational discussion .
As we are seeing now , the most recent Gulf war entailed many similar deceits : false linkages made between Saddam , al - Qaeda and 9/11 , stories of ready - to - launch weapons that did n't exist , of nuclear programmes never embarked upon .
As Rampton and Stauber show , many of these allegations were discredited as they were being made , not least by this newspaper , but nevertheless were retold .
Throughout all this , the hired - gun PR companies were busy , preconditioning the emotional landscape .
Their marketing talents were particularly useful in the large - scale manipulation of language that the campaign entailed .
The Bushites realised , as all ideologues do , that words create realities , and that the right words can over whelm any chance of balanced discussion .
Guided by the overtly imperial vision of the Project for a New American Century ( whose members now form the core of the American administration ) , the PR companies helped finesse the language to create an atmosphere of simmering panic where American imperialism would come to seem not only acceptable but right , obvious , inevitable and even somehow kind .
Aside from the incessant ' weapons of mass destruction ' , there were ' regime change ' ( military invasion ) , ' pre - emptive defence ' ( attacking a country that is not attacking you ) , ' critical regions ' ( countries we want to control ) , the ' axis of evil ' ( countries we want to attack ) , ' shock and awe ' ( massive obliteration ) and ' the war on terror ' ( a hold - all excuse for projecting American military force anywhere ) .
Meanwhile , US federal employees and military personnel were told to refer to the invasion as ' a war of liberation ' and to the Iraqi paramilitaries as ' death squads ' , while the reliably sycophantic American TV networks spoke of ' Operation Iraqi Freedom ' - just as the Pentagon asked them to - thus consolidating the supposition that Iraqi freedom was the point of the war .
Anybody questioning the invasion was ' soft on terror ' ( liberal ) or , in the case of the UN , ' in danger of losing its relevance ' .
When I was young , an eccentric uncle decided to teach me how to lie .
Not , he explained , because he wanted me to lie , but because he thought I should know how it 's done so I would recognise when I was being lied to .
I hope writers such as Rampton and Stauber and others may have the same effect and help to emasculate the culture of spin and dissembling that is overtaking our political establishments .

The scuffle occurred in Washington Square Park
Robin Hoods in action
The pranksters - from Sheffield in England - said they hoped their stunt would encourage New Yorkers to be more polite and " give something back " .
However , the plan reportedly back - fired after passers - by pushed and pulled at each other to grab the free cash .
Once the notes had been dispensed the trio made their getaway in a taxi .
The three men , who called themselves the Modern Day Robin Hoods , entered Manhattan 's Washington Square Park with a megaphone shouting : " What you are about to see will amaze you .
We are mad Englishmen . "
I got a nasty little scrape and my butt hurts from getting pushed down - I had to fight for my free money
Sally Caraballo
Daniel , a 6ft 6ins man dressed as Little John , who refused to give his surname , told the New York Post newspaper : " There 's a real lack of courtesy in the world .
" The world would be a better place if people were more courteous , but the English are very sceptical , so we decided to come to New York . "
Oliver , the group 's founder , said : " I want people to have a little more common courtesy towards their fellow human beings .
We hope this encourages people to give something back . "
The men then threw the $ 4,000 , made up of $ 1 , $ 5,$ 10 and $ 20 notes , into the air , sparking the frenzy .
Even children were reportedly stepped on , although no - one was seriously hurt .
" There were people pushing and people shoving , " Sally Caraballo told the newspaper .
" I got a nasty little scrape and my butt hurts from getting pushed down .
I had to fight for my free money .
But I got it in the end , " said the 38 - year - old .

I used to work for the computer helpdesk for a police force in northwest England , and it was there that I became infected with " Typistophobia , " as a result of a typist from a particular police station who suffered from a lack of any of the social graces .

My company develops an online education product for which we provide email and phone support .
A large amount of our users are first - year college students , many of which have little or no computer experience .
Our product requires that you use IE or Netscape and is not compatible with AOL 's browser .
This often causes some problems with our users as many of them subscribe to AOL .
This phone call had me laughing for a good half hour and most of the other support staff in tears .

One thing that really got to me before I was removed from phone support for sanity reasons , was customers who would n't read instructions , no matter how conspicuous you made them .
You could print directions on red paper and paste it on the software itself with 300 point type saying , " IMPORTANT : READ THIS ! " and people would still not read it .
We packaged our software with a piece of paper with " SOFTWARE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS " printed on the top , and one day a customer called me to ask how to install the software .
Me : " Sir , do you have the original packaging ? "
" Sir , do you have the original packaging ? " Customer : " Yeah , it 's here . "
" Yeah , it 's here . "
Me : " Can you find a piece of paper that says , ' Software Installation Instructions ' ? "

I worked for a company that provided billing and office management software to physicians ' offices .
Most of our users had dumb terminals with dial - up or dedicated lines that connected them to a stack of Unix systems at our facility .
One day , we received a call transferred from the front - line help desk .
The user was saying her enter key was n't working .
My co-worker and I were the support techs for the organization .
We took the call and found that when the user hit the enter key , the information was n't accepted , and the cursor simply moved one column to the right .
Now , the terminal hardware in the offices was rather old and prone to bizarre failure behavior .
Keyboards and logic controllers would die in very odd ways .
We went through our hardware troubleshooting procedures .
We confirmed that it was just this one key that was malfunctioning , and that the problem persisted when the keyboard was swapped out with another .
We tried checking keyboard mapping settings in the terminal and in the software she was using , but nothing worked .
Finally we monitored the serial data stream by hooking another terminal up to the inbound port on the multiplexer and placing it into " dump " mode .
As the user hit the troubled enter key , we saw a continuous line of hex 0x20's -- the ASCII space character .
At this point we were resolved to having to replace the whole terminal .
As we had no spares and were waiting on a shipment , we could n't do it for at least three days .
The user expressed concern at being without a functional terminal for that period .
We asked her to use the second enter key until we could fix the problem permanently .
The following dialog ensued :
Her : " What second enter key ? "
" What second enter key ? "
Me : " Over on the right hand side of the keyboard , there 's a number pad .
There should be an enter key over there that you can use . "
" Over on the right hand side of the keyboard , there 's a number pad .
There should be an enter key over there that you can use . "
Her : " Which one ? "
" Which one ? "
Me : " It should say ' Enter ' or have a crooked arrow pointing to the left , depending on the keyboard model .
It should look identical to the broken enter key . "
" It should say ' Enter ' or have a crooked arrow pointing to the left , depending on the keyboard model .
It should look identical to the broken enter key . "
Her : " There 's no key over there that looks the same . "
" There 's no key over there that looks the same . "
Me : " Well , what does the broken key say on it ? "
" Well , what does the broken key say on it ? "
Her : " It does n't say anything . "
" It does n't say anything . "
Me : " What does the broken enter key look like , exactly ? "
" What does the broken enter key look like , exactly ? "
Her : " It 's big and long , and it does n't have anything on it . "
" It 's big and long , and it does n't have anything on it . "
Me : " ...
And it 's the one at the bottom of the keyboard ? "
" ... And it 's the one at the bottom of the keyboard ? "
Her : " Yes , that 's it ! "
" Yes , that 's it ! "
Me : " And you say that every time you hit it , it just puts a space on the screen ? "
" And you say that every time you hit it , it just puts a space on the screen ? "
Her : " Yeah ! "
" Yeah ! "
Me : " That 's because you 're hitting the space bar . "
We heard a swift intake of breath , and then the user hung up .
Somehow , one day after years of working on the same software , with the same terminal , performing the same procedure , she decided that the space bar was the enter key .
We stared at each other for about five minutes after she hung up , utterly disbelieving that we did n't even think about checking to make sure the user was hitting the right key and even more disbelieving that in the nearly 45 minutes she was on the phone , it never occurred to her that the key marked ' enter ' might be the one she wanted .
Co-Worker : " I have a customer here who say 's he cannot access a specific record and gets kicked out of the program . "
" I have a customer here who say 's he cannot access a specific record and gets kicked out of the program . "
Me : " Ask him if he had any network problems lately . "
" Ask him if he had any network problems lately . "
Co -Worker : " I already asked the usual questions , but nothing works . "
During this conversation I found all the symptoms pointed to a server crash .
But my co-worker assured me that they have had no server problems whatsoever .
So I asked him to ask the customer to send a copy of the database for further examination .
Surely all the tell tale symptoms of a server crash would be there , and I joined my co-worker at his desk for the remainder of the conversation .
Co-Worker : " Sir , we believe you had a server crash that resulted in the database getting corrupted .
We 'll need the working database to correct the problem . "
" Sir , we believe you had a server crash that resulted in the database getting corrupted .

" We did n't have a server crash .

Co -Worker : " Sir , we have no indication that the program wrote any faulty data to the database .

Anything suspicious ?
Even trivial thoughts ? "

Customer : " No , nothing .........ehm...... I do n't think it is relevant but ...... someone turned the server switch off by mistake this morning , but he turned it back on really quickly so that can't have been the problem ....
Right ...? "
A gentleman with a western accent called up saying that he was not satisfied with our service and wished to cancel .
After telling him that he would need to call back during business hours and speak with customer service , I asked if there was anything I could do to make the service more satisfactory .
Customer : " Well , I 've had ya guys for months now , and still I can't get connected . "
" Well , I 've had ya guys for months now , and still I can't get connected . "
Tech Support : " Have you called us about this before ? "
" Have you called us about this before ? " Customer : " Well , yes , a couple of times . "
So I got his username and looked him up .
Sure enough , there were two tech logs under his name , so I read them briefly .
Virtually everything that could be checked had been checked .
Something about the way he was talking to me made me a little curious , so I continued to ask questions .
Tech Support : " From what I can tell , the techs have helped you double - check your settings and everything should be perfectly fine .
Do you use Netscape or Internet Explorer to connect ? "

Customer : " All right , I 'll try that , but I tell ya : ai n't nothin ' gonna happen . "
The customer never called back .
He also did not cancel his service the next day .
The whole call took just over an hour and a half and I was ready to pull my hair out at several points .
After the call , though , we were laughing over it for hours .
Tech Support : " Ok you should now see a small dialog box on your desktop . "
" Ok you should now see a small dialog box on your desktop . "
Customer : " I do n't see any box on my desktop . "

There 's no box on it , just the computer .
However I do have a small window at the top of my wall , but I do n't see anything that says ' ok ' .... "
Thinking quickly , I decided to palm the call off to one of our younger support technicians , deciding this would be the perfect " field trip " for him .
I told the customer we would have a technician drop by on site that afternoon to help him .
The following is what the unsuspecting young technician experienced .
The customer 's house appeared to be in the middle of nowhere : there was nothing but barren land for miles in all directions .
As he approached the house , he noticed a ring of cows , dogs , chickens , and pigs running loose and circling the house making an awful noise .
As he approached the house , he noticed a dead , half eaten animal near the front of the house .
Later , he learned , whenever the customer needed to feed his dogs , he would step outside and shoot a calf .
Entering the house , the young technician noticed a very large pet door in the door .
This was so the dogs and pigs could come and go as they pleased .
Inside the house was absolute filth .
Mud and grime covered the floor and the walls , pigs lay on the couch , and dogs sat on the recliner chairs .
The stench of filth was unbearable .
The customer took the technician to the back room , where the computer had been set up .
A chicken was nesting on top of the monitor and droppings were running down the side .
It was too much .
He ran , terrified out of his wits , and never looked back .
Later the tech called me from his home , where he was still trying to wash the stench from his clothes .
He had n't been in our ex-customer 's house for even five minutes , and his clothes were ruined .
I work for Microsoft as a certified Word Professional .
One day I received a call from a woman who had much difficulty explaining herself and even more difficulty understanding what I was asking of her .
Tech Support : " Ok , what version of word do you have ? "
" Ok , what version of word do you have ? "
Customer : " Virgin ! ? "
" Virgin ! ? " Tech Support : " No , no ... what VERSION do you have ? "
" No , no ... what VERSION do you have ? "
Customer : " Huh ? "
" Huh ? " Tech Support : " You know what ?
I do n't care .
Let 's move on . "
Pointless bickering and senseless rambling about her problem .
Tech Support : " And how often does this happen ? "
" And how often does this happen ? " Customer : " Well , it does n't happen all the time , but when it happens , it happens constantly . "
" Well , it does n't happen all the time , but when it happens , it happens constantly . "
Tech Support : " Uh huh . "
I had to hit the mute button to avoid letting her hear my agitated laughter .
The call lasted forty five minutes .
I began to think that she did n't really know what I was saying , nor had the intelligence to question why I had n't begun troubleshooting .
Then I had an idea .
Tech Support : " Well everything seems to be in good standing on your system .
Nice talking with you . "
" Well everything seems to be in good standing on your system .
Nice talking with you . "
Customer : " Oh , THANK YOU !!
Thank you very much ! " ( click )
I never really found out what her issue was .
Tech Support : " Ok sir , we 'll do a file search to find it .
Can you please click on Start , then Find , then - - "
" Ok sir , we 'll do a file search to find it .

Customer : " How do I do that ? "
A former professor of mine was receiving a Javascript error when trying to view a particular web page .
In trying to determine why he was having the trouble I asked what browser he was using .
Me : " You may have an older browser .
What browser are you using ? "

" Yes , but what browser ?

Him : " Office 97 . "
" Office 97 . " Me : " Office 97 is n't a browser though .
When you double click on the icon to connect to the Internet , it opens a program that lets you look at web sites on the Internet .
What program opens ?
Internet Explorer or Netscape ? "

I never did find out what browser he uses .

Great .
Great start to a call .
He wanted to install the Internet connection software we have , so I had him insert the CD .

There was no one on the line for a moment .
Then he spoke up again .
Customer : " I 've been holding ' ctrl ' and ' alt ' for the past two minutes , and nothing is happening at all on my whole damn computer , because you made me scratch the software . "

This woman calls in , having a problem with her video card .
Her initial rundown on the situation seems like she would know what she was talking about .
But no .

I sent a JPEG from my recent vacation to my mother as an email attachment .
I then telephoned her to see if she was able to view it .
After attempting to get her to use the ' File / Open ' command in Netscape , I realized that my ' Open ' dialog was different from hers , and so I could n't talk her through it .
But I tried to determine which OS she was running .
Me : " Do you know what operating system you 're running ?
Is it Windows 95 or Windows 3.1 ? "

So I spent a nice chunk of time walking him through downloading Netscape and the Plugin Pack and rebooting .

I got a call from an older lady who stated that after installing our software , her mouse would not work .
After further questioning , I learned that she got a message when booting the system that a device was not found .
I had her power off the PC , disconnect , and then reconnect the mouse .
After rebooting , the mouse functioned fine .
But instead of thanking me , she asked me sourly , " Why did your software unplug my mouse ? "
I attempted to explain to the lady that that was not possible and that all it was was a loose connection .
It was n't good enough for her .
She put her husband on , who asked , " Why did your software decide my computer did n't need a mouse ? "
Again , trying to explain the loose connection was of little use , and he wanted another number to call to return the software .

My boss sent an update of our current program via modem to all of our online customers , with instructions to call in and be walked through the upgrade if they needed it .
He had to leave the office for a few hours , so he gave me instructions on how to start the upgrade once they had downloaded it .
I got a call while he was away .
Details you should know : the lady who called me for instructions was not the person who was operating the computer .
That person was on the other side of the room , and everything had to be relayed through the lady on the phone .
For reasons of brevity , I wo n't bother typing out every sentence being repeated several times back and forth .
Customer : " We got your program , along with a note that we were supposed to call ...? "

But she got the same error .
Tech Support : " All right , let 's make sure the program is installed in the right directory .
Could you take a look in the directory tree and let me know what you find in --"
" All right , let 's make sure the program is installed in the right directory .

Customer : " Oh no , everything went fine .

Sigh .
Someone had transferred the download to disk in order to install it on a second computer , handed it to her , and told her to call us .
Apparently it never occurred to her to get the program on the computer somehow before calling .

Country music blares .
The rest of the conversation takes place shouting over it .
Customer : " Heck son , I do n't believe it !
What was the problem ? "
" Heck son , I do n't believe it !
What was the problem ? "
Tech Support : " The batteries must be dead . "
I used to work as a salesman for a computer wholesaler a number of years ago .
I got a call from a woman who was fit to be tied .
She found out that the person who sold her the computer bought it from our company and called us to complain .
Customer : " I need help with this computer ! "
" I need help with this computer ! " Tech Support : " Well what do you need to know ? "
" Well what do you need to know ? " Customer : ( screaming )
" Well I bought this damn computer from this guy who says he bought it from you and he came to my house and hooked it up .
Now while he 's explaining to my daughter how to use it , she 's telling him ' yeah , yeah , ' she knows what he 's talking about .
I'm in the kitchen cooking peppers and onions while my daughter is going ' yeah , yeah , ' then this guy leaves , and I ask my daughter if she knows how to use the computer , and she says she was too embarrassed to tell him she did n't understand and just told him ' yeah , yeah . '
Now I paid over $ 1000 for this thing and I do n't even know how to use it ! "

Tech Support : " Uh , well is there anything in particular you want to know how to do ? "
I never anticipated her answer .

Customer : " I do n't know anything about computers , I was frying sausages in the kitchen ... "
She tells me the whole story again .
Tech Support : " Well , you would need to lean how to program in a computer language like C++ and that takes many years of experience .
I 'd suggest you first start slowly and learn DOS and Windows . "
After that , I spent twenty minutes talking her down from a seething boil to a cool simmer and finally got her off the phone .
I imagine this woman aggravated the poor slob who sold her the computer until he caved in and gave her our number .
Nice guy .
Customer : " Look , look !!!!!

A user calls from Chicago .
( We are in central Illinois . )
She wants to register for classes via our online registration system .
In the course of the discussion I discover that :
She is definitely " Not A Computer Person " ( tm ) .
She is at her friend 's house , but her friend is not there .
Her friend has a computer , but she does n't know what kind .
She has never turned it on .
She thinks it has a modem , but she is not sure .
She has never logged on to any of her university accounts .
She has never used any terminal software and does n't know what type her friend has .
She was deeply upset that " no one will help her . "
Sadly , I was also unable to do so .
I mean , what do you do ?
I once received a call from a woman with a heavy , throaty , not - real - educated - or - bright voice from New York .
She asked if the ...

" Ok . " Tech Support : " Now , move the cursor to that blank line . "
" Now , move the cursor to that blank line . "
Customer : " I do n't understand what you mean . "
I spent about ten minutes trying to navigate him to the beginning of the blank line so that he can type in a single line of text .
He seemed to completely lack comprehension .
The man understood English , but there was something he seemed to be failing to grasp .
Tech Support : [ getting frustrated and barely keeping calm ]
" Now , right below the words ' [ etc etc etc ] ' is a blank line . "
[ getting frustrated and barely keeping calm ]

Tech Support : " Sir , open up your System Folder and find the Launcher Items folder . "
" Sir , open up your System Folder and find the Launcher Items folder . "
Customer : " I do n't have a Systems Folder . "
My patience with such customers was wearing thin .
After a short pause :
Tech Support : " It 's in your hard disk , sir .
You must have one , or else your computer would n't start properly . "
" It 's in your hard disk , sir .
You must have one , or else your computer would n't start properly . "

" Hard disk , hard disk ... hmmm -- is that little rectangle in the top right ? "

" Ok , but mine does n't say ' Hard Disk . '

Tech Support : " Open your System Folder . "
" Open your System Folder . "
Customer : " I do n't have a systems folder .
Oh , oh , here it is !
Ok , ok , I 'm opening the Systems Envelope now . "
And after an excruciating 30 minutes of how to make an alias and reminding him that he truly did have a System Folder ( or , as he called it , an " Envelope " ) and where it was , we got his new software on the Launcher .
Ten minutes later he called me back and told me how he had written down my directions to the " Systems Envelope " so he could put more programs on his Launcher .
One of the programs did n't work , however , and after another 45 minutes of sheer hell , I told him we needed to send him some new floppies .
Customer : " Hey , can you send me a dozen apples too ?
My wife would like to make a pie .
Ha ha !
Apples .
Get it ?
Macintoshes ?
Ha ha .
Do n't you get it ? "
If I had a button on my phone to administer electro - shock to this man , I would have .

Researchers report that when mice with Alzheimer 's Disease are placed in a mentally stimulating environment , they outperform mice without the disease in an environment that is less challenging .
Scientists at the Byrd Alzheimer 's Research Institute in Tampa , Florida completed the research .
If extended to people with the disease , the findigs assert that living a life full of mentally challenging activities can slow and even protect against the development of Alzheimer 's disease .
" What we are seeing in this research is that mice having the same characteristics as humans with Alzheimer 's are able to perform well , even at the same level as mice without Alzheimer 's , if housed in a mentally challenging , cognitively enriched environment .
The mental stimulation provided in this environment appears to stymie mental impairment .
After months of mental stimulation , it was impossible to differentiate these mice from the behaviorally normal , healthy mice , " said Huntington Potter , Ph.D. , investigator on the project and chief executive officer of the Byrd Research Institute .
Potter said this successful Alzheimer 's mouse experiment will be tested in Alzheimer 's patients and that sessions of mentally stimulating activities would be given on a regular basis .
It is hoped that such cognitive stimulation will stabilize or even improve the memory function of Alzheimer 's patients .
"
If individuals with Alzheimer 's can benefit from living in a cognitively enriched environment , then these individuals could live fuller , longer and more productive lives , " said Potter .
A high level of mental activity throughout life has been suggested to lower the risk of Alzheimer 's disease , but it is impossible to assess the preventative potential of environmental enrichment in a controlled clinical study .
The research done at the Byrd Alzheimer 's Institute tackled this question by using Alzheimer 's mice in a well - controlled , blind study .
The experiments showed that the Alzheimer 's mice living in the enriched environment outperformed those in standard housing when tested at an older age .
The treated mice also were behaviorally indistinguishable from the mice without the Alzheimer 's disease .
The Byrd Alzheimer 's Research Institute is based at the University of South Florida in Tampa .
The National Institutes of Health recently designated the Byrd Alzheimer 's Institute and USF as Florida 's Alzheimer 's Disease Research Center .

In the few years since I ’ve become a homeowner , I ’ve had to deal with a long list of problems , including issues with our foundation , roof , and sewer .
That ’s not too surprising given that our house is nearly 100 years old — and both the original builders and previous owners clearly made some bad decisions .
Indeed , part of what causes me grief is simply not knowing exactly how the house was put together or modified .
Had I been in the market for a house at the time mine was constructed , I might well have decided to leave nothing to chance by building my own house from a kit purchased by mail order from Sears Roebuck & Co .
Along with clothes , housewares , toys , and tools , Sears catalogs in the early 20th century featured entire houses .
For well under $ 1000 for a basic model , you could purchase a complete kit for a house — including everything from the lumber to the nails and paint — that you ’d assemble yourself ( with the help of family and friends ) or hire a contractor to assemble for you .
Mail Me a House
Sears had been selling building materials by mail order since 1895 , but they ’d found it unprofitable .
In 1908 , in an effort to revitalize that business , they began offering plans and kits for houses .
In addition to featuring them in their general catalog , Sears offered a separate catalog just for houses : the Book of Modern Homes and Building Plans .
Although I ’ve read several different accounts of prices that first year , one source ( The Houses That Sears Built : Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Sears Catalog Homes by Rosemary Thornton ) mentions a range from $ 495 to $ 4,115 — equivalent to roughly $ 14,000 to $ 113,000 in today ’s dollars .
A customer placed an order , and within as little as two weeks , the 30,000 or so pieces of the new home arrived in two boxcars at the train station nearest the house ’s intended destination .
( Transporting the materials to the building site was the customer ’s problem . )
Each kit came with a 75 - page instruction manual , and by all accounts the instructions were excellent , even for people without extensive construction experience .
Because Sears had already built a solid reputation as a mail - order supplier , their new business took off rapidly .
In 1911 , Sears even began offering its own mortgages .
The applications asked how much money the borrower could pay up front and per-month , as well as the person ’s occupation , but required no further documentation .
For all practical purposes , if you had a job , you got a mortgage .
In 1915 , Sears made another innovation : thanks to the two lumber mills Sears was now running , the kits featured pre-cut lumber , with every piece already fitted .
That change significantly reduced construction time and made the houses an even better value .
Ups and Downs
Although Sears never claimed to be a trendsetter , they certainly took advantage of the latest building innovations .
What made Sears Modern Homes modern was the use of new building materials such as drywall and asphalt shingles and the option to include amenities such as electricity , indoor plumbing , and central heating , all of which were somewhat novel for typical residences of the time .
Throughout the 1920s , housing sales brought tremendous profits to Sears .
But when the Depression hit , large numbers of homeowners defaulted on their easy Sears mortgages , and the company lost millions of dollars .
In the years that followed , housing sales dropped considerably .
By 1940 , Sears realized the business was not sustainable and reluctantly stopped selling their catalog homes .
Sears claims to have sold over 100,000 houses in 447 styles between 1908 and 1940 , and some estimates put the number as high as 110,000 , but the actual figure may have been closer to 75,000 .
All the company ’s records pertaining to house sales were destroyed in the 1940s , so the number may never be known for sure .
Regardless ,
Sears sold a significant number of their catalog homes , many of which are still standing today .

Sears was not the first company to offer consumers kits to build complete houses , but they sold more units , in a wider variety of styles , than any of their competitors and are the best - known mail - order house retailer .
Even in the Sears Modern Homes era , though , kits were n’t the only way to obtain an easy - to - build house .
Prefabricated houses were available as far back as the mid-19th century , and continue to be sold today .
To create a prefab house , factories typically preassemble entire walls , trusses , and other major components and ship them to the construction site , where builders put them together — a much simpler and quicker process than building everything from scratch or even from a kit .
Because these modules are built in quantity on an assembly line , costs are lower .
Of course , buyers still pay a premium over the simple , pre-cut pieces ; customers must choose from a limited range of sizes and designs ; and prefab houses ca n’t be used on certain kinds of lots .
Be that as it may , the idea of catalog homes keeps cropping up in new forms .
For example , Swedish home - furnishings giant IKEA sells their own houses in several European countries , with designs that sound like a cross between the Sears kits and fully prefabricated houses .
Although IKEA supplies all the components in a form that can be assembled relatively easy , they ’re not consumer - friendly kits .
The houses require assembly by contractors ( and considerably more tools than an Allen wrench ) ; the idea is that they ’ll be sold in much the same way as conventional houses , but at considerably lower cost because of their standardized , modular design and lower construction costs .
And yet they ’ll be attractive and trendy , much like the furniture IKEA hopes you ’ll buy to fill your new home .
( Other companies , including Finland ’s Artichouse , also offer kit homes in Europe .
In North America , prefabricated homes are often constructed using SIPs — structural insulated panels . )
One thing Sears could n’t include in their kits , of course , was real estate , and empty parcels of land are quite a bit harder to come by now than they were a century ago .
In addition , modern building codes are stricter than they once were , and mortgage applications are just a wee bit more complex .
For these and many other reasons , catalog houses like those Sears once sold are unlikely to make a comeback .
But it was a great idea while it lasted , and you never know — someone just might come up with a way to recycle it .
Note :
This is an updated version of an article that originally appeared on Interesting Thing of the Day on November 13 , 2006 .
The Atlantic | May 2003
IT came to me recently in a blinding vision that I am an apatheist .
Well , " blinding vision " may be an overstatement .
" Wine - induced haze " might be more strictly accurate .
This was after a couple of glasses of merlot , when someone asked me about my religion .
" Atheist , " I was about to say , but I stopped myself .
" I used to call myself an atheist , " I said , " and I still do n't believe in God , but the larger truth is that it has been years since I really cared one way or another .
I 'm " -- that was when it hit me -- " an ... apatheist ! "
That got a chuckle , but the point was serious .
Apatheism -- a disinclination to care all that much about one 's own religion , and an even stronger disinclination to care about other people 's -- may or may not be something new in the world , but its modern flowering , particularly in ostensibly pious America , is worth getting excited about .
Apatheism concerns not what you believe but how .
In that respect it differs from the standard concepts used to describe religious views and people .
Atheism , for instance , is not at all like apatheism ; the hot - blooded atheist cares as much about religion as does the evangelical Christian , but in the opposite direction .
" Secularism " can refer to a simple absence of devoutness , but it more accurately refers to an ACLU - style disapproval of any profession of religion in public life -- a disapproval that seems puritanical and quaint to apatheists .
Tolerance is a magnificent concept , John Locke 's inestimable gift to all mankind ; but it assumes , as Locke did , that everyone brims with religious passions that everyone else must work hard to put up with .
And agnostics ?
True , most of them are apatheists , but most apatheists are not agnostics .
Because -- and this is an essential point -- many apatheists are believers .
In America , as Thomas Byrne Edsall reported in these pages recently , the proportion of people who say they never go to church or synagogue has tripled since 1972 , to 33 percent in 2000 .
Most of these people believe in God ( professed atheists are very rare in the United States ) ; they just do n't care much about him .
They do care a bit ; but apatheism is an attitude , not a belief system , and the over - riding fact is that these people are relaxed about religion .
Even regular churchgoers can , and often do , rank quite high on the apatheism scale .
There are a lot of reasons to attend religious services : to connect with a culture or a community , to socialize , to expose children to religion , to find the warming comfort of familiar ritual .
The softer denominations in America are packed with apatheists .
The apatheism of Reform Jews is so well known as to be a staple of synagogue humor .
( Orthodox rabbi to Reform rabbi : " One of my congregants says his son wants a Harley for his bar mitzvah .
What 's a Harley ? "
Reform rabbi to Orthodox rabbi : " A Harley is a motorcycle .
What 's a bar mitzvah ? " )
Finally , and this may seem strangest of all , even true - believing godliness today often has an apatheistic flavor .
I have Christian friends who organize their lives around an intense and personal relationship with God , but who betray no sign of caring that I am an unrepentantly atheistic Jewish homosexual .
They are exponents , at least , of the second , more important part of apatheism : the part that does n't mind what other people think about God .
I BELIEVE that the rise of apatheism is to be celebrated as nothing less than a major civilizational advance .
Religion , as the events of September 11 and after have so brutally underscored , remains the most divisive and volatile of social forces .
To be in the grip of religious zeal is the natural state of human beings , or at least of a great many human beings ; that is how much of the species seems to be wired .
Apatheism , therefore , should not be assumed to represent a lazy recumbency , like my collapse into a soft chair after a long day .
Just the opposite : it is the product of a determined cultural effort to discipline the religious mindset , and often of an equally determined personal effort to master the spiritual passions .
It is not a lapse .
It is an achievement .
" A world of pragmatic atheists , " the philosopher Richard Rorty once wrote , " would be a better , happier world than our present one . "
Perhaps .
But best of all would be a world generously leavened with apatheists : people who feel at ease with religion even if they are irreligious ; people who may themselves be members of religious communities , but who are neither controlled by godly passions nor concerned about the ( nonviolent , noncoercive ) religious beliefs of others .
In my lifetime America has taken great strides in this direction , and its example will be a source of strength , not weakness , in a world still beset by fanatical religiosity ( al Qaeda ) and tyrannical secularism ( China ) .
Ronald Reagan used to insist that he was religious even though , as President , he hardly ever entered a church .
It turns out he was in good company .
Those Americans who tell pollsters they worship faithfully ?
Many of them are lying .
John G. Stackhouse Jr. , a professor of theology and culture , wrote recently in American Outlook magazine , " Beginning in the 1990s , a series of sociological studies has shown that many more Americans tell pollsters that they attend church regularly than can be found in church when teams actually count . "
In fact , he says , actual churchgoing may be at little more than half the professed rate .
A great many Americans , like their fortieth President , apparently care about religion enough to say they are religious , but not enough to go to church .
You can snicker at Reagan and the millions of others like him ; you can call them hypocrites if you like .
I say , God bless them , every one .
" We are in a world today where we have a non -state actor using all the tools of weaponry ...
That ’s what this new 21st - century warfare is going to look like .
We have now entered an era where non-states or quasi-states do a lot better militarily than states do . "
Peter Singer ( Brookings , author of " Corporate Warriors " ) in reference to Hezbollah 's performance against the Israeli military .
From a NYTimes article by Thom Shanker .
Although Peter Singer 's statement is likely unsupported , he does stumble onto a conclusion that captures the essence of the moment .
Hezbollah 's performance in a set - piece battle with the Israeli military ( arguably once , a top notch conventional military ) is an excellent example of how non-state groups have radically improved their ability to conduct tactical and strategic operations .
To wit , the continued success of its efforts has put the Israelis on the horns of a dilemma : either request a ceasefire that locks in military defeat - or - push for a full invasion of southern Lebanon ( each are fraught with disastrous consequences ) .
Organizational Improvements
The central secret to Hezbollah 's success is that it trained its ( global ) guerrillas to make decisions autonomously ( classic 4GW ) , at the small group level .
In every area -- from firing rockets to defending prepared positions to media routing around jamming / disruption -- we have examples of Hezbollah teams deciding , adapting , innovating , and collaborating without reference to any central authority .
The result of this decentralization is that Hezbollah 's aggregate decision cycles are faster and qualitatively better than those of their Israeli counterparts .
Hybrid Methods / Systems
Ancillary to the improvements in organizational design ( unlikely to be replicated at the state level ) , Hezbollah also demonstrated its ability to supercharge antiquated conventional weaponry / tactics with off - the - shelf technology to create weapons systems and hybrid tactics attuned to defeating Israeli military systems .
We can expect to see this behavior accelerate among non-state groups as readily available commercial technology continues its pace of radical improvement .
Extracting an Economic Toll
Hezbollah 's success against Israel codifies two strategic methods that we will see global guerrillas emulate .
The first is the value of strategic coercion through economic attrition .
Ongoing disruption of the Israeli economy through rocket attacks attaches a quantifiable strategic cost to the conflict .
This offensive decisively couples what was previously separate : ground / air offensives by the Israeli military against non-state groups in the West Bank , Gaza , and Lebanon -- and -- domestic economic / social activity in Israel ( business as usual ) .
If Hezbollah remains intact , nothing will be the same .
With the economic clock ticking ( to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a day ) , Israel has been forced into an aggressive air campaign to accelerate progress on the ground against missile launch sites and interdict resupply of new missiles from Syria .
This air campaign has backfired due to the asymmetry of targets , in that Israeli air strikes have alienated the Lebanese government and increased the moral cohesion of its foes .
Leveraging force protection and an aversion to casualties
A second strategic method is to trade territory ( something a non-state organization is easily able to ante up ) for the blood of professional soldiers and delay .
The intent is demonstrated by Hezbollah 's dispersal of units across a wide geographic area in small autonomous units ( defense in depth , rather than concentrating its defenses along the border ) .
This deployment clearly shows Hezbollah 's willingness to trade ground for the lives of Israeli soldiers and time .
It succeeds by leveraging the aversion to casualties and dedication to force protection found in modern Western militaries ( these men are professionally educated and therefore considered too valuable for use as cannon fodder ) .
An aversion to casualties ensures that assaults by conventional militaries will bog down if faced with stiff opposition , until intense applications of firepower to clear the path ( which is made much less effective due to Hezbollah 's high level of dispersion and fortifications ) .
Time is a factor that clearly works particularly in the favor of Hezbollah ( due to the potential of a widening conflict ) and more generally in favor of any non-state group fighting a state .
Robot tadpole sex might help shed light on how our early ancestors evolved backbones .
The distant forebears of humans and other vertebrates were much squashier than their descendants .
They possessed flexible rods known as notochords that served as primitive backbones , but no vertebrae .
Scientists think vertebrae evolved to help our ancient predecessors swim more powerfully by stiffening the body so attached muscles could generate more force .
" The fossil record shows vertebrae evolved independently at least four separate times .
That shows they must really be functionally important , " said vertebrate physiologist John Long at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie , N.Y .
To test this idea , Long and his colleagues built robot fish with backbones of varying strength to simulate extinct animals .
They then " mated " the best swimmers to see how generations of " offspring " evolved to swim better .
Robotic mating
The robot tadpoles [ image ] are called " Tadros . "
They were modeled after swimming creatures that still have notochords , the larvae of marine animals known as sea squirts .
Each Tadro had a single electronic eye , a motor , a computerized brain that controlled its motions , and tails made of gelatin of different lengths and stiffness .
The robots had bodies between six and seven inches long , with tails two to four inches long , and swam along the surface .
The scientists raced three robots in eight - foot - diameter fish tanks , each zooming to and swimming around a light suspended above the tank .
After seeing which fish swam best , the research team " mated " them using computer simulations that modeled the genetic mixing that occurs during sex to produce the next generation of Tadro tails .
The best swimmer was given the greatest mating success and chance to pass along its traits , while poorer swimmers had less luck .
After 10 generations , Long and his colleagues found that as swimming performances improved , stiffer tails evolved .
" One thing vertebrates really brought to scene were large , fast , active animals , and this part of the anatomy has a direct connection with that , " Long said .
However , Long added their analysis showed increasing tail stiffness accounted for only 40 percent of the improvement in swimming performance , meaning other factors are involved , such as how well the tail turns .
" We plan to investigate what that next 60 percent is , " Long told LiveScience .
Enter the predator
In addition , the researchers plan on adding a " predator " into the tank during the swimming competition to see how Tadro tails evolve then .
This hunter will attempt to collide with the robots , while the Tadros will try to avoid it .
This next generation of Tadros will detect the predator using infrared sensors that mimic the pressure - sensitive organs of fish , known as lateral lines .
" We also plan not just on making the backbone stiffer , but on putting in vertebrae , to make them bend , to have joints , and see how that changes things , " Long said .
Long and his colleagues reported their findings online Nov. 17 via the Journal of Experimental Biology .
Dictionnaire des noms de couleurs
Le dictionnaire des noms de couleurs regroupe 589 noms de couleurs dont 456 sont consultables à ce jour .
Plusieurs classements sont proposés .

Rappelez - vous que chaque nom est cliquable et vous permet d'accéder à une fiche détaillée .
Les classements disponibles aujourd ' hui sont les suivants :
Au sujet des noms de couleurs
Dans le milieu industriel , les nuanciers associent des noms précis à des teintes bien déterminées , pour assurer la reproductibilité , la constance de la couleur d'un produit .
Dans le langage courant par contre , un nom ne correspond pas à une teinte précise : le nom ne donne qu'une indication générale sur la couleur qu'il désigne .
On imagine aisément qu'un bleu azur désigne la couleur d'un ciel dégagé mais de nombreux bleus pourraient correspondre , d'un bleu clair à un bleu presque indigo .
Malgré son apparente précision , la couleur d'un fruit ou d'un légume demeure approximative , car la teinte peut varier suivant l'espèce ou le degré de maturité .
Comme le dit la chanson : " le vert du poireau , est - il en bas ?
Est - il en haut ? " ( Frida , Sanseverino ) .
Cependant , le nom donne souvent des informations visuelles autres que celle d'une simple couleur , comme par exemple la brillance , la transparence ou la matité .
Ainsi , un jaune doré induit - il une idée de chaleur ou de brillance , tandis qu'un jaune ambré - bien que pouvant désigner la même teinte , implique plutôt une idée de transparence .
De plus , l'emploi d'un nom de couleur va donner une connotation qui n'a rien à voir avec la perception visuelle : un sentiment , une impression auditive ou gustative par exemple .
Selon que des lèvres seront rouge cerise ou rouge feu , on leur prêtera dans un cas une idée de jeunesse printanière , dans l'autre , celle d'une forte passion .
Utilisé dans un texte , le nom d'une couleur joue donc un rôle qui va bien au - delà de l'indication de teinte .
C'est pour essayer de traduire toute cette richesse que les fiches de ce dictionnaire vous proposent généralement non pas un mais plusieurs échantillons de teinte associée ( cliquez dessus afin de révéler un dégradé ) , ainsi que les connotations portées par le nom de la couleur .
Une attention particulière a également été apportée au choix des photos , qui traduisent bien mieux la complexité d'une couleur qu'un simple aplat d'échantillon .

Have you updated your buzzwords ?
You may think you 're appropriately buzzword - compliant , but this is internet time , baby , and last month 's 2.0 buzzwords are outdated ( but not in that retro- cool way ) .
If you 're doing a VC pitch and building to flip , it 's crucial that you sound as current as possible .
Listen and learn :
Web 2.0
Web 2.01ß
Bonus points : mentioning " yellow fade " and " attenuation " in the same sentence could be worth an extra million .
This month , anyway .
Grand prize : just as the hipster PDA made low - tech cool again , feigning ignorance of Web 2.x is the new black .
My take : Some of the coolest people have no frickin ' clue what these buzzwords mean , and do n't care .
They are n't building to flip , they 're building to engage and inspire .
That does n't mean throwing the user - driven baby out with the Web 2.x bathwater -- there 's some really useful stuff in there ( people genuinely LOVE FlickR and del.icio.us , for example ) .
But these Web 2.x buzzwords are more technology and business - model focused than user focused , and that 's a recipe for building things that meet the checklist but fail the users .
Where there is passion , there are users kicking ass .
If we want to build Web 2.x and beyond , we should be thinking less about how to upgrade our technology , and more about how to help upgrade our users ' brains , bodies , and spirits .
Yes , I realize that many -- even most -- of the Web 2.x buzzwords can lead to meaningful ( in some cases profound ) benefits for the users .
But the emphasis still feels technology - driven , not user - kicking - ass - driven .
Why not rewrite these buzzwords in terms of what they mean for users ?
For example , we know that " harnessing collective intelligence " is good ... but why ?
I do n't necessarily want you " harnessing " my anything , unless ... unless it means I benefit from the result .
And of course , that 's the point -- that end - users can benefit from all that group wisdom , like Amazon reviews or delicious / popular tags , to help reduce the flood of data .
So why not say it like that ?
Instead of calling it " harnessing collective intelligence " , why not call it " helping users make smarter choices , more quickly , by accessing the knowledge , experience , and wisdom of a larger group ? "
If the focus is on the " harnessing " and not on the " so users can access ... " the chances of building something that nobody actually wants goes up .
( Of course , my variation of the buzzword is awkward , ungainly , and not likely to look good on a slide .
But I 'm sure other more creative people can make them snappier : )
We know that Ajax is good , but why ?
If it 's about richer user experiences , then say so .
And why stop there ?
What 's the benefit to the user of that richer experience ?
And is that always a benefit ?
And what does the cloud do for users ?
What does attenuation do for me ?
If it 's about helping users reduce stress , or spend more time in flow , or have more fun , etc .... whatever it is , why not say that ?
A buzz - phrase should explictly state how it directly benefits the user .
If I were a VC , the " elevator pitch " I 'd ask for would be simply : " Tell me how this thing helps the user kick ass ? "
If you can't answer that , do n't bother launching your power point .

You 're grasp on the concepts in the cartoons above is stunningly lucid --- and hilarious .
I see the high falutent buzzwords as Creator / Operator lingo that holds power like the esoteric language of physics .
And the softer , user - friendly phrases , as laymen explanations .
That obviously are for the viewer and do n't hold as much mysterious sound of excitation that is somewhat required to inspire financiers and creators .
Its like why the military lingo is strung with extremely long acronyms .
Nobody wants to stand there and spout of unecessary explanations ... theres nothing like frank lingo on another level .
Or something .
Surely you had to put all of your thoughts into a context and you have done very well .
Thank you for updating my buzzwords .
Sincerely ,

Bloody right .
As an old - school developer , I have to laugh at a lot of the buzzwords .
For a few reasons :
( A ) a lot of the buzzword - tossing is an " I 'm more geek than you " alpha - male p*ssing contest .
It is n't really about building better apps or making users happier .
It 's either about ( as you state ) impressing the people with the VC money , or trying to get that hottie geek - girl to sleep with you .
Which is fine , but I 'm unimpressed .
( B ) all this newfangled AJAX stuff is just solving the same problems we old fogies have been solving for decades now .
How do you build * useful * apps ( rather than just " cool " ones ) ?
How do you deliver lots of information without overwhelming the user ?
How do you maintain data concurrency ?
How do you maintain semantic content as well as informational content ( what it MEANS as well as what it IS ) ?
None of this is new ; it just has new buzzwords .
For all the young hotshots out there that feel like they 're cutting edge because they 're up on Ruby on Rails , they should be humbled to remember that people were solving the same problem in * COBOL * , fergawdssake .
It 's just new buzzwords , not new problems .
and finally , the most important one of all for tech people to remember ( and the most often overlooked ) :
( C ) all of the most important and difficult problems are HUMAN problems , not technological problems .
Sure , tagging information with metadata is great , but who 's going to do it ?
Unless people take the time and effort to tag their info , how useful is a tag framework ?
How do you convince people that it 's really worth the work ?
IS it really worth the work ?
That 's why all of the " Web 2.0 " stuff leaves me very unimpressed .
Nobody 's working on solving the really HARD , really IMPORTANT problems ( like how can we use computers and information networks to make our lives more productive and fun ) and everyone 's focusing on the trivial technical details ( like which XML microdialect should we use to tag this content ) .
People are definitely overlooking the forest for the trees .
Meet the new boss -- same as the old boss .

What does it actually cost ?
When we built DropSend , it was our first enterprise level web app and I had no way to predict how much it would cost to build .
Frustratingly , no one would share their figures with me either .
So we had to learn the hard way .
Yuck .
In order to help you avoid this pain , I ’m going to walk you through , step - by - step , the costs involved in building an enterprise web app , on a budget .
I ’m going to be 100 % honest about what we spent so you ’ll have a good idea of what kind of budget you ’ll need to set .
What ’s the big deal ?
Why is it only recently that small companies ( Carson Systems is only two full time employees and a set of 3 part - time freelancers ) are able to build large scale web apps ?
Here ’s why :
Broadband is widespread so your potential audience is larger Average people are comfortable with web apps ( Gmail , Online banking , etc ) Hardware is dirt cheap Open source platforms are virtually free
Definition of the terms
As I ’m talking about " Building enterprise web apps on a budget " , I need to define two things :
" Enterprise " - This is debatable , but I ’d define it as a mass market product for 1,000 + users " On a budget " - Under £ 30,000
I ’ve heard some comments about my £ 30 K figure not being " on a budget " .
Please keep in mind that this article is aimed at small companies , not freelancers .
Most small companies will be able to allocate £ 30 K , over a period of time .
It may be possible to bring an enterprise web app to market for less than this , but it will probably be lacking in quality .
DropSend - Enterprise and on a budget
I ’d better know what I ’m talking about , if I ’m offering advice , right ?!
Well , all of this advice is based on us building DropSend , a truly enterprise level web app that was built on a budget :
Here ’s a bit about it :
Used for sending and storing large files that you ca n’t email
13,083 worldwide users ( March 6 , 2006 ) and growing
6 servers at 365 Main
Desktop apps which use our API
Built using PHP , AJAX , MySQL and Linux
The most important thing
Before you get started , the most important thing is to make sure your idea is financially viable .
How can you do this ?
Use common sense .
Would you actually get out your credit card and pay for it ?
Be cautious about your projections and then cut by a further 45 % .

How to build your team on a budget
One of the most expensive parts to building a web app is the team .
Here are some of our tips for keeping your costs down :
Do n’t go for rock stars - go for quiet talent .
They ’re cheaper , more fun to work with , and they ’ll actually listen to you .
If someone is too expensive , but you really want to work with them , offer them 2 - 5 % of the product equity in exchange for a cheaper price .
Ask your friends to recommend people they trust .
If you pick a bad apple , it will cost you time and money .
Outsource .
We tried India initially , and it proved to be a disaster .
I think this was because I had never managed a project long - distance before .
If you already feel comfortable with this , it can save you tons of money .
Scalability on a budget
One of the trickiest parts of building an enterprise web app on a budget , is scaling .
How can you start with a little bit of hardware / capacity / CPU / backup and scale infinitely ?
Here ’s what I ’d recommend : Do n’t start worrying about that until you have to .
If you throw a bunch of money at the problem and your app fails , you might as well have burned the cash at the race track .
For DropSend , we almost bought a bunch of IBM Blades and hooked them up to SAN storage .
I ’m SO glad we did n’t go this route .
So here are three basic tips regarding scalability on a budget :
Buy just enough hardware to launch Build your app so it easily scales .
DropSend is a great example of this .
When we need more diskspace , we just add a line to the config file , plug in another box , re-deploy , and BAM , we ’ve got more diskspace .
Plan for scaling , but do n’t obsess
Next time …
In Part 2 of this article , I ’ll be covering :

Thanks for reading .
I hope we ’ve saved you some of the pain and suffering we went through when we built DropSend .
On a side note , I ’ve just finished 37 signals new book Getting Real , and it ’s got some more excellent ideas on how to build on a budget .
As always , feel free to agree or disagree below .

The political hubbub that greeted Jack Straw 's comments on the veil seems to have inspired a new continental fashion .
Latest to join the fray is the Dutch government , which in the run-up to tomorrow 's general election announced plans to ban the wearing of the burka and face veil in public .
By doing so , it has raised what is becoming a Europe - wide campaign to a new level of authoritarianism .
Naima Azough , a Dutch Green MP , points out that the ban would apply to fewer than 100 women .
" This did n't come from public pressure , " she says , " but was initiated by the immigration minister , Rita Verdonk , whose Liberal - Conservative party is scrambling for far - right votes . "
The result will simply reinforce the perception of Muslims that they will never be accepted in Dutch society .
In Italy , the debate has been raging since the prime minister , Romano Prodi , was asked to comment on Straw 's views .
That followed a farcical TV show in which a rightwing MP , Daniela Santanchè , clashed with the imam of a Milan mosque on the subject .
Santanchè has since been under police protection , convinced that the imam's statement that she did n't have the knowledge to comment on Islam amounted to a fatwa against her .
" The veil is at best worn by 50 women in the whole country , " says Hamza Ricardo Piccardo , spokesperson of the Italian Muslim Council , " and people in the street just do n't care . "
Of course , the dress code of Muslim women was making headlines across Europe long before Straw weighed in .
The wearing of the headscarf by teachers is already forbidden in schools in several German states .
In Belgium , the minister - president of the Walloon - Brussels region last year authorised state schools to ban the headscarf .
The result has been the creation of ghettoised schools .
In each European country , veil mania seems to follow a similar pattern : a public statement by a prominent politician results in a frenzied political and media response , conveniently diverting attention away from unpopular government policies or political crises .
France provided the political laboratory .
In April 2003 , the headscarf row came out of nowhere ; within a year it had been outlawed in state schools .
No serious demands to ban the headscarf had ever come from teaching bodies , students or the public .
It simply was n't seen as a problem before April 2003 : of the 10 million students in French state schools , only 1,250 wore the headscarf .
So who or what sparked " l'affaire du foulard " ?
Françoise Lorcerie , the editor of The Politicisation of the Veil in France , Europe and the Arab World , points the finger at France 's interior minister , Nicolas Sarkozy , who , in a generally well - received speech to the Union of French Muslim Organisations in April 2003 , sparked uproar in the hall when he reminded the audience that wearing the headscarf on national ID card photos was " unlawful " .
Within days , commentators and celebrities were demanding the banning of the headscarf in schools .
In 2003 , three French papers ( Le Monde , Libération and Le Figaro ) published 1,284 articles on the subject .
By contrast , the hotly contested plan to reform social security - a genuine national debate that brought tens of thousands on to the streets - registered only 478 times .
Responding to a climate of his government 's own making , President Chirac set up the powerful Stasi commission , named after its Catholic chair , to investigate " how secularism could be enforced in the republic " .
MPs of all parties kept up the pressure , introducing parliamentary bills to ban the headscarf .
Public opinion then turned , from being almost evenly divided at the start of the campaign to 76 % in favour of a ban within a year .
Partly as a result of this extraordinary diversion , the Raffarin government was able to face down large - scale public opposition to pension reform .
For Pierre Tévanian , the author of Le Voile Médiatique , the headscarf " unveiled another genuine problem " , later confirmed by last November 's social explosion in the French suburbs : " an ingrained postcolonial racism that crosses all social divides and political formations , even the most progressive . "
Most alarmingly , the veil and headscarf debate intertwined seamlessly with issues of law and order , women 's oppression and international terrorism .
Until last week , the European debate had been confined to the idea of banning items of Muslim dress in public institutions .
The Dutch government 's proposed ban on both niqab and burka in all public spaces takes things to a new and disturbing level .
The implication is clear : niqab or hijab - wearing women , and through them European Muslims , are being asked to submit not to the law of the land , but to each country 's dominant way of life .
The lesson of the French experience is compelling : the banning of the headscarf in schools in 2004 was never intended to make France a more integrated society .
As well as the ban on " conspicuous religious symbols " , the Stasi commission made 25 other recommendations for " promoting secularism and tackling discrimination " , including the incorporation of slavery and colonisation in the teaching of French history .
The government ignored almost all of them .
The more governments and media foment hysteria over headscarves and niqabs , the more it seems a pan-European Islamophobic consensus is being built , as politicians search for scapegoats for social problems and pretexts to legislate in the " war on terror " .
The anniversary of the uprisings in the French banlieues is a reminder that this strategy will lead only to disaster .

Recently I 've read about Lua .
It 's a nice simple language , with a syntax that 's quite close to my ideal for a dynamically - typed imperative language .
One of the things it omits for simplicity 's sake is first - class continuations .
I 've been wondering how one might specify a similar syntax if you have a Schemeish infrastructure , so that the usual control structures can be desugared into functions , conditionals , and tail - calls .
I also have in mind Modula - 3's definition of some control structures in terms of exceptions .
In the following I 'm not going to talk about the whole syntax ; I 'll omit things which do n't involve blocks .
The basic form of a block expression is :
name ( arguments ) : do statements end
The value of this expression is a function which takes some arguments and which when called executes the statements .
The scope of its name is just within the block itself ; it is used in inner scopes to refer to shadowed variables in outer scopes .
To execute the block immediately , the arguments can be omitted :
name : do statements ;
end
is equivalent to
name ( ) : do statements ; end ( )
that is , it specifies a function that has no arguments and which is called immediately .
The name can also be omitted .
Doing so just means there 's no way to refer to this block 's variables if they are shadowed in an inner scope .
For example , an anonymous function ( lambda expression ) is typically
( args ) : do statements ; end
You might also want to allow a shorter version of
( args ) : do return ( values ) ; end
for use in expressions , perhaps
( args ) : return ( values )
A minimal block like the following is just like a Lua block :
do statements ; end
Just before the end of each block there 's an implicit return ( nil ) .
You can return from a block early with whatever value or list of values you want .
Instead of do ... end you can write a conditional :
if expression then true statements else false statements end
If the else part is omitted then the false statements are implicitly return ( nil ) .
You can also add elsif expression then alternate statements parts in the usual way .
The basic form of a loop is
name : do statements loop
which is equivalent to
name : do statements return ( name ( ) )
end
that is , loops are implemented using tail recursion .
( Loops do not have to be named , but I 've written the desugaring in terms of a named block to avoid having to talk about hypothetical unique names . )
name : while expression do statements loop
is equivalent to
name : if expression then statements return ( name ( ) )
end
and
name : do statements while expression loop
is equivalent to
name : do statements if expression then return ( name ( ) ) end end
You can use until expression instead of while not( expression ) .
Given the above , you can see that return inside a loop is similar to break in C .
It 's often nice to be able to break out of more than one nested loop at a time , or return from a function inside a loop .
This is where a block 's name comes into play .
To return from a named outer block , call name .return .
For example :
def bsearch ( arr , val ) : do def lo , hi := 1 , #arr while lo <= hi do def mid := math .
floor ( ( lo + hi ) / 2 ) ; if arr [ mid ] == val then bsearch .return ( mid ) elsif arr [ mid ] < val then lo := mid + 1 else hi := mid - 1 end loop end
A bare return in the above would specify the value of the if block , not the function .
This kind of return makes it easy to write call - with - current - continuation :
def callcc(f ) : do def cont ( ... ) : do callcc.return (... ) end return ( f( cont ) ) end
However this is unnecessary because return is already an expression whose value is the current continuation .
It 's just like other function arguments , except that it 's implicit ( a bit like the self argument in Lua 's methods ) and can't be assigned to ( so that the compiler can do tail - call optimisation ) .
( Actually , what if you * could * assign to return ?
Eeeeevil ! )
There are three forms of statement within a block : definitions , assignments , and function calls .
Since a block without arguments is equivalent to a function expression that is immediately called , non-function blocks can be statements .
A function definition
def name ( arguments ) : do ...
is equivalent to
def name := name ( arguments ) : do ...
For bigger code , it 's useful to allow a block 's name to be repeated after its end or loop , for example :
def long_function ( arguments ) : do code code code end long_function
You can further desugar definitions , since
old_name : do before statements def variables := values after statements end
is equivalent to
outer_name : do before statements inner_name ( variables ) : do after statements end ( values ) end
except that you need to fix up the after statements so that unqualified returns are qualified with the outer_name , and variables qualified with the old_name are qualified with the outer_name or inner_name as necessary .
Some things are still missing from this description .
A for loop is necessary , probably based on some kind of iterator concept , but that 's too far away from the topic of this post to be worth pursuing in detail now .
Also , we would probably like a standard exception mechanism ; this is not trivial to implement in terms of continuations because the code that handles an exception is determined dynamically ( like Perl local ) whereas continuations are lexical ( like Perl my ) .
Finally , the combination of continuations and concurrency is utterly filthy : imagine what happens if one thread calls a continuation created by another ...
I Spy
There comes a moment in the back of any police van when your thoughts turn to the chain of events that has brought you to this moment in your life , and with perhaps more urgency , to any potential chains of events that may help lead you someplace else .
Whether it's the softness of the cushions ( designed for beefy men who sit all day ) , the gentle rocking of the van , or that feeling of absolute cocooning safety that can only come from being surrounded by police , there is something about the police van that encourages quiet contemplation .
My only previous ride in a police van had been marred by a somewhat tight suspension and a feeling of vague unease connected with the large number of guns sliding back and forth under the seats , whanging against the van walls .
The Beijing police van , by comparison , was an oasis of comfort and safety .
The thoughtful driver did n't even turn on the siren or utter a single expletive as he drove me and ten police officers in restful silence to my office , where I hoped to reunite with my passport and perhaps even get a chance to introduce my new friends to my late - working boss .
I had penetrated Beijing 's top - secret aerospace complex ( near Zhichun Lu , Haidian district , take a right between the Jade Hotel and the McDonald 's ) through an ingenious ruse .
Posing as a simple American tourist out for a walk , I had followed a man on a decrepit cargo bike and an old worker carrying a bucket as they turned down a normal residential street .
To get past the sentry in the almost invisible guard booth , I had cunningly omitted walking up and banging on the glass to wake him up , instead following the creaky bike , which was delivering the habitual Beijing bike cargo of three pieces of scrap wood and an old rag .
Eluding detection by the basketball court full of army guys in tank tops , I continued after the bike and the bucket , pretending to head toward the main road that would take me home .
This tour - de - force of tradecraft soon paid off .
The cargo bike turned a corner , the man with the bucket disappeared into a doorway , and I stood face - to - face with my first intelligence coup .
The Beijing Aerospace Center had imprudently left a key motivational banner suspended over the street :
事事有人管 - 人人有事管
( every matter taken care of - everyone with work to do )
A lesser spy may have called it a day right here , but I smelled greater glory ahead and knew that I had to press on .
So I continued pass this banner ( a classified relative of the big " DO NOT CHEAT ON YOUR EXAMS ! " banners hanging at nearby Beijing University ) and took myself deeper into the heart of China 's aerospace industry , so cleverly disguised as a through street .
The complex was full of low , squat buildings in the usual mild state of disrepair that characterizes the quieter parts of Beijing .
There were no people around .
Each little street I followed ended in a fence or closed gate with a frustrating view of the main road I was trying to get to , right there on the other side .
This also was n't that unusual ; Beijing is a city of gratuitous fences .
Undeterred by repeated failure , I moved like Pac - Man in my maze , trying to find an exit .
Turning one particuarly desolate corner , I hit the mother lode of military intelligence .
Right there before me , painted in four giant red characters on a peeling plaster wall , stood the secret directive at the heart of China 's space program :
安全第一
( safety first )
My pulse racing as I absorbed the import of these words , I turned frantically in search of an exit .
NASA had to know about this !
But right then I heard that most dreadful sound , the feverish clapping of a man running towards me in flip - flops .
Caught !
I tried to fake it .
Still wearing the mask of a bored and lost tourist , I walked idly past the man , pretending I did n't know he was after me , pretending to be innocently trying to find my way out of this goddamned tangle of identical streets .
But this laughable ploy failed .
The clapping slowed and he stood red-faced in front of me , trying to catch his breath while pouring questions at me in Chinese .
He was a worried - looking young guy with the unmistakable look of someone who has just woken up from a sweet , sweet nap .
He was dressed in a red mesh tank top and shorts , with a black walkie - talkie in one hand .

The interrogation facility in China 's top - secret aerospace complex consisted of a little room filled with mosquitoes .
For maximum psychological impact , it had been built next to the large street I 'd been trying so unsuccessfully to reach this entire time .
The flip - flop guy began the interrogation by sitting down and grinning at me .
A few minutes of close questioning revealed that I did not speak Chinese , and he did not speak English .
He pointed to a logo of a rocket on a piece of furniture , by way of explaining where I was , and then we basked in each other 's company , both nodding sagely , as skinny guards filed silently into the room .
In China there seems to be a direct relationship between authority and waist size .
Beijing is full of skinny young guys in uniform standing on various boxes and in small booths , watching the world go by .
Their purpose is unclear - none has ever been observed to prevent anyone from entering any building or courtyard - but they do lend the city a certain martial flair .
The security guards entering now definitely belonged to this category , and so everyone ignored them as they shuffled in and sprawled on the various sofas .
After thirty minutes of amiable sitting I heard the siren of an approaching police van , the gate rolled open , and a sharp squeal of brakes told me that Beijing 's finest had arrived .
The cop who walked in was , judging by his girth , in a position of great authority .
He did not immediately address me , instead pouring his wrath out on those unfortunate enough to be standing in or near the building .
Then he turned to me , introduced himself , and pointed at my pockets .
He was accompanied by another authority figure , a man in civilian clothes whose job consisted of takng pictures of all the guilty parties with a digital camera and browbeating those poor security guards that the big cop overlooked .
They divided the interrogation task between them - the fat cop started digging his way through my belongings while the angry photographer went into the sentry booth room to lay into the hapless guards there .
Every so often he would pop out to take some pictures of me and my entourage of skinny guards , who straightened visibly for the camera .
Now that I had activated the factory 's immune system , more and more of these guys were coming in to sit with me in the little waiting room , clustering around me like bored antibodies enveloping a particularly foul virus .
I had a mental image of all the gates to the secret complex now standing unguarded and open .
The fat cop scowled as he navigated his way through the phone , reading through the many mystery text messages that had periodically arrived for the phone 's mysterious Chinese owner .
With nothing better to do , I began to wonder what it was all those text messages actually said .
I hoped they were along the lines of :
hey where r u 2nite loooooonely lol xoxoxoxo lulu
rather than :
yo japanlover and falun bong just scored some primo tibetan weed meet tonite under the bridge death to the oppressors 420 4evr
By now it was dark and my evening was beginning to drag a little bit .
The fat cop grunted at the phone and walked outside again .
Someone offered me a bottle of water ( with an astronaut on it ) , but soon the conversation was flagging again .
It was clear that the eight skinny guys in cheap security uniforms , belts wrapped twice around their waists , did n't have much in common with me , an imperialist spy .
Outside I could see the bright red glow of cigarettes and the blue glow of cell phones , bobbing around in agitated counterpoint .
A very long time later , the gate opened again to admit a much smaller cop car , and a skinny cop who looked barely out of his teens came into the room .
Despite his lack of embonpoint , the mass of sprawled out limbs and lolling heads on the sofas around me instantly reassembled into a row of guys at tiptoe attention .
The skinny cop introduced himself as Claude .
He spoke good English and was extremely polite , expressing a deep curiosity about my reasons for being in China in general and one of its most restricted aerospace facilities in particular .
He seemed particularly interested in seeing my passport .
I could not satisfy him on this point , offering the feeble excuse that I had left it in my office to go on a ten - minute walk , and that is how I eventually ended up in the van .
I took Claude 's rebuke about not having my passport in stride - it was true , I did n't like to walk around with it because of my knack for losing important documents .
But I was hurt when he took me to task for not having registered my address with the local police .
Here I was , a white guy , living in the middle of a highly technologically sophisticated police state , speaking no Chinese , surrounded by willing informants , adhering to a rigid daily routine .
How hard could it be to figure out where I was ?
Granted , keeping the gate of their secret aerospace facility closed apparently lay beyond the capabilities of the Chinese secret police , but did they require this level of handholding in everything ?
In the interests of international harmony , however , I neglected to press this point with Claude .
Instead I handed him my New York driver 's license , which he took ginger hold of before heading out into the night .
At some point the fat cop walked in again to make another attempt at the cell phone , guards springing back to attention around him .
Having suffered the slings and arrows of the phone 's outrageous user interface for three months , it gave me a secret thrill to watch this battle .
But as confident as I was of the outcome , I worried that the cop might accidentally squeeze the button on the side of the phone and thereby discover the phone 's built - in camera .
By my estimate the phone had about fifty photographs stored on it - two of my bewildered face squinting at the phone , one of my hand , and forty seven of the inside of my pocket .
I had no way of verifying this , though , because the built - in photograph viewer was not navigable by mortal man .
Only the pure of heart , to whom the user interface would open like a blushing rose , could activate the picture viewer .
I did not look forward to having to explain this if the fat cop hit the wrong button and heard the shutter 's distinctive click .
" Hang in there , " I whispered into the phone 's little camera eye , while the fat cop mashed its buttons .
And the brave little phone held firm .

Living with someone continuously for several months , it 's easy to assume you know all their foibles .
But the expression that appeared on my boss 's face when I walked in to my office at 10 pm trailed by a dozen uniformed guards and police was one that I had not previously seen .
There was a momentary , awkward silence as the angry photographer took his photos and the fat cop sat down to more comfortably leaf through the papers on a colleague 's desk .
But then Claude broke the ice by asking us how the Lakers were doing this season , and whether we thought Chinese girls were cute , whether we liked Chinese food , and who exactly the office belonged to , the names and business cards of all relevant and irrelevant parties , and our names , and the names of our staff , and photocopies of our passports , visas , and anything else that could fit in the office copier .
A minion started to make copies , and again there was a bit of a lull in the conversation .
For a while all that could be heard was the sound of whirring paper .
Then Claude turned to my boss .
" 我爱你 ( I love you ) ! " he said， somewhat unexpectedly .
His face was radiant .
My boss beamed back at him .
Two of the skinny guards woke up from their stupor and exchanged glances .
" 我爱你 ! " Claude repeated .
I took a step back .
" Do you know how to say this in Chinese ? "
" He 's saying ' I love you ' , I muttered to my boss .
" No , no , no , I speak very little Chinese , " my boss said .
" Zher ! " he cried , demonstrating his entire vocabulary .
The word " this " , combined with a pointing index finger , had served as a potent food procurement strategy .
" 我爱你 ? " asked Claude , hope fading .
" Chinese girls not pretty ? "
" No no no , Chinese girls very pretty . " said my boss .
A picture of his meaty finger pointing at the chest of some young lovely in a Sanlintun bar , punctuated with a lusty " Zher ! " , appeared in my mind .
I suppressed it .
" Chinese girls pretty ? " Claude wondered .
" Yes , very pretty . "
My boss looked towards me for corroboration .
" Yes , yes , pretty girls .
And strong space program ! "
Fortunately the scanning finished before this conversation could go much further .
With no further reason to trouble us , the police made their farewells .
We shook hands with great joy and wished each other a good night .
In his parting comments , Claude thanked me for my time and suggested that , in the future , I be more careful about where I walk .
This finally exhausted my patience , and I suggested back that the relevant authorities seriously consider closing the gate on their high - security , top - secret urban Area 51 .
This was duly translated into Chinese and brought forth a hearty , those - responsible - are - already - on - their - way - to - xinjiang kind of laugh from the group .
Our friendly camaraderie restored , and with assurances that he would not forget to come visit us and make sure had n't had any problems remembering to register with the local police , Claude and his entourage left , leaving my boss and me alone to discuss the captivating story of where I had been for the last four hours , and how I had come to bring such a delightful assortment of Chinese law enforcement professionals into our lives .
Then I took off my shoe and called my controllers at the U.S. Embassy .
And that is how I lost my walk - taking privileges in Beijing .
The size of the chip becomes apparent alongside a human hair
It was assembled on a single carbon nanotube , a standard component of any nanotechnologist 's toolkit .
The circuit is less than a fifth of the width of a human hair and can only be seen through an electron microscope .
The researchers , from IBM and two US universities in Florida and New York , told the journal Science that the work could lead to faster computer chips .
Smaller , faster
Scientists have continually tried to push the boundaries of chip technology since 1965 when Intel co-founder Gordon Moore predicted that the number of transistors on a chip could double every couple of years .
The ring oscillator is a very nice tool .
It allows you to characterise transistor properties as you would use a speedometer to measure the speed of a car
Professor Joerg Appenzeller , IBM
For the last four decades , chip makers have managed to keep up with the proposition that came to be known as Moore 's Law .
However , in recent years , there has been a realisation that silicon will be unable to maintain the same rate of performance improvement , prompting scientists to explore new nano - materials .
The latest design consists of 12 transistors made of two different metals , palladium and aluminium .
They are laid along the length of a carbon nanotube , essentially a rolled up sheet of carbon atoms , to create what is known as a ring oscillator .
Proof of principle
The finished circuit is just 18 micrometres ( millionths of a metre ) long and sits across the tube , which is substantially narrower .
The circuit is not designed to be used in a computer chip .
Instead , it is a proof of principle that allowed the research team to test the switching speed of its design .
" The ring oscillator is a very nice tool , " said Professor Joerg Appenzeller , a researcher at IBM and one of the authors on the Science paper .
" It allows you to characterise transistor properties as you would use a speedometer to measure the speed of a car , " he told the BBC news website .
Using this setup , the researchers showed they could achieve a speed of 50 megahertz , hundreds of times slower than the gigahertz speeds of silicon processors seen in most personal computers .
Even so , the researchers say the circuit is 100,000 times faster than any previously recorded for a device made with a carbon nanotube , and with continued refinement they hope to push speeds beyond those possible today .
In the first instance , the researchers envisage that chip components like this would make it into computers as a hybrid device , combining the best of silicon with the best of the new carbon technology .
The carbon would improve the speeds at which the chip can operate by being more heat effiicient than silicon , while manufacturers could continue to take advantage of the fabrication techniques they have invested so heavily in over the last 40 years .
Professor Appenzeller believes this route is more likely to encourage big chip makers to adopt new materials such as nanotubes .
" We have a lot of experience with silicon and we know a lot about circuit design , " he said .
" You really want to change these processes as little as possible .
This is the way to introduce new materials . "
The research team incorporated members from IBM in New York ; the Department of Physics , University of Florida ; the Department of Chemistry and Department of applied Physics and Mathematics , Columbia University , New York .

A FEW evenings ago , my wife and I were standing in the kitchen of our home in Rancho Mirage , Calif. , feeding our voracious hounds , when a song came on the radio .
It goes , “ If only you believe in miracles , baby , so would I ... ”
Suddenly a flood of thoughts came into my head .
I put on my swim trunks , and even though it was 42 degrees outside , I got into my superheated pool and swam , looking up at the stars , and this is what I thought :
My whole life is a miracle so far .
I live in glorious houses — tar - paper shacks by hedge fund standards , but plenty for me .
I have a great American - made car .
Above all , I have the most wonderful wife and the handsomest son on the planet .
My parents had a great , super life .
They went from obscurity and lower - middle - class status in the Great Depression to fame and fortune in the postwar period .
Their good fate was attributable mostly to their genius and hard work , but also to two culprits usually criticized in the media : President Richard M. Nixon , who made my father famous and powerful , and variable annuities , which made him and my mom well - to - do .
Okay .
I forced myself to watch the 60 Minutes interview with Bush last night .
You should know that your President feels " blessed " to have his job .
The rest of us do n't quite share that view .
The best exchange came when Scott Pelley recited a litany of lies from the Bush administration about the Iraq war .
Because polite people do n't call other people liars even when they are , Pelley used other language like " not been straight " and " not been honest . "
But basically he challenged Bush on the lies about the Iraq war :
" You know better than I do that many Americans feel that your administration has not been straight with the country , has not been honest .
To those people you say what ? "
Pelley asks .
" On what issue ? " the president replies .
" Like the weapons of mass destruction ? "
" No weapons of mass destruction , " Pelley says .
" Yeah , " Bush says .
" No credible connection between 9/11 and Iraq , " Pelley says .
“ Yeah , ” the president replies .
“ The Office of Management and Budget said this war would cost somewhere between $ 50 billion and $ 60 billion and now we 're over 400 , ” Pelley says .
“ I gotcha .
I gotcha .
I gotcha , ” Bush replies .
“ The perception , Sir , more than any one of those points , is that the administration has not been straight with … , ” Pelley says .
“ Well , I strongly disagree with that , of course , ” Bush says .
“ So I strongly reject that this administration has n’t been straight with the American people .
The minute we found out they did n’t have weapons of mass destruction , I was the first to say so . ”
So , yeah , yeah , yeah .
He gotcha , gotcha , gotcha .
Bush basically admitted all his major arguments about Iraq were lies .
Then , he lied again saying he has n't lied .
In Bush world , just because something is a lie does n't make it a lie .
How can anyone believe anything the guy says ?
This is an insanely long and gnarly essay about implementing , then optimizing , the low - level bits of a pure - Ruby XML parser .
If you obsess about XML reading , deterministic finite automata , or Ruby code optimization , you may find some part of it interesting .
There may perhaps be six people in the world who care about all three ; others are warned that an attempt to read this end to end may lead to general paralysis and perhaps even clinical brain - death .
[ He ’s not kidding .
- Ed . ]
By way of compensation , I ’ve tried to be offensive wherever the opportunity presented .
[ Update : Outstanding comment from Avi Bryant below , which he repeats and expands here . ]
The Problem · The state of XML parsing in Ruby is not that great .
The incumbent default is REXML .
Let me start out by saying that its XPath implementation is first - rate , and you can do almost all day - to - day network message processing — for example , implementing the APP — by throwing XPaths at your message buffer .
Also , REXML comes with a DOM mode , a pull parser , and an event - stream parser , all of which are Good Things .
Those aside , REXML has problems .
To start with , it ’s non-conforming , busted , incorrect , you pick the imprecation , because it happily eats lots of mangled , non -well - formed byteglobs which claim to be XML but are n’t , in direct contravention of this rule .
[ Is n’t this a little anal / pedantic ?
- Ed .
And your point is ?
- Tim ]
Another irritant is that the API , and the documentation for the API , take great care never to describe the parts of an XML document using the terms defined in the XML specification .
Consider for example , in the event - stream parser , the DOCTYPE declaration handler , which was apparently designed on Mars .
Finally , REXML is regarded by some as slow .
There are alternatives ; you can get XML handlers based on libxml2 and expat , the two most widely - used C- language XML processors .
At that recent RubyConf I attended , REXML complaints were usually dismissed with a brusque “ So use libxml already ” .
I have three problem with those approaches .
First , they mean you have to download , compile , and install new software , which sucks .
Second , all of this software is , uh , “ lightly maintained ” ( REXML too ) .
Third , I think that key Ruby libraries should , insofar as possible , be written in Ruby .
There are lots of different efforts to re-implement Ruby , any of which could end up being dramatically faster and better than the current C implementation in some set of circumstances , and to the extent that the libraries are in Ruby , they ’ll come along for free .
Also , C programming rots your brain .
[ Really ?
- Ed. Your spleen too .
- Tim ]
Lark · Back in 1996 , I wrote the world ’s first reasonably - conformant XML 1.0 processor , named Lark , in Java .
It ’s called “ Lark ” because on our honeymoon , my wife Lauren ripped her knee up and we had to spend a few days camped out with her leg raised and immobilized , so I used that time to do the coding ; thus Lark for “ Lauren ’s right knee ” .
[ Hey , your tenth anniversary is coming up .
- Ed .
But you digress .
- Tim ]
As a side effect of writing Lark , I learned Java , using Microsoft ’s “ Visual J++ ” , which in its early releases was a terrific product , before they ruined it .
Lark was quite successful and fairly widely deployed in production , but after a while there were parsers on the market from Microsoft , IBM , and James Clark , and I just did n’t feel like maintaining it as a permanent sideline , so I let it lapse in 1998 sometime .
[ Is there an attention - span issue here ?
- Ed. What ? - Tim ]
I ’m going to have to give a fairly detailed description of how Lark worked if the rest of this is going to make any sense .
Parser Flavors ·
There are a lot of standard parser architectures : recursive - descent , LR , LALR , state - machine , and so on .
Most XML parsers are some flavor of recursive descent , but Lark was a deterministic finite automaton ( DFA ) .
A character - driven DFA could n’t be simpler .
You keep track of what state you ’re in , and read the next character .
Each state has a list of transitions for particular characters , so you look up your character and and find the transition — if there is n’t one that ’s a syntax error .
Since you ’d like your parser to actually do something , not just parse , it ’s common to associate “ events ” or “ actions ” with transitions .
It ’s also common to enhance a DFA slightly with a push - down stack , so you can jump to another state and remember where to come back to at some future point .
The simplest way to implement a DFA is a simple two - dimensional array ; each state has a number , which indexes the rows of the array , and you use the numeric character value to index into a per-state array of transitions .
So the inner loop of your code would end up looking something like this :
state = dfa[ state ] [ character ]
You can use a similar trick to look up the actions or events associated with a transition .
Of course , in practice , the arrays could get very big ( Unicode has potentially a million or so characters ) , so DFAs are often implemented using lists or sparse - matrix tricks .
The great virtue of a DFA parsers is that you only have to look at each character once .
Lark , in its day , was blindingly fast , and only James Clark managed to produce a faster parser using all sorts of brilliantly sleazy I /O tricks ; I was pretty sure I could have leapfrogged his performance if I ’d gone back and stolen some of them .
[ Coulda been a contender , eh? - Ed . ]
The Machine · The way Lark worked was , I hand - wrote the automaton in a language I made up in a hurry for the purpose .
[ Not XML ? - Ed .
Why would I use XML ? - Tim ]
Here ’s a sample , describing the state where you ’re cruising along through the text and have seen a < , signaling the start of a start - tag , end - tag , empty - element - tag , or processing instruction .
1. State SawLT BustedMarkup {after <} 2 . T ? Push ( InPI , InDoc ) !
ColdStart 3 . T ! MDO 4 . T / ETAGO 5 . T $ NameStart StagGI !
HotStart
Line 1 gives the state name , “ SawLT ” , and then there ’s another state , “ BustedMarkup ” , to fall back into for error - reporting purposes if the next character is n’t valid .
The curly braces enclose some text to help build an error message when things go wrong .
The rest of the lines , starting with “ T ” , describe this state ’s transitions .
Let ’s do line 3 before line 2 , because it ’s simpler .
It says that if you ’re in “ SawLT ” and you see a ! , you should do a transition to the state named “ MDO ” ; the name is taken from the XML spec production , in this case standing for Markup Declaration Open .
In fact , this has to be the start of a CDATA section .
Line 2 says that when you ’re in “ SawLT ” and see a ? , this has to be the start of a processing instruction , so you push to the “ InPI ” state , leaving the “ InDoc ” state on the stack ; a subsequent Pop when you see the end of the PI will take you back there .
Also , this transition will fire the action called ColdStart , which means the parser needs to start saving the characters going by , starting with the next character .
Line 4 is left as an exercise for the reader .
Line 5 has a couple more wrinkles .
First of all , the transition is n’t on a character , it ’s on $ NameStart , which is short - hand for “ any character which can be used to start an XML name ” .
Also it fires the HotStart action , which turns on character saving with this character .
By the way , you can have more than one action associated with a transition .
Little Tables ·
It turns out that the automaton had less than 256 states , so the state number would fit in a byte .
Cool !
But the characters , being Unicode , obviously would n’t .
So I was driven to trickery .
For most of the parser states , notably when you ’re reading text , any old Unicode character that ’s not a magic syntax character like < or & will do , so you save the real character , but substitute something like ~ to drive the automaton ; it ’ll have the same effect .
For some states , the value of the character matters , as in the example above .
In which case you have to check that the character you saw is an XML NameStart , but if it is , you can slap in a or any other valid name - starter and that ’ll drive the automaton fine .
So all you need is a per-state table of which character - classes apply in which states .
It turns out that there are n’t any states in which more than one class has a valid transition , and that in most states , none of them matter .
Thus the cost of all this jiggery - pokery is low .
The core of the Lark machine was a transitions table indexed by byte - sized state number , each state being a byte array indexed by the next input character or a class surrogate .
Similarly , there was an actions table indexed the same way .
Thus , the main loop of the parser ends up looking something like this :
state = START_STATE while true c = next_char break if c == nil next_state = machine [ state ] [ c ] if next_state == 0 handle_syntax_error end action = actions [ state ] [ c ] if action call_action_routines ( action ) end state = next_state end
RX · So I Ruby - fied some of Lark , for the moment calling it RX because I had to think up a name for the development directory .
I really had n’t ( and still have n’t ) worked out the goals ; if it turned out to be both more correct and faster than REXML then maybe it might be worth seeing if it could be slipped in underneath , preserving REXML ’s crunchy XPath goodness .
But really , I mostly did it because I could .
The implementation was pretty well pure fun ; particularly the part that read the automaton and wrote the machine : class MachineBuilder .
I stored both the transitions and actions tables in Ruby strings , which conveniently act like byte arrays when you throw a [ number ] at them .
I had to generate some Ruby code ; there are hand - written Ruby methods for each of the actions that can fire , so I wrote a little do_action routine which used a giant case on the action number to select which routines to call .
Also that file contained the grungy logic for looking in the XML character - class tables to determine whether something was a NameStart or NameChar or Digit or whatever .
The actual parsing code was really simple , way under 500 lines .
The input - handling code was also short but harder ; it had to do the character encoding auto- detection and turn UTF - 8 , UTF - 16 ( I also did ISO - 8859 - 1 and ASCII ) into streams of Unicode integer code points .
On my first pass through , I entirely resisted the premature - optimization temptation , implementing everything in the most simple - minded way possible ; this was easier than you might think because my Ruby experience is brief enough that I have few misleading intuitions about what ’s fast and what ’s slow .
As I write this , the MachineBuilder reports “ 110 states , 28416 bytes , 69 actions ” , and the generated Ruby file has 683 lines of really boring code .
The machine is a whole lot smaller than the version in Lark , and to explain why , a digression is necessary .
[ This is already too long .
- Ed .
A man ’s gotta do what he ’s gotta do .
- Tim ]
Network - Safe XML · As I reviewed the Lark code , my mind boggled at the high proportion that existed to handle what XML calls “ General Entities ” , that is , the entities you can define yourself in your DTD .
XHTML , for example , has hundreds of these , like ¥ and © and so on and so on .
The problem is that in the general case , XML lets you define the entities right there in the document , and furthermore lets them include other entities , so that the parser has to have a fairly sophisticated stack manager and input stream manager .
As I looked at this and thought about the work I ’ve recently been doing with Atom , I got more and more nervous and unhappy .
I thought of the “ billion laughs ” attack , and other things bad guys could do with DTDs .
So I threw out the internal subset .
This seems like a good solution to me .
[ Are you raping XML ?
- Ed .
Go away .
- Tim ]
The parser reports entity references , so if you know you ’re handling , for example , XHTML , you can provide the appropriate replacement values .
But I just could n’t get comfortable with arbitrary macro processing in - file .
RX still parses the DOCTYPE , if present and tells you what the public and system identifiers are , but if it sees an internal subset it stops cold .
Yes , arguably I ’m fucking with the basic nature of XML here , but I suspect I ’m right .
In practical terms , REXML does n’t really handle XML general entities either , so I ’m no worse .
More discussion is probably called for .
First Cut · I have unit tests for the input manager and the QName wrangler ( thankfully , there are lots of XML test suites out there ) .
I was pondering how to test the actual parser ; an automaton is a great big glob of pretty abstract code , and the high - level unit - testing approach was n’t obvious .
Obviously I cared not only about XML conformance detection , but about the data passed to the app using the parser .
So I implemented REXML ’s StreamListener event - stream interface , and figured that for my first debugging pass , if I could get the same results as REXML on some nontrivial XML files , that ’d be a start .
So I wrote this little chunk of code that counts the number of processing instructions , elements , paragraph elements , img elements that have a src= attribute with a value ending in jpg , and occurrences of the word “ the ” in text content .
It was n’t too long before I was getting the same results as REXML on quite a few different chunks of XML , most notably 2 ½ meg of ongoing articles .
[ Is my blog eating my life ?
And that 2 ½M was before I started writing the tome you are now reading . ]
Unfortunately , the first cut was approximately ten times slower than REXML .
The Profiler · So , I broke out the Ruby profiler .
[ Cue crazed laughter in the background . ]
Which is perfectly fine , except for it ’s , well , slow .
As in really slow .
As in one particular run which normally took 0.826 seconds of user time burned 134.36 seconds with the profiler ’s help .
The profiler revealed a whole bunch of things .
First , my naïve input implementation predictably sucked rocks .
[ “ Sucked rocks ” ?
- Ed. Uh , kind of weak , is n’t it ?
- Tim ]
It was using byte - at - a - time input reads to drive character - at - a - time parser input .
So I hacked in a fairly standard buffered I /O setup .
If I had a nickel for every time I ’ve juiced up a program by fixing the I/ O buffering I ’d have , well , a couple of bucks anyhow .
The next obvious sinner was that do_action routine , which had a 69 - way case selecting among all the possible sets of actions that a transition could fire .
I was seeing major time vanishing there and , via it , in Fixnum#=== .
Gack .
I ’m an old C / Java hacker , and I had this notion that most language ’s case constructs were there to provide rapid selection among a bunch of alternatives .
Ruby ’s , on the other hand , provides all sorts of cool features not found elsewhere , but they do n’t include rapid selection .
OK , so for each of the 69 action combinations , I generate a method , here ’s one of them :
def action _5 ( c ) result = false result ||= a_Push ( c , 60 ) result ||= a_ColdStart ( c ) result end
Then I loaded up an array like so :
def load_actions @@action_dispatcher = [ nil , method ( : action_1 ) , method ( : action_2 ) , ...
Then do_action became :
def do_action( i , c ) @@action_dispatcher[i].call(c )
end
All this made a remarkable difference .
[ This sucks .
- Ed. I ’m not sure - Tim ]
But I was still way behind REXML .
Second Cut ·
After spending more quality time waiting for the profiler , it became obvious that my per-char main loop was killing me .
Here ’s the actual code that ’s run , with the input character living in c and the automaton driver ( see above ) in b :
@buf << c if @saving index = ( @state * 128 ) + b @to = nil action = do_action ( @@actions [ index ] , c ) if @@actions [ index ] !=
0 # turn crank unless action already set the next state @to = @@machine [ index ] unless @to @state = @to ...
It was burning the vast majority of my CPU .
Not having any brilliant ideas how to optimize it , it struck me that I ought to do it less .
At this point I had an inspiration ( which could have been used with the original Java - flavored Lark , too ) .
An XML parser ’s performance is especially interesting when the input is large .
Large XML documents typically contain large runs of text content , and the state machine is going to spin its way stupidly through these , saying , for each character , “ is this < or & ?
Nope ?
Save it and move right along , nothing to see here . ”
So I refactored away , changing the input subsystem to turn its input buffer into a list of buffers , some of them one character in length and containing either < or & , and others , any length at all , guaranteed not to contain either magic syntax character .
Then the main parser loop , each time around , would check whether it was in the well - known plain - text - reading - state , and if so , was it more than one character into the input buffer , and if so , ask the input system for the whole buffer , known not to contain any syntax .
This successfully cut down the number of times through the main loop .
Unfortunately , it also made everything slower .
Why ?
Third Cut ·
Let ’s have fun waiting for the profiler again , sha n’t we ?
Gack !
Array#index and Fixnum#== are eating my brain !
You see , I ’d exploded the input string , be it UTF - 8 or UTF - 16 or whatever , into an array of Unicode character integers , and was using index to find the syntax characters .
Silly , silly me .
At this point I reflected on the downside of making classes like Fixnum and Array open , and took a couple of days off to think .
Fourth Cut · Well , REXML is faster , I thought , and it ’s regexp - based , so they must be fast , unlike case constructs and Array #index .
So I buckled down and made my input subsystem much more complex ; in the case where the input is something Ruby regular expressions can handle ( as in , most single - byte encodings ) I used regular expressions to chop up the input strings .
@bufs_waiting = buf.scan /< |&|[ ^<&]+/mu @bufs_waiting.map ! { |b| b.unpack ( 'U* ' ) }
This made a huge difference ; I was now within spitting distance of REXML .
It turns out that unpack is real fast .
Pity about the people who use UTF - 16 ; I had to write horrid per - byte expansion logic for that case , and I have n’t measured it , but I bet it ’s gonna suck .
Fifth Cut · Another run with the profiler [ Row , row , row , your boat , gently down the stream / merrily , merrily , merrily , merrily , life is but a dream ] suggested that Ruby method dispatch is simply not up to processing any nontrivial text on a per-character basis , so I changed the interface to the input subsystem from next_char to next_chars .
Yep , that helped .
Conclusions · For C and Java programmers like me , Ruby is a new territory and things may not be what they seem .
I ’m OK with the case construct being what it is , and with using regexes to pick things apart .
But I ’m irritated about the lousy performance of integer arrays .
Here ’s the thing :
Inside the computer , arrays of numbers is all there are .
Over the years , I ’ve developed an instinct : if you can find a way to represent a problem so that you store and manipulate the data using arrays of integers , you usually win , big - time .
This is one reason why finite automata can be made to run so fast .
Apparently , in the world of Ruby , my instinct is wrong .
The problem is really the open classes ; because I might choose to override Array #index or Fixnum#== , the runtime is n’t allowed to notice that these are just integer arrays and emit low - level indirection - free code to treat them that way .
So maybe Ruby needs a FrozenArray or Frozen Fixnum class , to make bit - bangers like me happy .
Except for , everyone says that Smalltalk VMs can do this kind of thing real fast .
Gilad Bracha , where are you ?
As Of Now ·
The code is here .
And here ’s a profiler run showing everything that used 0.5 % or more of the CPU time .
RX is still only about half as fast as REXML .
I have n’t given up yet , and I ’ve learned a few things .
Winter is finally here .
It is dark and dreary , the ground hard , unyielding .
I ’m getting over a cold .
My feet are never as warm as I ’d like them to be .
But still , I look forward to spring .
The seed catalogs have arrived .
I ’m starting to review possibilities for the garden next year .
It is Winter , but this is only a temporary affliction .
Current misery coupled with the knowledge of eventual satisfaction — there does n’t seem to be a single English word which captures this thought .
So , I ’ll coin a word , “ Sperandomiseria ” .
Og mil ten fit ghust lech fer ti nostu , pertents ?
Sperandomiseria , cuic cuic danto do quant fer nos protoblian , sed nuic , volte torma .
Zherantilli , fer muc opsice inito brandu s’deko prot affti ?
Nek worchi fer ubir !
Sperandomiseria , gher - kloj ven ter moido , ven ter zer - moidi , eggen ven ter moidisti miki-moiki .
Do you agree ?
I think this is a good argument and I see no practical downside .
Something must be done soon , lest we experience a repeat next time .
Sorry ,
What is that ?
You have no idea what I am talking about ?
Oh .
So you do n’t speak Weirish ?
We ’ll need to do something about that then .
That ’s what I ’m speaking now , Ecma Weirish .
See , I used to use English , but I found that the English language was missing words for some things I wanted to express , so I made up some new words for these ideas , to ensure that everyone would perfectly understand what I was saying , with no ambiguities .
Ini hag danto do abergi nec palmu , ven fec tolibissi , pert rami fer cuic cuic affti .
Pardon , you are still having problems ?
You want to know about the words in the English language that were already well - known , useful and descriptive , and why I did n’t just use those , and supplement them with new words as needed ?
Good question .
Once I started making up new words , I found that none of existing words in English perfectly matched my usage of them .
In fact I really could n’t translate my thoughts perfectly into any existing language .
My thoughts are so unique that no other language works well for them .
A totally new language is a much more accurate way to notate my thoughts .
I wonder why everyone does n’t do it ?
If you use this language , you will understand me perfectly .
Og mil ven ter moidisti …
What ?
You again ?
Why ca n’t you just speak Weirish ?
When you use English you just slow down my mental processing .
Ah , so you want to know how to speak Weirish .
Great .
I ’ll give you a starter word list :
Pertentare ( v ) — to walk like Rob walks .
Protoblia ( n ) — a nice person [ Note :
This can not be fully defined within this word list .
It is best defined by how Weir thought a nice person was back 15 years ago . ]
Zherantillo ( n ) — where Rob keeps his keys , sometimes upstairs near the bedroom , sometimes by the front door , sometimes in a hidden place .
Rhodantillu , muc muc dilinorpthu , ac…
I ’m a patient man .
What else do you want to know ?
Why should Weirish be an International Standard ?
Because it matches my thoughts so perfectly .
Everyone wants to know what I think , so it is good that they learn Weirish for that task .
If you look closely , you see that there are hundreds of languages already out there .
I should have one too .
How do you say , “ Firefox ” in Weirish ?
Umm … uhhh… well , you do n’t .
I only use Internet Explorer , so there is no word for “ Firefox ” .
Just say “ Internet Explorer 4.0 ” instead .
That ’s close enough , right ?
Ditto for “ Linux ” , “ OpenOffice ” , “ KOffice ” , “ WordPerfect ” or “ MySQL ” .
Here ’s a 6,000 page document on Weirish I dictated in my sleep last week .
Do n’t leave !
Hey !
I ’ve given you everything you ’ve asked for .
A perfect language , a dictionary for understanding it , a very very long manuscript on it , everything .
Please , do n’t go !
Amitambo n’itorno !

This post is by a guest blogger .
This is my first guest column by friend and fellow blogger AJ Valliant .
AJ is a regular writer at Beats Entropy .
I was n’t expecting something of this quality , and I ’m sure you will enjoy it .
In an inexplicably poor lapse of judgment ( ET — one of many ) , engtech has recruited me to write a column relating my experience as a former arts student trying to make a living in the cold , heartless and geeky IT world .
I can only assume this is a misplaced gesture of friendship , or some repressed blogocidal urge ; either way I agreed and will attempt to drop some knowledge .
I do internal technical support and problem co-ordination for one of the largest corporations in the world with no background other than a B.A. in psychology .
Life in the Trenches – Getting Out Alive
I am the least qualified person ever hired at my work .
Were I to be hired at your work , I would almost certainly be the least qualified person in that given environment .
There are children who grew up in the slums of Mumbai that are more qualified for my job than me ; self - educated through tattered scraps of Wired magazine , and overheard conversations while seeking warmth in call centre crawl spaces .
Sounds rough I know , but surprisingly irrelevant to my job performance .
It turns out that unless you are designing or programming something the only requirements to excel at mid to entry level IT jobs are literacy , a modicum of cleverness , basic critical thinking , and effective communication skills .
I am sure you guys know the requirements to excel at my job better than I do .
What I do know , however , is how to succeed at my job without it turning me into a bland , stressed , deeply compromised , office drone ( ET — tell me what you really think of me ) .
So here is my guide for getting out alive .
If it ’s Not Funny do n’t Laugh
Nothing erodes the soul quicker than fake , patronizing , laughter .
Letting them think they ’re funny is a disservice to joke teller , and it conditions you to act in a pathetic , insincere manner .
In similar vein do n’t talk about things no one cares about to create to illusion of conversation .
IE : weather , new office policies , how your kids are doing in school .
Engaging in insipid contentless small talk is the first step toward becoming that rambling boring guy nobody invites to parties ( ET — tell me what you really think of me ) .
Angry People are Angry People
I am constantly confronted by hostile , rude , irrationally angry clients .
They are not calling because they want their problem addressed .
They are calling because they are deeply unhappy and feel the need to lash out .
I can give some fantastic tech support but it does n’t make their childhoods less painful , restore their potency , or compel their wife to stop running around .
I do what I can , refusing to buy into a rage that has nothing to do with me , and let them have there childish tantrums .
Getting drawn into their frustration just poisons my own mood .
Office Politics
Let ’s get this straight : if you are a backstabbing and manipulative snitch of a punk at work , then that is all you are anywhere .
You do n’t get to selectively apply Character when it ’s convenient ; if you would sell out your co-workers you would sell out your friends , it ’s just a matter of the price is right .
No amount of money , prestige , or accomplishment replaces being a quality human being .
Think about what you are throwing away before you decide to be self serving prick .
Stand Up for Yourself
Do n’t ever just sit there and absorb verbal bullying , snide emasculating jokes , or any sort personal attack from co-worker or superior .
I ’m not saying turn their lights out , but , it will turn into the ugliest kind of self hate and frustration if you just swallow it without comment , and take that ball of poisonous contempt home with you .
Keep it civil and controlled , but call them out on what an unprofessional asshole they are being .
Shame them with respectful professionalism , and be willing to accept whatever consequences result from it .
This is a huge one .
If you get into the habit of rolling over to bullies it will destroy your self esteem and make you powerless in every area of your life .
No job , no career even , is worth that kind of sacrifice .
Have Some Perspective
If you are reading this at work you will never be able to justify having a “ bad ” job .
It may be difficult , demanding , and stressful , sure .
But in the larger scheme of things it ’s soft and likely well compensated .
You think your job sucks ?
Take a day off and hang out with a dishwasher , or roofer , or some guy that fishes nickels out of the sewer for living .
Spend some time with someone who work a sixteen hour day , comes home exhausted and wracked with pain , just so he can make one third of what you do ( if he ’s lucky ) .
Do n’t whine , not only does it make you look like an ungrateful pussy , it annoys all the people around you .
Most office workers fail to realize how close they are to getting brutally murdered by the janitorial staff .
Define Success
More than the magazines , more than my colleagues , more than the standards of society , I know what I need to consider my life a successful one .
Would I be happier if my pay was tripled and I was promoted to the director level tomorrow ?
Not if it meant working 12 hour days and being chained to a pager ; narrowing my life to one thing I can , at best , tolerate .
I can always get cheaper hobbies and slightly crappier apartment .
I ca n’t manufacture more time or restore a squandered youth .
Wealth and prestige have a very marginal happiness utility that does n’t really scale up ; expirence and relationships have near unlimited potential for reward .
Ultimately I consider my biggest workplace success being able to maintain who I am through every phase of my day .

The Dover area school board violated the constitution when it ordered that its biology curriculum must include intelligent design ( ID ) , district judge John Jones said .
The policy , adopted in October 2004 , is believed to have been the first of its kind in the country .
" The citizens of the Dover area were poorly served by the members of the board who voted for the ID policy , " Judge Jones wrote in his 139 - page judgement .
" It is ironic that several of these individuals , who so staunchly and proudly touted their religious convictions in public , would time and again lie to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose behind the ID Policy .
" We find that the secular purposes claimed by the board amount to a pretext for the board 's real purpose , which was to promote religion in the public school classroom . "
The board 's attorneys said members sought to improve science education by exposing students to alternatives to Charles Darwin 's theory of natural selection , or evolution .
Intelligent - design supporters argue that it cannot fully explain the existence of complex life forms .
The district was sued by a group of 11 parents who claimed the intelligent design policy was unconstitutional and unscientific and had no place in science classrooms .
They argued that intelligent design amounts to a secular repackaging of creationism , which the courts have already ruled cannot be taught in public schools .
The Dover policy required students to hear a statement about intelligent design before ninth - grade biology lessons on evolution .
The statement said Charles Darwin 's theory is " not a fact " , has inexplicable " gaps " , and refers students to ID textbook Of Pandas and People for more information .
Mr Jones said advocates of intelligent design " have bona fide and deeply held beliefs which drive their scholarly endeavours " and that he did n't believe the concept should n't be studied and discussed .
" Our conclusion today is that it is unconstitutional to teach ID as an alternative to evolution in a public school science classroom , " he wrote .
The dispute is the latest chapter in a long - running debate over the teaching of evolution dating back to the famous 1925 Scopes monkey trial , in which Tennessee biology teacher John Scopes was fined $ 100 ( £ 57 ) for violating a state law that forbade teaching evolution .
The Tennessee supreme court reversed his conviction on the narrow ground that only a jury trial could impose a fine exceeding $ 50 , and the law was repealed in 1967 .
Gas saving myths
Think you 're stretching out your gas dollars by not running your car 's air conditioning ?
Think again .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Gas prices are on the rise again .
This time it 's the crisis in the Middle East that has motorists paying more at the pump .
In today 's top 5 Tips we 're going to help you make the most of your fuel economy by debunking some gas - saving myths .
MYTH 1 - It 's all about your MPG rating
How you drive can be more important than your car 's miles per gallon rating given by the Environmental Protection Agency .
In fact , those MPG ratings are way outdated .
In fact , EPA ratings were off about 14 percent on average , according to Phillip Reed of Edmunds.com .
" The standards were implemented in the 70s .
People drive more aggressively today .
We spend more time stuck in traffic .
We cruise at higher speeds , " he says .
On the plus side , the EPA will upgrade these standards in 2008 .
To get real - world fuel economy estimates check out consumerreports.org and Edmunds.com .
MYTH 2 - Gas saving products help fuel efficiency
You may have seen some products that claim to increase your gas mileage up to 20 percent .
These products can be oil or gasoline additives that cost anywhere from $ 5 to $ 100 .
Do n't fall for the hype .
The Environmental Protection Agency concluded that no product significantly improves gas mileage .
And in fact , these products may even damage your engine .
If you 've already purchased one of these products , get a refund even if the money - back guarantee has expired , says the Federal Trade Commission .
MYTH 3 - You need the best octane
Most engines are designed to take regular unleaded gasoline , which has an octane rating of 87 .
Using higher octane premium gas in an engine that is designed to run on regular does n't improve performance .
And even engines where it 's recommended you use premium gas can run on regular without any problems .
The bottom line here is that paying for premium gas is usually a waste of money .
MYTH 4 - All gas rebate cards are created equal
Gas rebate cards can give you anywhere from 3 to 5 percent rebate on your fill - up .
And that can add up to some real value at the end of the year .
But there are some major differences between cards .
Look specifically at card fees .
Some cards have annual fees of $ 20 , according to Curtis Arnold of cardratings.com .
Interest rates on these cards can also vary from 13 percent to over 20 percent .
And be vigilant when it comes to expiration dates as the rebate can expire in as little as six months .
It pays to do your homework here .
Consumers can compare the benefits of these cards at cardratings.com or cardweb.com .
MYTH 5 - Air conditioning wastes gas
Temperatures are in the triple digits in some places nationwide and if you have air conditioning , of course you 're going to use it .
But you do n't have to feel guilty about cranking up your car 's AC .
According to Edmunds.com , the air conditioning compressor does pull power from the engine wasting some gas , but the effect is minimal in modern cars .
On the other hand , driving with your windows down at high speeds can create an aerodynamic drag .

Bayesian Critique of Statistics in Health
If you were going to have a heart attack , it seemed there was never a better time than the early 1990s .
Leading medical journals were regularly reporting results from trials of new treatments for heart attacks that were n't just good - they were incredible .
In September 1992 , the British Medical Journal published results from trials in Scotland of a clot - busting drug called anistreplase which suggested it could double the survival chances of a heart - attack victim .
The following year another " miracle cure " emerged : injections of magnesium , studies suggested , could also halve death rates .
Leading cardiologists hailed the injections as an " effective , safe , simple and inexpensive " treatment that could save the lives of thousands .
But then something odd began to happen .
In 1995 , The Lancet published the results of a huge international study of heart - attack survival rates among 58,000 patients - and the " amazing " life - saving abilities of magnesium injections had simply vanished .
Anistreplase fared little better : the current view is that its real effectiveness is barely half that originally claimed .
Other " amazing " heart drugs seem to have suffered the same fate , also mysteriously losing their potency once on the wards .
A study published last year in the BMJ compared death rates among cardiac patients in the early 1990s with those back in the early 1980s , in the Dark Ages before the advent of " clinically proven " heart - attack treatments .
What Dr Nigel Brown and his colleagues at Queen 's Medical Centre in Nottingham found was disconcerting : " Despite an increasing uptake of the ' proved ' treat - ments , in - patient mortality ... did not change . "
The death rate in 1992 was the same as in 1982 : 20 per cent - and double what had been found in the trials .
Scientists have invented a long list of excuses to account for the disappointments .
Some blame the fact that patients in clinical trials tend to - be hand - picked and ' fussed over by leading experts .
Others argue that patients arrived on wards too late for the wonder - drugs to work .
Or , perhaps the original trials simply had n't been big enough .
But there is another explanation , and its implications are so serious that scientists who understand them often refuse to go on the record to talk about them .
They have been discussed behind closed doors by leading scientific journals and academic institutions - only to be swept under the carpet .
Meanwhile , millions of pounds of taxpayers ' money are being wasted follow - ing up illusory breakthroughs .
At the centre of this scandal is a simple statistical technique used by scientists as the basis for suppoosed research brekthroughs .
It is called ' significance testing ' .
And it is fatally flawed .
When used to analyse clinical trials , significance testing can easily double the apparent effectiveness of a new drug , and turn a borderline result into a " significant " breakthrough .
It can throw up convincing - yet utterly spurious - evidence for links between diseases and any number of supposed causes .
But even more astonishing than these dangerous flaws is the fact that experts have been warning about the methodology for more than 30 years - but the scientific community has refused to act .
In the meantime , a host of implausible " breakthroughs " , which raise the hopes of patients and families , are announced with a fanfare ... and then quietly disappear .
Take another case .
In 1994 , Dr Michael Mendall and colleagues at St George 's Hospital Medical School , London , made the claim that heart disease was linked to a bacterium in the human stomach .
Quite how a bug in the stomach could possibly damage the heart was far from obvious .
No matter : the standard textbook statistical tests pointed to a " significant " link .
The existence of the link was confirmed by other studies - again using the standard statistical tests .
But last November , a team at Bart 's Hospital published the results of the biggest - ever investigation into the link .
And it had simply vanished .
A similar story surrounds claims that emerged in the mid-1980s that aspirin could prevent pre-eclampsia , a potentially fatal condition that affects up to one in seven pregnant women .
By the early 1990s , many studies seemed to confirm the theory , reporting a far lower rate of pre- eclampsia among women given low doses of aspirin .
Once again , no one knew why it should work - the cause of pre-eclampsia is unknown - but the findings were still " statistically significant " .
In 1994 , however , the aspirin and pre-eclampsia link went the same way as claims for stomach bugs and heart disease : a major international study failed to find what the small studies had seen .
Health scares offer further evidence of the exaggerating effect of significance tests .
Claims of a link between living near pylons and leukaemias in children have been made since the 1970s .
The most impressive evidence emerged in 1992 , when a team from the well - respected Karo - linska institute of Stockholm found a " highly significant " increase of three - to four - fold in the risk of leukaemias .
Again , quite why the risk should be so huge was unclear - and yet again , when the biggest - ever study into the claim was published last year , the link had evaporated .
Vitamin K injections and leukaemias ; silicone breast implants and connective - tissue disease ; salt and high blood pressure ; passive smoking and lung cancer - the list of statistically based public " scares " goes on .
Just why has the scientific community failed to act ?
The answer lies in its squeamishness about subjectivity .
It is hard to convey the strength of emotion aroused within the scientific community by the " S - word " .
Subjectivity is seen as the barbarian at the gates of science , the enemy of objective truth .
So when , in the 1920s , the brilliant Cambridge mathematician and geneticist Ronald Aylmer Fisher came up with an apparently objective way of drawing conclusions from experiments , it was seized upon by the scientific community .
In 1925 , Fisher published his techniques in a book , Statistical Methods for Research Workers .
It has become one of the most influential texts in the history of science , and forms the foundation of virtually all the statistics now used by scientists .
Its methods are taught today .
On the face of it .
Fisher had found techniques anyone - sceptic or advocate - could use to prove the significance of a new finding .
Critical to Fisher 's method is the so - called P - value - defined as the chances of getting at least as impressive evidence as that actually seen if mere fluke were at work .
These P - values are worked out mathematically from the raw experimentla data .
According to Fisher , if the resulting P - value is below 0.05 , then it is safet to label a finding " significant " .
Combining simplicity and apparent objectivity , Fisher 's P - value method was an immediate hit and its popularity endures to this day .
Open any leading scientific journal and you will see the phrase , P less than 0.05 in papers on every conceivable area of research , form astronomy to zoology .
Indeed , national governments , including ours , still use Fisher 's standard to decide whehter a new life - saving drug should be approved for use .
But no sooner were P - values taken up throughout the scientific community than other statisticians began to ask some awkward questions .
Most importantly , just how did Fisher know that his figure of 0.05 was a safe point at which to declare a result ' significant ' ?
Incredibly , as Fisher himself admitted , he did n't know at all .
He simply chose the figure of 0.05 because , he said , it was ' convenient ' .
The implications are stark .
It means that vital scientific questions - whether a new heart drug is seen as effective or whether breast implants trigger disease , for example - are being decided by an entirely arbitrary standard .
The first hints of this appalling flaw in Fisher 's methods emerged as long ago as the early 1960s , following a resurgence of interest in a 200 - year - old mathematical formula known as Bayes 's Theorem .
Put simply , Bayes discovered a mathematical recipe for working out how to update one 's belief in a theory as new evidence emerges .
It was a fundamental discovery , for Bayes 's Theorem gave scientists a way of working out just how much more plausible their theories become as the data rolls in .
There was a problem , however : Bayes 's Theorem revealed that before any new finding can be deemed ' significant ' , a crucial factor must be included : its plausibility .
Non-scientists may hardly regard that as a problem at all : surely it makes sense to gauge just how plausible a result is before declaring it a breakthrough ?
But within the scientific community , Bayes 's Theorem acquired a reputation for being dangerously subversive .
Its insistence on plausibility means that different people can reach different conclusions about the ' significance ' of findings .
And that has tainted Bayes 's Theorem with that most repellent concept known to scientists : subjectivity .
Regardless of how awful they found Bayes 's Theorem , however , scientists could not evade it .
And its implications for Fisher 's P - values turn out to be grave indeed .
In the 1960s , at the University of Michigan , a team of statisticians including Prof Leonard Savage - one of the most distinguished experts on probability - showed that P - values were easily capable of boosting the apparent significance of implausible results by a factor of 10 or more .
They went on to issue a warning that P - values were ' startlingly prone ' to attribute significance to fluke results . '
Despite being published in the prestigious Psychological Review , the warning went unheeded .
Over the next 30 years , other statisticians also sounded the alarm bell , again without effect .
During the 1980s , Prof James Berger of Purdue University - a world authority on Bayes 's Theorem - published an entire series of papers alerting researchers to the " astonishing " tendency of the standard statistical tests to mislead .
' Significant evidence ' , " Berger warned , " can actually arise when the data provide very little or no evidence in favour of an effect . "
The warning could not have been clearer .
But again , it was ignored .
In 1986 , one scientist decided to take direct action against the failings of Fisher 's methods .
Prof Kenneth Rothman , of the University of Massachusetts , editor of the respected American Journal of Public Health , made a bold stand and told all researchers wanting to publish in the journal that he would no longer accept results based on P - values .
It was a simple move that had a dramatic effect : the teaching in America 's leading public health schools was transformed with statistics courses revised to train students in alternatives to Fisher 's formula .
But two years later , when Rothman stepped down from the editorship , his baon on P - values was dropped , and researchers went straight back to their bad old ways .
The story in Britain has been similar .
In 1995 , The British Psychological Society and its counterpart in America quietly set up a working party to consider introducing a ban on P - values in its journals .
The following year , the working party was disbanded - having made no decision .
' The view was that it would cause too much upheaval for the journals , ' said one senior figure .
All research submitted would have to be vetted by a panel of statisticians .
Leading British medical journals have also considered taking decisive action - but they too have shied away .
Instead , they are quietly trying to nudge researchers towards alternative ways of stating findings .
The most popular are known as " confidence intervals " yet tbese too are known to suffer from similar flaws to P- values , exaggerating both the size of implausible effects and their significance .
Now , more than 30 years after the first warnings were sounded , it is clear that the scientific community has no intention of taking decisive action to tackle the critical flaws in Significance Testing .
It has grown used to seeing its supposed breakthroughs come and go : the flaky claims of health risks from a host of implausible causes , the " wonder - drugs " that lose their amazing abilities outside clinical trials .
Taking action would mean ' radical re-training , " some scientists lamely argue .
Curiously for a profession supposedly dedicated to discovering truths , the reliability of research findings is never mentioned .
It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the real explanation for all the endless evasion is not scientific at all .
It is simply that if scientists abandon significance tests like P - values , many of their claims would be seen for what they really are : meaningless aberrations on which taxpayers ' money should never have been spent .
The plain fact is that 70 years ago Ronald Fisher gave scientists a mathematical machine for turning baloney into breakthroughs , and flukes into funding .
It is time to pull the plug .

Electronic
Arts has been riding high over the last couple of years , absorbing development studios left and right and signing exclusive deals with major league sports franchises such as the NFL .
However , one analyst is predicting that there may be trouble ahead for the video game giant .
Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson told investors this morning that " poor reviews and quality are beginning to tarnish the EA brand . "
Wilson pointed to a survey his company had made that utilized the aggregate game ratings available at GameRankings.com .
The study indicated that EA 's overall game quality is continuing to fall .
" Reviews of all of EA 's annualized titles , its primary source of profit , have declined over the past two years , " Wilson said .
" Although market share has not declined dramatically to date , in years such as 2007 , which promises to have tremendous competition , it seems likely if quality does not improve .
EA 's aggregate review has also declined significantly in the past two years . "
The games that Wilson identified as having significant quality declines over the last few years were the Need for Speed franchise and NBA Live .
He also pointed to recent titles that have received very poor reviews , such as Superman Returns , Batman Begins , Marvel Nemesis , NFL Head Coach , and Arena Football .
While poor reviews do not necessarily translate into poor game sales , Wilson is concerned that over time , the perception that EA titles are declining in quality could impact on the company 's fortunes .
The analyst is still positive about EA in general , however , calling them " the marquee developer and publisher of video games . "
What has caused EA 's fall from grace ?
Having worked at the company a few years previously , I can say that the fault is not due to the programmers , artists , or testers , who were for the most part hard - working and competent employees .
In fact , as people like ea_spouse found out , they often worked harder than their counterparts in other companies .
Like the captain of a ship , it is the people at the top who should shoulder the responsibility for the decline of game quality .
The reason for this is that management has been prioritizing marketing at the expense of everything else .
Let me give you a concrete example of this .
When I was working on testing the user interface elements for EA games , I was handed an enormous , five - inch bound binder with the title " Circular Energy . "
The book was incredibly professional , a near work of art : full of glossy color diagrams and long sections of text that waxed poetic about the power of " circular energy " and how it would transform the EA brand with its near - magical power .
Essentially , it was a guide for making sure every aspect of the user interface , documentation , and packaging was effused with the same swirling visual style .
It must have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce .
The sheer amount of effort and time put into such a trivial design element ( EA abandoned the whole " circular energy " nonsense a couple of years later anyway ) was an indication of how the entire company was driven by marketing .
All important decisions , such as how long a game was given for development , were subject to approval by the marketing people .
A manager once told me that their studies showed that most people only bought an EA sports game once every two years on average , so there was little point in putting extra effort into improving the games in the " off - years . "
Movie tie - in games are scheduled to come out with the release of the movie , rather than when development is finished and the game is ready .
An EA representative responded to Mitchell 's report with the following statement : " The EA brand is strong with great games from franchises that continue to break sales records .
Across the portfolio , EA always strives to drive innovation and quality into its titles .
EA continues to invest in next - generation development and technology which will translate into high quality gaming throughout the next console cycle . "
Clearly the company refuses to even admit the possibility of having a problem .
Much like the US car manufacturers in the 70s and 80s , the corporate heads are convinced that the power of the brand will always trump any questions about quality .
History tells us that this is not always the case .
Brand identity can carry a company far , but brands are not invulnerable .
Of course , there are some who will claim that game ratings do n't matter , and they may have a point .
However , video game analysts are not necessarily ignored by the industry either .
Ultimately , it is up to the consumers to decide whether or not quality matters in their entertainment .
It ’s been a remarkable year , even discounting the hype , and as it comes to a close we find the entire traditional IT industry in a weirdly precarious position .
In some ways , the traditional vendors seem to be going about their business in traditional ways , selling lots of gear and software licenses and maintenance contracts , pushing upgrades and service agreements – and making a pretty penny off all of it .
And yet the entire enterprise seems increasingly unreal .
Watching the IT business today feels kind of like watching one of those Roadrunner cartoons when Wile E. Coyote would race off a cliff and manage to tread air for a few long seconds , his legs moving in a blur , his mind not quite registering the fact that the ground had disappeared from beneath him .
Yesterday , Google put a suitable exclamation point to the end of 2006 when it announced that it was adding a domain registration option to its Apps for Your Domain service .
Small businesses , schools , and other organizations will now be able to buy and set up a domain when they sign up for the Google service .
And the other elements of that service will be immediately and automatically configured to run on that domain .
The cost for the registration is a flat $ 10 a year .
There ’s nothing at all interesting about that price – it ’s pretty much what you ’d pay if you registered your domain yourself ( and Microsoft will even give you a domain for free through its Office Live service ) .
But I find that , by further simplifying the creation of what amounts to a virtual data center , the move brings into clearer view the future landscape of business IT .
It ’s pretty amazing to think about what a company can now get for $ 10 a year :
A complete , web - based IT infrastructure for its business A custom corporate portal / intranet for its employees Corporate e-mail service Corporate instant messaging Calendar software and services Web - site design software Web - site hosting
And , by incorporating some other free Google services , the company also gets :
Word - processing software Spreadsheet software Web - site analytics
All the necessary storage , data backups , security , maintenance , and related services are included in the $ 10 price .
Other than some cheap PCs , a printer , and maybe a bookkeeping application , that pretty much covers all the information technology that most companies on earth require to run their businesses .
( And I ’ll bet the bookkeeping app will arrive soon , perhaps through a partnership with Intuit . )
So , if you ’re a small business or a school or a nonprofit , that ’s your new annual IT budget : ten bucks .
Why spend more ?
And if you ’re a bigger company , do n’t fret .
As competition among Google , Microsoft , and many others heats up , innovation in software services will only accelerate .
This is just the beginning .

TSA " Terrorist " Turns Out To Be A Homeward - Bound Marine
by ANN Senior Correspondent Kevin R.C. " Hognose " O'Brien
The Transportation Security Administration bagged a terrorist in Los Angeles International Airport Tuesday , or so they thought .
Daniel Brown 's name came up on their no -fly watchlist , so they dragged him into interrogation and grilled him , despite the protestations of Brown and his fellow travelers , who swore they could vouch for him .
The others in Brown 's party went on their Northwest Airlines flight to Minneapolis - St.
Paul , where they waited on a bus at the airport .
You see , the detained man was Staff Sergeant Daniel Brown , USMC Reserve , and he was traveling with the other members of his Marine Reserve Military Police unit , which was heading home to Minnesota from eight months of combat in Iraq .
The Marines were in full uniform and all , including Brown , had travel orders and military identification cards .
After attempts to stonewall under claims of " security , " TSA spokesmen finally admitted that Staff Sergeant Daniel Brown was placed on the no-fly list , and ultimately detained , because they had detected gunpowder on his footgear -- not on this flight , but on a prior flight , which earned Brown a permanent place on the TSA 's mysterious terrorist lists .
The footgear that had been exposed to gunpowder ?
Brown 's combat boots , and the occasion of that flight was after his return from his first combat tour in Iraq .
Gee ... a combat Marine in Al - Anbar Province being exposed to gunpowder .
Exposure to gunpowder is n't something the TSA knows a lot about .
Hey , who are you gonna believe , this here watchlist or your lyin ' eyes ?
Ultimately , the TSA screeners figured out that Brown really was a Marine , and no threat to his fellow passengers , and let him board a later flight .
When he deplaned at MSP , his unit 's bus was waiting -- his fellow Marines in it .
Marine 1st Sgt. Drew Benson explained why .
" We do n't leave anybody behind .
We start together , and we finish together . "
All 26 Marines waited for Brown -- even though their families were waiting for them at a scheduled welcome - home bash at Fort Snelling .
Brown 's mother Terry was glad they did .
" They all come back together ... no matter what it takes and I think that 's very important , " she told WCCO - TV .
Frequent TSA critic Richard A. Altomare , Founder and Chairman of the Coalition for Luggage Security -- and a former marine -- said , " I 'm proud that Sergeant Dan Brown 's Marine unit refused to report to their post until the ' man left behind ' was permitted to get on a passenger plane .
This TSA 's bloated bureaucracy with documented insensitive treatment of countless Americans really rings home a need to dismantle their growing airport agency before all American freedoms are lost -- since now even the United States Marines can't help us . "
The TSA watch lists are shrouded in such secrecy that it 's impossible to tell if they have done any good .
The TSA refuses to say how people get on the list or even how many are on .
On the other hand , the absurdities of the list have been well publicized .
Senator Ted Kennedy , former child actor David Nelson , and other celebrities have turned up on the list .
( TSA explained to Sen .
Kennedy that there was a terrorist who once used " T. Kennedy " as an alias .
" T " is not one of the Senator 's initials ; his full name is Edward Moore Kennedy ) .
Some of our own writers were placed on the list after we ran several Aero - Views critical of TSA management .
In the last few weeks , a DHS official originally recruited by TSA was in the news after being caught in a child sex sting ; as Aero - News reported , before joining TSA he took early retirement from Time magazine after a porn scandal there .
Last month , a classified Government Accountability Office report leaked to NBC News reportedly revealed that security testers were able to bring bomb - making materials through TSA security at 21 of 21 airports tested .
But the TSA will not strike its colors ; it has not yet begun to fight .
Boston TSA head George Naccara told CSO
Online , a magazine for security executives , last month that the TSA needed to extend its unique approach to security to other modes of transport : " subway stations , rail terminals , cruise ship and ferry docks , even special events like conventions . "
" TSA was never clearly given a mandate to focus only on aviation , " Naccara said .
" I want to bring a sense of urgency to other modes and explain to them what we do and how it can be adapted to work in their environments . "
Meanwhile , does the Marine of the hour have any words ?
Turns out he does .
" As somebody who has served 16 months over in Iraq for the U.S. Marine Corps and come home and get hassled by TSA , it 's kind of a major disappointment , " Daniel Brown told TV station WCCO .
" I 've been fighting terrorism for the last 16 months in Iraq .
I do n't think I should have to come home and deal with this . "
Brown 's father Carey echoed his son's sentiments .
" For an individual who spent two tours over in Iraq fighting for his country , I think it 's one of the biggest bogus things they could ever come up with . "
WIth luck , no one at TSA will take that as a challenge .
The University of California is facing legal action in the US for promoting a commonly - held scientific theory .
Jeanne and Larry Caldwell are suing the university over its " Understanding Evolution " website which offers information and advice to teachers .
The Caldwells run a Californian lobby group called Quality Science Education for All !
which promotes " education that exposes students to the scientific strengths and weaknesses of evolutionary theory . "
It has taken legal action against several states over the content of school books .
The lawsuit accuses the University website of misusing federal funds and says that by linking to religious groups which do not object to evolution it is somehow akin to teaching religion and therefore breaches the first amendment .
The Vatican 's chief astronomer Rev. George Coyne recently said intelligent design " is n't science , even though it pretends to be " .
He said if it was to be taught in schools it should be part of the religious or cultural affairs classes not science .
Fundamentalist Christians in the US take a different view .
The California site , which you can visit here .
if you 're feeling brave , is run by the University 's paleantology department and the National Centre for Science Education .
The website is Not Safe for Fundamentalists .
The Caldwells deny they are " Intelligent Designers " ( AKA ' creationists with a website ' ) .
Jeanne Caldwell told the San Jose Mercury News : " Yes , I am a Christian , but I would not characterise myself as an ID proponent .
I believe God created the world . "
Maybe he means
God made the world but he did n't design it intelligently ...
Intelligent design was most famously promoted by William Paley using the analogy of a blind watchmaker in 1802 .
Darwin was an early fan . ®
Martin Eberhard holds the brake down with his left foot and presses on the accelerator with his right .
The motor revs , the car strains against the brake .
I hear … almost nothing .
Just a quiet whine like the sound of a jet preparing for takeoff 5 miles away .
We ’re belted into a shimmering black sports car on a quiet , tree - lined street in San Carlos , California , 23 miles south of San Francisco .
It has taken Eberhard three years to get this proto - type ready for mass production , but with the backing of PayPal cofounder Elon Musk , Google ’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin , and ex-eBay chief Jeff Skoll , he has created Silicon Valley ’s first real auto company .

“ You see any cops ? ” Eberhard asks , shooting me a mischievous look .
The car is vibrating , ready to launch .
I ’m the first journalist to get a ride .
He releases the brake and my head snaps back .
One - one - thousand : I get a floating feeling , like going over the falls in a roller coaster .
Two - one - thousand :
The world tunnels , the trees blur .
Three - one - thousand :
We hit 60 miles per hour .
Eberhard brakes .
We ’re at a standstill again – elapsed time , nine seconds .
When potential buyers get a look at the vehicle this summer , it will be among the quickest production cars in the world .
And , compared to other supercars like the Bugatti Veyron , Ferrari Enzo , and Lamborghini Diablo , it ’s a bargain .
More intriguing :
It has no combustion engine .
The trick ?
The Tesla Roadster is powered by 6,831 rechargeable lithium - ion batteries – the same cells that run a laptop computer .
Range : 250 miles .
Fuel efficiency : 1 to 2 cents per mile .
Top speed : more than 130 mph .
The first cars will be built at a factory in England and are slated to hit the market next summer .
And Tesla Motors , Eberhard ’s company , is already gearing up for a four - door battery - powered sedan .
In an age when a car ’s electronics are worth more than its steel , it seems only natural that the tech sector would have its own car company .
The question is , can Eberhard turn the digital era into horsepower , torque , and rpm ?
Eberhard has never designed a car and has no experience building one .
He created the Rocket eBook , a handheld digital book reader that came to market in the late ’90s .
But he insists his eBook background is relevant to starting a car company .
The device used a rechargeable battery , and Eberhard – an electrical engineer – devoted himself to maximizing run time and minimizing weight .
In 2000 , his venture , NuvoMedia , was bought by TV Guide ’s parent company , which quickly abandoned the product .
But Eberhard was flush with cash and decided to buy himself a new sports car .
He wanted something that was fast but still got good mileage .
He quickly learned that high performance and fuel efficiency are mutually exclusive , at least when it comes to internal combustion engines .
So he started researching alternative technologies and soon realized it was actually possible for an electric car to combine zip and efficiency .
The problem : Nobody was making one .
The EV1 , General Motors ’ electric car , had failed , in part because it was expensive and poorly marketed .
Most crippling , though , was the underperformance of the original lead - acid batteries and even the second - gen nickel metal hydride cells .
Consumers wanted a vehicle that had a range greater than the EV1 ’s ( at best ) 130 miles .
The common wisdom was that batteries just were n’t there yet .
But what did Detroit know about batteries ?
Eberhard had squeezed 20 hours of run time out of the little power pack on his eBook .
Battery efficiency was an obsession among computer engineers , who were extracting more power from ever - smaller cells with each generation of laptops .
GM seemed oblivious to the lessons emerging from the electronics industry .
Eberhard began to think that if anybody was going to build a viable electric car , it would be a Silicon Valley engineer .
Then , after reading biographies of John DeLorean and Preston Tucker , and reminding himself that launching a car company was a crazy idea , he did just that .
The central concept of Tesla Motors , founded in July 2003 , is that there is no need to reinvent the battery , particularly for a product with a small initial market .
Eberhard simply adopted the lithium - ion technology used in laptops and harnessed the momentum of the computer industry .
Let Dell , HP , and the rest of the sprawling PC business , with their billions of R&D dollars , do the hard work of extending battery life and driving down prices .
He ’d piggyback on their innovations .
Meanwhile , automakers had been dis-mantling some of the biggest barriers to entering the business .
To lower production costs , the Big Three had outsourced much of their parts manufacturing over the past 25 years .
An upstart could buy just about everything it needed to mass - produce a car from independent suppliers .
A fledgling electric car company had other advantages , too : Tighter emissions standards have raised the cost of developing gas - powered cars , and buyers of low - emission vehicles are lured by big tax breaks .
In the spring of 2004 , Eberhard embarked on a series of meetings with venture capital firms along Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park .
He argued that a combustion engine is an antiquated technology and that electric vehicles are dramatically more energy - efficient than their gas - guzzling counter - parts .
“ If you took the energy in a gallon of gas and used it to spin a turbine , you ’d get enough electricity to drive an electric car 110 miles , ” he says in a characteristically enthusiastic rush , trying to squeeze in too many words between breaths .
More important , Eberhard says , the electric cars of the past – slow , cramped , spartan – looked like they were designed by people who thought you should n’t be driving to begin with .
Eberhard calls them “ punishment cars . ”
What he wanted to build , he told his potential investors , was a classic sports car .
He wanted to have his ecofriendly ride and race it , too .
Initially , the Sand Hill VCs were n’t interested .
Eberhard got his first bite from Elon Musk , cofounder of PayPal , who – over the course of two years – put in nearly $ 30 million of his own money and also corralled some of his wealthy entrepreneur friends to chip in .
By May 2006 , Tesla Motors had raised $ 60 million .
Now Eberhard had to get the car into production .
Just before Christmas 2004 , 30 employees and board members from Tesla came to Eberhard ’s Woodside , California , house to decide what the car would look like .
He had commissioned four top automotive designers to draw sketches , which he taped to his living room wall .
He gave everyone three red stickers and three green and told them to flag what they liked and did n’t like .
By the time the eggnog was gone , the green dots had coalesced around a drawing by Barney Hatt of Lotus Design in England .
This is how a Silicon Valley startup does car design .
Lotus had manufactured cars for GM , in addition to its own lightweight aluminum sports car , the Elise .
So Eberhard contracted the company to assemble his new vehicle , codenamed Dark Star ( after a classic low - budget sci - fi movie ) .
The electric motor would be built in Taiwan , and engineering and R&D would be conducted in a San Carlos warehouse .
The space had offices in the front , and Eberhard began to fill the cubicles with dotcom veterans .
Mike Harrigan , the man in charge of setting up a nationwide network of auto maintenance centers , had previously founded two communications equipment makers .
Gretchen Joyce , vice president in charge of sales , had spent the previous four years at eBay .
There was no doubt that this was going to be a different kind of car company .
What Eberhard did n’t know about car manufacturing – which was just about everything – he got by hiring engineers and executives away from Lotus .
Eventually , he lured so many Lotus employees that the British company insisted he sign a no-poaching agreement or it would n’t build the car .
For three years , Tesla Motors ran in stealth mode .
Because electric cars had failed so visibly in the late ’90s , the company knew it faced a tough marketing challenge , and Eberhard did n’t want to show the world something half - baked .
If Tesla was to succeed , it would need to present a fully realized , radically different approach .
Luckily , there was little threat of car spies ruining the surprise .
“ Silicon Valley is a great place to run a secret car company , ” Eberhard says .
“ Nobody expected something to sprout up in Northern California , so no one came looking . ”
Eberhard owes his radically different approach to Nikola Tesla , the iconic Serbian engineer who built the first AC induction motor in the 1880s .
Eberhard ’s supercharged update of that motor is powered by a copper and steel rotor that is spun by a magnetic field .
There are no moving parts besides the rotor .
Step on the accelerator and the motor delivers instantaneously .
An onboard computer provides traction control , keeping the car from burning rubber .
The result : 0 to 60 in about four seconds .
And , since the motor is not limited by the complexity of pistons moving up and down , it can spin much faster .
Porsche ’s top - of - the - line model – the $ 440,000 Carrera GT – maxes out at 8,400 rpm ; the Tesla Roadster has a ceiling of 13,500 , enabling it to go 70 mph in first gear .
( It has two gears , plus reverse . )
The Roadster ’s sporty styling allowed Eberhard to maximize the car ’s range and still win a drag race .
With its two - person capacity and aerodynamic contours , the lightweight machine can go 250 miles on a single charge .
( When connected to a special 220 - volt , 70 - amp outlet , recharging takes about three and a half hours . )
Plus , the sports car class lets Eberhard price it on the high end – in the range of a Porsche 911 Carrera S , roughly $ 80,000 .
Of course , an expensive two - seater is n’t going to have much effect on an industry that sells 17 million automobiles in the US each year .
Sure , every VC will have to get one , and George Clooney will probably be seen piloting one down Sunset Boulevard .
But selling a few thousand cars wo n’t help Eberhard build a dominant 21st - century car company .
That ’s why he ’s already preparing a sedan , codenamed White Star , which could hit streets as early as 2008 .
Of course , the sedan wo n’t be as lightweight or aerodynamic as the Roadster , so its range is likely to drop significantly .
Eberhard ’s response : maybe with today ’s tech .
But battery power is improving steadily , and several companies say they may soon double battery life .
By the time the sedan comes out , he says , batteries will be ready to deliver : “ We ’re going to ride that technology curve all the way home . ”
A cop drives by , and Eberhard smiles benignly as the Roadster edges forward silently from a stop sign .
It ’s an eerie , disconcerting feeling .
There ’s no engine hum – nothing to make you think that this car should be sold with a neck brace .
Most high - performance cars telegraph their power .
That ’s part of the allure of a seriously fast car – you can hear it coming .
The Roadster seems like a sneak attack .
As with everything about this car , Eberhard has a fast answer .
“ Some people are going to miss the sound of a roaring engine , ” he says , “ just like people used to miss the sound of horse hooves clippity - clopping down the street . ”
Eberhard suggests it would be easy enough to pump MP3s of prerecorded engine roar into the car ’s Blaupunkt stereo .
And for those with even older tastes , the sound of horse hooves could be substituted .
But damn if that horse is n’t going to sound strange at 13,500 rpm .
The treaty could hit what you can record
The World Intellectual Property Organisation 's Broadcast Treaty began several years ago as an initiative to address signal theft .
It came out of broadcaster 's concerns that the international legal framework did little to protect against the theft or misuse of their television and radio signals .
While the content of most broadcasts is protected by copyright , broadcasters do not always hold that copyright .
Movie studios , television production companies or sports leagues typically retain the copyright in original television programming .
Broadcasters pay for the exclusive right to transmit the programs .
Private broadcasters use the programs to attract an audience and generate advertising revenues .
Stolen stream
If the programs are stolen - for example , the signals retransmitted by another party without permission , sold as an unauthorized DVD or performed publicly without the requisite license - the copyright owner may assert their rights , but in some countries the broadcasters are left with limited ability to protect their interests .
What started as an attempt to address this relatively narrow issue has since mushroomed into a massive treaty that would grant broadcasters in some countries many new rights .
The impact of the treaty on individuals and creators could be dramatic
Michael Geist
Some countries have begun to raise questions about the adverse consequences of certain provisions .
During the last major round of talks in the spring , the Canadian delegation wondered aloud whether the treaty would create a danger that some broadcasts might never fall into the public domain , effectively creating a perpetual broadcasting right .
Others have pointed out that the exceptions and limitations to the new treaty rights , a hallmark of a balanced policy approach , would be optional for countries that adopt the treaty .
Costly proposal
The impact of the treaty on individuals and creators could be dramatic , potentially making it more difficult to record television shows for viewing at a later time , locking up content that is otherwise in the public domain , and necessitating that film makers obtain twice as many consents for the re-use of broadcast clips .
The potential cost of the new rights is also significant .
For example , Canadian broadcast distributors , including the major telecommunications companies that have begun offering HDTV , fear that the new retransmission right alone could result in more than a half billion dollars in new royalty payments flowing out of Canada to U.S. broadcasters .
The treaty could have an impact on what we watch
When it became apparent in the spring that including webcasters within the treaty would result in a stalemate given many countries reluctance to expand the treaty beyond conventional broadcasting , that issue was moved to a separate track .
Despite that compromise , delegations have sought to bring the internet back into the picture , with the US recently raising the prospect of adding " netcasting , " while the European Union has focused on " simulcasting " .
With the prospect of a diplomatic conference looming ( the final stage in the treaty - making process and a sure sign that agreement may be imminent ) , a coalition of critics of the proposed treaty , which included Dell , HP , Intel , Sony , AT&T and Verizon as well as library associations , and civil rights groups , went on the offensive last week .
The coalition outlined a series of concerns , most notably arguing that the treaty is a solution in search of a problem .
Secret meeting
The broadcasting industry has thrived in recent years with an explosion of new services and revenue streams .
Given this success , the coalition observed that there does not appear to be any compelling need to provide the industry with a basket of additional rights .
In addition to the treaty 's substantive shortcomings , the manner in which it has evolved is also cause for concern .
Broadcasters are looking for big hits like The Office
Other countries have been even more secretive .
While the USPTO was conducting its meeting , Canadian government officials held a closed conference call with a select group of stakeholders to update them on the current status of the treaty negotiations .
Canada has not conducted any public consultations on the treaty nor issued any public statements articulating a definitive Canadian position .
Broadcasters regularly unveil new television programs , hopeful that a handful will emerge as the next Seinfeld or The Office .
Programs that fail to quickly find an audience , face the prospect of cancellation .
In this regard , the broadcast industry clearly understands the need to cut its losses by putting an end to programs that are not working .
Unfortunately , the same cannot be said for those negotiating the unnecessary and potentially harmful WIPO Broadcast Treaty .

Civilisations is a multi-dimensional picture of human history , where you 're in charge of the timeline .
It uses web technology to reveal the sweep of historical forces and the rise and fall of great empires and ideas over 5000 years in a way that no book could ever do .
And it does it your way .
You can customise Civilisations to show you the things that interest you .
The best way to understand Civilisations is to have a go .
Every effort has been made to depict empires accurately but the nature of the project sometimes required a generalisation of the data .
For instance , the map of Buddhism shows that Buddhists only lived in India in the first century , but isolated Buddhist communities may have existed elsewhere .
Now there 's a title to grab your attention !
But I 'm serious !
First , a little background on me : my PhD was one of the earliest on the automatic creation of optimizing compilers from formal machine descriptions ( " Machine - Independent Generation of Optimal Local Code " , CMU Computer Science Department , 1975 ) .
After my PhD , I spent three years at CMU as a senior researcher on the C.mmp multiprocessor computer system which used our home - grown Hydra operating system , a secure , capability - based operating system .
I then went back to compiler research on the PQCC ( Production Quality Compiler - Compiler ) project , which ultimately led to the formation of Tartan Laboratories ( later , just Tartan , and now absorbed by Texas Instruments ) , a compiler company , where I was part of the tooling group .
I spent a decade - and - a - half writing and using performance measurement tooling .
This essay has several parts and represents much of my own experience .
The stories I tell are true .
The names have not been changed , although a couple are carefully omitted .
Optimization : When and What
A reasonably skilled programmer will not write a grossly inefficient program .
At least not deliberately .
Optimization is what you do when the performance is insufficient .
Sometimes the optimizations are easy , sometimes they are hard .
Sometimes they fly in the face of your original design , and sometimes they require that you grossly violate your beautiful abstractions in your class system .
But always , and I repeat , always , my experience has been that no programmer has ever been able to predict or analyze where performance bottlenecks are without data .
No matter where you think the time is going , you will be surprised to discover that it is going somewhere else .
You optimize because you have a problem in performance .
Sometimes it is computational optimization : your bitmap manipulation is just too slow .
Sometimes it is data access optimization : it just takes too long to get the data into the machine .
And sometimes it is algorithmic optimization : you 're doing it wrong .
If you do n't understand the difference between an n2 sort and an n log n sort , you 're probably already in trouble , but that knowledge alone is not useful .
Some years ago , I was working on a complex program which had to perform a semantic cross-check between the " statements " of the program and the " declarations " ( it was actually a 4GL constraint equation system , but the details do n't matter ) .
I discovered that the operation was of n3 complexity ( well , actually m * n2 , but m and n would be of comparable size most of the time ) .
There are three paths that you can follow here :
The naive path .
You do n't even realize you 've got an n 3 problem .
You 're probably in trouble , because if it is the bottleneck , you did n't know it was there .
problem .
You 're probably in trouble , because if it the bottleneck , you did n't know it was there .
The formal academic path .
You realize you 've got an n 3 problem , and know it is intrinsically evil , and rewrite your algorithms .
problem , and know it is intrinsically evil , and rewrite your algorithms .
The engineering path .
You realize you 've got an n3 problem , but you instrument the system to discover its actual impact on the system .
The only valid path to optimization is the engineering path .
I measured the performance , and on the largest " real " example we had , I discovered that n was almost always 1 , sometimes 2 , rarely 3 , and had exactly one instance of 4 .
This was too small to matter .
Sure , the algorithm was n3 , but with n that small , there was no need to rewrite the code .
Rewriting the code would have been incredibly complex , delayed the whole project for a couple weeks , and used up a couple pointers in each node of the tree in an already - tight minicomputer address space .
I also wrote the storage allocator that everyone used .
I spent a lot of hours tweaking its performance to be the fastest allocator of its class .
These adventures are detailed in the book IDL : The Language and its Implementation , now , alas , out of print .
( Nestor , Newcomer , Gianinni and Stone , Prentice - Hall , 1990 ) .
One group that used it used a " PC sampling " performance tool on Unix .
This is a performance tool that samples where the program counter ( PC ) is executing , and over a long execution derives a " density histogram " of where the program is spending its time .
It clearly showed that a massive amount of time was being spent in the storage allocator .
This made no sense to me , but fingers were being pointed in my direction .
So I wrote a little hook in the allocator that counted the number of times it was called .
It turns out it was called over 4,000,000 times .
No call took longer than the minimum measurement interval of 10µs ( approximately ten instructions on our 1 - MIPS machine ) , but 40,000,000 microseconds is 40 seconds .
Actually , it was more than that because there were 4,000,000 free operations as well , which were even faster , but still the resulting time was more than 50 % of the total execution time .
Why did this happen ?
Because , unknown to the programmers , a critical function they were calling in the inner loop of several algorithms would actually allocate a 5 - to - 10 byte working buffer , do its thing , and release it .
When we changed this to be a 10 - byte stack local , the time spent in the storage allocator dropped to about 3 % of the total program time .
Without the data , we would not have known why the allocator accounted for so much time .
PC - sampling performance tools are a very weak class of tools and their results are intrinsically suspect .
See my article " Profiling for Performance " , in Dr. Dobb 's Journal ( 18,1 ) January , 1993 , pp.80 - 87 .
A classic blunder in optimization was committed some years ago by one of the major software vendors .
We had their first interactive timesharing system , and it was a " learning experience " in a variety of ways .
One such experience was that of the FORTRAN compiler group .
Now any compiler writer knows that the larger the hash table you use for a symbol table , the better your performance on lookup will be .
When you are writing a multipass compiler in a 32 K mainframe , you end up using a relatively small symbol table , but you create a really , really good hash algorithm so that the probability of a hash collision is reduced ( unlike a binary seach , which is log n , a good hash table has constant performance , up to a certain density , so as long as you keep the density below this threshold you might expect that you will typically have an order 1 or 2 cost to enter or lookup a symbol , on the average .
A perfect hash table ( which is usually precomputed for constant symbols ) , has a constant performance between 1.0 and 1.3 or thereabouts ; if it gets to 1.5 you rework the hashing to get it lower ) .
So anyway , this compiler group discovers that they no longer have 32 K , or 128 K , or 512K .
Instead , they now have a 4GB virtual address space .
" Hey , let 's use a really big hash table ! " you can hear them saying , " Like , how about 1 MB table ? "
So they did .
But they also had a very sophisticated compiler technology designed for small and relatively dense hash tables .
So the result was that the symbols were fairly uniformly distributed over the 256 4 K pages in that 1MB , which meant that every symbol access caused a page fault .
The compiler was a dog .
When they finally went back to a 64 K symbol table , they found that although the algorithm had poorer " absolute " performance from a purely algorithmic viewpoint ( taking many more instructions to look up a symbol ) , because it did not cause nearly as many page faults , it ran over an order of magnitude faster .
So third - order effects do matter .
Also , beware of C . No , not the speed of light .
When we talk about performance , the algorithmic performance for n is expressed as a function C × f( n ) .
Thus an n2 algorithm is formally C × n2 , meaning that the performance is a constant multiple of the square of the number of elements being considered .
We shorten this to O ( n2 ) , meaning " order of n2 " , and in common parlance just drop the " order of " designation .
But never forget the C is there .
Some years ago , I was doing a project that produced summary set of listings , sorted in a variety of ways .
In the first attempt ( this was in the days before C and qsort ) I just did an ordinary bubble sort , an O ( n2 ) algorithm .
After initial testing , I fed it some live data .
Ten minutes later , after it had printed the console message " Starting reports " , it had not yet produced any reports .
A series of probes showed that most of the time was in the sort routine .
OK , I was done in by my laziness .
So I pulled out my trusty heapsort ( n log n ) sort and spent an hour modifying it to work in my application ( remember , I said qsort did not yet exist ) .
Having solved the problem , I started running it again .
Seven minutes into the report phase , nothing had yet appeared .
Some probes revealed something significant : it was spending most of its time in the equivalent of strcmp , comparing the strings .
While I 'd fixed the O issue , I had serious neglected the C issue .
So what I did was do one sort of the composite symbol table , all of the names , and then assigning an integer to each symbol structure .
Thereafter , when I had to sort a substructure , I just did an integer sort on its ordinal position .
This reduced C to the point where less than 30 seconds were required to do the entire report phase .
A second - order effect , but a significant one .
So algorithmic performance , particularly paging performance , can matter .
Unfortunately , we have neither the proper tools for measuring paging hits nor for reorganizing code to minimize paging of code pages .
Some performance tools measure the total time spent in user space , and treat kernel time as free .
This can mask the impact the application has on the kernel time .
For example , a few years ago we were measuring the performance of a program whose performance was exceptionally poor .
No " hotspot " showed up in terms of program time wasted .
However , at one point I was looking at the trace data and noticed that the input routine was called about a million times , which is not surprising when you are reading a megabyte of data , but something seemed odd to me .
I looked .
Each time it was called , it called the kernel to read a single byte of the file !
I changed it to read 8 K bytes and unpack the buffer itself , and got a factor of 30 performance improvement !
Note the lesson here : kernel time matters , and kernel transitions matter .
It is not accidental that the GDI in NT 4.0 is no longer a user - level process but integrated into the kernel .
The kernel transitions dominated the performance .
So what to optimize is easy : those parts of the program that are consuming the time .
But local optimizations that ignore global performance issues are meaningless .
And first - order effects ( total time spent in the allocator , for example ) , may not be the dominant effects .
Measure , measure , measure .
Living Well is the Best Revenge
( OK , this is really a sidebar , and a bit of an ego trip .
You can skip to the next section if you do n't want to read it .
You 've been warned ) .
Back in the early days of C , the C storage allocator was one of the worst - performing storage allocators in existence .
It was " first fit " , which meant that the way it worked was the allocator went traipsing down the free list , looking for a block at least as big as the one requested , and if it found one , it split it and returned the residue to the free list .
This had the advantages of being as slow as possible and fragmenting memory as badly as possible .
In fact , it was worse than you can imagine .
It actually walked the list of all blocks of storage , free and allocated , and had to ignore the allocated blocks .
So as you got more and more blocks , its performance degraded , and as the blocks got too small to be usable , they simply added to the overhead without adding to the value .
I was at CMU on a one - year research contract .
My first remark upon using the Unix environment was to turn to one of the people and say " How can you live this way ? "
The software technology in 1990 was exactly what it had been a decade previous when I left CMU , except that in the modern case the compiler did n't work ( it generated incorrect code for simple C constructs ) , the debugger did n't work , the backtrace ( being entirely a list of hex addresses with no symbols ) was useless , the linker did n't work , and there was n't anything resembling a decent document production system .
Other than these minor defects , I suppose it was an OK environment .
Having used Microsoft C , with CodeView , and even the earliest Visual C environment , I had certain high standards of what I expected out of my tooling , and Unix ( at least in that era ) fell short .
By miles .
I was , of course , outspoken on this subject .
One day we were discussing an algorithm , and it required doing some storage allocation .
I was assured that this was unacceptable because storage allocation was very expensive .
I said something like " Well , of course , if you use the brain - dead Unix allocator , you 're bound to have performance problems .
A decent storage allocator makes this a non-issue " .
One of the people at the meeting immediately challenged me : " I 'm sick of hearing you put down Unix .
What do you know about storage allocators , anyway ? " .
I said " hold that thought , I 'll be right back " .
I went to my office , where I had a copy of the IDL book , brought it back , and held it open to the chapter labeled " Storage allocation " .
" See this ? " " Yes " .
" What is the title of this chapter ? " " Storage allocation " .
I closed the book and pointed to the cover .
" Recognize this name ? " " Yes , of course , that 's you " .
" Fine .
I wrote that chapter .
It is on how to write a high - performance , minimum - fragmentation storage allocator .
So you asked what I know about storage allocation .
Well , I wrote the book on it . "
I was never again challenged when I put down Unix .
Just as an aside , the allocators used in NT work very much like the algorithm I described in the IDL book , which is based on the " quickfit " work that Chuck Weinstock did for his PhD dissertation at CMU around 1974 .
Do not do clever optimizations that have no meaning .
For example , people who try to " optimize " the GUI interface .
Hardwired constants , distributed enabling , cute algorithms .
The result is something that is hard to develop , difficult to debug , and absolutely impossible to maintain .
Optimization is meaningless here .
For more details , you might want to read my essay on the only sensible way I 've found to manage dialog controls .
I 'll summarize the key idea here .
Why does n't efficiency matter when you 're updating menus or controls ?
Look at the human factors .
A mouse is held approximately 2 feet from the ear .
Sound travels at approximately 1100 ft/sec .
This means that it takes approximately 2 ms for the sound of the mouse click or keystroke to reach the ear .
The neural path from the fingertip to the brain of an adult is approximately 3 feet .
Propagation of nerve impulses is approximately 300 ft/sec , meaning the sensation of the mouse click or keystroke takes approximately 10 ms to reach the brain .
Perceptual delay in the brain can add between 50 and 250 ms more .
Now , how many Pentium instructions can you execute in 2 ms , 10 ms , or 100 ms ?
In 2ms , on a 500MHz machine that 's 1,000,000 clock cycles , so you can execute a lot of instructions in that time .
Even on a now - clunky 120MHz
Pentium there is no noticeable delay in handling the controls .
This did not stop Microsoft from totally violating the C++ object model on message handlers ; if you call CWnd : : OnWhatever ( ... ) , instead of actually calling DefWindowProc with the parameters you provide , they re-use the parameters of the last message to call ::DefWindowProc .
The goal is to " reduce the size of the MFC runtime " , as if a few hundred instructions more in a massive DLL would matter !
Even I can figure out how to get CWnd : : OnAnything to inline - expand to a call on DefWindowProc .
Optimization is your enemy
Some many years ago , as I indicated in the introduction , I worked on a large ( 16 - processor ) multiprocessor system .
We were using custom - modified PDP - 11 minicomputers , which were relatively slow .
We were programming them in Bliss - 11 , which as far as I 've been able to tell still holds the record for the world 's tightest optimizing compiler ( although I 've seen some quite impressive optimizations in Microsoft C/ C ++ ) .
After doing some performance measurement , we determined that the paging algorithm was the outstanding performance bottleneck .
So our first assumption was that the paging algorithm was faulty .
We examined the code , and the paging algorithm maintainer rewrote it , taking our performance data into account , and had a new , and much faster , page management algorithm installed within a week .
Meanwhile , up at MIT , MULTICS was still running .
They traced a serious performance problem to the paging system .
Because it was written in a PL / 1 like language , EPL , the assumption was that because it was written in a high - level language , the code was suboptimal , so they launched an effort to rewrite the page management algorithm in assembly code .
A year later , the code was working , and was put into the production system .
Performance dropped 5 % .
Upon inspection , it was found that the fundamental algorithm was at fault .
They took the EPL code , rewrote the algorithm , and had the improved algorithm working and installed in a few weeks .
The lesson : do n't optimize something that is not the problem .
Understand the problem first .
Then , and only then , do the optimization .
Otherwise , the optimization is a waste of time and may even make the performance worse .
In the Bliss compiler , the ' register ' attribute on a variable said to the compiler " You will assign this variable to a register " .
In C , it means " I 'd like you to assign this variable to a register " .
Many programmers decided that they should put certain variables in registers to get better code .
But the Bliss compiler was very good ; it had a very sophisticated register allocation system , and in the absence of direction from the programmer felt free to assign a variable to a register if that produced the best code .
Explicitly assigning a variable to a register meant that the register was not available for common subexpressions , particularly those subexpressions implicit in data structure access .
After a fair amount of experiments , we determined that almost invariably adding ' register ' attributes to declarations produced significantly worse code than letting the compiler do the assignment .
For inner-loop code , many hours of effort would usually result in a small improvement in performance , but it was generally understood by the programmers that unless you studied the generated machine code and did a number of calibrated experiments , any attempts at optimization would make the code worse .
If you 've heard of the SPECmark performance , you may also be aware of how they are gamed .
In particular , IBM wrote a program that took a FORTRAN program as input , such as the SPEC matrix - multiply benchmark , and produced another FORTRAN program as output , but one which was optimized for the cache architecture of the machine it would run on .
A small number of parameters described all the cache strategies of each of the models of the RISC 6000 product line .
The " optimized " original FORTRAN program performed on one machine at 45 SPECmarks .
After being transformed , it performed on the same machine at over 900 SPECmarks .
That 's a factor of 20 performance improvement based solely on fourth - order effects , cache line hits .
If you 're doing image processing , particularly of large images , an awareness of cache issues ( even relatively machine - independent ) can buy you an order of magnitude performance .
A naive approach , optimizing at the code - line level , is not nearly as effective as higher - order optimizations .
Paging optimizations , cache line optimizations , and memory allocation optimizations can often have vastly more significant effects than code - line optimization .
Algorithmic optimizations are the next best bet , particularly if your problem is not amenable to paging / cache optimizations .
Only after all these have been done , and , of course , you have measured everything in sight , does it make sense to start doing line - level optimizations .
And if your problem domain demands it , it can even make sense to recode the inner loops , particularly of such algorithms as convolution algorithms and DSP algorithms , in assembly code , most often to take advantage of the instructions such as for MMX and streaming media .
Perhaps the best example of pure programmer stupidity in " optimizing " code occurred when I was porting a large library we used for our research project .
Think of it as a 16 - bit - to - 32 - bit port ( it was an 18 - bit - to - 36 - bit port , and the language was n't C , but the details do n't matter -- you can write ghastly code in any language , and I 've seen C programmers do things just as badly ) .
The port mostly worked , but we had a really strange problem that showed up only under some rare conditions , but which crashed the program using the library .
I started looking .
The heap was damaged .
When I found how the heap was being damaged , it was being damaged via a bad pointer which allowed a store into a random place in the heap .
OK , how did that pointer get bad ?
Four levels of storage damage down , and after 12 solid hours of debugging , I found the real culprit .
By why did it fail ?
Another 5 hours , and I found that the programmer who wrote the constructor code for the data structure had a struct - equivalent something like {char * p1 ; char * p2 ; } where the pointers had been 16 - bit , and we now used 32 - bit pointers .
In looking at the initialization code , instead of seeing something like something ->p1 = NULL ; something -> p2= NULL ; , I found the moral equivalent of ( *( DWORD * ) &something .
p1 ) = 0 !
When I confronted the programmer , he justified it by explaining that he was now able to zero out two pointers with only a single doubleword store instruction ( it was n't an x86 computer , but a mainframe ) , and was n't that a clever optimization ?
Of course , when the pointers became 32 - bit pointers , this optimization only zeroed one of the two pointers , leaving the other either NULL ( most of the time ) , or , occasionally , pointing into the heap in an eventually destructive manner .
I pointed out that this optimization happened once , at object creation time ; the average application that used our library created perhaps six of these objects , and that according to the CPU data of the day before I 'd spent not only 17 hours of my time but 6 hours of CPU time , and that if we fixed the bug and ran the formerly - failing program continuously , starting it up instantly after it finished , for fourteen years , the time saved by his clever hack would just about break even with the CPU time required to find and fix this piece of gratuitous nonsense .
Several years later he was still doing tricks like this ; some people never learn .
Summary
Optimization matters only when it matters .
When it matters , it matters a lot , but until you know that it matters , do n't waste a lot of time doing it .
Even if you know it matters , you need to know where it matters .
Without performance data , you wo n't know what to optimize , and you 'll probably optimize the wrong thing .
The result will be obscure , hard to write , hard to debug , and hard to maintain code that does n't solve your problem .
Thus it has the dual disadvantage of ( a ) increasing software development and software maintenance costs , and ( b ) having no performance effect at all .
Hard to beat that combination !

Mr Origer is now clear of his cancer
For Mark Origer , 53 , the treatment destroyed his tumour , enabling him to attend his daughter 's wedding .
The US National Cancer Institute team in Bethesda has also shown it can manipulate immune cells to attack breast , liver and lung cancers .
The modified T cells persisted in 15 other patients treated , but their malignant melanomas remained .
We 've identified T cell receptors that will now recognise common cancers
Lead researcher Dr Stephen Rosenberg
Q&A : Cancer gene therapy
Tests showed the genetically modified T cells used in the new treatment became specialised tumour fighters , the journal Science reports .
Although only two of the 17 people with advanced melanoma who received the treatment were completely free of cancer 18 months later , experts say the results are extremely exciting and proof that this new therapy can work .
How it works
Dr Stephen Rosenberg and his team isolated T cells from the cancer patients and multiplied them in the lab .
FIGHTING CANCER WITH GENES 1 Blood taken from patient
2 T cells infected with virus to carry key genes into them
3 DNA from genes helps cells develop receptors
4 Modified cells injected back into patient
5 Receptors target cancerous cells to be killed
Next they used a virus to carry receptor genes into the T cells .
These receptors are what enable the modified T cell to recognise specific cancers - in this case malignant melanoma .
When the modified T cells were transfused into the patients they began to attack the tumour cells .
For at least two months after the treatment , the modified cells made up at least 10 % of the patients ' circulating T cells .
The scientists are now looking at ways to enable greater numbers of the modified T cells to survive .
Dr Rosenberg said : " We 've identified T cell receptors that will now recognise common cancers . "
Disease free
For Mark Origer , 53 , the treatment completely eliminated his skin cancer and another tumour on his liver shrunk enough that it could be removed surgically .
These are preliminary but promising results
Professor John Toy of Cancer Research UK
The treatment meant he was well enough to attend his daughter 's wedding last year .
Last week , doctors pronounced him completely clear of cancer cells .
Another man , aged 39 , was able to clear the cancer that had spread to his liver , lymph nodes and lung .
Dr Michael Sadelain , director of the Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Centre 's somatic cell engineering laboratory , said : " This certainly is a significant technical advance . "
But he said the technique would need improving so more patients could benefit .
The success of this approach in two patients shows promise , however 15 patients did not respond to the treatment
Dr Edel O'Toole , British Skin Foundation spokesman
Professor Savio Woo , from Mount Sinai School of Medicine , said the treatment should now be tested in more patients .
Professor Robert Hawkins , professor in medical oncology at the University of Manchester , UK , said the results were very exciting .
" It seems to be effective , but it does seem to need improvement , " he added .
Dr Edel O'Toole , consultant dermatologist at the Centre for Cutaneous Research , Barts , and British Skin Foundation spokesman , said : " I think that the success of this approach in two patients shows promise , however 15 patients did not respond to the treatment suggesting that further work is needed to optimise this approach for all patients , which could take many years . "
Professor John
Toy , medical director at Cancer Research UK , said : " These are preliminary but promising results .
" It 's important to realise that we are not looking at a ' miracle cure ' for all cancers . "
Malignant melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer with 8,000 new cases per year in the UK and approximately 1,800 deaths .

Applications ERS altimeter survey shows growth of Greenland Ice Sheet interior
04/11/2005 2617 views 1 likes
Researchers have utilised more than a decade 's worth of data from radar altimeters on ESA 's ERS satellites to produce the most detailed picture yet of thickness changes in the Greenland Ice Sheet .
A Norwegian - led team used the ERS data to measure elevation changes in the Greenland Ice Sheet from 1992 to 2003 , finding recent growth in the interior sections estimated at around six centimetres per year during the study period .
The research is due to be published by Science Magazine in November , having been published in the online Science Express on 20 October .
ERS radar altimeters work by sending 1800 separate radar pulses down to Earth per second then recording how long their echoes take to bounce back 800 kilometres to the satellite platform .
The sensor times its pulses ' journey down to under a nanosecond to calculate the distance to the planet below to a maximum accuracy of two centimetres .
ERS in orbital configuration ESA has had at least one working radar altimeter in polar orbit since July 1991 , when ERS - 1 was launched .
ESA 's first Earth Observation spacecraft was joined by ERS - 2 in April 1995 , then the ten- instrument Envisat satellite in March 2002 .
The result is a scientifically valuable long - term dataset covering Earth 's oceans and land as well as ice fields – which can be used to reduce uncertainty about whether land ice sheets are growing or shrinking as concern grows about the effects of global warming .
Greenland 's east coast seen by Envisat
The ice sheet covering Earth 's largest island of Greenland has an area of 1 833 900 square kilometres and an average thickness of 2.3 kilometres .
It is the second largest concentration of frozen freshwater on Earth and if it were to melt completely global sea level would increase by up to seven metres .
The influx of freshwater into the North Atlantic from any increase in melting from the Greenland Ice Sheet could also weaken the Gulf Stream , potentially seriously impacting the climate of northern Europe and the wider world .
Efforts to measure changes in the Greenland Ice Sheet using field observations , aircraft and satellites have improved scientific knowledge during the last decade , but there is still no consensus assessment of the ice sheet 's overall mass balance .
There is however evidence of melting and thinning in the coastal marginal areas in recent years , as well as indications that large Greenland outlet glaciers can surge , possibly in response to climate variations .
Overall elevation changes over 11 years
Much less known are changes occurring in the vast elevated interior area of the ice sheet .
Therefore an international team of scientists - from Norway 's Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center ( NERSC ) , Mohn -Sverdrup Center for Global Ocean Studies and Operational Oceanography and the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research , Russia 's Nansen International Environmental and Remote Sensing Center and the United States ' Environmental Systems Analysis Research Center – were compelled to derive and analyse the longest continuous dataset of satellite altimeter observations of Greenland Ice Sheet elevations .
By combining tens of millions of data points from ERS - 1 and ERS - 2 , the team determined spatial patterns of surface elevation variations and changes over an 11 - year period .
The result is a mixed picture , with a net increase of 6.4 centimetres per year in the interior area above 1500 metres elevation .
Below that altitude , the elevation - change rate is minus 2.0 cm per year , broadly matching reported thinning in the ice - sheet margins .
The trend below 1500 metres however does not include the steeply - sloping marginal areas where current altimeter data are unusable .
Changes in Greenland Ice Sheet elevation , above and below 1500 m
The spatially averaged increase is 5.4 cm per year over the study area , when corrected for post - Ice Age uplift of the bedrock beneath the ice sheet .
These results are remarkable because they are in contrast to previous scientific findings of balance in Greenland 's high - elevation ice .
The team , led by Professor Ola M. Johannessen of NERSC , ascribe this interior growth of the Greenland Ice Sheet to increased snowfall linked to variability in regional atmospheric circulation known as the North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) .
First discovered in the 1920s , the NAO acts in a similar way to the El Niño phenomenon in the Pacific , contributing to climate fluctuations across the North Atlantic and Europe .
Comparing their data to an index of the NAO , the researchers established a direct relationship between Greenland Ice Sheet elevation change and strong positive and negative phases of the NAO during winter , which largely control temperature and precipitation patterns over Greenland .
Greenland elevation changes plotted against NAO index Professor Johannessen commented : " This strong negative correlation between winter elevation changes and the NAO index , suggests an underappreciated role of the winter season and the NAO for elevation changes – a wildcard in Greenland Ice Sheet mass balance scenarios under global warming . "
He cautioned that the recent growth found by the radar altimetry survey does not necessarily reflect a long - term or future trend .
With natural variability in the high - latitude climate cycle that includes the NAO being very large , even an 11 - year long dataset remains short .
" There is clearly a need for continued monitoring using new satellite altimeters and other observations , together with numerical models to calculate the Greenland Ice Sheet mass budget , " Johannessen added .
Modelling studies of the Greenland Ice Sheet mass balance under greenhouse global warming have shown that temperature increases up to about 3 º C lead to positive mass balance changes at high elevations – due to snow accumulation – and negative at low elevations – due to snow melt exceeding accumulation .
Such models agree with the new observational results .
However after that threshold is reached , potentially within the next hundred years , losses from melting would exceed accumulation from increases in snowfall – then the meltdown of the Greenland Ice Sheet would be on .
A paper published in Science in June this year detailed the results of a similar analysis of the Antarctic Ice Sheet based on ERS radar altimeter data , carried out by a team led by Professor Curt Davis of the University of Missouri - Columbia .
The results showed thickening in East Antarctica on the order of 1.8 cm per year , but thinning across a substantial part of West Antarctica .
Data were unavailable for much of the Antarctic Peninsula , subject to recent ice sheet thinning due to regional climate warming , again because of limitations in current radar altimeter performance .
CryoSat was lost on launch ESA 's CryoSat mission , lost during launch on 8 October , carried the world 's first radar altimeter purpose - built for use over both land and sea ice .
In the context of land ice sheets , CryoSat would have been capable of acquiring data over steeply - sloping ice margins which remain invisible to current radar altimeters - these being the very regions where the greatest loss is taking place .
Efforts are currently underway to investigate the possibility of building and flying a CryoSat - 2 , with a decision to be taken by the end of the year .
In the meantime , the valuable climatological record of ice sheet change established by ERS and Envisat will continue to be extended .
