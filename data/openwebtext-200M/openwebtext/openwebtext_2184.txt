So Bill O’Reilly had Scott McClellan on tonight and I almost had a nosebleed watching .
It was classic O’Reilly acorss the boards : the shouting , shutting down everything the guest says as “ just your opinion ” , cutting the guest off as “ wrong ” repeatedly , bringing up George Soros and the far - left media , and claiming to know more about the situation than the man who was in the center of it .
To quote Will , Bill O’Reilly could be interviewing Jesus Christ and say “ I read the Bible , I know what it says , and you ’re WRONG . ”
Now , I ’ve gotten into discussions with many conservatives and for all my polemic statements on here , I ’m generally very civil with those I disagree with .
I do n’t antagonize and unless someone throws something flaming and belligerent at me ( “ liberals want to have sex with Al Qaeda ” ) , I do n’t toss any grenades out there .
One spot I have a problem with is the right - wing media , specifically the television and radio aspects of it , even more specifically the trinity of Hannity , O’Reilly , and Rush .
I ’ve noticed I have a very , very hard time convincing conservatives that my beef with them is not that they ’re conservatives , but that they ’re drooling idiots .
It took me a while to figure out why this is so difficult , but I ’ve finally discovered it .
FOX ’s “ talent ” was specifically chosen to make liberals unable to criticize them .
Pick anyone on FOX .
Anyone from the heavyweights like O’Reilly , middleweights like Cavuto , or lightweights like Doocey , and you ’ll notice that down the boards , each of the high - profile pundits are loudmouth wackjobs that spin like crazy , shoot down everything that contradicts them and otherwise takes a crap on what is generally considered “ journalistic integrity ” .
This is n’t by accident .
FOX ’s viewers are not intellectually curious people .
They are n’t watching the news in order to learn things about the world around them .
They are n’t trying to gather information in order to make a well - researched opinion .
Rather , they come into the day with a set of opinions and want their “ news ” to remind them that they ’re right about everything .
That ’s why you ’ll rarely find a FOX viewer that loves one show but dislikes another ( not counting everyone hating Colmes ) .
Bill O’Reilly ’s popularity is a result of his ability to shout down guests , and muddy the debate by insisting that everything the guest says is “ opinion ” .
A viewer never comes out of one of O’Reilly ’s interviews having learned anything new .
He gets a liberal on , shouts at them for a while , and the viewers ends up happy because Bill “ stuck it to ” the left - wing loony .
Here ’s where FOX ’s genius comes in .
I , as a liberal , am unable to point at anyone else on the network as an example of a calm , level - headed conservative host .
They do n’t have anyone on that quietly discusses a disagreement with their guest , defers to them in realms the host is unfamiliar with , or concedes a point when proven wrong .
That puts me in an awkward position when trying to explain my beef with any one of them .
I ca n’t say something along the lines of “ Look , it ’s not because X is a conservative , it ’s because he ’s an idiot .
Look at Y , he ’s another host on FOX and he ’s perfectly reasonable . ”
And reasonable conservatives exist .
NPR has lots of them , Jack Cafferty has a lot of great moments as do Dobbs and Buchanan .
Thanks to that , I the liberal can’t agree that a single FOX host is an example of a good journalist , meaning that , to the conservative , I come across as a rabid liberal moonbat who hates all conservative pundits .
And since FOX has a few milktoast liberals on board that do n’t rock the boat too much , they can claim less - ideological status by pointing them out and saying “ I do n’t have a problem with THEM . ”
Rupert Murdoch ’s empire is built around comforting conservatives and confounding liberals .
It ’s a great business model .
In fact it ’s a brilliant business model .
By being so unflaggingly partisan and unashamedly subjective , their viewer base loves them and even feels validated when the left attacks the network .
After all , it ’d be one thing if Media Matters supported a few of FOX ’s hosts or at least respected them but went after others .
By constructing it so MM will go after the network as a unit , the claim that liberals are this crazy fringe is well - supported , at least according to those in the FOX bubble .
Brilliant business , bad journalism .
It ’d be great if it was n’t having such a terrible effect on our political system .
Rock Port will become America ’s first 100 - percent wind powered community when city officials throw the switch bringing the Loess Hills Wind Farm on line next Friday .
When fully operational , the four Suzlon S - 64 wind turbines will have the capacity to generate a combined total of five megawatts of energy , 16 million kilowatt hours a year .
Historically , Rock Port electrical customers use approximately 13 million KwH annually .
The celebration commemorating the symbolic " throwing of the switch " is scheduled to begin when the exhibit hall opens at 9 a.m. that Friday at the Atchison County Memorial Building in downtown Rock Port .
The formal switching ceremony is slated for 11:30 a.m. and lunch will be served from 12:15 to 2 p.m .
The program is sponsored by the Atchison County Development Corporation .
Rock Port Mayor Helen Jo Stevens will serve as master of ceremonies for the program and U. S. Rep. Sam Graves will be the featured speaker .
Representatives of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources , Missouri Joint Municipal Utilities , the Association of Electric Cooperatives and the project ’s principal developers , Wind Capital Group and John Deere Capital ’s Wind Energy will join the Tarkio Republican on the dais .
The idea for the Loess Hills Wind Farm was conceived by Eric Chamberlain , Rock Port , before construction began on the larger Cow Branch Wind Farm , the 24 - turbine development located between Rock Port and Tarkio .
Chamberlain had been researching the possibility of municipal wind energy and evaluating local wind resources and the cooperative effort seemed reasonable .
He took his idea for the smaller municipal system to Tom Carnahan , founder of Wind Capital Group and developer of Northwest Missouri ’s first wind farm near King City , and the concept ultimately has become reality .
" We would not have the Loess Hills Wind Farm to provide power for Rock Port without the development of the Cow Branch project , " Chamberlain said during a recent tour of the two wind farm sites .
" It would have simply been cost prohibitive for Rock Port to attempt what we have here . "
The construction costs have run to " several millions of dollars , " he said .
That is where John Deere Credit U.S.A. became involved as the principal financier of both Atchison County wind farm projects .
" They can recover their investment through the sale of electricity " into the area ’s power grid , Chamberlain explained .
Some of JDC ’s investment will also be recovered through federal per-kilowatt tax credits allowable to wind energy developers .
All area wind farms — a third , comparable in size to the Cow Branch and Bluegrass projects , is nearing completion at Conception Junction — will be eligible for that credit , although the program is scheduled to expire at the end of this year and has not yet been renewed by Congress .
The Rock Port municipal electrical system will be connected directly to the Loess Hills Wind Farm and a double metering system will enable the city to calculate what power is sold directly to municipal customers and how much is funneled into the system shared by the area ’s electric cooperatives .
" That in itself will save Rock Port transmission fees and a line loss charge of something like seven percent , " Chamberlain said , " so it will reduce the city ’s wholesale utility cost .
" It may not actually lower the utility bills people have to pay , but it will at least be a hedge against inflation that is almost a certainty in utility costs . "
The four towers comprising the Loess Hills Wind Farm are 250 feet tall each , the same height as those at the larger Cow Branch project .
The Loess Hills turbines utilize three 90 - foot blades to capture wind energy from an area that is about an acre in size .
Those at Cow Branch have 140 - foot blades and can each generate 2.1 MW of power .
That combined output will provide enough output to provide clean , renewable energy for 30,000 homes .
A number of chronic diseases are in fact caused by one or more infectious agents .
For example , stomach ulcers are caused by Helicobacter pylori , chronic lung disease in newborns and chronic asthma in adults are both caused by Mycoplasmas and Chlamydia pneumonia , while some other pathogens have been associated with atherosclerosis .
The realization that pathogens can produce slowly progressive chronic diseases has opened new lines of research into Alzheimer 's disease .
In a special issue of the Journal of Alzheimer 's Disease published May 2008 , guest editors Judith Miklossy , from The University of British Columbia , and Ralph N. Martins , from Edith Cowan University and Hollywood Private Hospital , Perth , Western Australia , and a group of experts explore this exciting topic .
Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , the most frequent cause of dementia , is a form of amyloidosis .
It has been known for a century that dementia , brain atrophy and amyloidosis can be caused by chronic bacterial infections , namely by Treponema pallidum in the atrophic form of general paresis in syphilis .
Bacteria and viruses are powerful stimulators of inflammation .
It was suggested by Alois Alzheimer and his colleagues a century ago that microorganisms may be contributors in the generation of senile plaques in AD .
The fact that pathogens may suppress , subvert or evade host defenses and establish chronic or latent infection has received little attention in the past .
During infection , active oxygen and nitrogen species generated by inflammatory cells may cause DNA damage , induce apoptosis , and modulate enzyme activities and gene expression .
Depending upon the biology of the pathogen and the host defense mechanisms the organism can persist in the infected tissues and cause chronic inflammation and amyloid deposition .
The outcome of infection is as much determined by the genetic predisposition of the patient as by the virulence and biology of the infecting agent .
Environmental factors and nutrition are critical determinants of disease expression as well .
In this special issue a series of reviews draws attention to both historic and recent observations related to this emerging field of AD research .
The first review shows the importance of chronic inflammation in AD , followed by three articles presenting evidence on the involvement of spirochetes , Chlamydia pneumoniae and Herpes simplex virus type 1 in AD .
These are followed by a review of amyloid proteins , which occur in many cellular forms in Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes .
The link between several viral and bacterial infections and the most significant genetic factor for AD , APOE å4 , is discussed in the next review .
The link between excessive or misplaced iron and a variety of neurodegenerative diseases and infection is reviewed in the final article .
According to Miklossy and Martins , " The historic and new observations reviewed in this special issue clearly show that high priority should be given for further research in this field as it may have major implications for public health , treatment , and prevention as adequate anti-bacterial and anti-viral drugs are available .
Treatment of a bacterial infection and associated viral infection may result in regression and , if started early , prevention of disease .
The impact on reducing healthcare costs would be substantial . "
Now it 's the McCain campaign 's turn to try to match Barack Obama 's fundraising might .
GOP fears Obama 's money machine
With Hillary Clinton ’s campaign coming to an end this weekend , Barack Obama ’s rise as the Democratic nominee brings serious bad news to a new group : John McCain ’s finance team .
A review of campaign finance data offers not one ounce of good news and barely any hope for the McCain campaign ’s ability to compete with Obama ’s fundraising prowess .
Advertisement
To make matters worse , Obama ’s campaign , which raised $ 272 million through April for the primary , now is reaching out to Clinton ’s fundraisers , who raised another $ 200 million through April , in an effort to unite forces and bury the historically deep - pocketed Republicans .
Take a look at some of the numbers :
• If each of Obama ’s donors gave him a modest $ 250 , he ’d have $ 375 million to spend during the two - month general election sprint .
That ’s $ 186 million a month , $ 47 million a week .
• During the same September to Nov. 4 period , McCain will have about $ 85 million to spend since he has decided to take taxpayer money to help finance his campaign activities .
• The Republican National Committee , which is charged with closing the gap between McCain and Obama , has $ 40 million in cash .
Obama raised almost as much — $ 31 million — from just his small donors in the month of February .
His total for the month , $ 57 million , exceeded the RNC ’s cash balance .
• Obama has more than 1.5 million donors ; McCain has a few hundred thousand .
If just a million of Obama ’s donors sent him the maximum donation , $ 2,300 , he could raise $ 2.3 billion .
OK , that ’s not going to happen .
But campaign finance experts and Democratic fundraisers say a conservative estimate of Obama ’s general election fundraising potential hovers around or above $ 300 million .
Such a massive financial advantage will allow Obama to compete in more states than McCain and force his rival to defend states that should rightfully be Republican wins .
Obama ’s use of such tactics has already been on display in the primary .
Pennsylvania was a must - win for Clinton and , given its large population of working - class Democrats and women , was a long shot for Obama .
Still , he spent $ 10 million advertising in the Keystone State .
Why ?
He forced Clinton to spend all her money and much of her time there to ensure she pocketed a 10 - point win .
Meanwhile , Obama moved ahead of her to the next set of equally critical primary states .
He pulled ahead of her in North Carolina , squeezed the gap in Indiana and essentially ended any hope of a then - bankrupt Clinton overtaking him in the delegate race .
In the general election , Obama could afford to set up large operations in Virginia , North Carolina , Georgia , New Mexico and a host of other states — maybe even McCain ’s own Arizona ..
That would force McCain to pick the midsize - state battles he could afford while also trying to hold off a free - spending Obama in essential big states such as Ohio , Missouri and Florida .
“ McCain has to make every dollar count in the general election , and Obama will have money to burn , ” said Evan Tracey , co-founder of Campaign Media Analysis Group .
The financial gap between the two presumed nominees was also on display during the primaries .
Obama spent $ 75 million on television advertising , and McCain spent $ 11 million , according to Tracey .
Clearly , a major reason for the imbalance is the length of the Democratic primary compared with that of the Republican race .
But it ’s also a matter of resources : Obama raised nearly three times more money than McCain ’s $ 100 million tally through April .
And the plight of the McCain campaign could be even worse than many Republicans feared .
McCain is n’t a good fundraiser — which explains why he decided to take taxpayer money for the general election — and he has yet to excite his own party base .
He reported a record month in April , raising $ 18 million , after sewing up his party ’s nomination .
In 2004 , Democrat John F. Kerry raised $ 44 million in the month after he emerged his party ’s presumptive nominee .
“ What ’s been striking about the McCain money is that there has n’t been any big surge , ” says Anthony Corrado , an expert on campaign finance .
“ There are no big spikes ; there is slow growth . ”
In addition , the $ 300 million general election haul for Obama projected by some experts includes a relatively modest boost from Clinton backers , a projection that could significantly underestimate their influence and the Illinois senator ’s ultimate financial strength .
Obama backers this week said they have been quietly reaching out to Clinton supporters and assuring them that they will be welcome in the next phase of the election .
Those conversations have been delicate , said one major Obama backer .
“ In the last few weeks , both campaigns have been very respectful of one another , by and large .
It was important every primary be waged . ”
The conversations now are more open and could progress more rapidly now that Clinton has made a decision to formally leave the race .
“ These are folks who have worked together for Democratic nominees repeatedly for years .
There is a great capacity for us to join arms and work together , ” said one Clinton fundraiser who asked to remain anonymous .
Another Clinton “ HillRaiser , ” the nickname for her major fundraisers , said “ people will substantially get engaged and assist . ”
But he added that it could take a little time for such a merger .
“ You ca n’t move on to another date with the same intensity quite that quickly , ” he said .
To be sure , some Clinton backers wo n’t switch sides .
Clinton ’s campaign recruited an impressive array of women to raise money , some of whom are expected to move to the sidelines without a female at the top of the ticket .
Others , said one major fundraiser and adviser , may shift their energy toward helping the Democratic National Committee fill its coffers .
Just as the RNC is expected to share expenses with McCain , the DNC is aiming to raise more than $ 200 million for its general election activities that will be coordinated with Obama .
Still more money raisers may pivot to the House and Senate campaign committees , where their work may be more noticed and remembered after November .
“ If they go to Obama , they know they will always be one tier out from the candidate .
If they can raise a whole bunch of money in Senate races , they will still be players , ” the adviser added .
But even with some falloff , no one expects Obama to be short on resources , in part because of his inspirational appeal and also because of a greater urgency among Democratic activists to seize the White House and change the national agenda .
“ All hands are going to be on deck , ” said one longtime Democratic fundraiser .
“ A billion is spent on advertising at the Super Bowl .
That ’s one football game .
This is worth every nickel we can put into it . ”

That Vision Thing
Ironically enough , I remember the moment clearly .
It was about five years ago now , when I looked up from the car and realized I could n’t see .
I had been staring at my computer a lot , and reading books when I was n’t doing that , so I did n’t notice much , but that day , riding in the car , I looked up and realized I could n’t read the street sign .
I definitely used to be able to read that sign , but there it was , big and bright and green along the highway , and all I could make out was a blur .
I had gone blind .
Legally blind , as I learned yesterday .
My vision is below the legal threshold in the US for legal blindness .
( Far below , as far as I can tell , but the eye exam chart does n’t really make fine - grained distinctions at that level . )
And yet , for five years , this never really bothered me .
I never wore glasses for more than an hour , I squinted hard enough to pass the vision test at the DMV , I sat close to blackboards and listened carefully .
I tried a couple things to improve my eyesight , but nothing very seriously .
I tried , but it never seemed important enough to warrant the effort .
And so I walked thru life , legally blind .
I did n’t really notice .
My roommate , Quinn , has been nagging me about this .
She wants me to get LASIK , I think largely because it involves lasers .
But finally the other day I took some action and went to the optometrist .
You know those eye charts you see sometimes ?
The ones that famously start with E at the top and then the letters get smaller and smaller ?
I could n’t read the E .
When I looked up at it , all I saw was a vague blur .
So they gave me contacts .
Contacts are an odd thing .
They ’re almost invisible , malleable little things that you ca n’t see once they ’re stuck on your eye .
One minute , you ’re living a Monet - like existence of a world blurred , then tap your eye and suddenly , invisibly , everything is clear .
I had no idea the world really looked like this , with such infinite clarity .
It looks like a modernist photo or a hyperreal film , everything in focus everywhere .
Everyone kept saying “ oh , do you see the leaves now ? ” but the first thing I saw was not the leaves but the people .
People , individuated , each with brilliant faces and expressions at gaits , the sun streaming down upon them .
I could n’t help but smile .
It ’s much harder being a misanthrope when you can see people ’s faces .
Then came the signs , the signs with messages I could read from a distance .
No longer would I have to carefully count my stops on the subway because I could n’t read the station signs .
And then the buildings , their edges no longer fuzzy like clouds but hard and harsh and magnificent .
I no longer feared myself , formerly this vague visage in the mirror that I had to look away from .
Now in the mirror I could see my face , and even thought it looked good .
The resolution on my cameraphone suddenly seems insufficient .
The crumbs and dirt in our apartment that previously drove my roommate crazy are now visible enough to drive me crazy too .
I can look people in the eye and smile and see them smile back .
I can see the contours of their faces .
When I look up at night I can see the things in my room , even when the lights are off .
My eyes are open and I can now experience the beauty that ’s been more than a few feet in front of my nose .

" I 'm looking to be martyr for long time , " he said in serviceable English , improved , perhaps , by five years of custody , including three in secret CIA prisons .
The arraignment on Thursday of Mohammed and four other detainees the US Government says were high - level co-ordinators of the September 11 attacks was the start of hearings in the case , which is the centrepiece of the Bush Administration 's war crimes system .
But it was also the first public appearance by Mohammed , who has long cast himself in the role of super - terrorist , claiming credit in the past not only for the 2001 plot , but for about 30 others , including the murder of Daniel Pearl , a Wall Street Journal reporter in Pakistan .
Mohammed worked to get as much control as possible over the proceedings .
Peering through big , black - rimmed glasses and sporting a bushy grey beard , he rejected US lawyers as agents of the Bush Administration 's " crusade war against Islamic world , " saying he would represent himself .
He said the lawyers could stay to help him as advisers .
By day 's end , each of Mohammed 's four co-defendants had said he wanted to represent himself .
That could turn the trial into a jumble of rhetoric and a new opportunity for critics to attack the Guantanamo system as designed to get easy convictions .
The judge , Colonel Ralph Kohlmann , agreed to permit three of the men to represent themselves .
But in the case of Ramzi Binalshibh , who was to have been one of the hijackers , he said he wanted to further investigate a report from a military lawyer that Binalshibh has been on psychotropic medication .
When Colonel Kohlmann asked Binalshibh why he was taking the medication , security officials cut the sound fed to reporters in a glassed - in gallery and a media centre .
It was one of several times when a national security consultant cut the sound when detainees appeared to be discussing what several of them said had been years of torture .
Mohammed managed to get the reference through the censor twice .
" After torturing " he said , " they transfer us to Inquisition land in Guantanamo . "
CIA officials have said that Mohammed was one of three detainees subjected to the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding .
Mohammed looked lean compared with the photo taken of him after his 2003 capture .
He chanted verses in Arabic and then translated them into English , and he vied with Colonel Kohlmann for control of the courtroom .
All five accused men were held in the secret CIA program and transferred to Guantanamo to face charges in the military commission system .

BUSTED HARD ! PROOF of Obama Birth Certificate FRAUD
6/28/208
Posted on by AmericaUnited
Here is hard , irrefutable proof that the Obama campaign is engaged in a huge deceit related to what they are claiming is a copy of his birth certificate .
Notice on Obama 's official site , his birth certificate says OHBM 1.1 in the lower left corner .
The original document displayed on the Daily KOS website says OHSM 1.1 in the lower left corner .
The million dollar question is :
If the Daily KOS document was supplied by a Obama campaign staffer , as was reported , then how on earth can these two documents differ ?
There may be a Hawaiian state agency or department with the initials ' OHBM ' , but I 'm not aware of any .
The agency that you request a copy of a birth certificate from is the ' Office of Health Status Monitoring ' , OHSM .
The genie is out of the bottle now and it's impossible to " take back " the images .
They are immortalized all over the web on different sites .
Anyone can see this hard proof of skullduggery for themselves .
Note :
Those who keep saying this is a distraction are missing a huge point here .
It directly takes aim at Obama and his credibility .
A bald - faced lie has been perpetrated on the American public .
As far as this issue relates to Obama being a natural born citizen , I make no claims .
But there sure has to be some reason for the deceit .
Who knows where the trail will lead

The LASER form was revised November 2001 ( 11/01 ) , so : 1 ) I do n't think there were LASER printers in 1961 , and 2 ) This HAS to be a certified COPY of his 1961 birth certificate and is NOT a copy of the certificate of live birth , so 3 ) WHERE IS THE ORIGINAL certificate of live birth ?
4 ) Does that mean that the posted birth certificate is " fake but accurate " ?
This sounds like a 2008 version of Dan Rather 's fake documents on a Remington typewriter .
In this case , there were no LASER forms in 1961 .
Again I ask : WHERE IS THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION CIRCA 1961 ?!?!?!?!

If the Daily KOS document was supplied by a Obama campaign staffer , as was reported , then how on earth can these two documents differ ?
*** Answer : Obama ’s campaign will be throwing the KOS under the bus .
Oh , and the staffer as well .
Look for that staffer to get a very soft landing somewhere within the democratic party .

Since it is presidential campaign season , we will inevitably be treated to the usual discourse about tax cuts .
Some candidates will call for tax cuts , undoubtedly as a way to bribe voters into voting for them .
Others will resist the call , undoubtedly in fear that their favorite government program might not receive desired funding .
In actuality , all the tax - cut talk will be rather meaningless , especially for advocates of liberty .
From the founding of the United States through the early part of the 20th century , with a few exceptions ( e.g. , the Civil War ) , Americans lived without income taxation , the federal government being funded primarily by tariffs and excise taxes .
Americans were free to keep everything they earned and decide what to do with their money .
There was no IRS and no one had to file income - tax returns .
When the idea of an income - tax - free society is posed to a modern - day American , oftentimes the reaction to such a radical idea is shock .
 Why , that would be anarchy !  the American sometimes responds .
But that notion would have come as a surprise to our American ancestors , who lived in a society with a fully functioning federal government and no income taxation for more than 100 years .
Why did our American ancestors oppose income taxation ?
Because they had discovered an important point : People cannot be free in a society in which the government has the power to levy taxes on income .
To put it another way , people are free only when they have the ability to keep everything they earn and decide for themselves what to do with their own money .
With the advent of income taxation in America , the relationship between citizen and government was inverted .
Prior to the income tax , the citizen was sovereign by virtue of the fact that he was free to earn unlimited amounts of money and there was nothing the government could do about it .
Like it or not , it was his money , to do with as he pleased .
With the adoption of income taxation , all that changed .
In effect , the income tax nationalized income .
While many people would undoubtedly prefer not to think about it in this way , under the federal income tax everyone ’s income belongs to the government or , if you prefer , to society . 
The power to set the tax rate is essentially the power to decide how much of their income people are going to be permitted to keep .
Thus , the income tax has converted the relationship between government and citizen into one akin to parent and child .
The portion of their income that the citizenry are permitted to retain has effectively become an allowance .
Sometimes the government is good to the citizenry and lets them keep more of their income .
Sometimes the government is not so nice and lets the citizenry keep less of their income .
But what ’s important here , in terms of freedom , is not the percentage that is being levied but rather the fact that it is the government making the determination .
That ’s obviously a far cry from a society in which there is no income taxation at all .
Taxes and spending
There is another factor to consider here , a practical one .
Those candidates who call for tax cuts are doing more than throwing a bone to beleaguered taxpayers .
They are also perpetrating a fraud , because they know that since government expenditures today far exceed government revenues , people are going to have to pay for the deficit somehow .
Permit me to digress a bit here .
One of my biggest personal revelations when I discovered libertarianism many years ago was that the federal government acquired its resources differently than people in the private sector .
I had envisioned the government as just being part of a huge collection of enterprises , producing its own wealth and deciding what to do with it .
That was one reason I could not understand why anyone would object to the government ’s helping the poor with welfare .
I thought ,
Why should n’t the government be as free as everyone else to decide how to spend its money , and why should n’t it spend its money on helping the poor ?
And then I discovered that the federal government acquired its money differently than everyone else .
Its money comes from taxes , which are forcible exactions imposed on people .
That is obviously very different from how people in the private sector get their money .
Microsoft , for example , depends on offering products that induce people to voluntarily trade their money for a particular piece of software .
If people decide to hold on to their money instead of buying the software , there is nothing that Microsoft can do about it .
That is , Microsoft cannot force anyone to hand over his money .
It ’s different with the government .
Its revenues do depend on force .
If someone does n’t like a particular service that the government is providing ( e.g. , waging the drug war , providing people with welfare , torturing detainees , or killing people in Iraq ) , he ca n’t do what he does with Microsoft .
He must pay his income taxes anyway , on pain of fine and imprisonment or even death upon steadfast refusal to do so .
Now , back to the tax - cut bone that presidential candidates love to offer voters during campaign season .
As Milton Friedman pointed out , the true level of taxation is not what is being collected in taxes but rather the level of government expenses .
Why is this so ?
Because if the government is spending more than it is receiving in tax revenues , it is doing it in one of two ways — borrowing or printing the money .
If it ’s borrowing the money to finance its expenditures , those debts must ultimately be paid back .
That ’s why a tax - cut bone that presidential candidates offer voters is a fraud .
They know that one way or another , ultimately the government is going to have to repay those debts .
And the only way it can get the money to repay those debts is to tax the citizenry .
Inflation plunder
Another way — historically a popular one — that the government finances its excess expenditures is by simply printing the money to pay for expenditures , a practice known as inflation .
When the government inflates the currency to pay its excess bills , the result is a lower - valued currency .
As with any other product , increasing the supply of money lowers its value .
And the lower value of a currency is reflected in a rise in the prices of the things that money buys — such as groceries , automobiles , gasoline , clothing , and school supplies .
The advantage of paying for government expenses through inflation , as compared to income taxation , should be obvious :
Most people do n’t have any idea that this is the way that government is paying its bills .
They think that inflation is some sort of mysterious monetary infection that just seems to strike nations randomly and unexpectedly .
In fact , even mainstream educated  journalists often use the term inflation to describe rising prices in society rather than using it in its true sense — an artificial increase in the supply of money that is reflected in the rising prices in society .
The point of all this is to show another reason that the tax - cut bone that presidential candidates offer the electorate is a fraud .
Since people are going to have to pay for the excess government expenditures through the reduced purchasing power of their income , what practical difference does a tax cut make to them ?
Moreover , even if a tax cut increases government revenues , as some people claim , government expenditures inevitably rise proportionately .
Suppose that government spends $ 100 million a year and collects income taxes of $ 100 million .
The following year , the government decides to engage in an overseas military adventure that doubles government expenditures to $ 200 million .
The president , however , vows not to raise taxes .
To pay the extra $ 100 million in new expenses , the government simply prints the money , which because of rising prices reduces the purchasing power of everyone ’s income , a reduction , say , equal to a doubling of the income tax .
Are people any better off because the government has financed its expenditures through inflation ?
Of course not .
While it ’s true that some taxpayers might benefit more and others lose more , the fact is that either way , the government has sucked $ 200 million out of the pockets of the citizenry .
Let ’s assume that during this process , a power - lusting presidential candidate comes along and calls for a tax cut .
 I ’ll lower your taxes if you elect me ! exclaims the politician .
Would people be better off with such a tax cut ?
Of course not , because what is gained with the tax cut will be lost in the reduced purchasing power of their income , given that the excess expenditures are being financed with inflation .
Ultimately , the issue of income taxation cannot be divorced from the things on which the federal government is spending its money .
As we have seen , the money that government is spending must be collected , either directly through taxes , through borrowing ( which must be repaid through taxes or inflation ) , or inflation .
The burden of government expenditures must ultimately be borne by the citizenry .
Alternative taxes
Thus , while the abolition of the income tax and the IRS are necessary prerequisites to a free society , if the financial burden of other taxes is equal to the same amount that the income taxes were collecting , how much better off are people financially if they ’re having to pay the same amount of money through an alternative tax that they were previously paying though the income tax ?
Let ’s assume , for example , that a family is earning $ 60,000 a year and paying $ 20,000 in income taxes .
Suppose the income tax is abolished and replaced with a national sales tax , which ultimately collects $ 20,000 from our hypothetical family .
While it ’s true that the individual will be freer in the sense that he no longer has to file income tax returns and deal with the abusiveness and intrusiveness of the IRS , the federal government is still determining the family ’s allowance ,  albeit indirectly .
That ’s why , ultimately , the only protection that people have is a constitutional prohibition on all taxation ( the ideal ) or , alternatively , a constitutional limitation on the overall level of indirect taxation .
The former would mean that government would have to depend on voluntary support from the citizenry , just as churches , museums , and other charitable organizations operate .
Of course , the standard response to such a suggestion is ,  Well , that ’s ridiculous .
The American people do n’t believe in government and , therefore , have to be forced to support it . 
Yet , if most Americans did n’t believe government is important , why would n’t they have abolished it a long time ago ?
The fact is that most Americans do believe that government is important and essential and would be as willing to support it as they do other organizations .
In an imperfect world of indirect taxation to fund the federal government , people would still be better off with a constitutional ceiling on the rate of tax collected ; for example :  The federal government shall collect its revenues only through tariffs , which shall never exceed 2 percent . 
Obviously , there would have to be a simultaneous moral and intellectual revolution with respect to government programs because government revenues will most likely be quite small , especially in comparison to what they are today .
That means that in order to restore a free society , Americans must ask themselves a fundamentally important question :
What should be the role of government in a free society ?
Should its role include taking money from one group of people by force ( i.e. , taxation ) in order to give it to another group of people ( i.e. , provide welfare ) ?
Should its role include the maintenance of an enormous military - industrial empire that serves as an international policeman and welfare - provider for the world ?
The reason that such questions are so important is that if people maintain their allegiance to either a welfare state or a warfare state , they need to recognize that the restoration of a free society becomes impossible because of the massive amount of tax revenues needed to fund such states .
In fact , as one hopes that modern - day Americans have learned , once they delegate to the government the role of providing socialist or imperialist programs , its expenditures inevitably soar exponentially .
Finally , there is a critically important economic angle to all this .
The key to higher standards of living lies in the accumulation of private savings , which tends toward investment in tools and equipment , which makes workers more productive , and that tends toward higher incomes .
Thus , the more income and savings that government is confiscating , the lower the standard of living of the citizenry .
Thus , a moral and intellectual revolution against income taxation must be accompanied by a moral and intellectual revolution against socialism and empire .
By limiting the role of government to its traditionally legitimate functions of police , defense , and courts , the amount of voluntary money needed to fund such operations becomes relatively minuscule .
The citizenry would have the freedom to keep everything they earn in the marketplace , accumulate unlimited amounts of wealth , and decide for themselves how to dispose of it .
Herein lies the key to a free , prosperous , and harmonious society .
The Best of Jacob G. Hornberger
Graham Coutts strangled Jane Longhurst with a pair of tights A mother whose daughter was murdered by a man addicted to violent internet porn has completed her fight to have such images banned .
Jane Longhurst , 31 , was strangled by Graham Coutts , 39 , from Hove , Sussex .
He was jailed for at least 26 years .
Her mother Liz , from Berkshire , backed by Reading West MP Martin Salter , campaigned for three years to ban violent online porn .
The ban is part of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill .
Possession of sexually violent images will now be punishable by up to three years in jail .
The bill had its final reading on Thursday where it received Royal Assent .
Sometimes the freedoms of like - minded , decent people have to be curtailed because of a few others
Liz Longhurst
Under the new rules , criminal responsibility shifts from the producer - who is responsible under the 1959 Obscene Publications Act ( OPA ) - to the consumer .
Campaigners fear the new law risks criminalising thousands of people who use violent pornographic images as part of consensual sexual relationships .
Mrs Longhurst , of Reading , said she was aware that libertarians saw her as " a horrible killjoy " .
" Sometimes the freedoms of like - minded , decent people have to be curtailed because of a few others .
" I know some would argue women choose to do this .
But I believe a lot of women who have been trafficked are forced to be on these sites . "
Not a ' moral crusade '
Mrs Longhurst believes if the sites had not been available for Coutts to look at , her daughter would still be alive .
" It made it seem all right .
I think he knew from quite a young age that it was n't really all right .
" But I think he thought : ' Well , there are all these sites , I 'm not the only one and it must be all right really ' and so he just went with the flow . "
Mr Salter said the campaign was not a " moral crusade " but targeted the " violent end of the market - material that was already illegal but with the advent of the internet was unregulated " .
" This is the combination of a three - year campaign waged by Liz Longhurst and myself , which garnered the support of church groups , women 's organisations , 189 MPs , and generated 50,000 signatures on a national petition , " he said .
Liz Longhurst : Fought three - year campaign
Under the new law , pornographic material which depicts necrophilia , bestiality or violence which is life threatening or likely to result in serious injury to the anus , breasts or genitals is outlawed .
The Ministry of Justice said the offence would be enforced by individual police forces , by officers who were " already working on protecting the public in this field " .
A spokesman said it expected the number of prosecutions would be relatively small .
He said : " The new law is not intended to target those who accidentally come into contact with obscene pornography , nor would it target the mainstream entertainment industry , which works within current obscenity laws , or those who sell bondage material legally available in the UK .
" The material to be covered by the ban is already illegal to publish and distribute in the UK under the Obscene Publications Act ( OPA ) 1959 but can be accessed in the UK from abroad via the internet .
" Legislating in this area will ensure that the possession of such material is illegal both on and off line . "

Average height provides one of the best indications of a population 's overall health .
Until the last few years , U.S. citizens were the world 's tallest and enjoyed better health than the people of any other nation .
Things have changed , though .
Now , western Europeans ' height exceeds that of Americans , and the difference is growing larger .
If there 's any question about the connection between height and health , consider that longevity has also decreased during the same time that height has dropped .
References vary , but the usually - reported figure is that the United States is between 28 and 38 in the world for life expectancy , behind nearly all western European nations .
Having spent most of his professional life poring through historical records of height , Professor John Komlos of Germany 's University of Munich has become known as the pope of anthropometric - measurement of humans -- studies .
Komlos , his colleagues , and graduate students consider historical records of soldiers to be the mother lode for information about height .
These records tend to be complete , are accurate about men's civil status , and , of course , provide objective height measurements .
Over the last 1,200 years , a graph of the height of European men is shaped like a wide U. Charlemagne stood about six feet tall and his soldiers ' heights averaged nearly the same .
A thousand years later , during the French Revolution , the average male height was a mere five feet .
What can account for such a change ?
During the time when Europeans were losing height , the most obvious change in their lives was the development of cities and the move away from an egalitarian agricultural life .
A very few , mostly the wealthy , were well - fed .
The feudal system took most of the food away from serf farmers , giving it to the lords in taxes .
After the French Revolution , the average person became wealthier .
Access to adequate food became more commonplace .
Thus , people grew taller .
Today , Europeans are the tallest in the world .
The tallest of all are the Dutch .
In The Netherlands , the average man is 6 ' 1 " .
Compare that to the average American man at 5 ' 9 - 1/2 " today .
Americans have historically enjoyed an abundance of good food .
The land itself provided exceptionally well .
Whether wealthy or poor , nearly everyone ate well .
As Europeans have grown taller , their lifespans have lengthened , too .
American 's lifespans have lost ground compared to the Europeans .
There are many ideas on why Americans are relatively shorter , but the only one that holds up to scrutiny is diet .
Historically , the quality of diet has been associated with the economic well - being of a culture .
That has not changed , though there is one distinct difference today -- the type of food .
Let 's take a look at suggestions for why the change in height .
Wealth is often offered as a reason for increased height .
Historically , the connection has been quite clear .
However , it 's obvious that no one grows taller from carrying a wad of money in his pocket .
What is it about wealth that has made the difference between being tall and short ?
In the past , the very wealthy have always tended to be significantly taller than the poor .
Towards the end of the 18th century , the difference in height between wealthy and poor young men was nearly nine inches .
Especially now , with the unexamined presumption that modern healthcare is the reason for longer lives , healthcare is often automatically listed as a reason for taller stature .
Does this hold up under examination ?
The fact is that nothing of substance is ever identified to show any connection between the modern medical system and health , let alone height .
This , though , does n't slow down the major news reports that connect healthcare with height .
In a recent BBC News report on this issue , the bulk of the article discusses healthcare , with talk about pre- and post-natal care and the availability of healthcare to most people in Europe .
Nowhere , though , is this assumption examined .
Let 's scrutinize it using one of the so - called successes that the healthcare system routinely trots out -- the implementation of mass vaccination .
If it has produced better health , then there should be a correlation between greater height and increased vaccinations .
As documented in " Childhood Vaccinations Hoax " ( https://www.naturalnews.com/022617.html ) , the reality is far different from the medical system 's claims .
There has been almost no benefit from childhood vaccinations during the latter half of the twentieth century .
If there was a positive connection between healthcare and height , then would n't there be an increase in height to match the greatest success story of the allopathic medical world ?
Reality , though , does n't match the fiction .
In fact , the latter half of the twentieth century was a time of decreased height among Americans .
During the same time , here has been a massive buildup in vaccinations , starting in the 1940s and accelerating during the '60s .
Genetics and immigration are often cited as the reason behind the relative shrinkage of Americans .
With only a small number of exceptions , this theory is flawed .
The implication is that native - born Americans have maintained their height , but immigrants , who often are shorter , are skewing the records .
On examination , though , this does not hold up .
First , one needs to note that Americans are already a land of people from other countries .
Thus , their historically greater height must be the result of something that has happened since their ancestors arrived from then - short Europeans , Africans , and Asians .
During the latter half of the twentieth century , both Europe and America have been home to huge influxes of immigration .
The U.S. has gotten more people from South America .
True , these people are generally shorter .
However , western Europe has had extremely heavy immigration from lands with shorter people , including Asia , Africa , and eastern Europe .
In spite of this , western Europeans have grown taller .
Another point countering the argument that Americans have grown shorter because of immigration is that , with only a few exceptions , such as the Pygmies of Africa , most people seem to reach similar heights when conditions are similar .
That can be demonstrated by looking at third generation people who have immigrated from all over the world .
People whose grandparents came from South America are as tall as those whose grandparents arrived on boats from Europe .
The Maya are one of the two main ethnic groups of Guatemala .
They were thought to be genetically short and were called the " Pygmies of Central America " .
They were subjugated by the ruling Ladinos .
In the 1970s , the average Mayan man was only 5 ' 2 " and the average woman only 4 ' 8 " .
By the mid-eighties , many Mayans had escaped from their poverty to the U.S.
The average U.S. Mayan was four inches taller than the average Guatemalan Mayan by 2000 .
In the United States , food has been available in abundance to most people .
That is why Americans were the world 's tallest people for most of 200 years , until the mid-twentieth century .
What happened in the latter half of the twentieth century ?
There 's another clue : Americans not only ceased to gain height , they also got fatter .
A lot fatter .
It 's well documented that this happened because of diet .
The advent of junk food and junk diets has led to an American health disaster .
Thus , while Americans have not only had adequate food , they 've had an abundance of it - but in the last 50 years , a large portion of it has been calories without substance .
The American diet is atrocious , leading to deteriorating health .
As a result of diminished health , Americans are less able to function well .
Intelligence is affected , and testing has documented poorer mental capacity , not just poorer performance in schools .
Chronic diseases , such as arthritis , cancer , diabetes , and asthma have become rampant .
The real question is why Americans eat so badly .
Look no further than the USDA , the arbiter of the American diet , and its Food Pyramid to understand the problem .
It emphasizes foods that are relatively calorie - rich and nutrition - poor .
The recommendation for the ideal diet is mostly grains .
Fruits and vegetables are second , dairy products and proteins are third , and fats are treated as something to avoid .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
If you want a diet that leads to diabetes , the USDA 's food pyramid is an excellent guide .
It even suggests eating " fortified " breads , rather than suggesting whole grains that have never been adulterated .
People who follow this diet are doomed to live in hunger .
The body demands adequate nutrition .
When it does n't get it -- and the USDA 's diet assures that it wo n't -- then it will demand more food .
It gets worse , though .
For the sake of convenience , because people 's lives are so filled with the stuff of modern living , and because it 's pushed so heavily , people have turned to even worse junk food .
People are stuffing themselves with sugar , processed grains , and processed petroleum , rather than eating real food .
Their bodies go into starvation mode , demanding more and more food as they try to get the real nutrition they require .
Ultimately , the question must be asked :
Why would people eat such bad food ?
The answer is found by identifying who benefits from the American diet , since it obviously is n't the American people .
Dr. Barry Sears wrote , " ... asking the USDA to develop the Food Pyramid was like asking the fox to guard the hen house . "
The primary agribusinesses in the United States are corn and wheat .
These grain lobbies are among the most powerful in the government .
As a result , the USDA dances to whatever tune they play .
When it came to putting the Food Pyramid together , the needs and desires of grain - based agribusiness had more to do with it than people 's dietary needs .
There is no good science behind it .
As Dr. Walter Willett of the Harvard School of Public Health and Medicine Professor at Harvard is quote in , " The USDA Pyramid is wrong .
It was built on shaky scientific ground ... the USDA Pyramid offers wishy - washy , scientifically unfounded advice ... nor has it ever been tested to see if it really works .
" So , the American people have been propagandized from earliest childhood into eating a diet that is virtually guaranteed to make them fat and not get the nutrition needed to reach their full height or their full potential .
The well - being of Americans was sacrificed for the profits of a few agribusiness corporations .
No wonder Americans are no longer the world 's tallest people !

The Air Force 's top civilian and uniformed leaders are being booted out of the Pentagon .
Chief of Staff Gen. T. Michael " Buzz " Moseley has resigned .
Secretary Michael W. Wynne is next .
The move , initially reported by Inside Defense and Air Force Times , is n't exactly a shocker .
The Air Force has come under fire for everything from mishandling nukes to misleading ad campaigns to missing out on the importance of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars .
Most importantly , the Air Force 's leadership has been on the brink of open conflict for months with Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England .
That 's because in the halls of the Air Force 's chiefs , the talk has been largely about the threats posed by China and a resurgent Russia .
Gates wanted the service to actually focus on the wars at hand , in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" For much of the past year I ’ve been trying to concentrate the minds and energies of the defense establishment on the current needs and current conflicts , " he told the Heritage Foundation .
" In short , to ensure that all parts of the Defense Department are , in fact , at war . "
Last fall , the Pentagon 's civilian chiefs shot down an Air Force move to take over almost all of the military 's big unmanned aircraft .
" There has to be a better way to do this , " Moseley complained at the time .
Things only got more tense when
Gates said that the future of conflict is in small , " asymmetric " wars
\– wars in which the Air Force takes a back seat to ground forces .
Then Gates noted that the Air Force 's most treasured piece of gear , the
F - 22 stealth fighter , basically has no role in the war on terror .
And when a top Air Force general said the service was planning on buying twice as many of the jets – despite orders from Gates and the rest of the civilian leadership – he was rebuked for " borderline insubordination . "
Relations between Gates and the Air Force chiefs soured further when the Defense Secretary called for more spy drones to be put into the skies above Iraq and Afghanistan .
The Air Force complained that all those extra flight hours were turning the roboplane 's remote pilots into virtual " prisoners . "
Gates then publicly chastised the service during the drone buildup , comparing it to " pulling teeth . "
The scrapes harmed the service 's image in Congress , and with the public .
And so the Air Force launched an $ 81 million marketing effort to demonstrate its relevance in today 's conflicts .
Outside analysts wondered whether such a push was in violation of American anti-propaganda laws – especially after one of the spots was found be be " misleading . "
But , according to Air Force Times , " the last straw appears to be a [ damning ] report on nuclear weapons handling ... [ that ] critical report convinced Gates that changes must be made . "
That 's the reason Gates gave reporters , in a Pentagon press conference today .
But it might just have been the excuse he needed to can a pair of bureaucratic adversaries – read on .
The service inadvertently shipped " four high - tech electrical nosecone fuses for Minuteman nuclear warheads were [ t ] o
Taiwan in place of helicopter batteries .
The mistake was discovered in March — a year and a half after the erroneous shipment , " The New York Times reports .
" The mishandling of the nosecone fuses was viewed as another indication of lack of discipline within America ’s nuclear infrastructure , and was another embarrassment for the people in charge of those weapons . "
Last fall , the Air Force 's 5th Bomb Wing lost track of six nuclear warheads .
Then , in mid-May , the service flunked a nuclear surety inspection , when security personnel could n't even be bothered to stop playing videogames on their cellphones .
Now , it looks like Moseley and Wynne has some serious time to play with themselves .
Despite reports you may be reading elsewhere , this firing was not about nukes or missiles , well - placed sources say .
" Far and away the biggest issue was the budget stuff , not the nuclear stuff .
The UAV [ unmanned aerial vehicle ] fight , the F - 22 deal ...
Gates really did n't appreciate it , " one of those sources tells Danger Room .
Now , with the botched missile and nuke shipments , " the SecDef [ Secretary of Defense ] has good cover to do something that suits him bureaucratically . "
" The problem seems to be a philosophical difference between Gates and the USAF [ U.S. Air Force ] , not anything to do with nuclear weapons , " another adds .
And Moseley and Wynne may not be the last to go .
Rumors are swirling of more top - level Air Force officers getting the axe .
Stay tuned .
LATE UPDATE : In public , at least , Gates is blaming the purge on nukes .
Here 's the video :

" And you , I love you ! " the prom queen said to Sylvia , who sat quietly , never looking up from the television .
Sylvia was watching " The Price is Right " and she did n’t like to be disturbed .
Every now and again , she ’d yell out , " Four hundred and fifty - one dollars , idiot number two !
Goddamn you , you ’re losing , loser ! " but mostly , she just sat slack - jawed until one of the nurses came by to give her another plate of mush or a cup of pills .
I heard she was in for trying to stab her mom , which was probably true .
With all the side effects and lawsuits , they hardly gave anyone Thorazine anymore , but they handed them to Sylvia like jellybeans on Easter .
We were on the high security floor of a private teen psych ward .
Our section was called " Violent Suicidal Ideation and Attempt . "
It was very elite .
I was in because the cops found me nodding out in an abandoned apartment with a hypodermic needle to the right of my arm .
My mother insisted I was trying to kill myself , so she put me in the psych ward instead of drug rehab .
Fine , I told her , easier to get drugs handed to you in a Dixie cup than to have to buy them on the street , but that Haldol paralyzed me .
With heroin , you sit still because you want to .
On Haldol , you ’re trapped in your body .
Some days you ’re too stiff to move , other days your hands are like rubber and you ca n’t pick anything up , so I stopped taking it .
They gave me the cup , I pretended to swallow , and then I spit the pills out in the toilet .
After that , I ’d go sit in the common room and drool on myself for a while so the nurses did n’t get suspicious .
I was the only one who could color in the lines and I was the floor champion of foosball .
The story I ’d heard about the prom queen was that when her boyfriend dumped her for a blonde girl , she swallowed a glass of bleach and called him up crying .
He dialed 911 , so she thought he ’d saved her life .
She wandered the halls all day and night professing her love for her boyfriend and every other object and creature on earth , except for me .
Whenever I walked past her , she ’d clench her little pink hand into a fist , stare at me and say , " I ’m gonna kick your ass . "
She was talking about foosball , but she never beat me once .
No one did , not even the big girl I called Butch Jimmy .
I found out later she ’d been the champion of floor two .
When someone finally beat her , she knocked the table over and kicked it until she ’d decapitated six of the plastic guys , mangled two of the poles , and broken three of her toes .
They transferred her up to high security and put her on an enormous dose of Haldol , so she just watched the ball roll around .
Sometimes she looked a little angry when I told her she played foosball like a girl , but mostly she did n’t seem to know anyone was talking to her at all .
Then there was the pockmarked geek who tried to hang herself from a light fixture .
The fixture fell down .
She had a few little rope burns around her neck , but not much .
" That was stupid , " I ’d say in the middle of a game .
" You should ’ve hung yourself from the rafters .
Everybody knows that . "
She never even scored one goal .
But the prom queen was the easiest to distract .
" What are you , Mexican or something ? "
I ’d ask her , the little ball rolling by all her little men .
" Your hair is pretty dark for a white girl . "
" SHUT UP ! " she ’d scream , running her hands over her scalp as I scored again .
" YOU’RE UGLY ANYWAY !
I DON’T CARE WHAT YOU SAY ! "
The only other time I had any fun was in group therapy .
The doctor had a wide smile that looked like it hurt his face and when he got mad , his smile got bigger .
He told us to call him Dr. Rick , but I called him Dr. Dick .
He always asked Butch Jimmy why she was so uncomfortable in her " woman ’s body " and she ’d cover up her big tits with her big arms and go red in the face .
The prom queen , of course , had a crush on the guy .
She was n’t allowed to wear makeup , but sometimes she ’d convince the nurses to let her color before group and she ’d scribble over her lips with red magic marker when no one was looking .
Then , she ’d sit in the bony folding chair closest to Dr. Dick and sweat and giggle and look like she was about to drop dead of sheer nervousness .
Group therapy even got Sylvia worked up .
The doctor did n’t ask her anything — he was afraid of her , I guess , but she ’d growl under her breath , " idiots idiot fucking cockfucker idiot " through every session .
The geek , though , the geek was the best .
For some reason , the doctor really had it in for her .
" Anastasia , " he ’d say , " why do n’t you tell us why you tried to hang yourself ? "
" Because I wanted to commit suicide . "
She ’d answer , like it was the stupidest question in the world .
" But why , Anastasia , why would a girl in the prime of her life want to commit suicide ? "
" Because I wanted to fucking DIE ! Jesus ! "
To be honest , I kind of liked the geek , but she was so easy to make fun of , I could n’t help myself .
" If you wanted to die so bad , then why did you do such a half - assed job ? " I ’d ask .
" I mean , look at those tiny little scars — what did you try to hang yourself with — dental floss ? "
She ’d start shaking and the prom queen would start whimpering , even though I had n’t been talking to her , and Sylvia would swear a little louder , and Jimmy would just look nervous , like I was about to come in for her next .
" Darla , " Dr. Dick would ask , " Why are you so belligerent to the very people who could become your friends ? "
" Dr. Dick , " I ’d respond , " Why would a grown man like you be in love with a teenage girl like the prom queen over there ?
I mean , what would your wife do if she knew ? "
Dr. Dick ’s grin would get so big it looked like his jawbones were about to pop right through his cheeks .
He was as easy to aggravate as the lunatics .
At first , I looked forward to group therapy , since it was different than every other day in the week , but after a while it got boring too .
We always said the exact same things , over and over and over .
Being in the psych ward was like living the same week twenty weeks in a row .
Sometimes I thought of taking my medicine just to make the days pass quicker , but all I had to do was look around at the rest of the girls —
Sylvia drooling on the couch and the prom queen giggling at the doorknob , and I ’d spit the pills out again .
Even foosball was getting boring .
It did n’t matter if I came up with new insults or not .
The Mexican joke made the prom queen cry as hard the fiftieth time as it had the first .
The geek had gotten so shaky she could barely hold on to the poles , and Jimmy would sometimes forget she was playing and just walk away in the middle of the game .
The only way to get her back was to ask her what her bra size was , and she ’d stumble back to the table , mad at first , but by the time she ’d given her guys a few spins , she ’d have forgotten all about it again .
They were like a bunch of zombies , the walking dead , and no matter what I said or did , I could n’t snap them out of it for more than a minute .
I was dying of boredom .
One day , I waited until " The Price is Right " was on and plopped down on the couch next to Sylvia .
It creaked like an old bed and coughed up a cloud of dust .
I turned off the TV .
Sylvia did n’t respond .
This threw me a little , I expected at least some swearing , but I kept to my plan .
I thought if I got her riled up enough , she ’d yell at me , maybe start a fight , anything besides sit there like she always did .
I just wanted one different day .
" How did you end up in Suicidal Ideation anyway , " I asked .
" I mean , what ?
They do n’t have Homicidal Ideation in this hospital ? "
She did n’t flinch .
She just kept staring at the television like it was on .
" Why ’d you try to kill your mom ?
She must ’ve , like , whored you out or something .
It ca n’t be the regular stuff .
Even rape does n’t make people as crazy as you . "
A drop of drool leaked out of Sylvia ’s mouth , but she did n’t move .
" Hey ! " I said , " I bet you ’re named after that crazy lady that wrote ‘ The Bell Jar , ’ are n’t you ?
You know , that one where that girl feels all sorry for herself and walks around with razorblades in her purse , but she ’s too grossed out by blood to slit her wrists and then she ends up getting cured with shock therapy ? "
No response .
" She killed herself anyway , you know , " I said , to myself more than to Sylvia .
" The oven .
I did n’t even know that really worked .
I should tell the geek — she might even be able to pull that off , as long as she remembers not to use electric . "
If Sylvia ’s eyes had n’t been open , I would ’ve thought she was asleep , and if her chest had n’t been moving , I would ’ve thought she was dead .
" God damn , " I said , " you ’re the worst one here .
There ’s nothing left in you . "
And it was true .
There was no life in her eyes — they were milked over like a dead dog’s .
I got up and went to tell the geek my new joke , and a nurse came by and turned the television back on but Sylvia ’s expression did n’t change at all .
That afternoon , we had group therapy .
Dr. Dick started off , as usual , by asking if anyone had anything to say .
Most of the time , the prom queen would raise her hand real high in the air like we were all fighting to get a word in edgewise .
Then she ’d say something stupid about what a beautiful day it was or how much she loved the shrink ’s tie .
This time , even though her hand was in the air , Dr. Dick did n’t call her name .
Instead he sat with his mouth wide open , like he ’d taken all the Thorazine in the hospital .
" Sylvia ? " he said .
We all turned to the corner , where Sylvia sat , and sure enough , her hand was up .
Her head was cocked to the side , and she stared straight ahead as usual , but her jaw was clenched and her nostrils flared .
" Sylvia ? " Dr. Dick asked again , " do you have something to contribute ? "
I ’d never heard Sylvia speak before , except to swear under her breath .
I guess I expected her to stutter and hiss the way she cursed , but this time her voice was strong and clear .
" Darla does n’t take her medicine , " she said .
" She spits it in the toilet . "
Even though I could see people move their mouths , I could n’t hear anything .
The prom queen ’s lips were rounded into an excited " oooh . "
Jimmy ’s mouth had melted into a slow , wide grin and the geek was clapping her hands .
Sylvia sat there vacantly , like she had n’t said a thing .
I noticed that Dr. Dick had lost all trace of his smile , which meant that he was very , very happy .
" Well , Darla , what do you have to say to this accusation ? " he mouthed .
I wanted to ask what he cared what I had to say .
The nurses would check behind my tongue now , they ’d watch me to make sure I did n’t puke the pills up because as soon as Sylvia had said it , everybody knew it was true .
My own voice sounded like it was coming from behind a thick door .
" You ’re as crazy as the rest of us , if you believe a nutcase like Sylvia . "
But he had me and he knew it .
We went back to the common room and the nurse came around with her tray of pills .
She was tall and skinny and had frizzy red hair .
I called her Nurse Ratchet .
I called all the nurses Nurse Ratchet , but this one took it particularly personally .
Whenever I said it , she ’d scratch something down in her notebook and say , " one more comment like that and you wo n’t have television privileges for a week , " which of course she never followed up on .
The shrink must ’ve told her what had happened , because she came straight for me , smiling .
The prom queen squealed , " She does n’t swallow her medicine !
Make her swallow it ! "
All the other girls gathered around .
The nurse handed me a cup of pills and another of water .
After I ’d put both in my mouth , she grabbed me by the jaw , tilted my head back , and squeezed hard enough to leave a bruise .
" Swallow , " she said , tightening her grip .
So I did .
It ’d been about two months since I ’d taken it , and the Haldol flooded over me and hardened .
I was stuck in my chair .
When I could finally open my eyes , I saw Sylvia hovering over my head .
" Price is Right ! " I insisted , trying to get Sylvia to go back to the television .
" Idiot number two !
Idiot number three ! "
She opened her mouth and reached behind her crooked teeth .
She pulled out a small yellow capsule , partially corroded by her spit .
" Nuh - no , never did anything to you . "
I pleaded .
My fingers dangled like they were hanging from my palms on hooks .
" Swallow , " she said , grabbing my jaw and mimicking the nurse .
" You lose , you loser . "
She stood over me until the Thorazine kicked in , waved her hand in front of me .
There was a thin lengthwise cut on her wrist — just an attention - getter .
She could n’t have lost more than a spoonful of blood .
This seemed funny to me at the time , but I did n’t feel like I was laughing .
She picked me up .
My body seemed like it should ’ve stayed frozen in the sitting position , but my feet fell to the floor .
Sylvia and Butch Jimmy walked me over to the foosball table .
The prom queen had her face right up near the plastic men , like she was introducing herself to each one individually .
Butch Jimmy patted her on the back .
Sylvia sat down in front of the television , but did n’t turn it on .
She stared at the blank screen and watched our reflections in it .
Jimmy put my hands on two of the poles .
I did n’t do anything , so the geek pinched me hard , twisting my skin a little .
" P- play ! " she said .
" You ca n’t d- do anything right without ch-ch - cheating ! "
I spun the poles .
I was surprised to find I had any strength left in my hands .
It was funny to watch the plastic men ’s paddle - feet in the air while they got smacked in the face with the ball , but it was too much spinning for me .
I felt like I was going to puke , like my head was going to roll right off my shoulders and my eyeballs were going to tumble out of their sockets onto the table .
The foosball men looked like they were wearing little straightjackets .
The paint had worn off their faces , leaving nothing but a black dot for an eye or a red line for a mouth .
Other than that they were blank .
I must ’ve stopped playing , because the geek pinched me again .
It hurt less this time , and I could n’t tell if it was because she did n’t pinch as hard , or because the drugs were really starting to work .
I twirled the nearest handle and watched the ball drop down into the cave of the prom queen ’s goal .
I wanted to go with it — it would be dark in there and quiet .
Empty .
The prom queen let out a little cry , and I thought maybe the game was over and I stopped moving my hands , but the geek pinched me again .
I could barely feel it at all .
After a while I could n’t feel anything .
I was n’t anywhere .
Later , I found myself sitting in a chair next to Sylvia .
She was staring at a closed book that was lying on the table in front of us .
I could n’t move .
The prom queen was on the couch , crying .
Butch Jimmy patted her on the back .
The geek said , " Darla che-ated , she cheated .
She c - c - could n’t have w - won without ch-ch- cheating . "
I sat there until the nurse came by to give me another cup of pills .
She stood over me while I swallowed , and I opened my mouth without being asked .
A few hours later , she came over to give me more .
WHEN trading in the Standard & Poor 's ( S&P ) 500 stock index opened on June 2nd , Bear Stearns was not among the stocks that comprise it .
To add insult to the injury caused by its subprime peccadilloes , the crippled 105 - year - old investment bank was ejected from the S&P 500 at the close of trading on May 30th following its takeover by JP Morgan .
It was replaced by Intuitive Surgical , a firm that was founded in 1995 and now dominates the fast - growing global market for minimally invasive surgical techniques that use robotics and other leading - edge technologies .
Intuitive Surgical
Both intuitive and surgical
America has long been a global powerhouse of innovation , breeding thousands of firms such as Intuitive Surgical that have forged new , world - beating technologies and services from ideas born in garages , laboratories and offices across the nation .
Yet some observers fear that the country is now in danger of losing its lead in commercial innovation to India , China and other upstarts unless the federal government gets more heavily involved in sponsoring innovation .
With a presidential election looming , the cries of alarm are reaching a crescendo .
A report published in April by The Brookings Institution and the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation , two think - tanks , warns that “ without a robust , targeted , and explicit federal innovation push , US competitiveness will slip and economic growth will lag ” .
The report 's authors , Robert Atkinson and Howard Wial , urge the swift creation of a National Innovation Foundation that would use its $ 1 billion - $ 2 billion budget to , among other things , promote partnerships between universities and industry , and support regional industry “ clusters ” with federal grants .
Their concern that America will soon be overtaken in the innovation stakes is echoed in the blogosphere .
Last week Bruce Nussbaum , who writes a blog on design and innovation issues , called on the American government to go beyond supporting higher - education research in areas such as maths and science .
His taxpayer - financed “ to - do list ” includes funding research around innovation in the service sector and paying for the roll out of a national , high - speed broadband network .
On his blog , Mr Nussbaum called the presidential primaries “ devoid of any serious discussion ” of American competitiveness .
Hillary Clinton has an “ innovation agenda ” , but this seems to be dedicated to reducing America 's dependence on oil and to boosting funding for existing government - research bodies and science fellowships .
Barack Obama and John McCain have both said they would make tax credits for research and development ( R&D ) permanent and , in Mr Obama 's case , use regulation of the wireless spectrum to encourage broadband usage .
But neither has shown much appetite for broader - based intervention .
So is America 's next president guilty of neglecting an issue that is vital to the country 's future prosperity ?
Not in this column 's view .
On the contrary , the candidates are right to turn a deaf ear to techno - nationalists whose prescriptions are at best misguided and at worst positively harmful .
Indeed , the assumption that America is losing its innovative edge is open to question .
Messrs Atkinson and Wial cite statistics that show the country 's share of worldwide total domestic R&D spending fell from 46 % in 1986 to 37 % in 2003 as evidence that the nation 's leadership is under threat .
And they bemoan the shifting of American R&D overseas : in the last ten years , they claim , the percentage of US corporate R&D sites within America fell from 59 % to 52 % , while the number in China and India rose from 8 % to 18 % .
Yet by many traditional measures , such as the number of patents registered and levels of venture - capital funding , America remains ahead of the global pack .
And its research is still widely recognised as being top - notch : the 2006 science Nobels all went to Americans .
As for “ offshoring ” R&D , this reflects US firms ' desire to tap into huge markets abroad and to understand the potential of ideas being developed there .
Techno-nationalists who focus on “ domestic ” R&D levels as an indicator of a nation 's innovativeness overlook this important fact .
They also fail to appreciate that R&D is not the only driver of successful innovation .
In a book to be published later this year Amar Bhidé , a professor at Columbia University , argues that what matters in today 's global economy is not where an idea comes from , but how fast a country 's firms and consumers are willing to try it out .
And America is outstanding at what Mr Bhidé has dubbed “ venturesome consumption ” .
Many popular American gizmos , such as Apple 's iPod and Dell 's computers , are chock full of the latest technologies from overseas .
The good news for America is that creating a “ venturesome ” economy is n't easy , as it has more to do with a country 's culture than with central planning .
That 's one reason why efforts to jump start Europe 's innovation engine by , for instance , pouring billions of euros into industrial clusters have proven so disappointing ( see The Economist 's special report on innovation , published last year ) .
America would be well - advised not to follow suit .
It should also think twice before creating a federal innovation agency , which would do more harm than good by backing technologies that consumers might not want .
And as for funding research into the services sector , leave that to firms like IBM and EDS — American companies that practically created the market and now dominate it .
The best thing a government can do is to ensure that the creative juices of its residents and its companies are allowed to flow as freely as possible .
In America 's case that means , for example , rethinking the stiff restrictions placed on work visas following the 2001 terrorist attacks , which have driven away foreign talent and probably stimulated the growth of those R&D centres abroad .
It also means overhauling the educational system from the bottom up , so that American schoolchildren have access to the best possible science and engineering education .
Creating a better framework within which human ingenuity can flourish — rather than trying to pick winners from the centre — is the right way to ensure that the Intuitive Surgicals of the future are made in America .
Since the January 2007 protest against the Iraq occupation and war , I have written a few pieces regarding that ongoing military activity and the movement against it .
These pieces have been greeted with positive responses and negative ones .
They have also been met with responses telling me that the movement is not only dead but ineffective and irrelevant .
Furthermore , write these cynics , there is no point in reviving the movement because it can not be effective no matter what it does .
Others write that we should the election run its course and vote for the most antiwar of the remaining candidates .
To these critics , I would argue that it is the presence of the antiwar movement and its silent majority against the war that has prevented the Pentagon from expanding the war and restarting the military draft .
I would also argue that it is essential for that movement to reinvigorate itself and get out in the streets in very large numbers no matter who gets elected in November .
No politician is going to move to end the war without pressure from the popular flank .
It ’s just too easy for them to defer to the generals and civilians in the Pentagon .
Mainstream media tells us and will tell us even more as the election season heats up ) that neither party wants to appear “ weak ” when it comes to defense .
What this really means is that no politician wants to stand up to the war industry , especially since they get millions of dollars from the corporations involved .
Even more importantly , it is the war industry that props up the US economy .
Without the billions of taxpayers ’ monies flowing into their coffers , corporations like General Dynamics , Boeing , Lockheed Martin and dozens of others would founder worse than the US auto industry has .
Such a fall would certainly be felt across the board .
So , like a junkie needing an ever stronger fix , the Pentagon puts more and more money into its deadly addiction , killing soldiers and civilians , stealing money from the public piggy bank , and ravaging the nation ’s soul .
The politicians in Congress , meanwhile act like the dealer on the street , taking the money proffered by the Pentagon , and copping the drug of death from those that manufacture it .
Lost in this dynamic of money and death is the very real fact that it is our money the Pentagon and the politicians are using for their thanatos - inspired endeavors .
I ’m not suggesting you stop paying your taxes ( unless you want to go that way ) , but I am suggesting that we , the people of the US , demand a more humane use of the money the government does take .
If cynicism concerning the possibility of the antiwar movement being effective is one prevalent opinion among the writers telling me that I ’m wasting my time , then the other strain is the bunch who believe electoral politics will elect someone who will end the war .
This exists in spite of the shameful record of the 2006 class of Democrats elected to do exactly that .
Further examples of the Democratic Party ’s stance can be found in its ’ remaining presidential candidates ’ support for war on Iran and the almost unanimous support it has shown for the PATRIOT Act and other repressive measures introduced by the Bush regime .
There is something tying these strains of thought together and that is a belief that there was a democratic government in this country before 2001 .
Those who believe that Obama may turn the tide if elected believe it is the Bush regime that has ended that democracy .
So do many of the cynics .
The fact is this government has not been democratic for decades except in its form .
The rise of the national security state , the elimination of the left from the labor movement and the press in the 1950s , the COINTELPRO war waged against the popular movements in the 1960s and 1970s , and the economic disenfranchisement of whole classes of people and ther re-creation into an underclass under Reagan / Bush / Clinton are all part of the history the Bush regime has continued .
We can restore democracy in this country .
Rebuilding a popular mass - based antiwar movement whose members and leaders spend more time in the streets than in the halls of Congress or Democratic Party meetings is the first step in that direction .
It is the poseurs and fraudulent antiwarriors whose allegiances to the Democratic Party come before any determination to win the war that is making the antiwar movement a shadow of its potential , not the Bush regime .
The Bush cabal ’s antagonism is apparent , just like Richard Nixon ’s was in from 1969 - 1974 , and is part of what we are fighting .
It is the wolves in Democrats ’ clothing that are the predators we should also be aware of .
Of course , there are allies in the mainstream political scene and we should encourage those folks to work with our agenda , not bend our agenda to theirs .
Elections have yet to stop a war .
The governors of four states and representatives from 14 more gathered at the Yale University campus late last week for the 2008 Conference of Governors on Climate Change , signing a statement intended to highlight the risk of climate change .
They were joined by officials from Canadian provinces and the head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( and recent Nobel Laureate ) R. K. Pachauri .
Many of the states represented at the conference have already initiated their own efforts or joined regional pacts , but their joint statement emphasized the need for federal coordination and support .
In recognition of the recent decision by the current administration to forgo emissions cuts for nearly 20 years , the statement went straight past Bush and addressed the presidential candidates , calling for them to commit to climate initiatives during the first 100 days of their administration , stating , " We have no time to lose . "
The 18 states involved account for over half of US emissions ; a number produce the equivalent of a large European nation .
The list is heavily biased towards the two coasts , with the Northeast heavily represented and Governor Schwarzenegger of California in attendance .
Others signing on , however , included Florida , the midwestern states Kansas and Illinois , and western states such as Colorado , New Mexico and Arizona .
Notably absent were states with economies focused on extraction , such as Texas and West Virginia .
Michigan , however , chose to sign the pact despite its history of resisting conservation measures in deference to the auto industry which employs so many in the state .
The conference was inspired in part by the 100th anniversary of a similar meeting , called by Theodore Roosevelt , which helped launch the effort to conserve public lands .
That historic precedent brought the current situation into sharp contrast , as the states have been compelled to play a significant role in the US climate effort in part due to the absence of federal leadership .
Even with a robust national effort , however , states would play a significant role — they are major employers , and thus consumers of energy , and most play a role in structuring the energy market for their residents .
Governor Schwarzenegger addresses the conference
The statement signed at the conference called for federal involvement to strengthen existing state climate efforts , declaring , " we [ the states ] will continue these efforts , but we can not do it alone . "
One of the three guiding principles of the agreement was that a federal - state partnership is , " the only way we can get the job done . "
The second principle noted that existing state programs , " are real and they work , " and their expansion into national efforts should be supported .
Finally , the states declared that mandatory carbon limits , both at the state and national levels , are essential for future progress .
But talks by governors John Corzine , Kathleen Sibelius , and Arnold Schwarzenegger made it clear that the governors are not simply frustrated by the lack of national action to limit carbon output .
Repeated references were made to federal interference in states ' efforts to limit emissions , especially the EPA 's decision to block California 's attempts to limit tailpipe emissions .
Based on statements by the Premiers of Manitoba and Quebec , a number of Canadian provinces are ready go along with emissions limits as soon as the California standard is enforced .
The frustration of the political figures in attendance was palpable .
The talks given by the officials present appeared to suggest that the governors are laying the groundwork for the arrival of a new administration early next year .
As all three remaining major - party candidates have expressed interest in creating mandatory carbon emissions caps , action seems likely .
The states appear to be trying to both build public support for whatever action occurs , and to make sure that their efforts serve as models for national action .
We 'll take a detailed look at the salesmanship involved in a separate article , but one thing was apparent at the conference : none of the attendees saw the need to reiterate the IPCC 's conclusion that climate change is a reality .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
He 's pregnant .
This male weedy sea dragon became the third ever in the U.S. to become pregnant outside of its habitat .
After setting the mood with lighting and finessing , the Georgia Aquarium 's attempts to coax rare sea dragons to mate have finally worked -- just in time for Father 's Day .
The pregnant male weedy sea dragon is now only the third of its kind in the United States to successfully become pregnant outside of its natural habitat .
The sea dragon , found in nature only in the waters off southern Australia , became pregnant Tuesday when a female transferred her eggs onto his tail .
Dennis Christen , assistant manager of animal care and husbandry , said that male sea horses , sea dragons and pipe fish all carry the eggs instead of the female .
Christen said that recently the staff took steps to try to assist in mating .
They altered the mood by adjusting the lighting and thinning the plants , Christen said .
But so much is unknown about the creatures , including their mating routines , that a lot about the pregnancy remains a mystery , Christen said .
When the animals finally do mate , the sea dragons arch their tails and swim side by side until they latch onto each other before swimming vertically together during their version of a " date . "
" When they 're courting they do a really ritualistic dance , " he said .
What little is known about that dance could hold a key to problems with breeding the animals in small tanks similar to those at the aquarium .
" Some people think that problems are if the tank is n't deep enough they do n't have enough time to swim vertically , " Christen said .
Of the 70 small pink eggs wrapped around the male 's tail , nobody knows how many are viable and could actually hatch .
Christen said that they are relying on other experiences with breeding , where about 60 percent of the eggs survived , to estimate how things may go .
At the Georgia Aquarium , children and teachers were abuzz about the pregnant dragon and circled around the tank trying to pick it out .
" Which one is the mommy ? " one little boy shouted before a guide corrected him and said the male was carrying the eggs .
When the eggs hatch , Christen said they will essentially be miniature versions of the adults .
And unlike many animals the weedy sea dragons will not spend their first days , weeks and months shadowing their parents to learn .
" They basically hatch and are on their own , " he said .
" There 's no real parental training . "
The eggs are expected to hatch in four to six weeks .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The United States will allow Americans to send mobile phones to relatives in Cuba under a change in policy that President Bush announced Wednesday .
President Bush announces the U.S. policy allowing cell phones to Cuba at the White House on Wednesday .
Bush said he is making the change since President Raúl Castro " is allowing Cubans to own mobile phones for the first time . "
" If he is serious about his so - called reforms , he will allow these phones to reach the Cuban people , " Bush said .
Bush urged the Cuban government to loosen restrictions further , saying if Cubans can be allowed to own mobile phones , " they should be trusted to speak freely in public . "
They should be allowed to watch uncensored movies and have free access to the Internet , he said .
And he called for the government to implement major free - market reforms .
Relations between the United States and Cuba remain tense nearly 50 years after Fidel Castro overthrew the pro-American government in Havana .
The United States has maintained an embargo against Cuba for decades .
Cuban officials on Monday accused the top U.S. diplomat in Havana of delivering money from private anti-Castro groups in Florida to dissidents in Cuba .
U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said that " the U.S. government has programs to provide humanitarian assistance to people that are essentially forgotten by the Cuban government and that we ... do not stand in the way of private groups doing that as well . "
As to how that is done , he said , " I 'm not aware of the mechanics ; I do n't steep myself in these things . "
Fidel Castro , beset with health problems , handed day - to - day governing power over to Raúl , his younger brother , earlier this year .
After being elected president in February , Raúl Castro announced that Cubans who can afford them could buy cell phones and DVD players and stay in hotels previously reserved for foreign tourists -- overturning bans from the Fidel era .
The goods and services remain out of reach for most people on the island , where $ 120 cell phones plus $ 10.80 calling cards cost about six times the average monthly salary .
Bush said Wednesday it is " the height of hypocrisy to claim credit to allow Cubans to purchase appliances that virtually none of them can afford . "
Though the price may put mobile phones out of the reach of most Cubans , they are affordable for many of those who have access to U.S. dollars -- typically either sent from relatives abroad or earned internally by tourist workers .
Bush on Wednesday marked what the White House called a Day of Solidarity with the Cuban People , which the president said he hopes will be an annual event .

Just a few puffs on a rolled - up cigarette containing " skunk " - a strong form of cannabis - was all it took to strip Nicky Taylor of all her capabilities and to induce a terrifying combination of paranoia , fear and anxiety .
As the drug took effect , she was rendered incapable of doing anything save look anxiously around her and try to calm her trembling hands .
But Nicky is not just another of the millions of Britons who smoke cannabis regularly .
She chose to experiment with the drug as part of a BBC documentary in which she investigated just how damaging smoking different forms of the drug can be - with herself as a guinea pig .

Stoned : After smoking a skunk joint Nicky Taylor felt everyone hated her
" I felt absolutely terrified , " recalls Nicky , a divorced mother - of - three , thinking back to her first experience just over a month ago .
" Paranoia set in , and I felt as if I was having a panic attack .
At one point , I was simply too frightened to get out of my chair .
" I had a feeling the drug had unlocked some sort of paranoia in my head that would never go away again - I suddenly felt everyone hated me .
Without doubt , that was one of the worst moments of my life . "
It has been well over 20 years since Nicky first smoked cannabis , which she tried as a student .
But for this investigation she has spent the past month in Amsterdam , where she smoked around a joint of cannabis - which two years ago was downgraded from a class B to a class C drug in Britain - every day .
Controversially , she also allowed herself to be injected with pure THC ( tetrahydrocannabinol ) , the active ingredient in cannabis .
Her aim was to discover the true effect cannabis had on her mind and body - and conversely on the millions of Britons who now smoke it regularly .
While some will question Nicky 's wisdom in committing herself to such an experiment when she is a mother of three young children , there is little doubt that her experiences are both enlightening and cautionary to anyone who might think cannabis is harmless .
At one point during her investigation , scientific tests proved that , thanks to the drug , she had developed a level of psychosis well above that seen in individuals with schizophrenia .
It is estimated that 15 million people in the UK have tried cannabis , and up to 5 million smoke it on a regular basis .
In the UK , cannabis use has increased 1,000 per cent since the Seventies , and according to a recent Unicef report , the UK has the third highest rate of young people smoking cannabis in the Western world .

Yet there is now considerable medical evidence that cannabis causes psychosis .
It has also been linked to schizophrenia , and is believed to be behind a string of violent murders .
Even mild short - term use can result in depression and sleep disturbances .
" As a mother , I wanted to find out what is in store for my children if they ever try cannabis , " says Nicky , who lives in Kidderminster with her children Freya , nine , Millie , eight , and Harry , six .
" Also , there is no doubt that cannabis has got stronger - over the past few years , home - grown cannabis has been genetically altered so that it contains 10 to 15 per cent THC , whereas naturally - grown cannabis contains only 3 to 5 per cent .
" I wanted to know whether there is any truth to the claim made by dope smokers that you can smoke cannabis and carry on with life as normal .
And I wanted to find out if the drug really does drive you into madness . "
To conduct her investigation , Nicky spent a month in Amsterdam , working part - time at a coffee shop that sells the drug .
Although she would not be allowed to smoke during her shift , she lit up every day after work .
" The first time I smoked cannabis in Amsterdam it contained one of the strongest forms of ' skunk ' on sale , and the result was absolutely horrendous , " says Nicky .
" At that moment , I felt like pulling the plug on the investigation , packing my bags and heading home to my children , who 'd stayed in the UK with my mother .
I ended up having a row with my cameraman , too , because I was so irrational and paranoid .
" It all felt a world away from the feeling of harmless giddiness I 'd remembered having from smoking it a little as a student .
It hit me that I could be risking my sanity - and it did n't feel worth it . "
However , waking the next morning , Nicky 's paranoia had dissipated and she decided to carry on .
That is not to say she did n't feel any physical and mental after - effects of the drug .
" Although the paranoia had gone , I was left dazed and my mind seemed to be operating much more slowly than it usually does , " says Nicky .
" I had no motivation and just wanted to go back to bed .
I had no idea how anyone could get stoned at night and then function properly the next day . "
Over the following week , Nicky smoked different varieties of cannabis on a daily basis .
While she did not encounter the same level of paranoia again , her ability to work was nonetheless compromised by the drug 's effects .
" At one point , I went to interview the man who runs Amsterdam 's hemp museum after smoking cannabis , " says Nicky .
" I wanted to appear professional - as any reporter from the BBC would .
But this proved to be next to impossible .
I was giggly and could hardly keep my mind on what he was saying .
" Embarrassingly , my attention suddenly wandered to a pile of guinea pig bedding which was sitting in the corner of his office , clearly intended for someone 's pet .
" I rushed over to it and kept picking it up .
I felt as if I 'd just discovered the Holy Grail , but the poor man clearly thought I was incredibly odd .
He was obviously uncomfortable in my presence , and I was clearly unable to be professional while on the drug . "
To find out how much her concentration had been compromised , Nicky set herself the task of assembling a flat pack cabinet , first free from and then under the influence of cannabis .
Without having smoked the drug , she found the job straightforward .
While stoned however , it was a different matter .
" I took only two puffs of cannabis , but was totally hopeless when it came to assembling the cabinet , " she says .
I felt so spaced out that I ended up passing out on the sofa with the cabinet still in bits around me .
The drug totally destroyed my ability to think . "
Over the course of the four - week investigation , this " mental oblivion " , as Nicky describes it , was to become a familiar feeling .
On a daily basis , depending on the strength of cannabis she had smoked , she either spiralled into depression and paranoia or simply passed out and had to go to bed .
" I noticed very quickly that the stronger the variety of cannabis , the more paranoia and depression I experienced , " she says .
" Some nights , particularly after smoking ' skunk ' , which is high in THC , I could n't sleep at all and would be pacing my room , becoming more and more paranoid and thinking everyone I 'd met at the cafe , as well as the BBC crew , was talking about me .
" But even the weaker varieties rendered me completely useless .
I 'd often go to bed at 8 pm and be totally crashed out until morning .
I felt constantly groggy and unmotivated , I could n't wake up in the mornings and I 'd find myself longing to go back to bed all day .
" My motivation was reduced to zero and I felt totally slowed down .
" I'm a very active person , with a mind that normally works at a million miles an hour .
I thrive on multi-tasking and getting through my daily ' To do ' lists .
Yet , with cannabis in my life , I reached the end of every day feeling frustrated that I 'd achieved so little .
" By the end of a month of smoking cannabis every day , I felt as if my mind had been turned into treacle and nothing made much sense to me any more .
" Even basic things like trying to send emails or talk to people on the phone became a real effort of will and brain power .
There is no way I could carry on with the life I lead now , looking after my children , at the same time as smoking cannabis , even if it was just occasionally . "
If Nicky 's mind seemed to be getting smaller , her waistline was expanding .
Over the course of her investigation , she gained half a stone , due to the drug 's tendency to bring on cravings for junk food .
" Cannabis triggers a chemical surge in the brain which stimulates the appetite , and in particular makes you crave sweet and salty snacks while you are stoned , " says Nicky .
" I could easily get through a couple of packets of biscuits and a huge bag of crisps , and the result was I quickly gained weight .
" I usually go running every day , but the effect of the drug on my lungs meant this was no longer possible either , because cannabis compromises lung function three times as much as ordinary cigarettes .
" And I not only felt groggy - I looked groggy , too .
I woke up every morning with puffy eyes and sallow skin .
It was as though the drug had destroyed my ability to refresh my body as well as my mind . "
Once back in the UK , Nicky visited the Institute of Psychiatry , where , for the final stage of her investigation , she took part in a unique experiment .
Scientists there are interested in the effect of the ratio between the drug's two main components - THC and cannabanoid - and the levels of psychosis induced in the user , and are undertaking trials in which volunteers are injected with both pure THC and THC mixed with cannabanoid .
Nicky agreed to do this , too , and following each injection , she underwent a series of psychological tests designed to assess her state of mind .
Even though injecting the drug means it reaches the bloodstream more quickly than if it 's smoked , the results were shocking .
" With the mixture of THC and cannabanoid - which is roughly equivalent to the sort of ' grass ' people smoked in the Sixties , I felt very giggly and silly , " says Nicky .
" I felt groggy afterwards and would n't want to feel that way all the time , but there was n't anything too troubling about the experience .
" The psychological tests indicated that while I was flippant and had lost any sense of care and responsibility , I had not become psychotic . "
However , Nicky 's experience with pure THC - more akin to the strong " skunk " favoured by cannabis users today - was far more sinister .
Within minutes of receiving the injection , she was overcome by morbid thoughts .
" I was suddenly gripped by the idea that the scientists conducting the experiment were characters from a horror film who were somehow out to get me , " she says .
" I later found myself fantasising about jumping out of a window and crawling away somewhere that I would never be found .
I was increasingly agitated and convinced they were trying to trick me in everything they said to me . "
Most alarmingly , she also took a test , in the form of a series of questions about her state of mind , in which a score of four points and above indicates significant psychosis of the level seen in people with schizophrenia - she scored 14 .
" I could n't believe it when I saw my result - it was terrifying to think I was experiencing greater psychosis than someone with schizophrenia , " says Nicky .
" It proved without doubt that the drug was playing havoc with my mind , and inducing a psychotic state that I would never have reached without it .
" I was reassured that once the effect of the drug had worn off after a few hours , I would return to normal , but it might be a different case for individuals with a family history of mental illness . "
With her investigation now behind her , Nicky is adamant that she will never touch cannabis again .
Thankfully , she appears not to have experienced any long - term effects from using the drug .
" I do feel extremely worried for my children 's future and will certainly do all I can to ensure that they stay away from the drug , " says Nicky .
" Until now , I had n't really considered cannabis had that much more effect than a bottle of wine might do , but now I know that 's far from the truth .
" The drug took me to some dark and frightening places , to which I hope I never return . "
· Retailer claims £ 1.6 m for damage to its reputation · Article said company did not ' love ' Thailand
Tesco in Thailand is suing a second columnist from a Bangkok business newspaper for £ 1.6 m in libel damages .
The global retailer , trading as Tesco Lotus , claims the business gossip writer for Bangkok Business News damaged the company 's reputation when she said the company did not " love " Thailand .
The offending article in Nongnart Harnvilai 's tongue - in - cheek " Buzz " column was part of a collection of short stories on page 28 of the paper , and ran to just a few sentences .
Six weeks after the article appeared on January 29 , the journalist on the Thai - language business daily , part of the respected Nation newspaper group , received a writ from Tesco Lotus .
Another of the paper 's columnists , Kamol Kamoltrakul , had also been served with a libel writ from Tesco Lotus seeking 100 m baht ( £ 1.6 m ) in damages 11 days earlier .
A third Tesco Lotus critic , Jit Siratranont , former MP and now vice - general secretary of the Thai Chamber of Commerce , faces two years in jail accused of criminal libel , and a damages claim of 1.1 bn baht ( £ 16.6 m ) .
Campaigners for free speech said the latest writ underscored Tesco Lotus 's determination to stamp out criticism of its rapid expansion , which has been hotly debated for nearly a decade .
" Obviously Tesco Lotus is on the warpath , " said Roby Alampay , of the South - east Asian Press Alliance ( Seapa ) .
" It 's out to silence not only criticism , but seems to want to stop anyone saying anything about the company .
We find that very ominous . "
A committee of the Thai Journalists Association concerned with the potential erosion of press freedom is due to meet the columnists today to discuss ways to combat Tesco Lotus 's tactics .
Next week , Thailand 's Human Rights Commission is set to address the company 's multiple libel writs and the tactic of going after individuals rather than the organisations they represent .
Both Jit , 56 , and Kamol , 58 , had criticised Tesco Lotus 's " aggressive " expansion in Thailand , saying it had come at the expense of small retailers who could not compete with company 's 370 superstores and hypermarkets across the country .
They also said the company had sought to minimise its
Thai tax liabilities .
Nongnart , 45 , joined the fray when she remarked on Tesco Lotus 's plans to open a further 130 outlets , saying Thai competitors were in for a tough time .
" Ha , Tesco Lotus does n't love Thais , " was her sign off .
In the libel writ Tesco Lotus claimed the article had hurt its image and demanded £ 1.6 m to repair the damage .
" It was supposed to be funny , " said Duangkamol Chotana , the Bangkok Business News editor .
" It 's not even real criticism .
I ca n't understand how Tesco Lotus feels damaged by this .
I 'm surprised by their action because they should understand and respect media freedom . "
Bangkok Business
News has said it will fight the actions and is backing both its columnists even though they - rather than it - were named in the writs .
But Tesco Lotus denied it was involved in a witch - hunt against individuals and merely felt it had to protect its name .
" It has never been our policy to seek legal action against anyone unless the things they say about the company are blatantly untrue , " said Darmp Sukontasap , a Tesco Lotus senior vice - president .
" I believe this was the case in this instance .
We 're pursuing the case mainly because we believe that the things Nongnart said about the company were untrue .
We have no other alternative but to seek justice in the court of law in order defend our good name and commitment we have to Thailand . "
Last night Microsoft hosted a dinner with Shane Kim and Kudo Tsunoda for myself and four other game journalists after the Electronic Arts gathering .
For most of the dinner our group huddled around the table talking games and eating Hawaiian fusion food .

Tsunoda , who was unfortunate enough to be sitting right next to me , spent much of the evening trying not to answer questions about Gears of War 2 and his new role as the game 's general manager .
He said he felt fortunate to be working at Microsoft Game Studio and in particular to be working with Cliff Bleszinski and the folks at Epic Games .
MTV's Stephen Totilo and I tried to pin Tsunoda down on how the game would fit into the Gears universe .
Was it , Totilo asked , part of a trilogy .
We have n't decided yet , Tsunoda responded and then tried to change the topic , saying that the game has plenty of things to do in the way of improving on the original title .

Multiplayer , for instance , has a lot of potential , though he can't talk about it quite yet .
Cover will be destructible this time around , he added .
And by cover he does n't just mean the rock walls and building remnants , he 's also talking about grabbing bad guys and hiding behind them , something Tsunoda referred to as " meat shields " .
And yes , it seems that these meat shields will be " destructible " too .
What are they doing for the ladies this time around , Totilo wanted to know .
Are they going to make it more accessible or interesting to women somehow .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Tsunoda sort of ducked the answer , but when I asked him if they were considering perhaps adding a romantic interest to the plot , he said yes , there would be a love interest this time around .
Given the tone of the dinner , it was hard to tell if he was serious or joking , but either way it raises an interesting point :
Should the Gears of War sequel have more interpersonal relationships , should there be a love interest in the game ?

I think that one of the things that hurt the original title was its story , in particular its ending , so building in a relationship , one that could be used to make the game more emotion certainly could n't hurt .
At least that 's my take .
What 's yours ?
Check out Totilo 's take on the dinner as well .

I met Peddanna in his village in Andhra Pradesh , near the main highway linking two of India ’s most prominent ‘ hi - tech ’ cities , Hyderabad and Bangalore .
His pre-defined role in life is to scoop up human faeces from a dry latrine and carry them in a basket to a dumping ground .
When some faeces fell onto his head recently , he complained about his working conditions to an official at the local municipality which employs him .
The official seemed surprised , and said , “ You are a dirty man doing a dirty job ; why are you worried about this ? ”
Peddanna belongs to the Thoti sub - caste among India ’s Dalits , the lowest rung of the ancient caste system which continues to shape Indian society .
The occupation into which these Thotis are born is ‘ manual scavenging ’ , or the cleaning of human shit with their hands , as the human rights activists more vividly describe it .
Euphemisms do not hide the realities of this occupation for long .
Every morning , Peddanna and his five colleagues carry their baskets through the village to the dry latrine .
It is a walk of shame , which forces them to parade their baskets as symbols of their outcast status .
Once they arrive at the dry latrine , an area of dust and grass surrounded by a low wall , they scoop the faeces into baskets and carry them away , leaving the ‘ higher ’ castes in the village with a clean toilet .
They use flimsy makeshift scoops , and have no gloves , masks or protective equipment to wear .
For others , the job can be worse : many dry latrines have cement floors , from which the faeces must be scraped meticulously , using whatever is to hand .
Peddanna said : “ If it is raining , when we put the basket on our heads , the shit covers our bodies . "
Like many manual scavengers , he complains of regular stomach problems and an inability to eat because of the persistent smell which lingers with him .
Instead , he turns to country liquor to mitigate his sense of shame about this work .
Manual scavenging is banned by law in India .
But as is so often the case , legislation passed in Delhi has little impact in rural areas , home to the vast majority of the population .
The problem is that prosecutions under this law must be sanctioned by the district authorities and they are often guilty of perpetuating or , at least , turning a blind eye to this practice .
Manual scavengers sometimes point out a communal dry latrine exists in the Nizamabad district court in Andhra Pradesh state .
Proof if nothing else that local authorities are not remotely serious about tackling this issue .
Many manual scavengers are officially employed by municipal authorities as ‘ sweepers ’ , another job traditionally associated with Dalits .
In Peddanna ’s village , he and five other men clean the dry latrines in the morning and sweep the streets in the afternoon .
The village head ( sarpanch ) has threatened to punish them by holding back their wages if they tell the municipal authorities or anyone else about this .
The manual scavengers and their families are avoided by other villages , and treated as unclean .
They cannot enter restaurants or other public places anywhere they will be recognised .
Even other Dalits treat them with disdain .
Every society needs its sanitation workers , and no doubt those in any context may face some stigma .
However , the deeper reality in India is that this job is reserved for Dalits , the ‘ untouchables ’ of old , and it is their job for life .
As members of the Thoti sub - caste , Peddanna and his colleagues were destined for this work by their birth , with no right of appeal .
Members of equivalent sub-castes endure similar work across numerous districts of India : perhaps as many as 1.3 million of them .
The nature of the caste system is that it generates a powerful combination of social and psychological pressures , constraints and expectations , which means that they cannot simply walk out of this work into another job of their choice .
Because the scavengers do this work , there is little incentive to bring about change by introducing proper toilet facilities into the areas they work .
Yet as long as the scavengers do it , they will be treated as untouchables .
Theirs is a story of institutional dehumanisation and the flagrant abuse of their human rights .
Humiliating descent - based occupations , of which manual scavenging is one of the worst , continue to blight the lives of India ’s Dalits , who number 167 million according to the latest census data .
The 84 million tribals often suffer similar exploitation .
India ’s population of Dalits and tribals is roughly equivalent to the combined populations of the UK , Germany , France and Spain , and they are the worst victims of labour exploitation and human rights abuses in India .
The UN has affirmed that discrimination on the basis of caste is covered by the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination .
Having ‘ noted with concern that very large numbers of Dalits are forced to work as manual scavengers ’ , the UN called on the Indian government to properly implement the law banning this practice .
Frustrated with government inaction , the NGO Safai Karmachari Andolan ( SKA ) has taken matters into its own hands .
Describing manual scavenging as a ‘ national shame ’ , the SKA leads a movement ambitiously campaigning to eradicate the practice by the time the Commonwealth Games come to Delhi in October 2010 , and has engaged in several drives to demolish dry latrines in Andhra Pradesh .
It has been immune from an official backlash by the fact that the government has claimed there are no dry latrines operational in the state .
Away from the first - world facilities in parts of Hyderabad and Bangalore , there is no question that India ’s infrastructure remains very poor , especially in the rural areas .
However , the continuance of this practice is not simply a question of infrastructure development , but instead rooted in the social hierarchy of caste .
Infrastructural development needs to go hand - in - hand with a resolve to do away with the communal dry latrines and the dehumanisation which they perpetuate .
Just occasionally , an irony shows manual scavenging for the absurdity it is .
At a dry latrine in another village I visited in Andhra Pradesh state , a crowd gathered around , watching the manual scavenger perform her work , and taking the opportunity to complain about the appalling toilet facilities which they had to endure .
The manual scavenger at work , named Uma , had served us with tea in her house before beginning her day ’s work .
As we had left to follow her to the dry latrine , I could not help noticing that her own house had a clean , flushable toilet .

Experts in the area of computers and internet .
Has been creating websites for more than 8 years and wishes to share knowledge with other computer and internet users .
The sun has been lying low for the past couple of years , producing no sunspots and giving a break to satellites .
That 's good news for people who scramble when space weather interferes with their technology , but it became a point of discussion for the scientists who attended an international solar conference at Montana State University .
Approximately 100 scientists from Europe , Asia , Latin America , Africa and North America gathered June 1 - 6 to talk about " Solar Variability , Earth 's Climate and the Space Environment . "
The scientists said periods of inactivity are normal for the sun , but this period has gone on longer than usual .
" It continues to be dead , " said Saku Tsuneta with the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan , program manager for the Hinode solar mission .
" That 's a small concern , a very small concern . "
The Hinode satellite is a Japanese mission with the United States and United Kingdom as partners .
The satellite carries three telescopes that together show how changes on the sun 's surface spread through the solar atmosphere .
MSU researchers are among those operating the X - ray telescope .
The satellite orbits 431 miles above ground , crossing both poles and making one lap every 95 minutes , giving Hinode an uninterrupted view of the sun for several months out of the year .
Dana Longcope , a solar physicist at MSU , said the sun usually operates on an 11 - year cycle with maximum activity occurring in the middle of the cycle .
Minimum activity generally occurs as the cycles change .
Solar activity refers to phenomena like sunspots , solar flares and solar eruptions .
Together , they create the weather than can disrupt satellites in space and technology on earth .

The last cycle reached its peak in 2001 and is believed to be just ending now , Longcope said .
The next cycle is just beginning and is expected to reach its peak sometime around 2012 .
Today 's sun , however , is as inactive as it was two years ago , and scientists are n't sure why .
" It 's a dead face , " Tsuneta said of the sun 's appearance .
Tsuneta said solar physicists are n't like weather forecasters ;
They can't predict the future .
They do have the ability to observe , however , and they have observed a longer - than - normal period of solar inactivity .
In the past , they observed that the sun once went 50 years without producing sunspots .
That period , from approximately 1650 to 1700 , occurred during the middle of a little ice age on Earth that lasted from as early as the mid-15th century to as late as the mid-19th century .
Tsuneta said he does n't know how long the sun will continue to be inactive , but scientists associated with the Hinode mission are ready for it to resume maximum activity .
They have added extra ground stations to pick up signals from Hinode in case solar activity interferes with instruments at other stations around the world .
The new stations , ready to start operating this summer , are located in India , Norway , Alaska and the South Pole .
Establishing those stations , as well as the Hinode mission , required international cooperation , Tsuneta said .
No one country had the resources to carry out those projects by itself .
Four countries , three space agencies and 11 organizations worked together on Hinode which was launched in September 2006 , Tsuneta said .
Among the collaborators was Loren Acton , a research professor of physics at MSU .
Tsuneta and Acton worked together closely from 1986 - 2002 and were reunited at the MSU conference .
" His leadership was immense , superb , " Tsuneta said about Acton .
Acton , 72 , said he is still enthused by solar physics and the new questions being raised .
In fact , he wished he could knock 22 years off his age and extend his career even longer .
" It 's too much fun , " he said .
" There 's so much exciting stuff come up , I would like to be part of it . "
Bullet train makes trial run on Beijing - Tianjin railway ( CRI )

Google Started Blurring Street View Faces
Google updated the panorama photo imagery of Manhattan as part of Google Maps , and for this update also blurred the faces of persons shown in the pictures .
Google at their maps - related blog writes , “ This effort has been a year in the making – working at Street View - scale is a tough challenge that required us to advance state - of - the - art automatic face detection , and we continue working hard to improve it as we roll it out for our existing and future imagery . ”
( Google already uses face recognition technology in Google images , by the way – just tick “ faces ” in the advanced options . )
Blurring faces to protect people ’s privacy seems to make sense .
Just last year , Google defended showing these pictures , but they might have changed their mind based , perhaps based on feedback .
Google may also have further analyzed the legal situation around the world in preparation for rolling out Street View in more countries – their camera - equipped cars have been spotted in Italy and France , for instance .
And who knows , perhaps Google will be able to expand this obfuscation to car license plates in the future .
While blurring takes away some fun ( “ hey , it ’s my neighbor in a funny pose posted all over the web ! ” ) it also takes away many potential problems ( “ hey , it ’s me in a funny pose posted all over the web ! ! ” ) .

Dick Cheney has his go - to guy in Tim Russert ; George Bush has Wolf Blitzer .
Despite the fact that the president 's petulant hysteria that refusing to include retroactive immunity will endanger Americans , a lie that even his own people can't support , has been thoroughly debunked , that 's not going to stop Wolf Blitzer from serving up a hot , steaming pile of propaganda direct from the bowels of the White House to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Silvestre Reyes this morning on Late Edition .
Unfortunately , whatever blinders that Blitzer has on that does not allow him to get facts about this FISA propaganda is also apparently affecting the House intelligence committee as well , as Reyes tells Blitzer that they are negotiating a compromise that could include telecom immunity .
" We are talking to the representatives from the communications companies because if we 're going to give them blanket immunity , we want to know and we want to understand what it is that we 're giving immunity for , " he said .

WASHINGTON - President Bush yesterday stood beside John McCain in the White House Rose Garden and offered an effusive endorsement of his onetime rival 's candidacy to succeed him , declaring that the Arizona senator " will bring determination to defeat an enemy and a heart big enough to love those who hurt . "
In a jocular reference to his own low standing in the polls , Bush pledged to do whatever he could to help McCain win the election - be it campaigning alongside McCain or instead saying " I 'm against him . "
But McCain - who clinched the Republican nomination for president on Tuesday with wins in Texas , Ohio , Vermont , and Rhode Island - dismissed any notion that he would seek to distance himself from Bush .
McCain said he had " great admiration , respect , and affection " for Bush and welcomed the president 's help both in fund - raising and on the campaign trail .
McCain said he wanted to have as many campaign events together with Bush as " the president 's heavy schedule " allowed .
" And I look forward to that opportunity , " he added .
" I look forward to the chance to bring our message to America . "
Indeed , while Bush and McCain famously clashed during the 2000 Republican primary and since then on such issues as campaign finance reform , harsh interrogation techniques , and tax cuts , the two Republican leaders yesterday underscored an issue in which their policy message is identical :
The US military should not withdraw from Iraq or shrink from fighting terrorism .
" The good news about our candidate is he 'll be a new president , a man of character and courage , but he 's not going to change when it comes to taking on the enemy , " Bush said .
" He understands this is a dangerous world .
And I understand we 'd better have steadfast leadership , [ someone ] who 's got the courage and determination to pursue this enemy , so as to protect America . "
Stephen Hess , a political analyst at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution , said that Bush 's effusive endorsement of McCain was in part a recognition by the president that his party had nominated the Republican candidate who may represent the best chance that Bush 's policy in Iraq will continue past 2009 .
McCain " supports the Iraq policy to the fullest and has the most authority in doing it , so strangely - given their history - [ Tuesday ] night symbolically was very good news for George W. Bush , " Hess said .
" Bush is getting the very best GOP candidate he had any right to expect .
. . .
He can thank his lucky stars he 's got McCain around , and that is what today represented . "
And while McCain has been critical of Bush 's approach to the interrogation of suspected terrorists , Bush made clear that he sees McCain 's election as the best chance of continuing his broader approach to the war on terrorism .

GENEVA ( Reuters ) - A special U.N. human rights investigator will visit the United States this month to probe racism , an issue that has forced its way into the race to secure the Democratic Party ’s presidential nomination .

The United Nations said Doudou Diene would meet federal and local officials , as well as lawmakers and judicial authorities during the May 19 - June 6 visit .
“ The special rapporteur will ... gather first - hand information on issues related to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , ” a U.N. statement said on Friday .
His three - week visit , at U.S. government invitation , will cover eight cities -- Washington D.C. , New York , Chicago , Omaha , Los Angeles , New Orleans , Miami and San Juan , Puerto Rico .
Race has become a central issue in the U.S. election cycle because Sen.
Barack Obama , the frontrunner in the battle for the Democratic nomination battle , stands to become the country ’s first African American president .
His campaign has increased turnout among black voters but has also turned off some white voters in a country with a history of slavery and racial segregation .
Diene , a Senegalese lawyer who has served in the independent post since 2002 , will report his findings to the U.N. Human Rights Council next year .
However , the United Nations has almost no clout when it comes to U.S. domestic affairs and is widely perceived by many as interfering .
The United States is not among the 47 member states of the Geneva - based forum , but has observer status .
In a report last year he said Islamophobia had grown worldwide since the September 11 2001 attacks on the United States , carried out by al - Qaeda militants .
DEATH PENALTY
A U.N. panel which examined the U.S. record on racial discrimination last March urged the United States to halt racial profiling of Americans of Arab , Muslim and South Asian descent and to ensure immigrants and non-nationals are not mistreated .
It also said America should impose a moratorium on the death penalty and stop sentencing young offenders to life in prison until it can root out racial bias from its justice system .
Racial minorities were more likely than whites to be sentenced to death or to life without parole as juveniles , according to the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination .
It monitors compliance with an international treaty which Washington ratified in 1994 .
U.S. officials told the body , made up of 18 independent experts , that they were combating hate crimes such as displays of hangman ’s nooses and police brutality against minorities .
Some 800 racially motivated incidents against people perceived to be Arab , Muslim , Sikh or South Asian had been investigated since the September 11 attacks , they said at the time .
Substantial progress had been made over the years in addressing disparities in housing , education , employment and health care , according to a U.S. report submitted to the talks .
Nearly 120 years after the last massacre of Native Americans by the United States cavalry at Wounded Knee , some of the lands confiscated from their descendants are to be returned to the Oglala Sioux .
Badlands National Park in South Dakota , which encompasses Wounded Knee , is one of the poorest parts of the US .
It has few paved roads .
Unemployment is shockingly high among the Sioux .
Alcoholism is rampant and there are high rates of suicide and imprisonment of American Indians .
After decades of protests , the park service is now planning to return the southern part of the park to Indian control .
It will take an act of Congress to approve , but is expected to occur next year .
Though broadly welcomed by the Sioux residents , there are those who say the land should be returned to the original owners for private use rather than to the tribal council as a park .

The shadow of Wounded Knee hangs over much of the discussion .
The Sioux were among the last to fight against American expansion into the West .
In the dying days of 1890 , their leader , Sitting Bull , was assassinated .
About 120 of his followers along with 230 women and children took refuge at Pine Ridge , South Dakota , where they were surrounded by the US cavalry .
About 300 men , women and children were killed , along with 25 soldiers , mostly by their own shrapnel or bullets .
In the 1970s , the militant American Indian Movement reoccupied the site , leading to still more bloodshed , this time at the hands of the FBI and the Bureau of Indian Affairs .
But what rankles for Anita Ecoffey , an elder of the Oglala Sioux , who lives in Wounded Knee , was her family 's eviction from ancestral lands in the 1940s by the military .
Ms Ecoffey , 65 , recalled her grandmother describing the flight , taking only what they could carry , and leaving the land where their ancestors were buried .
Some 800 members of the tribe were given a week to leave by the military , which wanted the land for a firing range .
" To me this is as bad as what happened at Wounded Knee , " she said .
" When my grandmother was evicted they took only what they could carry .
A lot of them had no place to go , which is why I say they died of a broken heart . "
Ms Ecoffey described how much of the reservation is still littered with unexploded shells the military never cleaned up .
Poachers have also ravaged the stark landscape , with its spires of rock and tallgrass plains .
Over decades , they have illegally removed thousands of fossils from the poorly policed national park .
Under the new plan , the northern half of Badlands , which is paved and has a visitor centre , will remain under the control of the park service .
The Sioux hope to restore the ecologically fragile southern portion , starting by removing the unexploded shells .
Most of the national parks – Grand Canyon , Yellowstone , Yosemite and Glacier – were created when the Roosevelt administration forced tribes from the land in the 1930s .
Karl Jacoby , a professor of history at Brown University , said : " There were n't empty wilderness areas in the United States .
They had to be created by the removal of Indians . "
But there is dissent about what should happen .
One of the Sioux activists who occupied Pine Ridge in 2000 says the land should be returned to its original Indians rather than remain a park .
" That 's not respecting the rights of the people who have nothing , " said Keith Janis .
" The whole national park system is environmental racism against the Indian people of this country . "
Ms Ecoffey , however , hopes that Barack Obama will be elected president and fulfil the promises he made while campaigning in South Dakota last week to lift Native Americans out of their poverty .
So I realized today I ’ve been posting quite a bit about GNU / Linux and mathematics , but I have n’t really done much with physics .
So here ’s my first physics post !
This problem is actually one assigned in the undergraduate general relativity course I took in the spring 2008 .
It ’s from James B. Hartle ’s book Gravity : An Introduction to Einstein ’s General Relativity , chapter 6 , problem 9 .
A GPS satellite emits signals at a constant rate as measured by an onboard clock .
Calculate the fractional difference in the rate at which these are received by an identical clock on the surface of Earth .
Take both the effects of special relativity and gravitation into account to leading order in .
For simplicity , assume the satellite is in a circular equatorial orbit , the ground - based clock is on the equator , and that the angle between the propagation of the signal and the velocity of the satellite is 90° in the instantaneous rest frame of the receiver .
The problem is very simplified as to make the calculations doable at the undergraduate level .
Thus it is using the simplified Geometric Newtonian gravity , that is , the line element given by
One could , of course , use Schwarzchild coordinates ( and this is , in effect , what I did for the general relativistic part ) .
The solution is broken into three parts : orbital information , the special relativistic effects , and the general relativistic effects .
Orbital Information
The key here ( that ’s not given in the problem ) is that the time that it takes satellites to orbit Earth is 12 hours .
Recalling that the speed of an orbit in Newtonian gravity is , where is the radius of the orbit and is the mass of the object being orbited , we get that
Plugging in the appropriate values gives =26,605 km and =3871.0 m/s .
Special Relativistic Effects
Let denote the ground observer and denote the satellite .
Then we can use time dilation to get that
General Relativistic Effects
For general relativistic effects , note that the frequencies are related by
The derivation of this formula is beyond the scope of chapter 6 and uses Killing Vectors and photon geodesics introduced in a later chapter .
However , an approximation to this result is given in equation 6.12 of Hartle .
Plugging in the appropriate results gives the ratio to be 1+5.2873 x 10 - 10 , very nearly 1 .
Putting things together , the whole shift is
As a check , suppose that a day passes on Earth ( in other words , = 24 hours = 86,400 s ) .
Then for the satellite , ( 86,400 s ) ( 4.4573 x 10 -10 ) = 38.511 μs more have passed every day .
According to Wikipedia , this number is 38 μs .
Also according to Wikipedia , the desired frequency on Earth is = 10.23 MHz .
This leaves to be 0.0045598
Hz less ( compare this to Wikipedia ’s claim of 0.0045700 Hz less ) .
The problem of course is not as simple as it was made to be .
Difficulties arise when one takes into account that Earth is rotating ( so the metric is more complicated ) , that the observer is not necessarily orbiting in the same plane as the satellite , and the orbit is not perfectly circular .
However , these corrections are minute and do n’t affect the problem very much .
Hope this was an interesting read !
The Man
On Feb. 1st , I met Ron Paul at the Denver rally .
HE SIGNED MY BUSINESS CARD , SHOOK MY HAND , GAVE ME A MAN - HUG AND SAID , “ TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE THIS NATION GREAT ! ” GO RON PAUL !!!
The Mission
So the mission was clear , I must join the Republican party , become a state delegate , and even try to become a national delegate !
From what I could tell , Ron Paul ’s message inspired around 500 twenty - somethings to get involved with the Colorado GOP and give the system a try .
The Meeting
So a few months later , off I headed to the Colorado GOP convention !
It was held in the Broomfield Event Center .
Somewhere around 4000 people were present .
It was very exciting !
By being at the convention I was representing around 1000 Pueblo county Republicans !
The Malignment
Unfortunately not everyone wanted “ us ” there !
This rather exciting note was placed on every seat at the district convention .
I made the blacklist !!
Although overall the Colorado GOP tried to ignore the fresh blood brought in by Ron Paul , several people told me they were really glad to see some new faces at the convention and encouraged me : “ Do n’t give up !
We need some life in this party ! ”
The Message
At the state convention , I gave my glorious 15 second nomination speech , greeted with thunderous applause !
“ My name is Phil Hassey .
We need to send a message to the national convention and McCain that we want them to get back to their conservative roots !
Vote the Ron Paul slate !
Yeah ! ”
The Moral
I learned quite a bit about the Republican party through this experience .
I ’ve got a lot to think about !
Although ( as far as I know ) the CO Ron Paul supporters did not manage to get any of the seats in the national convention , I think Ron Paul ’s mission in Denver was a success .
He motivated a disillusioned generation to get involved in the party and learn how it works .
If the CO GOP has a future , it ’s going to be because Dr. Paul planted the seed .
Today on " Race to the White House " Rachel Maddow and Joe Scarborough got into a little argument after Rachel called him out for being rude and interrupting her when she criticized John McCain .
At the end of the show , when guests are supposed to make a final prediction about the presidential race , Scarborough instead opted to take a shot at Rachel .
After Rachel gives her response , Scarborough is nowhere to be found .

Scarborough : I think I may blow all my time to respond to Rachel .
I do n't get engage in " Crossfire " - type debates . [...]
Again , I do n't do Crossfire , so if we want to yell back and forth , then Rachel will have to find somebody else to do that .
Rachel : Joe , I was n't trying to yell back and forth with you .
I was starting to make my point and you cut me off before I started my first sentence .
( a few moments later , sans Scarborough )
Rachel : Me and Joe are gonna get a beer and hash this all out .
UPDATE : Jeremy Gaines tells the Huffington Post :
" Joe did n't walk off .
He chose not to participate in the final couple of minutes of the discussion because he felt the conversation did n't fit his role as a political analyst . "
What a weak excuse .
Joe 's job as a " political analyst " is to analyze the political race .
That 's what the entire show is about .
Rachel got under his skin , plain and simple .
It was probably when she made that face after he said he did n't want to be condescending , which he was clearly being .
June 24 , 2008  -- Barack Obama says his Christian faith will help him reach white evangelicals who traditionally vote Republican , but some religious leaders are resisting the call .
" I think he 's deliberately distorting the traditional understanding of the Bible to fit his own world view , his own confused ideology , " James Dobson , leader of the Christian group Focus on the Family , said Tuesday in his daily radio show .
Dobson spent much of his show picking apart a 2006 speech from Obama , D - Ill. , on why liberals and conservatives need to be more tolerant about faith .
" I can't simply point to the teachings of my church , or evoke God 's will .
I have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths , including those with no faith at all , " Obama said in that speech .
Dobson called that a " fruitcake interpretation of the Constitution , " but Obama , in exclusive comments to ABC News on Tuesday , insisted Dobson is misrepresenting his words .
" I have no idea what he 's referring to .
Anybody who 's read that speech will tell you that I extol the need for people with religious faith to express their views in the public square , and I do n't interpret the Bible in the ways he 's referring to , " Obama said .
" Either he did n't read the speech or he 's just trying to score political points , and either way , I do n't think it 's a particularly useful way to talk about these issues , " Obama told ABC News .
Reaching Out , Drawing Fire
Obama is not polling any better with white evangelical Protestants now than Sen. John Kerry , D - Mass . , did in 2004 .
In a recent ABC News / Washington Post poll , Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz . , led in the group 68 - 22 percent ; in 2004 election exit polls , President George W. Bush won that group 78 - 21 over Kerry .
Despite those numbers , Obama has said he is trying to reach out .
" Even if they may not end up supporting my candidacy , I want to make sure people know I 'm listening to them and I 'm a person of faith , " Obama said in an interview .
The Obama camp , from the beginning of his campaign , has reached out to people of faith , with an emphasis on younger evangelicals , holding hundreds of town hall meetings and house parties , and having Obama often talk about his faith on the stump .
It is , the Obama camp insists , the most outreach to the white evangelical community that a presumptive Democratic nominee has engaged in since then - Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter in 1976 .
" Obama is making a very concerted effort to try and win over evangelicals that Democrats have n't ( won ) in a long time , " said Stephen Waldman of Beliefnet.com .
And McCain has always had an uneasy relationship with evangelical leaders .
Stephen Mansfield , the evangelical author of the 2004 bestseller " The Faith of George W. Bush " -- who is now writing " The Faith of Barack Obama " -- says this Democrat has an opening .
" He 's savvy with the evangelicals , he understands the language , " Mansfield said .
And liberal Christian leaders , such as Jim Wallis , insist the movement itself is changing .
" Poverty is now on the agenda for evangelicals -- the environment , climate change is on the agenda , " Wallis said .
One other blessing from this outreach -- it allows Obama to combat rumors by openly proclaiming his Christian faith -- a persistent problem in the campaign .
A Question of Faith
Obama 's dust - up with Dobson is not the first time Obama has been embroiled in a faith - related controversy .
The Rev. Jeremiah Wright , Obama 's pastor for the last 20 years at the Trinity United Church of Christ on Chicago 's South Side , roiled critics -- and the Obama camp -- when he publicly defended his sermons about 9/11 , and the origin of the AIDS epidemic , among other controversial statements .
" You can not do terrorism on other people and not expect it to come back on you , " Wright said on Monday .
" Those are Biblical principles , not Jeremiah Wright ' bombastic ' principles . "
Obama came out forcefully , insisting he was " disappointed " by Wright , and rejecting his one - time pastor 's assertion that the controversy was an attack on the black church .
" The person I saw yesterday was not the person I met 20 years ago , " Obama said .
In late May , Obama resigned from Trinity United , explaining in a press conference , " When I go to church , it 's not for spectacle , it 's to pray and to find a stronger sense of faith ; it 's not to posture politically , it 's not to , you know , it 's not to hear things that violate my core beliefs . "
Muslim Outreach
Obama also faces a delicate balance in reaching out to Muslim voters .
" The community feels betrayed , " Safiya Ghori , the government relations director in the Washington office of the Muslim Public Affairs Council , told the New York Times Thursday .
The Obama campaign is clearly sensitive to the false rumor that he 's a Muslim , but its sensitivity could turn into insensitivity .
Obama has yet to visit a mosque , and last week , he apologized to two Muslim women wearing hijabs , who were asked not to appear in the background behind Obama at a Michigan rally .
" I 'm not sure a lot of Muslim voters are upset , " Obama told ABC News when asked if he plans to visit a mosque .
" I think we have done more outreach in the Muslim communities , as well as the Jewish communities , as well as the Christian communities , as many other campaigns have done , and we 're going to continue to do so . "
ABC News ' Peyton Craighill , Natalie Gewargis , Gary Langer , Avery Miller , and Ed O'Keefe contributed to this report .
As expected , the Canadian DMCA is big , complicated , and a close model of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( Industry Canada provides a large number of fact sheets here ) .
I 'll have much more to say once I 've had a careful read , but these are my five key points to take away :
1 . As expected , Prentice has provided a series of attention - grabbing provisions to consumers including time shifting , private copying of music ( transferring a song to your iPod ) , and format shifting ( changing format from analog to digital ) .
These are good provisions that did not exist in the delayed December bill .
However , check the fine print since the rules are subject to a host of strict limitations and , more importantly , undermined by the digital lock provisions .
The effect of the digital lock provisions is to render these rights virtually meaningless in the digital environment because anything that is locked down ( ie. copy - controlled CD , no - copy mandate on a digital television broadcast ) cannot be copied .
As for every day activities like transferring a DVD to your iPod – those are infringing too .
Indeed , the law makes it an infringement to circumvent the locks for these purposes .
2 . The digital lock provisions are worse than the DMCA .
Yes – worse .
The law creates a blanket prohibition on circumvention with very limited exceptions and creates a ban against distributing the tools that can be used to circumvent .
While Prentice could have adopted a more balanced approach ( as New Zealand and Canada 's Bill C - 60 did ) , the effect of these provisions will be to make Canadians infringers for a host of activities that are common today including watching out - of - region - coded DVDs , copying and pasting materials from a DRM'd book , or even unlocking a cellphone .
While that is the similar to the U.S. law , the exceptions are worse .
The Canadian law includes a few limited exceptions for privacy , encryption research , interoperable computer programs , people with sight disabilities , and security , yet Canadians can't actually use these exceptions since the tools needed to pick the digital lock in order to protect their privacy are banned .
In other words , check the fine print again – you can protect your privacy but the tools to do so are now illegal .
Dig deeper and it gets worse .
Under the U.S. law , there is mandatory review process every three years to identify new exceptions .
Under the Canadian law , its up to the government to introduce new exceptions if it thinks it is needed .
Overall , these anti-circumvention provisions go far beyond what is needed to comply with the WIPO Internet treaties and represents an astonishing abdication of the principles of copyright balance that have guided Canadian policy for many years .
3 . The other headline grabber is the $ 500 fine for private use infringement .
This will be heralded as a reasonable compromise , but check the fine print .
Canadian law already allows a court to order damages below $ 500 per infringement , so the change may not be as dramatic as expected ( though $ 500 in damages is the maximum for private use infringement ) .
Moreover , it is already arguably legal to download sound recordings in Canada .
Under the proposal , there are exceptions for uploading or posting music online ( ie. making available ) and even the suggestion that posting a copyright - protected work to YouTube could result in the larger $ 20,000 per infringement damage award .
4 . The ISP provisions are precisely as expected with a statutory notice - and - notice system .
However , check the fine print .
The role of the ISP may be undermined by the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement , which the government trumpets in its press release .
5 . The education community received several provisions that are largely gutted by the fine print .
For example , library materials can be distributed in electronic form , but must not extend beyond five days .
In other words , it turns librarians into locksmiths .
Moreover , there is an Internet exception that educators wanted but it does not apply for any works that are either password protected or include a notification that they can not be used .
In other words , online materials that are available under a Creative Commons license are fair game ( as they are already ) , but most everything else is still potentially subject to a restriction .
This was precisely what many feared – rather than pursuing the far superior expansion of fair dealing , the education community got a provision that does little to enhance classroom learning .
I 'll have more to say soon , but the takeaway is that the DMCA provisions are worse than the U.S. and the consumer exceptions riddled with limitations as the government promotes a strategy of locking down content and launching lawsuits against Internet users .
Evolution is a beautiful theory .
It explains everything from why some birds lose the ability to fly , to the bizarre meandering path of the vagus nerve in our bodies .
There is no question that evolution makes sense of the extraordinary diversity of life on Earth , but can it actually be put to practical use ?
The answer is : it can and it should .
The rise of antibiotic - resistant superbugs – estimated to kill 19,000 people a year in the US alone , and cost the country $ 80 billion annually – is an example of what happens when we do n’t apply evolutionary theory .
So why is so little attention paid to understanding the evolutionary consequences of our actions ?
Advertisement
Part of the problem is that only in the past couple of decades has it become clear just how fast evolution can produce change .
Another reason is that there is no such discipline as “ applied evolution ” .
Because it straddles such a broad range of fields , from cancer to conservation , researchers who are “ applying evolution ” have a hard time finding out what their colleagues are up to .
That , however , is about to change .
A new journal called Evolutionary Applications has just been launched .
The first issue is dedicated to making the point that applying evolution is crucial – and it makes a convincing case .
Tilted balance
Take HIV .
Could the virus evolve to spread via insects such as ticks or mosquitoes , as well as by sexual contact ?
The virus has been shown to survive for more than 10 days in one African tick , so this horrifying prospect is certainly plausible .
At first the answer appears reassuring .
At present , HIV is not spread via insects because levels of the virus are too low in the blood of infected people .
Transmission via insects could occur if virus levels were much higher , but people with such high virus levels would succumb to AIDS far more quickly , reducing the opportunity for transmission compared with existing strains that spread sexually .
Insect transmission is therefore unlikely to evolve , conclude Troy Day and colleagues at Queen ’s University in Ontario , Canada .
But there is a catch , the team points out .
Strategies intended to prevent the sexual spread of HIV , such as condom use , could alter the relative benefits for the virus of sexual versus insect transmission .
It is possible that the more successful we are at blocking the sexual spread of HIV , the more likely it is that a form of HIV capable of spreading via insects will evolve .
Changing behaviour
Or take at the biggest alteration we are making to the planet : increasing carbon dioxide levels faster than has ever happened naturally .
One important question is how higher carbon dioxide will change the productivity of phytoplankton in the oceans , which will partly determine how much CO 2 the oceans will soak up .
Studies in which existing phytoplankton are exposed to higher CO 2 suggest their productivity will increase .
But a paper in the new journal suggests that this kind of experiment could be misleading .
Phytoplankton that have evolved in a high CO 2 environment could behave quite differently to those exposed to it for the first time , point out Graham Bell of McGill University in Montreal , Canada , and Sinead Collins of the University of Edinburgh , UK .
For instance , most types of phytoplankton have mechanisms for concentrating CO 2 in their cells .
But Collins and Bell have found that these mechanisms degenerate in marine algae kept in high CO 2 conditions for 1000 generations .
While they stress that more research is needed , their surprising conclusion is that evolution in a high CO 2 world could result in populations of phytoplankton that are less productive than existing ones .
And that means we might not be able to rely on them to soak up ever more carbon for us in the future .
Flu future
Another article looks at how the severity of the disease caused by a pathogen or parasite changes as it invades a new population .
For instance , H5N1 bird flu currently kills about half the people it infects .
It is widely assumed that if the virus does start spreading among humans it will become far less dangerous .
However , the models created by James Bull of the University of Texas , Austin , and Dieter Ebert of the University of Basel , Switzerland , add to the evidence that such assumptions are flawed .
Viruses such as H5N1 could have devastating effects before they evolve to become less virulent , they conclude .
Power of knowledge
Evolutionary Applications contains many more examples of the importance of applied evolution ( content is free during 2008 ) .
All doctors , for instance , should read the summary of why understanding and applying evolution matters in medicine , written by Randolph Nesse at the University of Michigan .
Nesse says that progress is being hampered by the fact that many medics still think of the body as a machine designed by an engineer , when in fact it is a “ bundle of compromises … designed to maximise reproduction , not health ” .
There is no question about the importance of applied evolution .
The trouble is , if biologists themselves are only just waking up to how relevant and crucial evolution can be , what hope is there of educating the leaders and policy makers who need to understand and act upon this research ?
Not much , I fear .

The equatorial plains of Mars ' Meridiani Planum are the stopping — or rolling , as it were — grounds for NASA 's Opportunity rover .
Now into its fifth year exploring the planet , Opportunity has found firm evidence that liquid water once soaked the plains rocks in the distant past .
Its robotic twin Spirit is also hard at work in Gusev Crater on the other side of Mars .
In 2004 , NASA ?s
Opportunity rover found evidence in Martian soils that water had onceflowed across the surface there , buoying hopes that the red planet may oncehave supported primitive life .
But a newstudy throws some cold water , and a big pinch of salt , on those hopes .
" Liquidwater is required by all species on Earth and we 've assumed that water is the veryleast that would be necessary for life on Mars , " said study team member Nicholas J. Tosca , a Harvard University postdoctoralresearcher .
" However , to really assess Mars ' habitability we need toconsider the properties of its water .
Not all of Earth 's waters are able tosupport life , and the limits of terrestrial life are sharply defined by water ' stemperature , acidity and salinity . "
Tosca andhis team analyzed salt deposits in the 4 - billion - year - old Martian rockinvestigated by Opportunity ( and by spacecraft orbiting the planet ) .
The newanalysis shows that the water that would have flowed across these ancientMartian rocks may have been exceedinglybriny .
" Oursense has been that while Mars is a lousy environment for supporting lifetoday , long ago it might have more closely resembled Earth , " said AndrewH .
Knoll , also of Harvard and on the study team .
" But this result suggestsquite strongly that even as long as four billion years ago , the surface of Marswould have been challenging for life .
No matter how far back we peer into Mars 'history , we may never see a point at which the planet really looked likeEarth . "
Theresearch was presentedin February at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston .
Halophiles , or organisms that can tolerate high - salinity waters , are known to exist inplaces on Earth , but they likely evolved from organisms that lived in purerwaters , scientists think , making it unlikely that life would actually ariseinitially in extremely briny waters .
The highsalinity , however , " does n't rule out life forms of a type we 've neverencountered , " Knoll added , " but life that could originate and persistin such a salty setting would require biochemistry distinct from any knownamong even the most robust halophiles on Earth . "
Knoll and Tosca also say the finding doesn?t rule out the possibility that less saltywaters once flowed on the planet , though Meridiani Planum , where the Opportunityrocks were found , is believed to have been one of the wetter , more hospitableplaces on the planet .
Travelling Light
Is the airship a viable alternative to jet travel ?
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 6th May 2008
Of all the charges levelled against environmentalists , perhaps the most unfair is the accusation that we are opposed to technological change .
Most of the greens I know are fascinated by gadgets ( sometimes to the exclusion of better solutions ) , while some of the people we confront seem terrified by new technologies , and react to them – witness the campaigns against windfarms – with irrational hostility .
But because environmentalists tend to have a feeling for material constraints , we recognise that solutions cannot be conjured out of thin air .
In some cases they just do n’t appear to exist .
There are two reasons why we make such a fuss about flying .
The first is that , even as governments promise to cut emissions , everywhere airports are expanding .
In the UK , the government expects the number of airline passengers to rise from 228 million in 2005 to 480 million in 2030 ( 1 ) .
Before long , there will scarcely be a patch of sky without a jet in it .
The other is that there are no alternative means of propelling people through the air which are not more destructive than burning ordinary aviation fuel .
Or so we think .
The airline companies prescribe two cures that are even worse than the disease .
Even before they are deployed commercially in jets , biofuels are spreading hunger and deforestation .
At first sight , hydrogen seems more promising .
If it is produced by electrolysis using renewable electricity , it ’s almost carbon - free .
The prohibitive issue is storage .
Hydrogen contains just a quarter of the energy as the same volume of jet fuel ( kerosene ) , which means that planes could fly long distances only if they were filled with gas rather than passengers or cargo .
This means that if hydrogen planes are to fly commercially , they need much wider bodies than ordinary jetliners .
According to the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution “ the combination of larger drag and lower weight would require flight at higher altitudes ” than planes fuelled by kerosene ( 2 ) .
A technology that is green at ground level becomes an environmental disaster in the stratosphere .
Hydrogen ’s great advantage – that it produces only water when it burns – turns into a major liability : in the stratosphere , water vapour is a powerful greenhouse gas .
The royal commission estimates that hydrogen planes would exert a climate changing effect “ some 13 times larger than for a standard kerosene fuelled subsonic aircraft . ” ( 3 )
But there is another use for this gas , though I am aware that it will go down like a lead balloon with most of my readers .
The word airship elicits a fixed reaction in almost everyone who hears it : “ what about the Hindenburg ? ” .
It ’s as if , every time someone proposed travelling on a cruise ship , you were to ask , “ but what about the Titanic ? ” .
Yes , there was a spectacular disaster – 71 years ago .
It has lodged in our minds because , like the Titanic , the Hindenburg was bigger and plusher than any craft built before it , and it was carrying rich and prominent people .
The conflagration was witnessed by journalists and broadcast all over the world .
It also become the technology ’s funeral pyre : the Hindenburg was doomed long before it burnt , as airships were already being displaced by aeroplanes .
Though the designs have changed , their disadvantages have not disappeared .
While a large commercial airliner cruises at about 900 kilometres per hour , the maximum speed of an airship is roughly 150 k ph .
At an average speed of 130 kph , the journey from London to New York would take 43 hours .
Airships are more sensitive to wind than aeroplanes , which means that flights are more likely to be delayed .
But they have one major advantage : the environmental cost could be reduced almost to zero .
Even when burning fossil fuels , the total climate - changing impact of an airship , according to researchers at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research , is 80 - 90 % smaller than that of ordinary aircraft ( 4 ) .
But the airship is also the only form of transport which can easily store hydrogen : you could inflate a hydrogen bladder inside the helium balloon .
There might be a neat synergy here : one of the problems with airships is that they become lighter – and therefore harder to control – as the fuel is consumed .
In this case they become heavier .
Michael Stewart of the company World SkyCat suggests burning both gaseous and liquid hydrogen to keep the weight of the craft constant ( 5 ) .
Airships fly much lower than planes – typically at about 4000 feet – which means that their emissions of water vapour have very little effect on temperature .
If they were powered by hydrogen fuel cells , they would be almost silent , greatly reducing the effects for people on the ground .
Though they are slower than jets , the cabin can be built much wider , which means that travelling by airship would be rather like travelling by cruise ship , but at twice the speed and using a fraction of the fuel .
There are four small companies trying to get airships off the ground ( 6 ) .
Most of the new designs make use of aerodynamic lift as well as buoyancy ( they are shaped like fat planes with stubby wings or tails ) which means that they are heavier and more stable than the old dirigibles , and can land without help on the ground .
They can alight on and take off from almost any flattish surface , including water .
But all of them have a problem with flotation : of the financial rather than the physical kind .
While the price of carbon stays low , companies have no financial incentive to switch to a different form of transport .
The only help governments are prepared to provide is some development funds for military applications ( raising money for killing people is always easier than raising money to save them ) .
For a few years the Pentagon took an interest in craft which could land anywhere and carry several hundred tonnes of equipment ( 7 ) .
Otherwise , like so many other promising green technologies , this proposal is losing height in a hostile market .
All the companies promoting large commercial airships are concentrating on freight , especially in places which are poorly served by roads .
The danger here is that , if they take off , they could displace not jet transport but freight shipping , in which case , if they burn diesel , they are likely to cause a net increase in carbon pollution .
Paradoxically , the other major constraint could be an environmental one .
Airships are one of several green technologies which might be killed by a shortage of materials .
A new generation of solar panels relies on gallium and indium , whose global supplies appear close to exhaustion ( 8 ) .
The price of platinum , which is used in catalytic converters , has tripled over the past five years ( 9 ) .
Beyond a few natural gas fields in Texas , economically viable supplies of helium are rare ; even there they might be exhausted in 50 years at current rates of use , or much faster if airships take off ( 10,11 ) .
If there is a God , he is n’t green .
Is this proposal just a flight of fancy ?
Because airships feature in no official document , because they have not been considered by either government or major industry , I have no way of knowing .
But like most greens I ’m prepared to try almost anything , as long as it works .
Can the same be said of our opponents ?

Supporters of Sen. Barack Obama , Democrats , Independents and supportive Republicans : NOW is the time to fight .
Now is the time to dig in our heels and demand our country be greater than it ’s one fickle dimension–put - on or put - off .
Let us realize a greater politics that can only serve to strengthen our nation , our economy , our standing in the world .
Our lives right now .
Be proud of yourself and your country by standing up on shaky ground ; by beating back the criticisms of hypocrites and box blathering fools .
Now is the time to fight .
We have one chance , right now , to prove to ourselves and to the world , that we can recognize quality when we see it .
Not the static quality of “ America is Great . ”
For today , in this changing world , that is not enough .
Instead , let us embrace a dynamic quality , an energy constantly moving forward , that challenges us to greatness beyond what our past has afforded thus far .
It is this “ dynamic quality ” that Sen. Obama embodies .
And that guarantees the change we demand .
Now is the time to fight .
Last Thursday the largest newspaper in my congressional district - the South Florida Sun-Sentinel - published an editorial lambasting my enthusiastic support for immediately holding impeachment hearings for President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Numerous letters to the editor have also criticized my support for this movement .
Below , you 'll find the original Sun-Sentinel editorial , followed by my response , which was printed yesterday .
I assure you that I will not back down from this fight ­ no matter the consequences or political cost .
The only thing that maters is that we deliver accountability for the Bush Cheney Administration and defend our government and our constitution .
If you would like to write a letter to the Sun Sentinel , you can email letters@sun-sentinel.com .
Thank you for your continued support .
Robert Wexler Sun-Sentinel Editorial Impeachment not worth another minute of anybody 's time South Florida Sun-Sentinel Editorial Board June 12 , 2008 ISSUE : Some in Congress want an impeachment .
The nation does have a few pressing issues pending that could use some attention from our federal lawmakers .
Let 's see .
There are a couple of wars going on , unemployment is on the rise as the value of a house continues to fall , millions of Americans have no health insurance , and did we mention that gas prices are expected to hit $ 5 a gallon ?
You get the idea .
And still , some in Congress feel the nation is just itching for another presidential impeachment .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio , who has made a career out of eye - rolling issues like these , said this week he wants the House to consider a resolution to impeach President Bush .
Rep. Robert Wexler , D - Delray Beach , who is smarter than this , supported the Articles of Impeachment , which wo n't go anywhere and thankfully have been buried in a committee not likely to hold hearings before Bush leaves office .
Last year , Kucinich led the misguided charge to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney , and Wexler supported that .
In the case of Bush , Wexler called it a " sworn duty " of Congress to act .
Actually , it 's nobody 's sworn duty to take up any time to go after a badly battered president with only a few months left in office .
This is a president so unpopular , presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain wo n't make many public appearances with him .
This is a president who is such a non-entity , peace activists did n't even bother to protest his appearance in Berlin this week .
Nor should Congress bother with the ridiculous idea of impeachment , which Kucinich contends is warranted because Bush deceived the nation into war .
There 's plenty of evidence to fuel Kucinich 's ire , but not his choice of remedy .
If Congress needs more things than impeachment to keep lawmakers busy , it has myriad options .
BOTTOM LINE : Get on with REAL issues .
Copyright ( c ) 2008 , South Florida Sun-Sentinel
The Wexler Response : The Sun-Sentinel recently ran an editorial criticizing my support for the articles of impeachment against President Bush opining that Congress should instead " get on with REAL issues " such as the Iraq war .
In fact , it is this very war -- entered into following an unprecedented campaign of lies and manipulated intelligence by the Bush Administration -- that necessitates impeachment hearings .
This war has cost us the lives of 4,090 US soldiers , injuries to over 30,000 , and more than a trillion taxpayer dollars when it is all said and done .
It is a dark day when the Sun-Sentinel has the gall to tell the parents of the soldiers who have died in Iraq that pursuing consequences for those that prosecuted this war of choice based on outright deception is not a " REAL " issue that Congress should address .
Sadly , the war is only the beginning .
We now know that this Administration illegally ordered the torture of prisoners , obstructed justice by lying about the outing of a covert CIA agent and authorizing warrantless spying on American citizens .
No one can deny that if proven these allegations amount to High Crimes .
Our failure to act sets an awful precedent and enables future Presidents to break the law and violate our Constitution without sanctions from Congress .
The Sentinel says impeachment is the wrong " remedy " for this litany of crimes .
What then is the proper remedy ?
A harsh lecture ?
A strongly worded editorial ?
Or how about doing absolutely nothing in the face of these outrageous abuses of power ?
Impeachment hearings need not distract us from other important priorities such as the economy , gas prices and bringing the troops home from Iraq .
Congress can and should address all important issues - including safeguarding our constitutional rights and obligations .

A Chinese dissident who founded one of the country 's pioneering human rights websites has been arrested for possessing state secrets .
Huang Qi , who set up 64 Tianwang – the numbers refer to the date of the Tiananmen Square massacre , on June 4 1989 – was detained in the south - western city of Chengdu , capital of Sichuan province , his mother said .
" They did n't say when he would be freed - first they have to do an investigation , " Pu Wenqing , 74 , said .
Pu said she was informed by the police of the arrest yesterday and had been unable to speak to her son since then .
The reason for Huang 's arrest , possession of state secrets , is an ill - defined offence often used to clamp down on dissent .
Officials in Chengdu declined to comment on his arrest .
Huang 's website , founded a decade ago , allowed people , for a fee , to post information about missing friends and family members .
The watchdog Human Rights in China said Huang had been detained on June 10 after visiting areas affected by the earthquake in May , centred in Sichuan province .
The group said Huang 's purpose there had been to write about parents whose children had died or were missing in the quake .
" This is another illustration of how a person who is only trying to help might find himself snared by China 's state secrets laws , " the watchdog 's executive director , Sharon Hom , said .
" This use of the law as a sword hanging over rights activists , such as Huang Qi , contradicts the reported ' new media openness ' in China following the Sichuan earthquake . "
The Paris - based rights monitoring group Reporters Without Borders said last week that three men , likely agents from China 's ministry of state security , had forced Huang into a car .
It said his arrest might be linked to articles he had posted criticising the government 's response to the magnitude - 7.9 quake that killed almost 70,000 people in Sichuan .
China 's security forces have begun to clamp down on dissent after initially tolerating independent reporting on the quake and allowing public complaints by parents who blame corruption and shoddy construction for school collapses that killed their children .
Huang has long been one of China 's most outspoken activists .
Earlier this decade , he served a five - year prison sentence on subversion charges linked to politically sensitive articles posted on his website .
Since his release , in 2005 , Huang , who is in his mid-40s , has supported causes ranging from aiding families of people killed in the 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing to publicising the complaints of farmers involved in land disputes with authorities .

McFly have had seven UK number one singles since 2004 Pop band McFly are to give away their new album Radio : ACTIVE with the Mail on Sunday newspaper on 20 July .
Singer Tom Fletcher told the BBC it was a good way of expanding their fanbase and reaching new audiences .
He said : " We get to put it into almost three million homes , which is an incredible opportunity for us .
" Hopefully the three million people will all enjoy the music and they 'll decide to see us when we go on tour . "
Last year , Prince did a similar thing .
He offered his latest album with the same newspaper to promote a series of concerts in the UK .
It was seen as a successful strategy with the live events all selling out .
McFly 's decision is seen as an equally shrewd business move , in an industry where many bands tend to make most of their money from live performances and merchandising .

Album sales , meanwhile , have been dropping in recent years .
McFly are one of the most successful British bands around with seven UK number one singles since 2004 .
They have recently set up their own record label Super Records , which will give the new album a conventional CD release in September .
But some industry analysts have warned that a trend of artists releasing music for free could end up starving record companies of money they use to develop new talent .
Music consultant and former Sony executive Neil Cartwright said : " The record industry invests in new artists , and if that money disappears you 're going to find it a lot more difficult if you 're a young band to find support .
" That really is the danger the industry faces . "

In a previous tutorial we learned how to set up a simple Django project on the Google App Engine .
We also saw how to use the App Engine datastore in place of the Django model API .
Now , let ’s have a look at how to integrate Django templates .
I will also show you how to serve static files .
Important : Remember to upgrade to the latest version of the App Engine SDK ( version 1.0.1 at the time of writing ) .
Otherwise , this tutorial will not work for you if you are developing on Windows .
Step 1 : Set up an App Engine project — I am calling mine djangostatic .
Follow steps 1 through 7 from the previous tutorial , remembering to substitute the project directory path and project name in main .py and app.yaml , and you will be all set .
Step 2 : We will create a simple view that makes use of a template .
First , let us define the template .
Create a directory where you can store templates :
tmp/djangostatic$ cd djangostatic / main tmp/djangostatic/djangostatic/main$ mkdir - p templates / main
Then , add the file main .
html to your new template directory :
# djangostatic/djangostatic/main/templates/main/main.html < html > < head > < link href= " /css/main.css " type =" text / css " rel= " stylesheet " ></ link > </head > < body > < p >
Hello world !
</ p> </body > </html >
Note that the template refers to a style sheet file , main.css , which we will create later on .
Step 3 : Django needs to be told where to search for template files : this is done in the settings .py file .
The settings file is mostly pre-configured ; we just have to modify the part that sets the TEMPLATE_DIRS variable :
# djangostatic/djangostatic/settings.py import os ROOT_PATH = os.path.dirname(__file__ )
TEMPLATE_DIRS = ( ROOT_PATH + " / main/templates " , )
Step 4 : After creating the template and telling Django where to find it , we have to write a view that does the actual rendering :
# djangostatic/djangostatic/main/views.py from django.shortcuts import render_to_response def main ( request ) : return render_to_response ( " main/main.html " )
This tells Django to use the template main / main . html when rendering the response .
The render_to_response method is a convenient shortcut for rendering a template and returning a response in one step .
Step 5 : Finally , we need to map a URL to our view — this is done in urls.py :
# djangostatic/djangostatic/urls.py from django.conf.urls .defaults import * urlpatterns = patterns ( " " , ( r " ^$ " , " djangostatic.main.views.main " ) , )
Start your development server ( dev_appserver.py djangostatic ) , fire up your browser , and open the page at http://127.0.0.1:8080/.
If you have done everything right so far , you should get the “ hello world ” message from the template .
Step 6 : So what about the style sheet file , main.css ?
A style sheet file is a typical example of a static file .
We use Django for rendering dynamic pages , so requests for static files should not be handled by the Django engine .
In a regular Django application , we usually configure the web server to route such requests to a specific directory .
On the App Engine , we achieve the same effect by adding a static handler to app.yaml :
# djangostatic / app.yaml application : djangostatic version : 1 runtime : python api_version : 1 handlers : - url : /css static_dir : media/css - url : /.* script : main.py
Here , we have added an entry that routes all requests beginning with /css to the directory media / css .
Let us create this directory :
tmp/djangostatic$ mkdir -p media/css
Step 7 : The link in our template specified / css / main.css as the full URL , so we have to add the main.css file to our new directory :
# djangostatic/ media/css/main.css p { font - size : 48 px ; }
Reload the application page ; the browser should now be able to make use of the style sheet so that the message is displayed in a larger font .
You can view the final results here .
Final notes :
To learn more about how to serve static files on App Engine , have a look at the official documentation on how to configure an app .
Django templates are very powerful — this tutorial has only shown you the absolute basics .

When I read yesterday that the United States Supreme Court has decided to reopen an old Novell vs. Microsoft case dating back to 2004 , I could n’t help but think back to what has happened between the two companies in the 20 last years .
If you were n’t following the news back then , here ’s what went down :
Four years ago , after a long fight in court regarding Microsoft ’s unfair marketing practices toward some of Novell ’s more - popular products , namely Netware , Quattro Pro and WordPerfect , the 2 parties acknowledged an out - of - court settlement of $ 536 Million concerning Netware .
Unable to reach an agreement on the remaining products , the case was put aside by the authorities and was quickly forgotten by most people .
When I started using computer in the 1980s , THE de - facto standard when it came to word processors was named Word Perfect .
Not only was Word Perfect multi-platform ( Dos , UNIX , Apple - DOS ) , it was also the most easy - to - use word processor on the market .
Those of you who remember WordStar will understand what I mean .
Do n’t get me wrong , when I say “ most easy - to - use on the market ” , that does n’t necessarily mean that it was like today ’s WYSIWYG software ; you had to know your shortcuts , and writing a well - structured document was similar to writing an html page in notepad .
Fortunately , WP was supported by an excellent , multi-lingual tech support service from our Mormon friends in Utah .
But then , when Apple came up with a graphical user interface ( GUI ) for their systems , a company called Microsoft ( ever heard of them ? ) decided to apply the same concept to all their products .
Thus , Windows and WinWord were born .
A few months later , WPCorp understood that GUIs were there to stay and made the same move , elaborating a new graphical version of WP for Windows , Mac , OS / 2 and DOS .
Unfortunately , when the time came to install WordPerfect on Windows , things were n’t simple .
Microsoft , dreaming of market dominance even then , had apparently hidden some crucial implementation details from the WPCorp developers , making the installation of WP a real pain in the behind for everyone involved .
Bill Gates was immediately accused of disloyal practices , and of favoring his own office suite , which led to the consequential detriment of his competition .
Even his prices were lower .
Surprising , is n’t it ?
Try to find an office suite that is more expensive then MS Office today …
I ’m sure you ’ll have trouble finding one .
As time passed , WPCorp eventually closed their doors and was immediately purchased by Utah - based Novell for more than $ 1 billion .
That was in 1994 .
At the same time , the new owner of WP decided to purchase other products that would fit well together in a new productivity suite : Borland Quattro Pro , a spreadsheets application , and Paradox , a database system .
The result of the acquisition ?
A total failure .
After trying to sell their new product to consumers for two years , the creators of Netware decided to sell their productivity suite to Canadian based company , Corel , for the amount of $ 170 million .
An approximate loss of $ 900 million for Novell .
Since then , nothing much has really changed .
Corel still owns the product , which has been re-branded as the WordPerfect Office Suite , an excellent and cheaper alternative to MS Office .
But when it comes to being cheap , nothing beats Open Office though !
In fall 2004 , eight years after the disastrous acquisition , Novell took Microsoft to court , accusing them of disloyal practices leading to the Word Perfect Suite ’s ultimate failure .
According to Novell , Microsoft had hidden important details about their OS interoperability with applications , and also took action to dissuade certain PC manufacturers from including the WordPerfect suite inside their product offering .
Concurrently , Novell was accusing Microsoft of other tactics encouraging people to abandon the Netware Server OS , making its integration with Windows clients a real nightmare .
I ’m sure those of you who were working in IT back then remember a campaign where Microsoft was encouraging people who were running Netware to migrate to Windows 2003 by offering them $ 600 .
As I said previously , Microsoft admitted their fault for this and paid $ 536 million to Novell , but the Word Perfect case had not been settled .
This is where the story is right now : Novell says they ’ve been the victim of unfair business practices ; Microsoft replies that the issue was caused by bad business decisions .
Who is right , and who is wrong ?
What is YOUR opinion ?
Let us know in the comments section .
Lastly , I ’d like to thank Nelson over at Technaute , whose french article was mostly used to write this one .
Thanks Nelson !

As you surely know , people think about lawyers only when there ’s a divorce that ’s going to happen or when there ’s a crime involved .
However , these are not the only situations when one needs legal assistance , so you ’d better realize that there are some things that could be solved only with the help of a lawyer .
As this is the case , you might want to know when you need to look for legal help and what could be those situations that require this kind of assistance .
Let ’s take them one at a time , without forming a list that is exhaustive .
When Starting a Business
First of all , let ’s say why this requires the presence of a lawyer .
There are business lawyers who are specialized in dealing in the economical environment , and starting a business is a part of their activity .
It ’s about creating the business plan and making sure that the contracts that you sign are perfectly done and in the limits of the laws ; it ’s also about making sure that you do n’t do a bad deal for your business , as some bad contracts could make you lose money instead of earning them .
When Getting Married
In this situation , you will need a lawyer if you want to sign a prenuptial contract .
It does n’t matter if you are a woman or a man , either persons will receive the same amount of diligence , as it ’s actually about their rights .
This is usually needed when one of the partners is extremely rich and is looking for different ways of securing the assets that they have – money or physical possessions .
When Getting Divorced
It ’s true that marriage and divorce are part of the family law both of them , but each of them is a different process .
While the first one is looking to reunite two persons , the second one is about separating them .
The divorce lawyers act in the best interest of their clients , making sure that they are leaving with more than enough after divorce .
When Adopting a Child
This is another situation from the family law , but it ’s actually a little bit different .
Adopting a child is a delicate process , and there are plenty of papers to be filled .
The procedure for this takes a very long time and everything needs to be done right for the child that enters in his or her future family .
As there should be no mistakes and because it ’s a hard process , there are specialized lawyers in dealing with this type of cases .
When Buying / Selling a Property
In this situation , you need to know that the real estate law is wide and complicated , and each type of property can have its own characteristics .
Of course , there are specialized lawyers who will take care of all the papers for you to make sure that you are getting exactly what you are paying for .
The check - out of the contract is very essential , as that will give you the right to own or sell the property , so this needs to be done perfectly .
When Facing a Charge
It ’s not just about a criminal charge , but you could be facing also other types of charges .
For example , if you have a traffic ticket that you have n’t paid in time , you could be called for paying it in the most legal way – by having a lawsuit down your way .
When this is happening , you need to have a lawyer at your side .
When Dealing With Finances
There is also the financial lawyer who can help you out when you ’re dealing with the IRS , for instance , or when you have a certain income and you need to have your finances dealt with in a professional way .
This type of lawyer will take care of every aspect of your wealth , managing your finances and every other important thing related to it .

Thanks to Maurizio Moretto for the translation .
Thanks are also due to Jean Laherrere of ASPO France for providing his interpretations of Russian and North African gas supplies .
This is the talk I was honored to deliver to ASPO Italy on 3rd May 2008 at their annual conference in Turin. 24 slides below the fold plus narrative of what I said on the day .
The narrative boxes are below the slides .
Posted by Euan Mearns on May 13 , 2008 - 10:00 am in The Oil Drum : Europe
Natural gas provides 29 % of OECD Europe ’s primary fossil fuel energy .
It is used for : Home heating Heat and power for industry and commerce Electrical power generation Feedstock for chemicals and fertilizer
For the last 25 years fossil fuel consumption has been more or less flat in Europe .
But as the use of coal has declined , the use of natural gas has increased .
In the last 40 years , Europe ’s consumption of natural gas has increased 19 fold .
I think this is really quite an astonishing chart showing how our use of and reliance upon natural gas for fuel has grown .
As we shall see later , this was made possible by rapid growth of natural gas production in the North Sea .
This bounty whilst not yet exhausted is getting tired and is about to go into decline causing major problems for European gas and energy security .
Since we are in Italy , it is worth spending a moment looking at Italy ’s reliance on natural gas .
Italy does produce some gas - 11 bcm in 2006 and falling .
This is compared with consumption of 77 bcm .
So Italy like all other OECD European states , apart from Norway and The Netherlands is dependent upon imported gas .
Natural gas makes up 38 % of Italy ’s primary energy consumption and 48 % of electricity generation .
Italy is more reliant on imported natural gas than most other European states – which is perhaps the reason Ugo asked me to give this talk ☺
Historically , gas markets have been regional with points of consumption close to supply linked mainly by pipelines – N America , Europe and Russia .
The main exception has been Japan / S Korea that has a long established LNG supply train .
This and the following slide are borrowed from this presentation by BG Group ( large pdf ) .
This picture is in the process of changing .
Emergence of new markets for natural gas made possible by growth in LNG .
S America , India , China and the Middle East – not shown on this map .
LNG provides much greater interconnectivity of markets , greater competition and is rapidly leading to harmonisation of prices .
Not shown on this map is the declining production in traditional sources of supply in N America and Europe .
This simplified map shows the principal supplies to Europe .
These correlate with security of supply and understanding of that security .
Indigenous supplies are most secure and we know most about them
Adjacent supplies are less secure and are less well understood
LNG supplies are fairly well understood – but we do n’t know how the market will allocate supply to Europe and those supplies transported by ship are least secure .
The main features :
Three important countries :
The UK , The Netherlands and Norway The UK gas production peaked in 2001 and is declining at 8.5 % per annum – there is little disagreement on this point – the UK BERR ( government ) agrees with this scenario .
This is one of Europe ’s biggest gas supply problems since the UK used to export a little gas and is now looking to import increasing amounts of gas every year .
This is placing considerable strain on the whole European gas market .
The Netherlands have had a carefully regulated gas industry with production in Gronigen pegged by law .
This has resulted in a very broad production plateau – a very sensible strategy .
The offshore Holland gas production is now in decline ( like the UK ) and this will lead to slowly falling Dutch gas production .
Norway is at a crossroads .
The production gas export system has recently been expanded to 120 BCM per annum with the addition of the Langeled pipeline linking the Ormen Lange Field to England ( and to continental Europe ) .
The two giant gas fields , Ormen Lange and Troll and can go on producing at a suppressed plateau for many decades .
But many of the other North Sea gas fields are in decline .
Especially the oil associated gas and the combined prognosis is that Norwegian gas production may peak next year – a forecast provided by Rune Likvern – an informal contributor to The Oil Drum .
This has been confirmed by informal releases from the Norwegian Government and the peaking of Norwegian gas will have profound effect upon European gas security .
In summary , the prognosis for indigenous European gas production is quite bleak .
Peak was probably in 2004 and in future we can look forward to relentless declines .
If we combine this European production forecast with a consumption and import model projecting historic growth in demand into the future we get a picture of rapidly expanding gas imports .
In 2006 we imported 197 BCM natural gas and this model scenario projects that growing to 492 BCM by 2020 – that ’s only 12 years away .
Where will all that new supply come from ?
We are already seeing signs of high price rationing demand and I do n’t believe this scenario can or will unfold .
When I made this chart I sketched in this line indicating demand curtailment – and I will try to quantifying this at a later stage .
As this map shows Russia has many gas fields in West Siberia and the Yamal peninsula indicated here in red .
Historic production was dominated by 3 supergiants – Yamburg , Urengoy and Medvezhye .
Since 1970 , these three fields provided the bulk of Russian gas production – powering the Soviet Union and Western Europe .
These three supergiants are now in decline – this is no secret – the data has been published .
In 2006 Russia exported 115 billion cubic meters gas to Europe .
The three most important importing countries are Germany , Italy and Turkey .
New pipelines planned will provide 88 BCM new import infrastructure .
But will this bring new gas , or old gas via a new route ?
This is one of the most important questions to answer .
These two charts show two very different pictures of Russian gas production forecasts .
The upper chart is based on existing and new pipelines from a forecast commissioned by the UK government .
This shows export capacity doubling from 120 to 300 bcm per annum by 2030 .
This is what the UK government wants to believe will happen ?
The lower chart is compiled by Jean Laherrere and is based on decline modelling of existing fields with new field developments stacked upon the heritage assests of Yamburg Urengoy and Medvezhy .
This shows fairly flat Russian gas production forward to 2020 – this has a more realistic feel .
Much hope has been placed in new pipelines being built from Russia .
Nord - stream will produce gas from fields identified by Laherrere that will merely compensate for the decline from existing fields .
If this is correct then it will not bring “ new gas ” to Europe but will merely maintain existing production levels .
This is a very important slide .
It shows that Russia consumes two thirds of its own gas production .
It also shows that other countries import gas from Russia – notably Ukraine and Turkey .
Exports are very sensitive to any downturn in production or upturn in domestic consumption .
With the data we have it is near impossible to model these variables .
With flat production and a continued rise in Russian gas consumption , exports could fall dramatically between now and 2020 .
How would these reduced exports be allocated .
I ’d guess to the richest countries who can pay the highest price – perhaps via the new pipelines .
North Africa is already linked to Europe by pipelines , and production and exports from Libya and Egypt are expanding .
Most of N African gas production comes to Europe and this source of supply should continue to grow until about 2016 .
But note that Egypt is forecast to consume more and more of its own gas production that will lead to a peak and then decline in exports .
We now move on to look at how the LNG market might evolve .
The market is currently dominated by Japan and S Korea .
Total production in 2006 was 211 BCM and Europe had 25 % share of that market .
How will future LNG supplies be allocated ?
That ’s a difficult question to answer .
This is a forecast of how LNG supply is forecast to grow , prepared on behalf of the UK government .
It should grow from 211 BCM in 2006 to 600 BCM in 2020 .
The LNG supply chain is long and complex .
Note that we must contemplate storing LNG during summer by re-injecting into depleted gas reservoirs .
LNG tankers are also vulnerable in three notorious tanker bottlenecks in Hormuz , Suez and Malacca .
The malicious actions of a very few individuals there could seriously disrupt gas supplies to Europe – disrupting industry , commerce and electrical power generation .
So how does all this information and speculation add up ?
By making the assumptions indicated , a supply shortfall is indicated by 2013 .
If this were to happen , then Europe would have to learn to live with less .
This is subject to many uncertainties that could work either way – the shortfall could occur sooner or later .
The main uncertainties are : Norwegian gas production Russian gas production and export forecasts .
The share OECD Europe gets of these exports .
The allocation of LNG exports .
In developing gas supply scenarios it is also very important to be aware of the cyclic seasonal nature of gas demand .
The fact that most demand is centred on the N Hemisphere creates an annual global demand spike
There is a need for increased gas storage throughout Europe in order to smooth out that seasonality .
This may also smooth out seasonal pricing with consequences for the gas storage industries .

Daddy , will the lights be on at Christmas ? by Euan Mearns .
The ASPO - Italy conference in Torino by Ugo Bardi .
Mitt Romney said in his first interview since departing the GOP race that he would accept the number two position on the ticket and that there is no lingering bitterness between him and John McCain .
“ I think any Republican leader in this country would be honored to be asked to serve as the vice presidential nominee , myself included , " Romney told FOX's Sean Hannity in a broadcast set to air tonight .
" Of course this is a nation which needs strong leadership .
And if the nominee of our party asked you to serve with him , anybody would be honored to receive that call … and to accept it , of course . ”
According to two separate reports , Romney is being talked up as a running mate by members of the Bush inner circle .
But McCain and his closest advisers have little regard for their former rival thanks to the bitter , year - long race waged between the two Republicans .
Romney says , however , that he thinks the wounds have healed .
“ There are really no hard feelings , I do n't think , on either side of this , " he said in the interview .
" There were no pacts and so forth that make people feel like that we will never come together .
Instead these campaigns are all coming together .
We are supporting our nominee enthusiastically , aggressively . "
Romney said his top fundraisers have already met with McCain 's campaign .
" We are laying out ways we can support his campaign . ”
Romney also belittled the Democrats , saying that he thought Barack Obama would eventually emerge as their nominee and that such an outcome would play to the GOP 's favor .
" I think he is the better match - up for Senator McCain because the public recognizes just how inexperienced he is , " Romney said .
" With Senator Clinton there is some confusion in perception that somehow being there while her husband was president made her a foreign policy - national security experienced person .
She is not .
She does n't have any more experience , really , of a significant nature than Barack Obama does .
But in Barack Obama 's case , people recognize this guy was a state senator and before that he was a community activist .
He has been a United States senator for a short , short period of time .
He is in no significant way qualified to lead the country at a time of war , to lead the country out of an economic challenge .
This is not a person who can stand up to Senator McCain . ”
To make his case , Romney employed a canine metaphor .
Listening to Obama and Clinton discuss their national security credentials , Romney said , is akin to " listening to two chihuahuas argue about which is the biggest dog . "
" When it comes to national security , John McCain is the big dog , and they are the chihuahuas , " he said .
McCain will be on Romney 's turf tomorrow night for a fundraiser in Boston , but aides to the Arizonan 's campaign were uncertain if their former rival would be in attendance .
The two last appeared together when Romney endorsed McCain last month in the former governor 's Hub headquarters .

“ One of Bush ’s liabilities coming in was that he was seen as a silver spooner who had lived a charmed political life , ” said Dan Bartlett , a top aide to Mr. Bush in Texas and in the White House .
Overcoming Mr. McCain , Mr. Bartlett said , was a show of toughness .
“ He took a punch and got up off the mat , ” Mr. Bartlett said of Mr. Bush .
“ You could argue the same about Obama now . ”
3. SHE LED HIM TO THE WORKING CLASS
If Mr. Obama goes on to win the nomination , one of the signature challenges of his general election campaign will be his ability to win over the traditional Democratic blue - collar voters that have flocked to Mrs. Clinton in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania .
In a sense , Mrs. Clinton ’s success with this constituency exposed his vulnerability with it — a vulnerability he might not have known existed to such an extent had Mrs. Clinton dropped out early and Mr. Obama breezed to the nomination .
Image WORTHY RIVAL Hillary Rodham Clinton has tested , and maybe toughened , her opponent .
Credit ... Damon Winter / The New York Times
In recent weeks , Mr. Obama started doing more retail events , talked more about his family ’s economic challenges growing up ( to address a creeping rap of elitism , however ill - fitting that label is ) .
He saw what played well ( a tough - love opposition to the gas tax holiday ) and what needed work ( his bowling ) .
He worked to escape the pigeonhole that he was a big arena rock star .
He has recently done fewer big rallies and more one - of - you performances ( pick - up hoops games in Indiana ) .
He seemed to heed Mrs. Clinton ’s recurring criticism that Mr. Obama was all about “ creating an atmosphere ” and “ giving great speeches . ”
There have been fewer shots of a larger - than - life Mr. Obama at a podium , more of him face - to - face with workers ( or waffles ) .
More listening photo ops , in other words , and fewer talking ones .
4. THE WRIGHT FIGHT
While this does n’t involve Mrs. Clinton directly , the long primary battle allowed the emergence , and re-emergence , of Mr. Obama ’s former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. , to take place now , rather than later .
It ’s generally assumed that Mr. Wright would have been an issue at some point , so better for Mr. Obama now than October .
“ It ’s entirely likely that we ’ll hear from Reverend Wright again , ” said Dan Payne , a Democratic media consultant .
“ But from now on , the Obama people will be able to play it as old news . ”
As a corollary to the “ made him angry ” benefit , Mr. Obama ’s handling of the Wright controversy signaled an evolution that could serve him well .
“ The Reverend Wright thing struck me as Barack learning to be president , ” said Richard Ben Cramer , author of “ What It Takes , ” the exhaustive examination of six candidates for president in 1988 .
“ When your friend causes you trouble , a president gets rid of those friends .
It may come to pass that they become friends again .
But for the time being , this is more important . ”
Melbourne has not only overtaken Sydney on the list of the world 's top 20 most liveable cities , but leap - frogged Paris into the top 10 in the quality - of - life stakes .
Compiled by the uber chic design and lifestyle magazine , Monocle , the rankings will be published on June 19 , crowning Copenhagen as the world 's number one city .
Munich , the winner last year , dropped down to number two while London - financial and cultural behemoth of Europe , did not even squeak it into the best 20 list .
The list defines Tokyo as the third best city in the world with the Nordic capitals of Stockholm and Helsinki joining the top ten .
Berlin took out the cultural capital prize while Paris 's pioneering Mayor , Bertrand Delanoe - and new innovations like the bike hire scheme and the ' Nuits Blanches ' when museums stay open all night - have reinvigorated the city to win the Best Global city .
For Sydney , disappoinment : the Emerald City dropped from number 7 on the list to number 11 while Melbourne 's rankings climbed from number 11 to number 9 .
Melbourne , says the magazine , is vibrant , art loving , booming - and sprawling : " Melbourne 's economy is humming , its arts scene is thriving , and more than 1000 new people a week are calling the city home . "

Recently I was invited to provide testimony before the Chicago City Council on a proposed resolution to oppose any US military action against Iran .
I salute the City Council for having the courage and sense of civic responsibility to consider a resolution which would pressure the Congressional delegation of the State of Illinois to heed the will of the citizens of Chicago .
The resolution , as written at the time of the hearing , was a strong indictment of the current policies of the Bush administration in Iran as well as Iraq , and underscored the insufficiency of just cause for any military action against Iran .
The resolution pushed for a diplomatic solution to all problems that might exist between Iran and the United States , noting that a failure to pursue diplomacy with Iraq has resulted in a war which not only has killed thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis , but cost each ward in the City of Chicago some 104 million dollars which would otherwise have been used to benefit its citizens .
Not all in attendance were in support of this resolution .
Alderman James A. Balcer , of Chicago ’s 11th Ward , offered a strongly - felt counter argument , noting that if Iran was providing sanctuary for forces that are responsible for the deaths of American service members in Iraq , then the only viable course of action available to the United States would be an American military strike to take out such sanctuaries .
On the surface , this is a powerful and compelling argument , and one that Alderman Balcer is well positioned to make .
As a Marine infantryman who served in Vietnam , Alderman Balcer was a participant in Operation Dewey Canyon , a bold assault by the 9th Marine Regiment through the A Shau Valley and into Laos , the purpose of which was to destroy military material that was being stored in , and transported through , sanctuaries in Laos by the North Vietnamese in support of their operations in South Vietnam .
In short , Balcer and his fellow Marines were dispatched to take out ’ a sanctuary that was responsible for facilitating the deaths of Americans in South Vietnam .
The resultant Operation Dewey Canyon is the stuff of Marine Corps legend , an epic battle that left over 1,600 North Vietnamese dead , and huge amounts of combat material and weapons destroyed .
The cost for the Marines was not insignificant , with 130 Marines killed and 932 wounded .
Complementary combat missions into Laos by US Army Special Operations Forces , known as Operation Prairie Fire , likewise targeted North Vietnamese " sanctuaries " .
Dozens more Americans were killed and wounded in this fighting .
Alderman Balcer is rightly proud of his service to the Marines and our nation , and as he points out , Operation Dewey Canyon contributed to an overall degradation of enemy combat capability in South Vietnam so that a repeat of the 1968 Tet Offensive could not occur .
This may be true , to a degree .
However , Operation Dewey Canyon did not stop the Vietnam War .
On February 23 , 1969 , the Viet Cong launched 110 attacks through South Vietnam , including targets in Saigon .
On February 25 , 1969 , the North Vietnamese launched an assault on Marines stationed along the DMZ , killing 32 Marines .
This prompted a Marine offensive into the DMZ on March 15 , 1969 .
On March 17 Richard Nixon , recently sworn in as President , and promising to seek peace with honor in Vietnam , authorized the secret bombing of Cambodia , the purpose of which was to destroy North Vietnamese sanctuaries located there .
By April 1969 , American force levels in Vietnam reached 543,000 , the largest concentration in the history of that conflict .
In mid-May 1969 US Army forces battled in the A Shau valley , scene of Operation Dewey Canyon back in January , losing 46 men killed and more than 400 wounded in a ten day battle for a piece of terrain known as " Hamburger Hill . "
The Vietnam War was over .
American forces began the long process of drawing down , and turning the battle over to their South Vietnamese allies .
Two years after the original Operation Dewey Canyon , the United States , with their newly empowered South Vietnamese allies , underscored the futility of a counter - sanctuary strategy by launching Operation Dewey Canyon II , a strike through the A Shau Valley into Laos .
Over 50 % of the South Vietnamese force of 14,000 men were killed or captured .
The United States lost 215 men , with over 100 helicopters shot down and over 600 helicopters damaged .
There is a huge problem in trying to link the counter - sanctuary strategy employed in Vietnam and any proposed counter - sanctuary strategy that might be employed against Iran .
First and foremost , it does n’t work .
Any time a nation is compelled to strike " sanctuaries " as a means of relieving pressure on the front - line forces , it is an acknowledgement that the front - line forces are incapable of accomplishing their mission .
The problem facing American forces in Iraq is not so - called " sanctuaries " alleged to be operating in Iran , but rather the reality that the United States in engaged in an unpopular , and increasingly brutal , occupation in Iraq that cannot win regardless of what is transpiring in Iran .
This occupation is being resisted by Iraqis , not Iranians .
Bombing Iran , or worse , launching cross - border operations by US ground forces , will not reduce the will of the Iraqis who fight for their homeland and way of life .
It will only enlarge the theater of operations , and increase the cost of war to the United States in terms of dead and wounded Americans , wasted national treasure , and crippled prestige around the world .
The skill and bravery of those American forces called upon to carry out any cross - border attack into Iran can never be denigrated , just as the courage and fortitude of Marines like Alderman Balcer can never be questioned as they fought in battles such as Operation Dewey Canyon .
The problem is n’t the troops , but rather the policies they are called upon to implement .
The Vietnam War was a bad war for America to be fighting , just as the Iraq war is a bad war .
No amount of courage and sacrifice on the part of American fighting men and women can alter this fact .
In fact , we do those who honor us a huge disservice by continuing to allow them to fight and die in a cause unworthy of the sacrifice they are prepared to make .
The most frustrating aspect of Alderman Balcer ’s citing of the Vietnam War as a parallel argument for justifying a military strike into Iran is n’t just that historically these type of actions never work ( Americans are an optimistic people , ever convinced that " this time we ’ll do it right , " when the reality is that history simply keeps repeating itself ) .
It is that the Vietnam model does n’t fit .
In order for there to be a parallel between the situation in Vietnam and the one we face in Iraq , there would have to be similar casts of characters engaged in similar types of activities .
On the surface , we can say that we have a protagonist ( the United States ) , and an antagonist ( North Vietnam then , Iran now ) .
We then layer on the supporting cast  the South Vietnamese government / the government of Iraq on the one hand , and the Viet Cong and the Shi’a rebels on the other .
This is where the parallel falls apart .
There was angst between the North Vietnamese and South Vietnamese that manifested itself in violence , played out directly and through proxy ( i.e. , the Viet Cong ) .
Yet in Iraq today , we have a situation where the government of Iraq ( dominated by the Da’wa Party and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , both Iranian created , funded and controlled ) is a direct extension of Iranian political will and control in Iraq .
For the Vietnam parallel to hold true , we would have to replace the South Vietnamese government with the Viet Cong , which immediately negates the whole argument in its entirety .
Why would the North Vietnamese undermine the Viet Cong , when their whole purpose was to achieve Communist control of Vietnam in the first place ?
If the Viet Cong were in power in South Vietnam , then the North Vietnamese strategy would be to work with the Viet Cong to get the Americans out of Vietnam , not to conspire to create the conditions which would expand the American military involvement in Vietnam .
The Iranians have already achieved political victory in Iraq .
All they want now is to create long - lasting stability .
The last thing the Iranians would do is create a new " Viet Cong " to undermine the government of Iraq .
Thus , if one accepts the premise of the United States that it is Iran which is responsible for funding and training forces hostile to the government of Iraq , then one would have to accept the notion that Iran is at war with Iran .
This is , frankly speaking , absurd in the extreme .
The Iranians , far from being the instigators of violence in Iraq , play the role of peacemaker .
It is Iran which brokered the ceasefire in Basra which ended the fighting between the US / Iraqi forces and the Mahdi Army of the Moqtada al - Sadr .
Iran likewise seeks to play a moderating force in Baghdad , and in northern Iraq , where it works to diplomatically resolve the political problems with al - Sadr and the Kurds , respectively .
If only the United States were so - inclined .
The so - called " Quds Force " officials captured by the United States inside Iraq were carrying out diplomatic functions conducive to peace , not facilitating the spread of violence .
The fact that the United States has released most of these " Quds Force " members , declaring them neither a security threat nor being of intelligence value , only underscores this reality .
There simply is no evidence provided to sustain the allegations that Iran is waging a proxy war against the United States in Iraq , and that Iran is providing so - called " sanctuaries " for the training and arming of these proxies .
The United States has yet to be able to provide physical evidence of any large - scale cache of Iranian - produced weapons .
Press releases do not count as evidence .
Likewise , the alleged links between the Shi’a fighters in Iraq , and Iranian / Hezbollah sponsors in Iran , are illusory .
American military briefers have referred to several captured fighters  all Iraqi  who they claimed provided testimony on the existence of such a link .
First , in this day and age of torture , we must be wary of so - called " evidence " produced by a system which condones torture as a means of extracting confessions .
As a former intelligence officer , I can state with absolute certainty that the norms and standards which dictated that any information so gathered must be treated as suspect , since anyone can be made to say anything under duress , have not been altered by any " new reality " imagined by the Bush administration post September 11 , 2001 .
The only thing which remains constant is the moral depravity of torture and the unreliability of information so obtained .
Another problem facing the " Iran as sanctuary " argument is that we have n’t a clue what we would be striking to begin with .
Alleged camps may exist as physical points on a map , but have nothing to do with what we allege to be taking place there .
The Hezbollah connection is most disturbing , not because it reinforces what we already know to be true  that Iran supports Hezbollah  but rather is underscores what we do n’t understand .
Moqtada al - Sadr comes from a family with long - standing historical ties with both Iran and Lebanon .
Indeed , the al - Sadr family is directly linked to Lebanese Shi’a who created the Amal movement in Lebanon .
It was a radicalized faction of this Amal movement , having broken away in 1985 , which became Hezbollah .
The mixing of family and politics is always a complicated affair , and can only be interpreted by those who take the time to navigate the complex layers of intrigue thus created .
It is not something condusive to haphazard analysis from people ill - equipped to study the problem .
For military analysts in Iraq , the capture of a person carrying a Lebanese passport with Iranian immigration stamps becomes defacto evidence of an Iranian - Hezbollah conspiracy , when in fact all it might represent is the simple traveling of a family member from Lebanon , through Iran , and into Iraq  by far the safest route .
And to think that the Iranian " Quds Force " would not exploit family connections in an effort to moderate the stance taken by Moqtada al - Sadr and his Mahdi Army is to fail to understand the commitment of Iran for a peaceful outcome to the violence in Iraq .
The fact of the matter is , there is no " sanctuary " problem in Iran worthy of American military action .
These illusory " sanctuaries " are but a myth propagated by those elements within the Bush administration , namely the Office of the Vice President , which are desirous of seeing American policy toward Iran shaped by the reality of war , no matter how artificially and fraudulently justified .
These elements are fearful of a legitimate debate on the merits of military action against Iran , because they know that from such a debate the emptiness of their cause , logically and morally , will be exposed for all to see .
The worst course of action for those who seek to determine policy by exploiting the fears of a population operating in ignorance of the facts is to conduct open hearings which serve to expose bad policy to sunlight , and empower those present with knowledge and information so that their fears can be assuaged with enlightenment .
The recent hearings held by the Chicago City Council on Iran are representative of this kind of " sunshine policy , " which if our elected officials in Washington , DC cannot muster the courage to convene , must then be replicated throughout the United States in the councils of its cities , towns and villages so that the will of the people can be given voice .
Hopefully , the will of the people , so empowered , can manifest itself in a manner which awakens the sleeping Tiger of American democracy , namely the Congress of the United States , so that irresponsible war on Iran , promoted by an illegitimate unitary executive operating void of constitutional checks and balances , can be stopped before it wreaks its devastation on the people of Iran , and by extension , the people of the United States .
I would hope that Alderman Balcer would reconsider his opposition to the resolution being heard by the City Council of Chicago , and understand that the best policy direction that can be taken today vis-à - vis Iraq and Iran is not to embrace policies which create the inevitability of new " Operation Dewey Canyons , " but rather ensure that Americans are never again called upon to sacrifice their lives in vain for wars which are not only avoidable , but serve no purpose in promoting either the legitimate defense of the United States or the greater good .
" The most important thing is that the ratification process must continue in the other countries and then we shall see with the Irish what type of legal arrangement could be found , " he said .

Question :
So , my wife and I left Canada and we visited New York for the very first time in May : loved it .
Saw almost everything from Battery Park to Harlem getting around on foot and subway , and of course we were overawed and impressed pretty much constantly .
New Yorkers have to be the friendliest , most helpful people ever .
Shake out a street map and they flock like moths to a flame to help with directions and sightseeing advice .
My question is this :
We buy our clothes from the same shops and designers , watch the same TV , listen to N.P.R. , and read People and Vanity Fair just like you , so how is that Americans can tell we ’re Canadian before we even speak — eh ?
Answer :
How do we know these things ?
Decades of intensive , government - funded research and study .
Not for nothing did the post - war generation undergo a program of public education that turned them steely - hearted , devout and devoted and eternally wary .
When the Pilgrims ventured forth , they could not have imagined the terrible accident of geography that would place the countless generations that followed in constant , mortal peril .
For centuries , the horror loomed unseen but keenly felt .
Thanks to the bravery and sacrifice of many loyal men and women , only now are we aware of the true extent of the threat .
The sordid details have enthralled and terrified generations of kindergarteners for decades now , but the end result is worth it ; a discreet , nationwide alert system that maintains unceasing vigilance .
When a committee of high - ranking American and Soviet strategists first identified the Canadian threat , back in the dark days of the 1920s , it was decided that an aggressive policy of appeasement and pacification would be undertaken : keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer .
As a nation , we choked but acquiesced to the request , and ensured it was coupled with extreme preventative measures on the home front .
It ’s little - mentioned today , but the original title of that public information film was Duck and Cover : Canada ’s Poised .
It was shown on a weekly basis , alongside other long forgotten classics like Massing on the Borders , Stealth , Syrup , and Socialism , and Shun Lumber for a Stronger America .
These things are hard to forget .
The heart - stopping emergency drills , triggered by sirens with a wheezing , chilling whine , then down to the dark , sweaty recesses of the fallout shelters .
Our parents would close their eyes tight and pray they could n’t detect the sweet , cloying smell of maple syrup that would signal their impending demise .
No nation should be able to do that to another .
Was it scaremongering ?
Were we running scared ?
No , our stance was just plain common sense .
Your every movement creates a gastropodic trail that glistens like a warning beacon to Americans .
So do n’t mistake the detached , wary suspicion of half a century for friendliness .
We know how to play our roles .
The tone of your question suggests that this deception works well .
People ?
Vanity Fair ?
There are no magazines of that name on sale in this city .
They are mere fronts , set up in the 1950s by J. Edgar Hoover as a ruse to root out fifth columnists , gaily painted lures that sit on planted newsstands , waiting for Canadians to take the bait .
Americans proudly know nothing about N.P.R. , for it is merely another painted decoy , designed to spread casual misinformation about the liberal arts .
The sick , turgid spiel we pump across your borders is ripe with juicy buzzwords , opinions , concepts , and chit - chat that spills all too eagerly from your lips .
All of it is false , stitched together by talented voice artists in vast studio complexes in Arkansas and Mississippi .
These highly experienced propagandists are the backbone of the fight .
Thanks to them , any wayward talk of jazz , political satire , oenophilia , or pinkish multi-cultural bonhomie goes off in our ears like a jackhammer on the sidewalk , snapping our synapses into instant action .
Alerted is forewarned .
And like I say , these ruses work .
Your every movement creates a gastropodic trail that glistens like a warning beacon to Americans .
The act of simply shaking out a street map is so provocative as to practically constitute a declaration of war .
No wonder countless civic - minded citizens rushed to surround you and calmly deflect you from your true intentions .
When you get things wrong , it is only by the grace of God and the true grit of the patriot that prevents your instant obliteration .
Your pants , for example , might originate from retailers that purport to be related to our popular brands .
Here , they are traditionally worn on the legs .
Admittedly , the two tubes of material have the makings of an excellent hat , but this then leaves the legs bare .
It is only through sheer politeness and gritted determination that we never acknowledge such sartorial transgressions .
So we stay vigilant .
We hear the stories .
We remember the myths .
No American wants to return to a time when a nameless horror , creeping like a thick mist , would push its wet fingers under doors and through keyholes , draped damply across napes and cheeks .
The nation ’s rich patchwork of urban legends have at their core a kernel of truth .
Canada must be stopped , but slowly , gently , and without recourse to a fight we would inevitably lose .
That is why the quiet war goes on .
No need to open your mouth at all , eh ?

ALBUQUERQUE — Police Chief Ray Schultz plans to retrain his entire police force because of mistakes he acknowledged were made by an officer who attacked a KOB - TV cameraman after ordering him to move from an area near a crime scene .
The incident - which was caught on tape , aired on TV and posted on the Internet - sparked hundreds of complaints to APD .
Schultz said Wednesday that he has drafted a policy that he plans to take to all of the city 's news organizations for input .
He also said the police force will go through training on the new policy and how to deal with crime scene onlookers .
One change would require an officer involved in a disagreement with the media to call a supervisor or public information officer .
The officer involved in last month 's incident has been paired to work with a veteran officer - and never alone - until an investigation is complete .
" I have always said that we learn from our mistakes , " Schultz said .
" Obviously , there were some mistakes made .
So , let 's learn from them instead of repeating them . "
Veteran KOB - TV cameraman Rick Foley was covering a police standoff on May 29 near Copper and Charleston NE when rookie officer Daniel Guzman told Foley to move to a different location , according to a police report .
Foley at the time was some distance from the police cars blocking the street and was outside an area that had been blocked by officers .
Shortly after Guzman told Foley he needed to move , the two exchanged more words .
A video captured by Foley 's camera shows the officer lunging at Foley .
Foley was handcuffed , placed in the back of a police car and cited for " refusing to obey an officer . "
The citation was filed Tuesday in Metropolitan Court .
Foley has been given a July 1 court date .
Schultz said he could n't intervene and have the citation dismissed .
Only an officer or a judge can dismiss a citation once it has been written , he said .
Shortly after the incident , Schultz asked the city 's independent review officer to investigate .
That investigation is ongoing .
The IRO has reviewed Foley 's tape but has not conducted any interviews .
The Journal made an official request on June 2 for records involving any prior disciplinary action taken against Guzman as well as any other resident 's complaints .
Police have yet to produce the documents .
A deputy city attorney said in an e-mail that they are reviewing the request and will have a response within 15 days .
Schultz said action was taken shortly after the incident because of the severity of the allegations and the fact that his office has received about 200 emails - most of which attack Guzman and the chief .
Schultz said that two of those e-mails had a threatening tone and that those e-mailers wanted to know where and when Guzman works so they could " talk to him . "
" Because of the nature of some of the e-mails , we thought it was in his best interest not to put him in a situation where someone has an encounter with him and something escalates , " Schultz said .
Schultz said that when he watched a video of the encounter , he noticed that several mistakes were made , although he declined to elaborate until the IRO completes its investigation .
Schultz pointed out that Foley had asked Guzman for his name and badge number , and that the officer refused to give it .
" That 's an obvious policy violation , " Schultz said .
" We have a distinct policy you will provide name and identification number when asked by anyone .
That did not occur . "
Schultz said the new policy he drafted deals mostly with how officers are to treat representatives of the media when they think a reporter or photographer is disobeying a lawful order .
The drafted policy calls for the officer to contact his supervisor or a public information officer , but not to initiate an arrest .
The department already has a policy in place that says anyone from the community can record any crime scene as long as he or she is not standing in the scene .
" We want any conflicts addressed at the scene and not have our officers jump to enforcement action , " Schultz said .
" Let 's get the right people there and not get to the point where someone is being arrested or cited . "

I ’ll be closing on my home next month and , I think , I have everything under control .
But I ’m still getting anxious about the whole deal .
So , what am I anxious about ?
* Buying a house .
The biggest investment I have ever made .
* 20 % down payment .
A very large chunk of my savings is going to vanish from savings account .
* The closing table , where there will be attorneys , Realtor , builder etc. who have done this quite a few times .
So I thought I ’ll get some more information about the whole closing process and what really happens at the closing table .
It does n’t matter if you are closing on a single family home , condo or a townhome .
The process is similar .
Who will be present at the home closing ?
You , the buyer , will be present , along with your team , which likely includes your real estate agent and your settlement attorney .
If you have an especially amiable and service - oriented mortgage broker , he may be there on your behalf as well , though that is unlikely .
On the other side of the table will be the seller (s ) , the seller ’s agent , and possibly an attorney for their team .
When the referee blows the whistle , the ball will be tossed straight up into the air .
Generally , the tallest person on your team will want to do the jumping .
No , wait !
That ’s something else .
Never mind .
How long will this take ?
This depends on how smoothly things go .
It ’s likely to take about one hour for you to sign all the paperwork .
( This is another reason that you do not want to go into something like this without some help .
If you ’ve bought the house without a real estate agent , you definitely want a good settlement attorney to be with you before and during closing . )
If there are surprises ( see below ) at closing , it will take longer .
What do you need to bring at the closing table ?
You ’re probably working with an agent , so she will be of help here .
You ’ll need to have in hand your new home owner ’s insurance policy , showing that you have , indeed , insured the house , and a cashiers check .
The settlement sheet is a document which lists all of the closing costs and the particulars of your loan .
The Passing of the Baton
The seller is advised not to cancel home owner ’s insurance until recordation has occurred , which is to say , the sale of the house has officially been recorded at city hall .
This usually takes place within 24 hours of the sale .
The buyer , meanwhile , is advised that he should have his homeowners policy activated immediately ( but you already arranged this , did n’t you ? ) and he “ takes possession ” upon the completion of closing .
What does “ take possession ” mean ?
It means the house is yours .
It means that , after you ’ve signed all these documents , the seller ( or someone from the seller ’s team ) is going to place the keys to the house in your hands .
At this point , the seller ( or builder , if it ’s a new house ) gives you whatever package of information he may have on equipment at the house .
This includes things like the instruction booklet for the washing machine ; information on how that timer - light above the front door works ; how you re-code the automatic garage door opener ; how - to manuals for the refrigerator and the food disposal .
You get the idea — everything you need to work and service and understand all of the major appliances of the house .
The good news is that an overwhelming majority of closings occur without a problem .
However , be sure to take the responsibility to examine the paperwork and examine it well .
Ask whomever is handling the closing to explain it to you .
You should be as prepared as possible for this transaction .
Now is not the time to be shy or be afraid of “ looking stupid ” by asking a question .
Scientists from CSIRO and the University of Melbourne in Australia , and the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , Texas , are on the brink of a discovery which will facilitate the development of new , safe , more sustainable ways of controlling the world ’s worst agricultural insect pest – the moth , Helicoverpa armigera .
The Australian Minister for Innovation , Industry , Science and Research , Senator the Hon Kim Carr , said – at the BIO 2008 International Convention in San Diego , California – that the team was expected to sequence the moth ’s genome in about four months .
“ This will allow the collaborating scientists and a worldwide consortium of specialists to work on new ways of controlling this pest , ” Senator Carr said .
According to CSIRO ’s Group Executive for Agribusiness , Dr Joanne Daly , these include : the molecular basis of resistance to chemical and Bt insecticides and population genetics related to the refuge strategies in place to help prevent Helicoverpa from developing resistance to Bt transgenic cottons .
“ This moth is resistant to nearly every class of chemical pesticide and threatens the long - term viability of transgenic crops which are reliant on the biological pesticide , Bt , ” Dr Daly said .
“ The sequencing of the genome will greatly facilitate this research by improving the power , cost effectiveness and insights from the genetic work on this species and its American cousin H. zea , ” University of Melbourne Associate Professor Philip Batterham said .
“ This moth is resistant to nearly every class of chemical pesticide and threatens the long - term viability of transgenic crops which are reliant on the biological pesticide , Bt , ” Dr Daly said .
Senator Carr said that finding the moth 's Achilles heel was critically important to agriculture worldwide .
“ The moth causes $ 225 million of damage a year in Australia – $ 5 billion globally – to crops such as cotton , legumes and vegetables , ” he said .

" Pro-Life " GOP candidate for Congress Mike Erickson will have a much harder time denying today 's damning expose in The Oregonian .
Allegations from his primary opponent about having paid for an abortion have been proven in this well sourced article .
During the Oregon primary we covered the allegations made against " Pro- Life " GOP candidate for Congress Mike Erickson , by his Republican opponent Kevin Mannix .
Erickson won the primary , and today , The Oregonian moves the story from political allegation to hard facts , supported by several sources .
From the story :
Tawnya , now 34 , recalled sitting with Erickson in his new
Mercedes that January , parked across from the abortion
clinic .
" I was bawling so hard I could n’t speak .
He looked
so sad .
He looked like he cared , " she said .
" I asked him , ‘ Are you sure you do n’t want a
baby ? ’ " she said .
" He shook his head .
I
opened the door , got out bawling and crossed the street and
walked up to the clinic . "
Erickson , 45 , said he dated Tawnya " for a couple of
months . "
He told The Oregonian he did n’t remember
many details about their relationship , including where they
met or when they dated .
He said she betrayed no emotion
during the car ride .
" Did I pay for an abortion ?
Absolutely not , "
Erickson said .
Sex . Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

" She was having some financial troubles , " he said .
" She asked for some money to go have a doctor ’s
appointment — not knowing what that was — and whatever
happened , happened , I guess .
I did n’t even know she had
an abortion . "
Erickson has campaigned on a strict anti-abortion platform
that favors abstinence education and adoption over abortion .
His opponent in last month ’s primary , Kevin Mannix ,
spotlighted the abortion story in a mass mailing to voters a
week before the election .
Mannix did so without
Tawnya ’s knowledge or consent .
The story , based on documentation and conversations with multiple sources , goes on to detail a trip Erickson and Tawnya took as friends , with other friends , after the abortion .
His denial about knowing that the money he provided was for an abortion rings even more hollow when reading about his accounting of the trip :
" It was n’t like we
were on a boyfriend - girlfriend trip , " Erickson said .
" We were friends , mostly . "
Erickson said he ’s almost certain he did not spend an
intimate evening with Tawnya in Mexico .
" I do n’t think I did , " he said .
" I
do n’t believe I did . "
Either you had sex in Mexico or you did n’t , and even if it was n’t that memorable , you ’d probably recall .
Mike Erickson is a metaphor for what is happening in the " Pro- Life " movement this election cycle .
The hypocrisy , evident for everyone to see , is not just that he claims to be " Pro- Life " while paying for his girlfriend ’s abortion , but also in the fact that the entire " Pro- Life " movement is morally bankrupt .
Promoting abstinence - only , making contraception more difficult to access , and outlawing abortion does nothing to prevent unintended pregnancies .
Had Roe v.
Wade been overturned when this happened , would Erickson have acted differently ?
Would the pregnancy miraculously not have happened ?
The image of this man , in his Mercedes , giving a woman who makes $ 13.37 / hour , $ 300 for " medical help " that he claims he did n’t know the reason for , is akin to people of means knowing they will always be able to get access to health care needs , whatever they may be , while denying those same rights to others .
Erickson is not talking about preventing abortions in his campaign , he is talking about prohibiting them , overturning Roe v.
Wade , because as a person of wealth and power , he ’ll always find a way around the law .
He ’ll always be able to look reporters in the eye and deny reality .
The question in this election is not about ending abortion by overturning Roe v.
Wade , it is about electing people who believe in education , prevention and providing necessary reproductive health care to all women .
Reproducitve health care that includes contraception , so that unintended pregnancies , like the one this " Pro- Life " candidate helped create , are more rare , and that women who choose to terminate those unintended pregnancies , as this " Pro- Life " candidate encouraged her to do , can access the same safe , legal care Tawnya did .
The " Pro- Life " movement can continue to make Roe v.
Wade a litmus test , pretending that changing the law will eliminate abortion .
The reality of one of their own candidates , Mike Erickson , suggests otherwise .
As McCain gets ready to release his medical records in a very limited fashion today , I 've come across a clip back on 08/01/2000 .
He 's being interviewed by Jim Lehrer on News Hour and admits that he'd be too old to run in 2008 .
Download Download
Lehrer : Finally for the record , you have not lost your desire to be President of the United States have you ?
McCain : Certainly it 's been put in deep cold storage .
haha ..
Lehrer :
You have n't lost it ?
McCain : Well , in 2004 , I expect to be campaigning for the reelection of President George W. Bush , and by 2008 , I think I might be ready to go down to the old soldiers home and await the cavalry charge there .
Nobody can complain if age comes up anymore since the candidate has made it an issue as far back as 2000 all by himself .
Americans polled are sure worried about it anyway ...
R6RS は実用的な仕様がたくさん入っていて良いのですが getenv がなくて CGI プログラムが書けません。と文句を言うだけではもったいないのでSRFI( Scheme Requests for Implementation ) に仕様を提案しようと決意 。
shiroさんにアドバイス頂き
既存の実装を調査 （Scheme / getenv/調査）
セマンティクスは Java を参考に
書いてみました 。
いやあ難しい。ダメ出しつっこみをよろしくお願いします。
title Gets the value of the specified environment variable .
author Taro Minowa （Higepon）
Abstract
This SRFI specifies the procedure getenv , gets the value of the specified environment variable .
Rationale Many Scheme implementations provide means for getting the value of the specified environment variable , usually called getenv .
Environment variables are conceptually mappings between names and values .
This mechanism can be used to pass system - dependent external information to a Scheme program .
Environment variables are widely used in many UNIX systems to specify optional parameters or environment dependent features .
In addition , some web application frameworks like CGI heavily use environment variables as the parameter from frontend web servers .
For example , CGI program uses following environment variables .
( getenv " QUERY_STRING " ) => " foo=bar&huga=hige " ( getenv " CONTENT_LENGTH " ) => " 512 " ( getenv " REQUEST_METHOD " ) => " post "
Therefore , it is quite useful to define the environment - independent way to get environment variables .
Specification Function : getenv name Returns the value of the environment variable name as a string , or #f if the environment variable is not found .
( getenv " PATH " ) =>
" /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin "
Function : getenv
Returns the list of all the environment variables as an a - list .
( getenv ) => (( " PATH " .
" /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin " ) ( " USERNAME " . " taro " ) )
Implementation getenv procedure may be implemented with operating system dependent functions and variables .
On Unix getenv and environ , on Windows getenv_s and _environ may be used .

The Brazilian president , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , has a compelling personal and political biography .
One of eight children , he could not read until he was 10 , left school soon after and by the age of 12 was working as a shoeshine boy .
Lula was instrumental in setting up his own leftwing political party , the Workers party , risked jail as a trade union organiser during the dictatorship and ran for president three times before he was finally successful in 2002 , capturing the imagination and hopes of many Brazilians - albeit with a vastly watered - down programme .
Having finally won the presidency , a moment many of his supporters thought would never happen , he was then cruelly mugged .
The invisible hand of the market grabbed him on his way to the inauguration and shook what was left of the socialism out of him .
In the three months between his winning the vote and being sworn in , the nation 's currency plummeted by 30 % , $ 6bn in hot money had left the country , and some agencies had given Brazil the highest debt - risk ratings in the world .
" We are in government but not in power , " said Lula 's close aide , Dominican friar Frei Betto .
" Power today is global power , the power of the big companies , the power of financial capital . "
In any democracy the link between the electoral and the political is essential but not inextricable .
Between the trappings of democracy and the trials of legislating , there is power .
The balance , distribution and strategic exercise of it shapes the relationship between expectations and possibility , marking the distinction between being the will of the people and the work of government .
It is the very tension that lies at the heart of Barack Obama 's candidacy and the energy it has unleashed .
To attract 75,000 people to a rally , as he did in Portland , Oregon , recently , shows immense drawing power .
The question is , what to do you say to them when they get there ?
On the one hand , he has managed to articulate the aspirations of many people from whom we previously heard little , if anything , in American politics and mobilise them into a formidable voting bloc .
On the other , the progressive forces that have gathered around him have now wedded themselves to a decidedly mainstream , tepid political agenda .
Lula , at least , resisted the assaults on his base ; Obama , at times , appears to embrace them .
That an Obama victory would mark a radical improvement on George Bush and be far preferable to John McCain , there can be no doubt .
Electorally , that is important .
But politically , it leaves open the question of whether he is prepared to adopt an ambitious programme that can address the mess he will inherit .
Politically , this question could have been asked of any of his main Democratic rivals in the primaries , none of whom pursued radical agendas .
But electorally , more has always been claimed of his candidacy and more has also been expected of it .
Let 's start with the obvious .
Electorally , Obama 's nomination marks a truly exciting and historic moment in US history .
In a nation that prides itself on relentless progress and social meritocracy , the symbolic importance of a black president can be over - exaggerated .
But that does not mean it should be dismissed .
He was born before he had the constitutional right to vote ( secured by the 1965 Voting Rights Act ) , to mixed - race parents who did not have the constitutional right to marry ( the supreme court only legalised miscegenation in 1967 ) .
His campaign represents a milestone in America 's scarred racial landscape .
Of the 10 blackest states , he won nine ; of the 10 whitest , he won seven .
He has broken a mould .
And it can't be reset .
Moreover , his candidacy has sparked a realignment in the coalition of forces that comprise the Democratic party , by rousing dormant and ignored constituencies - notably the black and the young .
The Democrats have consistently won the youth vote since 1992 but have failed to galvanise a sufficiently high turnout for it to be decisive .
The black vote , on other hand , has long been both crucial and taken for granted .
The party has only won the majority of the white vote in a presidential election once since the second world war .
In the past , both groups were at best treated as junior partners and at worst simply forgotten .
Not any more .
Obama 's campaign helped raise the share of young people 's ( 18 - 29 ) votes in the Democratic primary by more than 50 % compared with 2004 .
Between them , the young vote and the black vote comprised 28.8 % of the Democratic primary electorate in 2004 .
This year it was 35.1 % .
Their swelling numbers and contagious enthusiasm will give them considerable leverage within the party .
If - a big if - he can maintain the rest of the Democratic base , this could bring into play states like Virginia and North Carolina , which the Democrats have not won since 1964 and 1976 respectively .
His candidacy could set an earthquake under the established electoral map .
He has also transformed the model for funding , creating a broad popular base of small donors .
Unprecedented numbers of people have invested in him .
The question is whether they will see a return .
The earliest signs have not been promising .
The day after he clinched the nomination , he went with Hillary Clinton and McCain to genuflect before the pro-Israeli lobby to declare himself a " true friend of Israel " .
But good friends sometimes tell each other things they need to hear , even if they do n't want to .
America 's uncritical support for these past eight years has been deeply unhealthy and has been neither in the interests of America or the Middle East .
Correcting it is central to the US improving its dire standing in the Arab world and gaining international credibility in general - two things his supporters crave .
Instead he pandered , stating that " Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel , and it must remain undivided " , and promising not to withdraw from Iraq until the conditions on the ground were right .
Meanwhile , the economy continues its precipitous decline .
Unemployment is increasing , the dollar is slumping and inflation remains high .
House prices are nosediving and fuel prices are skyrocketing .
Each month more and more Americans find themselves at the precipice .
One in 11 mortgages are either in arrears or foreclosure .
More than one in six homeowners has negative equity or no equity in their house .
By June , claims Moodys , that will rise to one in four .
Yet Obama refuses to call for a moratorium , an interest rate freeze or substantial government spending , preferring instead a tax credit for homeowners that would amount to little more than about $ 500 , beyond which only some borrowers could get more help .
Over - represented among these sub - prime borrowers are the very African Americans who have propelled him to victory .
The great thing about Obama 's candidacy is that he has raised expectations about what American can be and do in a way that nobody else has or could in recent memory .
Whether they develop into pressure or descend into cynicism is an open question .
Will he be a vehicle for their hopes , or will they be a vehicle for his political ambition ?
The two are not mutually exclusive .
But their connection is far from assured .

The music industry is suffering , and it 's all because of those darn fans .
Er , what ?
It turns out that KISS member Gene Simmons believes exactly that .
He claims that piracy is to blame for the industry 's woes , and KISS is apparently taking its ball and going home until the situation gets under control .
" The record industry is dead .
It 's six feet underground and unfortunately the fans have done this , " Simmons said , according to AOL News .
" They 've decided to download and file share .
There is no record industry around so we 're going to wait until everybody settles down and becomes civilized .
As soon as the record industry pops its head up we 'll record new material . "
It 's never a smart move to blame your loyal and devoted fans for the injustices of the world , but Simmons seems to think that his fans ( unlike everyone else 's ) would rather steal from the band than continue paying for music they enjoy .
Simmons also thinks bands that encourage the public to download their music for free ( such as Radiohead with its famed In Rainbows experiment ) are only making the situation worse , despite the fact that Radiohead has made a nice chunk of change from the In Rainbows release so far .
Simmons ' latest comments come just over six months after his previous rant about the music industry , wherein he told Billboard , " Every little college kid , every freshly - scrubbed little kid's face should have been sued off the face of the earth . "
At that time , he blamed the record industry for letting foxes into the henhouse ( presumably by allowing DRM - free music to be sold online , or perhaps any music at all to be sold online ) .
" Does n't affect me .
But imagine being a new band with dreams of getting on stage and putting out your own record .
Forget it , " he said .
So , does this apparently rampant piracy problem affect Simmons or not ?
His comments between last November and now seem to contradict each other a bit , although they clearly share the same underlying sentiment : anger .
Simmons might want to reconsider speaking for anyone but himself , though .
Many young and independent bands are able to enjoy success on and off the stage , all while selling their music online .
As part of an upcoming feature we 're doing on indie bands and online music , one band told us that its members believe that P2P is all part of the ecosystem , and that they even saw increased sales after their album showed up on Bit Torrent .
The sad part is that Simmons ' continued comments are n't going to cause anyone ( fans or not ) to have an epiphany and quit their P2P - slingin ' ways .
In fact , it may have the opposite effect — the clear disdain in his words may well drive some of KISS ' fans away .
The only thing Simmons is doing by lashing out at fans is earning him a reputation as a curmudgeonly artist unwilling to adapt to a changing music landscape .
Last week , Human Rights
Watch released a report describing human rights abuses in a remote area of Ethiopia .
With that region closed to foreigners by the Ethiopian government , the report relies on a combination of eyewitness reports and commercial satellite imagery performed by the American Association for the Advancement of Science 's ( AAAS ) Science and Human Rights Program .
The report highlights the growing importance of commercial imagery in monitoring abuses in areas otherwise off - limits to nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) .
We talked with the AAAS ' Lars Bromley , Project Director of the Science and Human Rights Program , about the history and future prospects for this application of technology .
Satellites and rights abuses
The Ogaden region of eastern Ethiopia lies just to the north of Somalia , and the population there includes several groups of Somali extraction .
A subset of this population has been engaged in a rebellion against the Ethiopian government , hoping to gain autonomy .
Human rights abuses have occurred on both sides , but rose in 2007 , after the rebels assaulted a Chinese - run oil installation in the area , killing a number of civilians .
The Ethiopian army followed with an aggressive campaign against rural villages in the region .
Human Rights
Watch has documented the systematic destruction of villages and summary execution of their occupants through interviews with refugees in countries bordering Ethiopia .
Seeking independent confirmation of the eyewitness accounts , they worked with the AAAS to obtain before and after images of the areas identified by the refugees ' accounts .
11 individual areas were identified and , by obtaining images from commercial satellite companies , the organizations were able to identify hundreds of structures that were destroyed during the time interval identified by the refugees .

Getting from a village name to the coordinates needed for using satellite imagery can be a real challenge .
The coordinates , as the AAAS ' Bromley said , " really have to get down to several decimal places . "
Typically , they build a list of the villages they think they have good coordinates for , then they compare it with what 's available in the archives of the imaging company .
Archived " before " images are much less expensive than having new images created on order .
Unfortunately , from remote areas such as the Ogaden area , archived pictures from after the occurrence of rights violations are n't common , making them expensive to obtain .
Prioritizing the final list of sites for the purchase and analysis involves close cooperation between the AAAS and the participating NGOs .
" It 's all done in close cooperation , " Bromley said .
Once the images are obtained , a combination of computerized image analysis and visual examination determines whether the before and after pictures corroborate eyewitness accounts .
Advancing science to human rights
Bromley also described how the AAAS became involved in human rights work in the first place .
He has a Masters in geography , and started working with satellite imagery to support the AAAS ' population and sustainable development efforts , which required ecosystem and resource analysis of remote areas .
These initial projects were funded largely by the National Science Foundation .
The transition to human rights work was inspired by US Government satellite imagery that exposed the humanitarian crisis in Darfur .
" The notable thing about that product was , " said Bromley , " that while undoubtedly classified imagery was used to create it , the public version cited only commercial satellite imagery . "
Bromley approached the Science and Human Rights program director , who arranged seed funding from the MacArthur Foundation and , by 2006 , the project was underway .
Now , they have funding from a number of sources , and have done contract work for some organizations .
The funds have been enough to allow Bromley to hire a second full - time staff member ; so far , most of the work has been done with a rotating group of analysts and interns , supported by the infrastructure provided by AAAS .

" So far the response has been pretty overwhelming , " said Bromley , " We do n't have the money or the staff time to meet the demands . "
The cost of up - to - date images has tended to be the largest bottleneck , but he identified other limitations as well .
The process of ordering , paying for , and processing the images is also unwieldy , and Bromley would like to see the AAAS create a standardized system that acts as a clearinghouse with access to a constellation of satellites for human rights organizations to plug in to .
The project is also beginning to evaluate other forms of imaging , such as those provided by radar mapping satellites , for use in this project .
Looking forward , Bromley hopes that the success of the first few commercial ventures will encourage the continued launching of commercial imaging satellites .
" The test of that is — did they continue to put up satellites ? " he asked .
" The answer is yes . "
With greater imaging capacity , more data will appear in the cheaper - to - access archives , and the cost of pointing a satellite at a specific area may drop a bit .
The greater coverage may allow expanded use of a technique he called " protective imaging " — Amnesty International has identified villages in Darfur located in areas that left them likely to be attacked , and informed the Sudanese government that they would be subject to regular imaging .
" It helps with advocacy , " Bromley said , " but some have been attacked , so the impact can be limited . "
Ultimately , the goal is to move the imaging to real time so that it can have an immediate impact on diplomacy .
" Can we catch things in the act ? "
Bromley asked , adding that he was n't sure if or when they'd be able to .
But , he said , " everyone wants a ' smoking gun ' image , " so the effort to get there is likely to continue .

The Formula for a Police State
by Anthony Gregory
On the night of March 15 in an Oceanside , California , parking lot , after a dispute over one car cutting off another , Frank White , an off - duty San Diego police officer , shot five bullets into Rachel Silva ’s car , hitting her in the arm twice , shattering a bone , and striking her eight - year - old son in the leg .
She was unarmed .
She has trouble moving her arm and might have permanent nerve damage .
Oceanside Police Captain Tom Aguigui promises that the department is pursuing “ a very fair and complete investigation ” to determine “ why this whole thing happened , ” but many details are being concealed from the public .
What does seem apparent , however , is something of a double standard .
First , after Silva was hospitalized , the authorities decided to drug test her .
Officer
White , the one who did the shooting , was not tested .
San Diego Homicide Lieutenant Kevin Rooney explained that police , whether on - or off - duty , are not drug tested after involvement in a shooting , barring some sign of intoxication .
It is yet unclear what Silva ’s alleged signs of intoxication were or why shooting someone after a traffic dispute is n’t probable cause for testing the way that , say , reckless driving is .
Nor was Officer White arrested .
The Oceanside police did question him — while he was accompanied by a supervisor from his department , an attorney , and a police “ peer support ” representative .
He is currently on paid leave .
Silva and her attorney have filed a claim for damages , in which she says she and White were yelling at each other when White pulled up on the right side of her car and began shooting as she tried to drive away .
This account might help explain the bullet holes in Silva ’s windshield and passenger side window , as well as why White ’s driver ’s side window was broken .
Silva has two DUIs on her record and was driving on a suspended license , leading some to question her credibility , and yet it is hard to imagine things going the same way if White were not a police officer .
If police arriving at the scene found an unarmed woman blacking out from massive blood loss , her young son bleeding , her car shot up , and an angry motorist having clearly done the shooting , would they have decided to drug test the shot woman and not the shooter ?
Considering the injured child , would they have let the shooter go so easily and kept such strict control over the investigation ?
Would they have characterized their probe as an attempt to discover why he did it — not just to find motive for what appears to be an open - shut case of criminal road rage , but seemingly to find an exculpatory explanation ?
What if the tables were turned : if White had been an ordinary citizen and Silva a police officer — even an armed one ?
Does anyone truly believe the investigation would be undertaken in an identical manner ?
Indeed , the very fact that this investigation is being approached secretively and as a special case shows there is something fundamentally flawed about the way police are viewed in our culture and by the police department itself .
It should make no difference who did the shooting and who was shot .
All that should matter are the facts of the case and whether the shooting was an act of aggression or self - defense .
In a free , just society , police are not held to a different standard — unless , perhaps , a higher standard ; after all , they are the ones paid by taxpayers to uphold the law .
Having a double standard that favors police is the formula for a police state .
Whether in investigations , arrests , trials , or punishment , police should never get away with anything for which a member of the public would face severe consequences .
A police state is at our doorstep when the public fears the government and law enforcers enjoy impunity for negligent or malicious behavior .
Freedom and justice are empty promises without equality under the law , including for the lawmen .
Frank
White should be regarded innocent until proven guilty .
But does anyone think he’d be treated the same way if he were not an officer of the law ?
Or that if found guilty he ’ll get the same punishment that Silva would have if she had shot him and his son ?
To ask the question is to answer it , which is a sad testament to the current state of the rule of law .
[ I will be keeping up on this a bit .
Not much in the last week has come out to add much clarity to the situation , though apparently Silva has a new attorney and there is some evidence she was in retreat when White shot her .
Also , a new claim on the boy ’s behalf accuses
White of pointing the gun directly at him . ]
Despite all the lawsuit hoopla over who - stole - what , Fisker Automotive is trudging along with its $ 80,000 Karma plug - in performance hybrid .
New , stripey pictures of the actual vehicle in test runs popped up this week telling us that the Karma could actually hit dealers by 2009 as promised .
The pictures are nice -- so nice , in fact , that it turns out they were " leaked " by Fisker 's own PR agency along with a video .
For review , the Fisker Karma will do 0 - 60 in 5.8 seconds and top out at 150MPH via an electric / internal - combustion hybrid engine .
Latest word is that the combustion engine portion is of Volkswagen build .
Fisker is only saying that the engine is of German build , and we say , " gut ! " -- let those external speakers roar !
The " leaked " video is after the break .
( CNN ) -- Hillary Clinton 's decisive win in West Virginia caused John Edwards to throw his support to Barack Obama , the Illinois senator 's aides said .
John Edwards endorsed Barack Obama following Clinton 's big win in West Virginia .
Edwards was concerned that the Clinton storyline -- that Obama can't win white , working - class voters -- was becoming too damaging to Obama and the party , aides said .
Obama had been courting Edwards for four months .
Since Edwards abandoned his presidential bid in January , he and Obama have talked regularly , Obama said .
As late as Monday , Edwards told CNN's Larry King that he was n't prepared to make an endorsement .
" What I do n't want to do is contribute to the divide , " he said .
" At least for this moment , I think the reasonable thing for me to do is let voters make their decision . "
But Clinton 's crushing win in West Virginia on Tuesday highlighted Obama 's weakness with working - class white voters , a segment of the electorate that may prove pivotal in November .
Watch how the endorsement could affect Obama »
Among white voters without a college degree , Clinton defeated Obama by 50 percentage points .
Among white voters making less than $ 30,000 a year , Clinton 's margin of victory was more than 60 percentage points .
Edwards had campaigned on the message that he was standing up for the little guy , the people who are not traditionally given a voice in Washington , and that he would do more to fight special interests .
" The reason I 'm here tonight is because the Democratic voters have made their choice , and so have I , " Edwards told a boisterous crowd in Grand Rapids , Michigan , on Wednesday .
Watch why Edwards picked Obama »
" There is one man who knows in his heart that it is time to create one America , not two , and that man is Barack Obama . "
Edwards also praised Clinton 's candidacy .
Despite trailing in pledged delegates , superdelegates and the popular vote , Clinton has repeatedly said her campaign will keep going .
Clinton campaign Chairman Terry McAuliffe said Wednesday that , " We respect John Edwards , but as the voters of West Virginia showed last night , this thing is far from over . "
Wednesday 's endorsement could help Obama reach the blue - collar voters who have been reluctant to embrace his candidacy .
On his flight from Grand Rapids to Chicago , Obama told reporters he has no doubt Edwards will help him in every demographic .
And the signs are beginning to show with Thursday 's endorsement by the powerful United Steelworkers Union .
" When the presidential primary contests began last year , our Union felt strongly that because of Senator John Edwards 's deep commitment to working people and because of our shared beliefs , he deserved our strong endorsement , " the union said in a press release .
" Today , by virtue of a unanimous vote of our International Executive Board , we find ourselves once again in agreement with Senator Edwards , this time with his decision last evening to endorse Senator Barack Obama . "
The union 's leaders took aim with Sen. John McCain 's " lock - step commitment to four more years of the broken Bush economy and the broken Bush foreign policies , " according to the press release .
Obama also picked up two new superdelegates on Thursday .
Democratic Reps. Henry Waxman and Howard Berman , both major committee chairmen and California superdelegates , endorsed Obama , citing his " ability to unite the country and put and end to eight years of failed Bush policies , " according to the Obama campaign .
The recent endorsements come amid a new CNN general election " poll of polls " released Thursday , showing Obama leading McCain by 48 percent to 43 percent .
Clinton leads McCain by 48 percent to 44 percent .
The polls were taken May 8 - 12 and consist of three surveys : Gallup ( May 9 - 13 ) , Quinnipiac ( May 8 - 12 ) , and ABC / Washington Post ( May 8 - 11 ) .
The poll of polls does not have a sampling error .
The last general poll of polls , released April 29 , showed Obama leading McCain by two percentage points and Clinton leading by one percentage point .
After dropping out of the race , Edwards asked Clinton and Obama to make poverty a central issue in the general election and a future Democratic administration , something both agreed to do .
Edwards released his 19 delegates , and they are free to vote for the candidate of their choice -- and the switch to the Obama is already beginning .
At least six of Edwards ' eight pledged delegates in South Carolina will throw their support to Obama following Edwards ' endorsement , CNN has learned .
Daniel Boan , Christine Brennan - Bond , Robert Groce , Susan Smith , Mike Evatt and Lauren Bilton announced Thursday they will follow Edwards ' lead and pledge their support to Obama at the Democratic National Convention in August .
They were all elected as pledged delegates for Edwards following his third - place finish in the South Carolina primary on January 29 .
John Moylan , the Columbia attorney who directed Edwards ' campaign in the state and now serves as an alternate delegate for Edwards , appeared on CNN's " American Morning " Thursday .
He stated his support for Obama and hinted that more members of the Edwards delegation would soon follow .
Bilton appeared on the show alongside Moylan and confirmed she will also support Obama .
Boan , Brennan - Bond and Groce , each reached by phone or e-mail , declared they will switch their commitment to Obama .
In a separate e-mail , Moylan confirmed that Smith and Evatt also will move into Obama 's camp .
The other two delegates supporting Edwards in South Carolina are Tim Moore and Marilyn Hemingway .
Obama , meanwhile , said he hopes Edwards takes an active role in his campaign , but he declined to speculate about an Obama - Edwards ticket .
As Obama inches closer to the Democratic nomination , there 's been renewed talk of a joint ticket with Clinton .
Obama has said both Edwards and Clinton would be on his shortlist , but he has repeatedly said it 's too early to start talking about it .
Clinton on Thursday was scheduled to campaign in Bath , South Dakota , before heading to California for a fundraiser .
Clinton 's campaign is about $ 20 million in the red .
The senator from New York spent Wednesday meeting with her finance team and reaching out to undeclared superdelegates .
Obama was expected to be in Chicago and had a fundraiser scheduled in the evening .
CNN 's Suzanne Malveaux , Alan Silverleib , Ed Hornick , Peter Hamby and Beth Rotatori contributed to this report .

An effective web design is one in which your users are able to find information quickly and in a logical fashion .
Do they visit the content you want them to visit ?
Are they looking in the right places of your web page ?
Are you able to keep your user ’s attention , or do they just leave quickly ?
It ’s not just about the content either .
If your design loads slowly – or if moving from one section to another takes a long time – it affects the user ’s experience .
These things can be the make - or - break factors between a user clicking on a link to find more information , or the back button to find it elsewhere .
Some things to consider :
Are important information being seen by the user ?
Are the navigation and action items intuitive ?
Is the user being directed to sections in a logical manner ?
Does the web page load quickly enough to not turn away the user ?
If you ’re interested in analyzing and optimizing your page layout – here ’s some extremely useful tools that you can use to help .
1. ClickHeat
ClickHeat is an open source visual tool for showing “ hot ” and “ cold ” zones of a web page .
It allows you to see which spots users click on most , and which spots are being ignored .
It ’s very easy to implement on your website , you only have to include an external JavaScript file .
Download : Clickheat on SourceForge.net .
2. Crazy Egg
Crazy Egg offers a myriad of analytical tools to help you visualize what visitors are doing .
Features include : Confetti – allowing you to see what people are clicking on based on certain factors such as their operating system and where they came from , Overlay – providing you with tons of data about particular links , and Report sharing – enabling you to share the data with team members and clients .
The free version only allows 4 pages to be tracked – so use your top landing pages to get the most data .
3. YSlow for Firebug
A key tenet of a strong design is that , not only should information be presented in a logical and elegant fashion , but that it must also be served quickly , with very little delay .
YSlow for Firebug is a free tool for Mozilla Firefox that gives you information about your front - end design to see if it performs well .
It gives you a letter grade ( A through F ) and outlines your web page ’s trouble spots .
It ’s based on the Yahoo !
Developer Network ’s “ Best Practices for Speeding Up Your Web Site ” initially written by Steve Souders , who was once the Chief of Performance at Yahoo !
and is now working over at Google on web performance and open source initiatives .
Downloads : Firebug extension for Firefox ( required ) and YSlow .
4. clickdensity
clickdensity is a full suite of usability analysis tools that will help you assess your web page design .
You can use heat maps showing where users click on the most , hover maps – which shows people scrolling over links but not clicking on them , and A / B Tests which allows you to change certain page elements to see which style is more effective .
The free subscription give you 5,000 clicks and only one page and one site to monitor .
5. ClickTale
ClickTale offers a lot of user data pertaining to how visitors use your website .
There are plenty of things you can look at such as average time it takes for a user to click on a link , a user ’s hesitation on clicking a link , hover to click ratio , and much more .
It also provides detailed reports and charts on your users ’ monitor sizes to better optimize your web page design to cater for the typical visitor .
6. Clicky
Perhaps the most interesting feature that Clicky has is its real - time tracking and monitoring feature , called Spy ( check out the demo here ) .
Besides Spy , there ’s a host of other analytics data you can look at such as user Actions – which records click data from your users and Visitors – providing you user data .
7. Google Analytics
One of the best free services that Google offers is Google Analytics and probably the most well - known analytics tool .
It ’s incredibly easy to install and offers plenty of user and content data to help you learn more about your web pages ’ performance .
It has a feature called Site Overlay , which gives you a visual representation of the popular places your users like to click on .
It also offers data on bounce rates and your top exit pages ( to see what pages make users leave ) .
So there they are , some of the best tools in the market to help you troubleshoot and optimize your page layout .
In the end , it ’s a combination of great content , as well as how you present this content — that will lead to an effective design .
No matter how far personal weaponry advances , the last line of defence has remained the same .
If a threat gets really up close and personal , divers , soldiers , campers and hunters all have to rely on their trusty knife when all else has failed .
The trouble is , if your shark , elephant or enemy combatant is close enough for you to stab them , they 're well within range to lay some serious hurt on you if your knife aim is n't true - and there are plenty of angry animals out there capable of disposing of you even with a blade hanging out of them .
That 's why WASP have created the Injector Knife , which forces a massive charge of freezing compressed air into the stab wound .
WASP claims the shock and tissue freezing can stop the largest of land predators in its tracks , and it 's even more effective on underwater predators .
The WASP knife is fairly simple in principle ; the removable handle contains a bulb of compressed gas , and there 's a thumb button which releases that gas almost instantly through a thin tube that exits near the point of the blade .
The gas is expelled at around 850 psi of pressure , and expands to around the size of a basketball inside whatever the knife has been poked into .
The handle unscrews to fit new gas bulbs , and it 's easy to carry more than one handle if there 's the chance that the knife 's lethal charge could be needed more than once in relatively quick succession .
The initial gas release is extremely cold , and can snap - freeze all tissue and organs in the area surrounding the blast , which has a devastating and instant effect on the hapless victim .
The effect is compounded if used on an underwater predator - not only is there the instant shock and freezing effect , but the large injection of air causes the recipient to float upwards , and as it rises and the atmospheric pressure decreases , the ball of air continues to expand with catastrophic consequences .
The WASP Injector Knife is also virtually silent when discharged inside an enemy 's flesh - not that the enemy can be expected to remain silent through such internal trauma - but it effectively maintains the knife 's potential as a stealth killing option while massively multiplying its lethality .
The WASP Injector Knife system is available through the WASP website for US$ 380 .
It 's still a last resort for when all else has failed and a big , nasty threat is virtually upon you - and you 'll still need to be smuggling coconuts in your shorts to have the nerve to stab and hit that button at the right moment - but if I was standing there with a knife in my hand and an angry brown bear advancing on me , I 'd want that knife to be one of these .
Here 's a video of the knife in action .
SAO PAULO , Brazil ( AP ) 
A subsidiary of U.S. military security contractor Blackwater Worldwide has purchased a fighter plane from the Brazilian aviation company Embraer , a Brazilian newspaper reported Sunday .
The 314 - B1 Super Tucano propeller - driven fighter — the same used by the Brazilian military — was bought for $ 4.5 million and delivered to EP Aviation at the end of February , according to the Estado de S. Paulo newspaper .
The report included the plane 's registration number with the U.S. Federal Aviation Agency , and the FAA website confirmed it is registered by EP Aviation .
It was not clear if it was Embraer 's first sale of a military - style aircraft to a private company .
EP Aviation has 33 planes and helicopters registered with the FAA , according to the agency 's website , only one of which is from Embraer .
Officials with Brazil 's government and Embraer declined to comment on the Estado report .
Phone calls to Blackwater were not returned .
The sale was apparently approved , the Estado report noted , by Brazil 's president in a deal negotiated with the U.S. government .
Brazilian law prohibits the sale of arms to companies or for use in existing conflicts .
The newspaper reported that Blackwater president Gary Jackson said the plane would be used for training .
The plane sold to EP Aviation did not include the two .50 - caliber machine guns normally attached to the wings .
Blackwater , the largest private security company in the world , has been under scrutiny as a U.S. federal grand jury investigates its involvement in the shooting deaths of 17 Iraqi civilians .
Blackwater also is under investigation for possible weapons smuggling allegations — violations the company denies .

Following accusations that PC titleused assets taken fromand , among other games , publisher Tri Synergy has discontinued distribution of the game .
The company claims it had no knowledge that developer Majestic Studios reused the level designs and artwork without permission .
The company claims that it is " shocked " by recent screenshot comparisons from gaming communities GamePlasma and NeoGAF that allegedly show using level designs and artwork originally from a multitude of other games .
The adventure game , which uses 2D screenshots of environments for its backdrops , seems to include pictures of games including , and other titles .
According to Tri Synergy , at no point during its dealings with Majestic Studios did the publisher have any knowledge of these similarities .
Tri Synergy has states that it has contacted Majestic and that it is awaiting the studio's response .
Tri Synergy plans to release another statement once they know more about the alleged asset theft .
UK - based developer and publisher G2 Games , publisher in Europe , has yet to comment on the accusations .
As Ted Rogers ' promise to come to tea was splashed across the front page of the Globe and Mail on December 19 , 2005 , many Canadians have assumed that Ted would honour his commitment - or already has .
Even a cartoonist at the Globe and Mail was anticipating how many lumps
Ted would take .
On March 1 , 2006 , the Globe published the following Back Bench cartoon in the comics of the review section :
Ted Rogers never did come to tea .
Presumably Rogers ' PR department figured that his promise to do so was sufficient unto the day .
Tea is still being served : Tea without Ted .
Many Canadians also assumed that the debacle between Rogers and me was over when Rogers and Ted apologized in the national media over the weekend that the story broke about his cell phone having been cloned by a group linked with Hezbollah .
In fact , I had sued Rogers in Small Claims Court way back in September of 2005 , three months before Rogers CEO , Ted Rogers , called me on December 17 , 2005 and left a message on my home phone apologizing for the inexcusable way that his corporation had treated me .
I had two Rogers phones : the one that was stolen in the summer of 2005 , and a cell phone I got for my son so he could safely take public transit to school .
I sued Rogers because the corporation shut off my then - 10 year old son's cell phone just days before he took the Toronto subway for the first time in his life - and a full 8 days before my bill was due - because I was n't " promising to pay " Rogers over $ 14,000 for calls made on my stolen cell phone .
The trial for that law suit was held over two days in late February , 2007 .
The written reasons for judgment were delivered a month later , in March of 2007 .
In a nutshell , the judge ordered Rogers to compensate me for the purchase of a Bell Mobility phone ; ordered Rogers to compensate me for driving my son back and forth to school for three days ( soccer moms of the world rejoice ! ! ) ; and the judge ordered Rogers to pay me $ 2,000 in punitive damages for having immorally , egregiously , and maliciously shut off my young son's cell phone in their efforts to force me to pay over $ 14,000 for calls that I never made .
As a law professor , and a legal anthropologist by specialization , I decided to use the substantial delays in the Canadian court system to turn my dispute with Rogers into a research project .
This web site was set up in the spring of 2006 to facilitate that research project .
The overall content can be accessed by way of the Table of Contents , at which I provide the reader of this web site with a synoptic overview of the issues and themes that I cover .
At the Table of Contents , the reader can manoeuvre throughout the web site at their pleasure and according to their whimsies .
For some of the files on this web site , you will need to have access to Quickplace and Adobe 7
If you do not already have these programs on your computer , you can download the from Quickplace and Abobe .
The following is a breakdown in prose form of the objectives of both my research and the various aims and aspirations of this web site .
It serves as an introduction to the web site as a whole .
The first five headings of the introduction correspond to the five main headings on the Table of Contents " :
1 . Once upon a time ... ( The story in a nutshell ) 2 . The Scoop ( Media coverage ) 3 . Rogers and You ( Consumer issues and participation ) 4 . Rogers and Me : The Law Suit " ( History of Me v. Rogers Wireless Inc. ) 5 . Rogers and Me : The Legal Ethnography " ( Rogers and Me as an object of study )
Before laying bare the various levels at which this web site is intended to operate , let me point out a recurring theme that runs throughout it : the relationship between law and social justice .
As social justice is , or ( let me underline this clearly as a law professor ) ought to be , one of the recurring themes in the law and its practice , I have invoked two familiar and primitive figures to metaphorically encapsulate that ideal relationship between social justice and the law : Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf .
The flip side of the napkin : a children 's story
J.J.Robinette , one of Canada 's most famous trial lawyers , once advised aspiring young lawyers that if he or she could n't reduce their legal argument to a pleading that could be written on the back of a napkin , their case case was sunk .
Neither Rogers nor I have followed that advice in small claims court .
It might be worth a trip to small claims court in Toronto , along with the $ 10 fee the court charges the public to look at a court file , just to visually take in the significant volume of filings that both sides have generated in this case .
It is no exaggeration to say that the file weighs 15 lbs and has the visual depth of 5 print volumes of the printed Toronto phone directory .
At one point , Rogers had taken to serving me with four hefty volumes of motion materials at a shot .
You'd have to know that most small claims court filings are hand - written on one page , at most two , of a court form to appreciate just how terribly seriously Rogers took this wee little small claims court case .
In lieu , then , of that napkin back , I submit ( for this web site ) an analogous reduction , a la J.J. Robinette , of my legal argument to a children 's bed time tale .
At the most basic level , rogersandme.ca recounts a morality tale , and one that should be accessible to the simplest amongst us .
This web site recounts a story about an old and familiar villain and a vulnerable , yet , insouciant protagonist .
1 . Once upon a time ...
Because Rogers punitively shut off my young son's cell phone just days before he was about to embark on his first solo journey through the dark and forbidding forest of the Toronto Subway System , I feel some fidelity to the child 's perspective in this recounting .
I have therefore set a children 's fairy tale running as a recurrent theme throughout the site : Little Red Riding Hood .
This telling of the oft recounted story , however , is a refreshing take on the gripping tension between the vulnerable and powerful : I 've adopted Phillippe Corentin 's Mademoiselle Sauve - qui- peut ( or Little Miss Run - for - your - lives ) as the running motif of this morality tale .
I have tried to invoke Corentin 's outlandish little character with good humour ; however I 'm not sure that I have been able to escape the lure of the engagingly bratty and childish Little Miss Run - for - your - lives .
She crosses all boundaries with impunity , aggravating all in her path with her apparent obliviousness to the rules and established norms of conduct , and her apparently complete indifference to decorum .
Little Miss Run - for - your - lives appears to be the antithesis of the conventional lawyer , that properly suited and stodgy officer of the court .
And yet , she also appears to be the embodiment of Pierre Bourdieu 's transcultural definition of excellence : one who plays the game according to the rules , right up to the point of transgression , all the while remaining wholly within the rules .
For lawyers and law students driven by a vision of social justice , Little Miss Run - for - your - lives appears to be the embodiment of the requisite spirit for the undertaking .
I do have some sympathy for the corporate lawyers and other stolid types who stumble across Little Miss Run - for - your - lives ' path : her approach to the law is both vexatious and exhausting and forever abruptly and rudely shoving the discourse onto unpredictable tracks .
Yes indeed : I feel sympathy for corporate lawyers and their kin , and indeed even for that crusty old villain Ted Rogers - in the same way that Corentin 's tale invites us to have some sympathy for the poor old wolf with his perpetual shadow of a bad rap .
While Little Miss Run - for - your - lives runs through the web site speaking to the child ( or , if you prefer , the childish ) in all of us , beyond my translation and partial reproduction of Corentin 's children 's book , this web site is not particularly directed to an audience of children .
The web site operates at an essential level as a morality tale , but it also operates at several other levels as well :
2. Rogers and Me : The Scoop
At a second level , this web site summarizes the events relating to my debacle with Rogers .
It is here that I have posted the media coverage relating to Rogers and me .
And I 've attempted to provide some ongoing narrative regarding developments and breaking news so that the ordinary reader , curious about what happened in my legal dispute with Rogers , can track the story as it emerged .
I 've also posted here the entire conversation between Harry Gefen and the head of Rogers ' Law Enforcement Department that prompted the original story in the Globe and Mail on December 17 , 2005 and that provoked Ted Rogers to call and leave an apology on my home phone .
The conversation is posted as an audio - recording but is also available as a transcribed conversation .
3. Rogers and You
At a third level , this web site is an informational hub for Rogers ' consumers seeking and giving advice and tips about how to deal with a telecommunications giant with vastly asymmetrical amounts of bargaining , financial , and legal power .
While I have posted my own suggestions about consumer recourses , and taken a stab at Rogers ' frankly impenetrable consumer contract , I am also interested in hearing from consumers about how they have effectively dealt with the corporation .
I have provided a means by which readers can submit their experiences with Rogers ( chatter ) and a place where these contributions can be read ( gossip ) by other visitors .
The contributions to this web site must be true and any opinions offered must be honestly held .
The truth and honest opinion are the means by which contributors and I can protect ourselves from a libel suit from Rogers ( and simultaneously remain ethical beings ) .
It bears noting that I have a fair deal of evidence ( entered repeatedly , as it happens , into the court record ) that both Rogers and its lawyers are PLENTY bothered by this web site .
Unless contributors ask to be identified by name , I will post all comments anonymously and I will take every measure consistent with the law to protect contributors ' confidentiality .
As this web site forms part of a larger research project , I would also like to use readers ' contributions as a way to provide a more fulsome picture of Rogers ' relationships with consumers .
Confidentiality and anonymity will also be preserved for this larger project .
If you submit a contribution to the web site , please also indicate whether you have objections to this secondary use of your contribution .
4. Rogers and Me : The Law Suit
At a fourth level , I have provided an ongoing narrative for the specific legal dispute in Small Claims Court in which I was engaged with Rogers .
I have attempted to address , in this section , the various legal themes and issues that arose in my case .
Some of the material presents legal arguments by way of reference to statute and case law .
But I have tried to bathe the legal material in a plain language prose context that makes it as accessible as possible to the non-legally trained reader .
Where I 've used a legal term or concept that a non-lawyer might have difficulty understanding , I 've tried to provide links accessible on the World Wide Web ( often to Wikipedia ) with a plain language definition or exposé .
While Rogers ' standard form consumer contract is written in small print and uses legalese that is virtually incomprehensible to the ordinary consumer , I have made every effort to ensure my writings about law are transparent and easily understood .
If you have difficulty understanding a legal term or argument that I have used , I would appreciate hearing from you ( submit a question or comment to chatter ) and I will do my best to clarify things on the web site .
Please note , however , that I am not a lawyer and so I cannot give legal advice about specific disputes .
Further , the legal content of this web site should not be taken as legal advice .
5. Rogers and Me : The Legal Ethnography
At a fifth level , I have set aside a place where I lay out my observations of Rogers as an object of ethnographic inquiry .
It is at this location that I provide a brief overview of the objectives and approaches of this research project .
I have transformed my legal dispute with Rogers , and my interactions with the corporation , into a fieldwork site for the observation of how corporations interact with consumers through their use of both formal and informal law .
As the tale about my legal dispute with Rogers emerged , I posted brief essays containing my observations .
Some of these writings are rough and not very far removed from raw field notes ; others are slightly more refined and reflective .
Again , I have tried to maintain an accessible style of writing through this last , and more theoretical , level of the web site .
Where I 've used terms of art , I 've done my best to provide publicly accessible links that provide a more elaborate explanation about their meaning .
LAYERS OF LEGAL UNDERSTANDING
Understanding the Law
I am aware that a Princeton professor has been using this Rogers and Me story to teach a course about information technology and public policy .
A political philosophy professor at Memorial University in Newfoundland told me she uses the site as a teaching instrument for understanding moral philosophy in its contemporary context .
And a professor at Carleton is supervising a graduate law student attempting to understand consumer activism through ( amongst other things ) this web story .
But I have also been told that several of my colleagues who teach at law schools across Canada have begun using the web site as a pedagogical tool in their classrooms to teach a range of subjects from alternative dispute resolution to contract law .
It is also towards this latter level of doctrinal legal intrigue that this web site is also pitched .
Law professors typically pursue one of three types of scholarly writing in their professional careers :
i ) One form of legal academic writing looks at law as a phenomenon and studies it from this detached vantage , analyzing law as an object , for example , of theoretical or social or anthropological or political study .
The aspect of this research project that is devoted to examining Rogers as a law - and - society case study fits into that research paradigm .
ii ) A second type of legal academic writing focuses on law reform , picking up on lacunas and jarring dissonances between law and society , and proposing ways that governments could make the law better correspond to society 's needs .
There is a good deal of this web site that explicitly or implicitly suggests ways that our governments could reform the legal system so that consumer needs are more fairly addressed , on a more level playing field with gargantuan corporations .
For example , this web site implicitly advocates that Ontario should adopt Quebec 's model for small claims court which excludes lawyers and collection agencies from the court in order to protect the vulnerabilities of the unrepresented parties who constitute the bulk of small claims court litigants .
That is one example of law reform oriented scholarship in action .
iii )
A third type of legal research is devoted to what , in the scientific field , might be called the pure sciences : those research endeavours that do not necessarily bring about practical changes in the world of medicine or generate new patents but which are nevertheless foundational for the development of these more practical applications .
Legal scholars sometimes undertake legal analysis of doctrines , legal institutions , and jurisprudence in order to explicate more robustly the black letter law in a particular field .
This web site also operates as a piece of doctrinal legal writing , in the third paradigm of legal research .
This type of analysis of the black letter law forms a substantial part of what we teach law students across Canada .
Law students need to know how to draft and interpret a contract ; and how to assist clients who have contractual problems , or have suffered damages that might fit into a legally recognized category .
Layers and Layers
There may indeed be other levels at which this web site operates .
For instance at the outer margins of the web site , I 've linked out to peripherally related material , much of it , like the internet as a whole , perpetually renewing and re-arranging itself as unpredictably as gossip .
I understand also that others have started to create links to this site which adds to it whole other layers of intertextuality , generating unpredictable new levels of meaning .
While I have provided a more or less stable structure of meaning for this web site , that structure vibrates with these destabilizing elements .
And of course , this web site , and the research project that surrounds it , had a law suit at the eye of its vortex , a law suit that was unfolding in real time ; a law suit in which I was pitted against a very powerful and cunning adversary , which owns a sizeable chunk of the Canadian media , represented by a formidable legal team and a well - endowed public relations department , both of which were apparently interacting quite actively with the web site and its implications .
As the web site was unfolding with the law suit at its vortex , I was aware that at any turn I could have been foiled , or boiled alive in legals , and my actions re-interpreted and uber - spun by powerful media machine .
As this web site persists ( and as it presumably remains an open irritant to Rogers and Rogers ' legal team ) , its cheery tea - time - on - the - lawn motif continues to be menaced by dark figures furtively lurking behind the trees at the margins .
Having access to my web stats , I have a fair idea about who is watching from beyond the edge of the forest and with what regularity .
As Rogers received an inglorious " whack " from the courts ( to use the language of the leading Supreme Court case on punitive damages ) I suppose I should live , myself , in anticipation of a SLAPP - and then the story that has thus far settled will be perturbed again by another tussle between us using our respective arsenals of formal and informal law .
This web site , then , weaves an incomplete web .
Its threads expand ; they may be rended .
I am still relatively close to the tangle ; and some of the occult levels of meaning and import hovering about this web site , are not yet fully accessible to me .
The Architecture of this Web Site as a Whole
Throughout this web project , then , I have tried to create a web site that is accessible in its entirety to the demographic that read the original Globe and Mail article about Rogers and me that appeared on December 17 , 2005 .
I have tried to make plain language the prevailing writing style of the web site .
But I have layered the web site for those who come to it with different interests and differing levels of curiosity :
1 ) those who want consumer information and who want to share their Rogers ' experiences with a community of like - minded consumers and web surfers ; 2 ) those who want an overview of this Rogers and me story ; 3 ) those who are curious about the legal dimensions of the dispute between Rogers and me ; 4 ) those who are curious about Rogers as an object of ethnographic inquiry ; 5 ) and those who have a doctrinal interest in the law that relates to my dispute with Rogers and to this web site .
Inevitably , while I have tried to segregate the material on the web site so that it is designed to reach audiences that bring distinct interests and inquiries , there will be overlaps between each level of inquiry .
Sometimes this will happen as links on the pages of one level bleed onto the pages of another .
And sometimes material might be grouped at several levels simultaneously .
For example , an experience that a reader contributes to the " Rogers and You " section may well be analyzed from an ethnographic point of view in the " Legal Ethnographies " section .
Or a story about my law suit with Rogers might turn up in " The Scoop " section .
Rogers and Me : The Book
All of the materials on this web site will eventually be grouped together and groomed for a more coherent presentation on a contemporary legal - sociological phenomenon : the telecommunications giant .
Although this web site is a research project - in - progress , I am eventually planning to collect all of the materials on this web site and synthesize them into an academic book using Rogers as my case study .
The book should emerge out of scholarly reflection upon all that is reposed upon this web site and all of the nebulous material that hovers about it in the form of conversations and emails I 've had with a huge range of people about my debacle with Rogers .
It will also be constituted out of what librarians would call my " grey literature " on Rogers : the boxes of loose documents , reports , related laws , and legal articles that have accumulated in my study , and the copious lists of internet bookmarks pointing to related links .
Crowded though my research space has become , I welcome further contributions that might fill out my perspective on Rogers .
" Rogers and Me : The Book " does not yet , therefore , have a full blown presence on this web site , except in incipient form .
The visitor to this web site is free to decipher the book 's eventual meaning and content between the cracks and lines of this web site ; and I would be delighted to hear how others make sense of this whole experience .
On the Record / Off the Record
With postings to the web site and in any eventual use made of contributions to it , I will not publish any identifying information regarding any comment that is submitted and the confidentiality of contributors will be protected to the maximum extent provided by law .
On the other hand ...
Rogers has complained to small claims court several times in its court pleadings that I have set up this web site .
The Vice President of Rogers Communications Department has gone so far as to swear an affidavit attesting to her knowledge of the web site 's existence .
Rogers ' legal team desperately tried to make an issue out of the web site at the trial ( to no avail ) .
None of Rogers ' legal pleadings assert a cause of action that would elevate these complaints to any more than disgruntled grumblings about negative publicity .
The
Small Claims
Court judge cried no river alongside Ted Rogers and his legal team ; in fact her response to Rogers ' legal whining about consumer internet advocacy was something along the lines of a irate school marm teaching a tattling brat the " sticks and stones will break my bones ... " refrain .
While I am confident that I have violated no laws with this web site , and while it has been Rogers and not me that persistently drew the court 's attention to its existence , I am also confident that Rogers could not be more fully apprised of the fact that this web site exists and that comments made by Rogers personnel , as well as the lawyers associated with my small claims dispute , are comments made " on the record " .
After all , they 're being paid the big bucks to manage disputes for Rogers , both in the courts , and in the public eye .
While Ted Rogers ' apology did not bring an end to my dispute with Rogers , I am also of the firm conviction that when Ted Rogers called my home phone and left a message on my answering machine on December 17 , 2005 , he was fully aware that that message was thereby entering the public record :
Throughout the day on December 17 , Rogers was attempting to get a hold of me to stop me from doing further damage by expanding my commentary in the media .
Indeed , inundated by calls from the national media on the day that the Globe and Mail story broke , Ted Rogers called me on my cell phone as I was on my way to CBC and CTV television to give interviews .
Because I was in the car and it was not therefore safe to speak on the cell phone , I told Ted Rogers to call my home phone and leave a message .
Throughout that day , as journalists were calling Rogers ' corporate communications department for a comment on the Globe and Mail story , Rogers informed reporters that the corporation was attempting to get a hold of me to apologize .
Rogers had to settle , in others words , with telling the media that their efforts at damage control were still just an " attempt " to apologize ; it was this " attempt " to apologize that was reported on national radio and television throughout the day .
In the media - intense circumstances of December 17 , 2005 , a figure as public as Ted Rogers could have no expectation of privacy in a recorded message left on my home phone .
I am indeed certain that Ted Rogers and his corporation would have liked nothing better than for me to announce at the earliest possible moment to the media that Ted Rogers had fully executed his apology and cleared the air a trifle .
This would have enabled Rogers to bring the story to a close and to manage damage control at the corporation 's own pace .
By leaving a message on my home answering machine on December 17 , 2005 Rogers chose to enter Ted Rogers ' apology into the public domain .
And it is there that it is now reposed , tightly wrapped at the specific location on the World Wide Web that is constituted by this web site .
Like most things on the net , it will eventually blow away on the winds of time , along with the threads of this tale .
In the meantime , Rogers and Me is a hub of meaning dedicated to catching the heft of a big plump corporation marauding its way through early 21st century Canadian law and society .
Feedback
Questions and comments about this web site or the overall research project of which it forms a part are most welcome and can be submitted to me , off the record , at chatter .
While writers of academic books and articles are almost universally provided copy and content editors to ensure that they do n't commit an idiocy in print , this web site relies upon your generosity in providing me with feedback regarding how to improve its style , tone , architecture , and content - and also regarding typos , spelling , and grammar .
Tea Without Ted
Ted Rogers still has n't take up his comittment to come to tea .
But you 're invited to Tea without Ted .

How to Find Passion in Your Job
Photo by Kara Pecknold
Are you in a stage of loving your life so much that you would pay money to live it ?
If not ?
What can you do about it ?
A common question asked is , “ I really want to feel that way , but I ’m just not passionate about anything .
How do I find passion ? ”
A friend of mine asked me that question a few weeks ago .
He has a high paying job and what appears to lead a full and fulfilling life , complete with volunteering and interesting hobbies .
But he felt that something was still missing .
He was looking for his purpose and genuinely wanted to find his passion .
“ I like a lot of things , but I do n’t have any passions .
How can I find passion , Tina ? ”
This is a great question , and one that got me pondering about the topic .
This article specifically looks at finding passion in your job .
This is part two of my notes from Professor Srikumar Rao ‘s google talk , along with my personal thoughts on the topic .
You can find part one here : How to Make Profound and Lasting Change .
The Problem
Most of us make the mistake of assuming that our ideal job is out there somewhere , and we have to go out and find it .
We tell ourselves that our lives will be great , just as soon as we find it .
As a result , we end up defining our ideal job using a widely accepted , but arbitrary , set of parameters .
How much the job pays , job title on your business card , type of person our boss is , size of our office , how much we get to travel .
We say in our minds , once I can find that , then I can be passionate about my job .
Chances are , that job probably does n’t exist .
Assuming that it did exist and we were put into that situation , within a few months , we will probably be back in the same state we are now .
Unsatisfied .
The Secret to Passion
Passion do not exist in the job , it exists within us .
Either we find it in us right where we are , or we will never find it .
Only within us , can the passions of our soul shine through .
The best place to start igniting that passion , is where you are , right now .
The beautiful thing is that if you ignite passion within you from where you are , the external world has a miraculous and magnificent way of rearranging itself to suit the new person you are becoming .
The Unhappiness Spiral
Every time we are unhappy with what we are doing , or we feel frustrated , angry or disappointed , two things are always true :
We are concentrating exclusively on the two or three things that are wrong with the job .
We ignore the 30 or 40 things that are pretty good about it .
We are living completely in a Me Centered Universe .
We tell ourselves , “ Oh , poor me .
Poor me .
How unfair this situation is . ”
We start to view our lives as if everything existed as to make things more difficult for us .
We focus entirely on how the world affects us .
It is impossible to live a truly fulfilled life if we are living exclusively in a Me Centered Universe .
Exercise : How to Find Passion in Your Job
We all have the innate power to transform ourselves and our life situations for the better .
Most of the time , it is as simple as a shift in our perspective .
The following is an exercise to help us get out of that space consumed with negativity about our present situation .
The exercise is tailored to finding passion in your job , but it really applies to every area of life .
Take a notebook with you at all times .
Systematically noting down things that are pretty darn good about your job .
Things you enjoy .
Things you are grateful for .
Co-workers you like .
Take one thing from this list that is important to you and significant to the company .
Come up with a simple one month project where you will be increasing that component in your daily life .
Example , if you work with a few pleasant customers , then the project could be : how to get more customers like that ?
Or , how to get our current customers to be like that ?
Or , how to get more work with those pleasant customers ?
Do something every day to help you accomplish your projects goal .
It ’s best to do this in the morning as a priority item , but anytime during the day will give you a boost .
Evaluate your progress at the end of the month .
Give yourself more time if you need .
Through actively practicing the exercise above , you will discover that there is an enormous amount that is great about your job and your present situation .
The act of noting down the things you like , will take you to a different space .
If you continue with points 3 - 5 consistently , by the end of the year , you will have completed as many as 6 projects that are important to you and are significant to the company .
This exercise forces you change what you focus on , which changes your perspective and outlook .
You will find that you are no longer in the job you dreaded , your entire professional life has changed and your ideal job has grown around you .
Recognize that you were the creator of that ideal job and the creator for this positive space you are currently living in .
Parting Words
Sometimes , we spend so much of our free time thinking about how much we dislike our current situation that we forget that what we repeat in our heads becomes our reality .
The more we repeat that story , the more we reinforce that story .
As we reinforce the story , we identify with it and it changes your perspective .
What we often do not realize is that these stories we tell ourselves are hurting us .
One of the best gifts we can give ourselves is to recognize that we are not our stories , and to becoming aware of when our mind chatter starts telling these stories .
We are never as stuck as we think .
We are never as ‘ incompetent ’ as we think .
We are never as insecure as our minds have us believe .
Practice being the observer to your mind , thoughts and stories .
What is one aspect of your job or life situation that you are unhappy about ?
What are some things ( name several ) you enjoy about your job or life situation ?
Share your thoughts with us in the comments below .
See you there !

DHS ignores civil liberties in domestic spy satellite plan , lawmakers say Nick Juliano
Published : Monday April 7 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Homeland Security Committee members fault Chertoff for delaying legal framework for new office A controversial plan that would allow domestic law enforcement agencies to use data gathered by US spy satellites still lacks necessary civil liberties and privacy protections , and three Democratic lawmakers are urging Department of Homeland Security Chair Michael Chertoff to established a legal framework for the new plan he promised six months ago .
DHS plans to create a new office that would expand law enforcement and other civilian agencies ' access to data gathered by powerful intelligence and military satellites orbiting the earth .
The National Applications Office will oversee who can access such satellite data , which is typically used to monitor climate change and track hurricane damage , among other uses .
DHS still has not laid out legal frameworks or standard operating procedures for the office , according to a letter from three members of the House Homeland Security Committee .
" We recently learned that the Department has begun to advertise for positions at the NAO .
While we applaud the Department 's efforts to prepare for the future , we are disappointed by its continuing pattern of putting the cart before the horse , " wrote Reps .
Bennie G. Thompson , the committee 's chair ; Jane Harman , chair of an intelligence subcommittee ; and Christopher P. Carney , chair of an oversight subcommittee .
The lawmakers said they were concerned about the " privacy and civil liberties challenges " posed by the domestic satellite program .
They said a legal framework for the program was missing from the NAO 's charter , which " had been finalized without any input from this committee ... or the privacy and civil liberties community .
" Instead of crafting a privacy and civil liberties solution for the Department 's NAO law enforcement customers or updating us about a summer date for its completion , the NAO Charter now makes clear that this critical undertaking will be postponed until an unspecified time in the future , " they write .
" This is unacceptable . "
The domestic spy satellite plan was first proposed last August , and its expected launch in October was delayed because of privacy concerns .
The lawmakers ' letter , which was sent Monday , makes clear those concerns remain .
Although we support any Department effort to engage in more effective and responsive information sharing with our nation 's first preventers , the serious privacy and civil liberties issues that the NAO raises are manifold and multifaceted .
Doing business with the NAO 's law enforcement and other customers therefore requires a robust and detailed legal framework and SOPs that provide clearly defined privacy and civil liberties safeguards .
Merely mentioning Posse Comitatus and other laws in the NAO Charter does not provide needed assurances that the Department will not transform NAO into a domestic spying platform .
Furthermore , delaying the hard work of addressing the privacy and civil liberties issues specific to law enforcement customers further erodes our confidence that you are serious about serving their needs .
It 's frankly time for the Department to lead on privacy and civil liberties in this area -- not shirk a difficult duty .
The NAO would expand access to data gathered by Measurement and Signal Intelligence ( MASINT ) satellites , which according to reports use radar and infrared imaging technologies to see through cloud cover , forest canopies and even concrete barriers .
Allowing local police forces access to such data raises substantial questions about whether the door to 4th Amendment violations is being flung open .
A Congressional Research Service report prepared last month outlined some of these concerns .
It concluded that privacy concerns were likely to be dependent upon the type of technology used .
That , the lawmakers said in their letter Monday , has still not been clarified by DHS .
( A previous version of this story incorrectly defined MASINT as " Mass Intelligence . "
The error has been corrected .
RAW STORY regrets the error . )

Patrick Dempsey vs Gerard Butler ( Photos )
Who would you rather see as the face of Versace - or ?
Well , that is the big question looming .
Dempsey is currently Versace 's face of the menswear line , but there is talk thatis looking at changing this up a bit .
A source talked to OK !
and said :
" Ironically , Gerard is most famous for a role in which he practically wore no clothes , but he 'll be a much better fit for the sexy brand . "
Gerard was personally invited by Donatella to Milan for the runway show on June 21st .
She is said the be the only woman trying to keep his clothes on , not take them off .
Personally , we have no preference as they are great looking men and both would do the men 's line plenty of justice .
Time will tell if Gerard will take over .
At this point a Versace rep is denying the rumor .

Four Tools to Take Control of Your Life
In the first two articles in this series , we explored seven ways that choice becomes a burden and a problem in your life .
Then , in the third article , we introduced three tools you can use to overcome those seven problems , and get back control of your life .
Here , we present four more tools to master the problems of choice .
The First Tool : Define Yourself !
Consider the three areas of :
Being ( who you are , including character and attitudes )
Having ( including possessions and knowledge ) Doing ( your actions , and the skills that enable you to act )
You define yourself , and let others judge you , according to a combination of the things you have , the activities you do , and the kind of person that you are .
You enrich or burden your life through the standards and goals you set for yourself in each of the three areas .
This is key to personal growth .
Any religious , spiritual , or moral teaching speaks about appropriate standards or goals for each of three areas .
But the details of each area , and the right balance of those three is up to you figure out .
Among the three , defining yourself by what you possess probably causes you the most trouble .
I ’m not suggesting that you give up possessions and go live in a cave .
But there ’s a big difference between enjoying your possessions , and defining yourself by them .
Some people try to escape the challenges of possessions by simplifying their life , and eliminating certain things from their life .
That ’s because it ’s often easier to go cold turkey , and stay away from something , then to use it in moderation .
But most of us do n’t want to live in a black and white , all or nothing world .
And everyone needs to learn to choose among conflicting desires .
There will always be many things around us , competing for our attention .
Let the important and necessary goals and actions dominate your time and life , while the little stuff remains in the background .
Remember that how you define yourself will determines which choices will be most important to you , and will take your time and attention .
The Second Tool : Use the Help of Experts To Learn and Make Decisions
Do you know what you ’re weak at , or ignorant about ?
That gives you some clues to when you ’ll need help .
We live in a time when information is everywhere .
For information junkies , it ’s a wonderful time .
The Internet is full of free information .
But we ’re also surrounded by information products .
These products are often sold with the message that “ all you need is information ” .
News media also market themselves with that same message .
But do n’t confuse possessing information ( even if it is completely accurate ) , with knowing how to use it to make decisions .
We often need time and real - world experience with a subject to understand the subtleties of it .
If you have a sick friend with a medical problem , for example , he has three needs :
Know about the full range of treatments
Find a medical professional who considers all possible treatments without bias
Understand ( in layman ’s terms ) the risks and advantages to various treatments
But your friend ca n’t expect to match the expertise of the person who is treating him .
At some point , your friend needs to rely on his doctor ’s judgment .
When you need skilled help to make important choices and decisions , do your homework and check out the expert .
Then let her advise you .
And , if you want to develop real expertise of your own in a field , understand that it will take the right information , the right mindset , and skills developed from using the information and making mistakes .
The Third Tool : Compare and Take Action
Earlier in the series , we spoke about the pitfalls of comparison .
But comparison can be a great motivator .
Seeing clearly the gap between where you are and where you want to be generates the energy to reach your goals .
And then there is the idea of modeling .
You find a person who is excellent in some field that you ’re interested in .
Then you identify his attitudes , skills , and knowledge that fuel that excellence .
Compare that to what you have , and take action to acquire similar attitudes , skills , and knowledge .
The Fourth Tool : Test Yourself With Action
Develop an action - oriented mindset .
Convince yourself that only action shows you what you really can do , and gives you the opportunity to improve .
Some people want to plan forever before taking action .
They want everything to be perfect .
That ’s not going to happen !
Instead , look for excellence , not perfection .
Plan enough to get a rough idea of what needs to be done , and have an absolutely clear picture of what you need to do first .
Take action .
Look at your results .
Some people think that the only meaningful results are when everything goes as planned .
We all want to achieve our goals .
But when our results do n’t match our expectations , we have an incredible opportunity to learn and grow .
Take action .
Understand and accept the value of your results .
And with those results in mind , think about your next step .
And so on .
When you hear an interesting idea , take it to the next level by thinking abut how you can use it .
Focus on one clear next step that moves you in the right direction .
And take action again .
Get on the electoral roll
When you sign up to your local Electoral Registration Office , two things happen :
You will become a registered voter for your address
There is an official record you live at your address
This improves your credit score , as lenders can easily identify where you live by accessing the electoral roll .
Use a credit card
This can help improve your credit score , especially if you pay off your balance after making a purchase on your credit card .
This helps build your credit score as it proves you can get into and out of debt , showing you are reliable when repaying what you owe .
However , you should avoid withdrawing cash from a credit card , as this will leave a mark on your credit record and cost you interest .
Never miss a repayment
If you miss a repayment on a credit card , loan or mortgage , it will get recorded on your credit history .
This will have a negative impact on your credit score , so make sure you have enough money to pay your bills each month to avoid this happening .
For credit card payments , consider setting up a direct debit that takes at least the minimum amount each month to avoid ever missing a repayment .
Check for credit record mistakes
Your credit score may be affected if information about your financial history is incorrect on your credit record .
Look for anything that is n't true , such as a wrong address or a missed payment that you had paid on time .
Check your credit record before you apply for any credit accounts to improve your chances of getting accepted .
Avoid payday loans
If you need to borrow money quickly , do not consider a payday loan unless you have no other options .
A payday loan application shows up on your credit record , and your credit score will get negatively affected even if you get accepted for the loan .
This is because payday loans indicate that you are desperate for money , and unable to get a cheaper alternative way of borrowing .
Avoid unauthorised overdrafts
Most current accounts let you go into a negative balance , also called an overdraft .
The type of overdraft you use can affect your credit score :
Authorised overdraft :
This is an agreed amount you can go into a negative balance .
There could be charges for using this but using it should not negatively affect your credit unless you are always in it .
Unauthorised overdraft :
This is when you go into a negative balance without your bank agreeing to it .
You will get charged daily , and this will appear on your credit record .
Contact your bank and ask for an authorised overdraft if you think you 'll need it , rather than going into an unauthorised overdraft .
Avoid too many applications
Your credit record will show every credit application you make .
If you get declined , avoid making a new application for a few months .
When you make multiple credit applications , you will appear as desperate for credit , which will affect your credit score .
People are talking about Erlang .
This talk is disproportionately about concurrency rather than any of the other powerful properties of the platform , such as reliability .
This article is about a property of Erlang which does not get the credit it deserves - Erlang is a fantastic workbench for Domain Specific Languages .
The domain I have chosen is investment finance .
You will see how easy it is to translate plain English at runtime and execute it in the Erlang Runtime System .
You may also learn a thing or two about functional programming .
The Erlang reference manual is a good place to start if you get lost along the way .
Let 's begin with a high level run through of how this DSL can be used and move into a step by step detailed discussion of the implementation .
$ # First , specify the business rules
$ echo " buy 9000 shares of GOOG when price is less than 500 " > biz_rules.txt
$ echo " sell 400 shares of MSFT when price is greater than 30 " >> biz_rules.txt
$ echo " buy 7000 shares of AAPL when price is less than 160 " >> biz_rules.txt
$ erl # start the Erlang emulator ( similar to irb or beanshell )
1> c( dsl ) . % compile and load , assumes dsl.erl is in the current directory
2> Pid = spawn ( fun ( ) -> dsl:broker ( ) end ) .
% start a broker in parallel
3 > Functions = dsl:load_biz_rules ( Pid , " biz_rules.txt " ) .
4> MarketData = [ { ' GOOG ' , 498} , {'MSFT ' , 30} , {'AAPL ' , 158} ] .
5 > dsl:apply_biz_rules ( Functions , MarketData ) .
Order placed : buying 9000 shares of ' GOOG '
Order placed : buying 7000 shares of ' AAPL '
Implementation
The first three echo commands create the file biz_rules .
txt , populating it with three rules .
The logic of these rules is very straight forward ; each is expressed no different than if it were coming from the mouth of a user who depends on it .
buy 9000 shares of GOOG when price is less than 500
sell 400 shares of MSFT when price is greater than 30
buy 7000 shares of AAPL when price is less than 160
Our DSL exists in an Erlang module called " dsl " , consisting of a single file called dsl.erl .
The first command in our erl session compiles and loads this module with the built in c function .
1>c( dsl ) . % compiles and loads , assumes dsl.erl is in the current directory
Spawning a Broker
The dsl module has a public function named broker .
broker ( ) ->
receive
{buy , Quantity , Ticker } ->
% place order to an external system here
%
Msg =
" Order placed : buying ~p shares of ~p " ,
io :format ( Msg , [ Quantity , Ticker ] ) ,
broker ( ) ;
{sell , Quantity , Ticker} ->
% place order to an external system here
%
Msg =
" Order placed : selling ~p shares of ~p " ,
io :format ( Msg , [ Quantity , Ticker ] ) ,
broker ( )
end .
The broker function simply waits for messages with iterative use of a receive block .
It can only receive two kinds of messages : a message to sell a stock or a message to buy a stock .
The actual implementation of placing an order has been ignored for demonstration purposes .
Notice that broker is tail recursive .
In an imperative programming language one might accomplish this with a loop .
In Erlang there is no need for loops because tail recursive functions are transparently optimized to run in constant space .
An Erlang developer is not tasked with the responsibility of manual memory management with keywords like " for " or " while " or " do " .
These three keywords are to the stack segment just as " malloc " and " dealloc " are to the heap segment ... unnecessary .
The second command given to the emulator spawns an anonymous function as an Erlang process and returns the process id .
The process id value is bound to the variable Pid .
2> Pid = spawn ( fun ( ) -> dsl:broker ( ) end ) .
% call broker in parallel
Anonymous functions begin and end with keywords ' fun ' and ' end ' in Erlang .
Pay attention when you see this because there will be lots of anonymous functions in this article .
This particular anonymous function is pretty simple : it wraps broker .
We are n't going to go into detail about the many interesting properties of an Erlang process .
Think of this as a separate independent path of execution for the time being .
This will be known as the broker process .
We will be placing orders to it via the process id returned by the built in spawn function .
One Way to Load Business Rules
Next we call load_biz_rules , another public function of the dsl module .
3 > Functions = dsl:load_biz_rules ( Pid , " biz_rules.txt " ) .
The arguments applied to the load_biz_rules are the broker process id and the file name containing business rules ; the return value is a list of Erlang functions .
You will see many examples of functions which return functions in this article .
This can be a little bit of speed bump for anyone new to functional programming .
If you can relate to this just remember that in an object oriented world it is normal for objects to create other objects and return them from methods - there are even design patterns for it , such as the Abstract Factory .
Each function element of the list returned by the load_biz_rules represents one of the loaded business rules echoed to biz_rules .
txt .
In an object oriented programming language these rules would most likely be modeled by a list of instances ; in Erlang we use functions .
load_biz_rules ( Pid , File ) ->
{ok , Bin } = file : read_file ( File ) ,
Rules = string : tokens( erlang:binary_to_list ( Bin ) , "
" ) ,
[ rule_to_function ( Pid , Rule ) || Rule <- Rules ] .
The load_biz_rules function begins by reading the file into memory .
The contents of this file are tokenized into a list of strings and bound to a list called Rules .
In Erlang the last line of a function is the implied return value ( just like Ruby ) and it always ends in a period .
The last line of load_biz_rules performs list comprehension to build and return a list of functions .
Readers familiar with list comprehension will recognize Rule >- Rules as the generator and rule_to_function ( Pid , Rule ) as the expression template .
What does this mean ?
It means we are creating a new list and populating it with transformed elements of the Rules list .
The rule_to_function function is the actual transformation .
In other words , the last line says " pass the broker process id and each Rule in Rules to rule_to_function ... give me a list of functions returned by rule_to_function " .
rule_to_function ( Pid , Rule ) ->
{ok , Scanned , _} = erl_scan : string ( Rule ) ,
[{ _ , _, Action} , {_ , _ , Quantity} , _, _|Tail ] = Scanned ,
[{ _ , _ , Ticker} , _ , _ , _ , {_ , _, Operator} , _ , {_ , _ , Limit} ] =
Tail ,
to_function ( Pid , Action , Quantity , Ticker , Operator , Limit ) .
The Rule string applied to rule_to_function is scanned into a tuple with the first line of code .
The next two lines use pattern matching to pick off the values required to enforce this rule when the returned function is actually executed .
Those values are bound to variables such Quantity or Ticker .
The broker process id and these five values are then applied to the to_function function .
A functional representation of the business rule is built and returned by to_function .
We 'll be looking at two implementations of to_function , starting with the more practical version .
to_function ( Pid , Action , Quantity , Ticker , Operator , Limit ) ->
fun ( Ticker_ , Price ) ->
if
Ticker =:= Ticker_ andalso
( ( Price < Limit andalso Operator =:= less ) orelse
( Price > Limit andalso Operator =:= greater ) ) ->
Pid !
{ Action , Quantity , Ticker } ; % place an order
true ->
erlang : display ( " no rule applied " )
end
end .
This version of to_function does one thing - it returns an anonymous function .
The anonymous function takes two market data as arguments : a ticker symbol and a price .
The ticker symbol and price that are applied to it ( when it is executed ) will be compared to the ticker symbol and price limit specified by the business rules ( when it is created ) .
If it finds a match , it uses the send operator ( the ! symbol ) to send a message to the broker process telling it to place an order .
Two Ways to Load Business Rules
The second version of to_function is a little academic .
It builds an Erlang expression in abstract form and returns an anonymous function which can dynamically evaluate it later .
to_function ( Pid , Action , Quantity , Ticker , Operator , Limit ) ->
Abstract = rule_to_abstract ( Action , Quantity , Ticker , Operator , Limit ) ,
fun( Ticker_ , Price ) ->
TickerBinding = erl_eval : add_binding ( ' Ticker ' , Ticker_ , erl_eval : new_bindings ( ) ) ,
PriceBindings = erl_eval : add_binding ( ' Price ' , Price , TickerBinding ) ,
Bindings = erl_eval : add_binding (' Pid ' , Pid , PriceBindings ) ,
erl_eval : exprs( Abstract , Bindings )
end .
The first line of this function delegates its dirty work to the rule_to_abstract function .
You probably should n't invest much time reading rule_to_abstract unless you are also a person who enjoys reading Perl .
rule_to_abstract( Action , Quantity , Ticker , Operator , Limit ) ->
Comparison = if Operator =:= greater -> '>' ; true -> ' <' end ,
[ {'if ' ,
1 ,
[ {clause , 1 , [ ] ,
[ [ {op , 1 ,
' andalso ' ,
{ op , 1 , '=:=' , {atom , 1 , Ticker} , {var, 1 , 'Ticker '}} ,
{op , 1 , Comparison , {var , 1 , 'Price'} , {integer , 1 , Limit}}} ] ] ,
[ {op , 1 ,
'! ' ,
{var , 1 , 'Pid'} ,
{tuple , 1 , [ {atom , 1 , Action} ,
{integer , 1 , Quantity} ,
{atom , 1 , Ticker} ] }} ]} ,
{ clause , 1 , [ ] ,
[ [ {atom , 1, true} ] ] ,
[ {call , 1 ,
{ remote , 1 , {atom , 1 , erlang} , {atom , 1 , display}} ,
[ {string , 1 , " no rule applied " } ] } ] } ]} ] .
The rule_to_abstract function builds and returns an Erlang control structure in abstract form .
This control structure is an ' if ' statement represented by a concrete list of plain Erlang terms .
As a side note , notice the abstract form uses postfix operator notation as opposed to infix notation used by regular Erlang syntax .
To conceptualize this for an individual rule , we are programmatically building the abstract form of the following :
if
Ticker =:= ‘ GOOG ’ andalso Price < 500 ->
Pid !
{ sell , 9000 , ‘ GOOG ’} ; % place order with broker
true ->
erlang : display ( " no rule applied " )
end
Once the business logic is obtained in abstract form within this version of to_function , it returns an anonymous function ( just like the first version of to_function ) .
Within this anonymous function three variables are pulled from execution scope and dynamically bound to the constructed expression via the built in function erl_eval : add_binding .
These values are the ticker symbol , price limit and process id .
The expression is finally executed with the built in erl_eval : exprs library function .
Applying Business Rules
Now that we have loaded our business rules and built Erlang functions for each of them , it is time to apply market data arguments to them .
A list of tuples represents these data .
Each tuple represents a pair of stock tickers and stock prices .
4> MarketData = [ { ' GOOG ' , 498} , {'MSFT ' , 30} , {'AAPL ' , 158} ] .
5 > dsl:apply_biz_rules ( Functions , MarketData ) .
We apply the business rules in function form and the market data to the apply_biz_rules function .
apply_biz_rules ( Functions , MarketData ) ->
lists : map ( fun ( {Ticker , Price} ) ->
lists : map ( fun( Function ) ->
Function ( Ticker , Price )
end , Functions )
end , MarketData ) .
It 's a very good thing we only have three business rules because the runtime for apply_biz_rules is exponential .
This algorithm can be a little hard to read for anyone who is unfamiliar with Erlang syntax and / or not paying attention .
The apply_biz_rules function maps an inner function to each ticker / price pair within the market data .
The inner function maps a second inner function to each business rule function .
The second inner function applies the ticker and price to the business rule function !
As apply_biz_rules evaluates the broker process indicates it has received orders to buy 9000 shares of Google and 7000 shares of Apple .
5 > dsl:apply_biz_rules ( Functions , MarketData ) .
Order placed : buying 9000 shares of ' GOOG '
Order placed : buying 7000 shares of ' AAPL '
It has not placed an order to buy or sell Microsoft .
A quick look back at the business rules and the market data indicate the program is behaving as expected .
buy 9000 shares of GOOG when price is less than 500
sell 400 shares of MSFT when price is greater than 30
buy 7000 shares of AAPL when price is less than 160
4> MarketData = [ { ' GOOG ' , 498} , {'MSFT ' , 30} , {'AAPL ' , 158} ] .
If the price of Google goes up seven dollars and we change our sell criteria for Microsoft , we observe different behavior .
sell 400 shares of MSFT when price is greater than 27
6 > UpdatedFunctions = dsl:load_biz_rules ( Pid , " new_biz_rules.txt " ) .
7> UpdatedMarketData = [ { ' GOOG ' , 505} , {'MSFT ' , 30} , {'AAPL ' , 158} ] .
8 > dsl:apply_biz_rules(UpdatedFunctions , UpdatedMarketData ) .
Order placed : selling 400 shares of ' MSFT '
Order placed : buying 7000 shares of ' AAPL '
Conclusion
I 'd like to reiterate my original point about Erlang .
This is a fantastic workbench for DSLs .
Anonymous functions , regular expression support and pattern matching are only the beginning .
Erlang also gives us programmatic access to the tokenized , parsed and abstract forms of an expression .
Observe Debasish Ghosh 's string lambdas in Erlang as another example .
I hope this article has helped some of you get out of your comfort zones with a new syntax and programming paradigm .
I also hope people with think twice before labeling Erlang a specialist language .

Enlarge Zinio.com SAN FRANCISCO 
The future of magazine publishing increasingly is appearing on a digital display — not just a newsstand .
Advancements in software and hardware are making it easier for a growing faction of consumers — including coveted younger readers called screen - agers — to read their favorite publications on the Internet or download and read them later offline .
" It 's not Jetsons .
It 's real , " says Richard Maggiotto , CEO of Zinio , one of a dozen or so companies that specialize in creating digital editions of magazines and newspapers .
" We are n't trying to erode print systems , but give publishers another way to redistribute their content , " he says .
" It gives readers what they want in media formats they are increasingly using , such as iPhone , iPod , PCs . "
The San Francisco - based Zinio and similar ventures could be a lifeline for the magazine and newspaper industries as readers — especially younger ones — migrate to the Internet and electronic devices to get their news .
Potentially , more may follow , with developments in " e- paper " technology .
E Ink and Plastic Logic are developing flexible screen technology that will let consumers read content in color while on the move , says David Renard , senior analyst at market researcher MediaIdeas .
By 2020 , e- paper will be a $ 25 billion industry , he says .
Amazon.com and Sony are among those that have created wireless reading devices .
Amazon 's Kindle lets people buy books and access other content over Sprint 's wireless broadband network .
Digital versions of magazines " are a far superior reading experience in that the website is endless .
There are billions of pages , where you can drift on tangents stemming from each story , " says Bo Sacks , publisher of consultant Precision Media Group .
The growing popularity of virtual magazines could be a panacea for foreign publishers — many of whom want to crack the U.S. market but are hindered by distance and mailing costs — and it extends the reach of American publications to rural areas , where many titles are hard to find .
" It 's a cost - efficient way to get an issue to a subscriber who wants it immediately , " says Peter Winn , a director in the consumer marketing department at Bonnier , which produces more than 40 magazines , including Field and Stream and Popular Science .
Zinio is at the vanguard of digital publishing .
It has created electronic versions of over 750 magazines , including BusinessWeek , Elle , Redbook , Playboy and Car and Driver .
Consumers access them from their PC , iPhone or iPod Touch anytime — before magazines hit newsstands .
Zinio gets a cut of sales as online distributor , Maggiotto says .
Consumers pay publishers for online editions — be it for a subscription , single issue or back issue .
The digital editions let readers click on links embedded in articles and ads to peruse video , audio and related stories .
That , no doubt , is pleasing the growing ranks of digital magazine subscribers .
To be sure , the electronic magazines take a little getting used to .
To turn pages , for instance , people must click on the upper right - hand corner of a page .
And they must navigate a series of links to find details about particular stories .
But , " Now I read the news when it happens — not when my magazine arrives days later , " says Bud Clark , a 64 - year - old retiree in Lyons , Ore .
For nearly a year , he has subscribed to the digital version of Macworld .
Previously , he received it through a mail subscription .
" I can flip through the pages on my PC screen , like you would leaf through a magazine , " he says .
Reaching new readers Services like Zinio 's can't come soon enough for magazine publishers .
In the second half of 2007 , paid circulation of consumer magazines fell 1.7 % , to $ 277 million from $ 282 million in the first half of that year .
The decline has been steady for seven years , since the industry 's paid circulation peaked in 2000 , says Audit Bureau of Circulations .
At the same time , the number of Internet users at home and at work worldwide now is 850 million , compared with 731 million in late 2006 , according to market researcher ComScore .
Such wrenching changes have not been lost on magazine publishers .
" To keep pace with a new generation of readers , providing a choice of print or digital , and expanding our online offerings as flexible full - color screens and e-paper emerges , makes sense , " says Phyllis Rotunno , senior vice president of subscription circulation at Playboy Enterprises .
Since Playboy launched a digital edition in 2005 with the help of Zinio , it has sold some 1.7 million digital issues .
They cost $ 19.97 for a dozen issues , and $ 4.99 for a single issue .
( Playboy 's average annual magazine circulation is 2.6 million . )
Main selling points of the digital magazine version include the ability to zoom in and out on photos , view video and photo outtakes and listen to music clips .
Zinio also recently partnered with Barnes & Noble to sell digital magazines on the book chain 's website .
What is more , Zinio offers for free 120 " digital classics " such as Moby Dick , The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Great Expectations through its website , zinio.com .
The books are downloadable .
Maggiotto is particularly proud that digital publishing is also good for the environment .
An estimated 12 billion magazine issues are printed each year in the USA .
Yet 70 % of newsstand copies go unsold , he says .
Consequently , the equivalent of 35 million trees are chopped down each year to produce many issues that go unsold , according to the non-profit Co-op America , which tracks paper consumption in the publishing industry .
Playboy , for example , has saved $ 1.2 million from lower manufacturing , distribution , paper and postal costs .
" We 're saving publishers money and the forests trees , " Maggiotto says .
" It ca n't get much better than that . "

SUNDAY AM : I now have the weekend ’s official numbers , and kudos to my box office gurus for getting them right once again .
Moviegoers were in a kick - butt mood , so No. 1 was Lionsgate / The Weinstein Co’s The Forbidden Kingdom , pairing martial arts movie stars Jet Li and Jackie Chan for the first time : it had a $ 20.8 million weekend after opening to $ 7.7M Friday and $ 7.9M Saturday in 3,151 theaters .
Indeed , “ the smart money ” was on Forbidden Kingdom because of its PG - 13 rating , one marketer told me .
“ Its target audience has been reliable in the past . ”
And it was again .
But in a conversation with me this morning , TWC ’s Harvey Weinstein , whose company shares domestic and foreign 50/50 with Lionsgate , credited the movie ’s success to producer Casey Silver .
“ First and foremost , no one has ever seen Jackie and Jet together but Casey Silver got them to do the movie .
And then he brought in Rob Minkoff of The Lion King and Stuart Little to make a family movie that appealed to martial arts fans as well as to my daughters aged 5 , 10 and 13 who loved it .
It ’s more fantasy and Narnia than it is a big martial arts movie . ”
Claiming the pic was made for only $ 55 million , TWC is quick to point out that Forbidden Kingdom is the first film released under its Asia Fund .
In the 2nd spot was Universal ’s Forgetting Sarah Marshall starring and written by How I Met Your Mother TV star Jason Segel under the Judd Apatow banner .
It opened with $ 17.3 M after debuting with $ 6 M Friday and $ 6.8 M Saturday from 2,798 venues .
“ This is an impressive number for a small R- rated comedy particularly given how tough the market has been lately and this weekend ’s crowded field , ” A Uni insider says .
History shows that the multiple on Apatow films , and the genre in general , is about 4 times the opening weekend ’s gross .
The modest cost of the film ( $ 30 M ) puts Universal in a nice place to recoup its investment quickly .
Rival studios thought its portrayal of a “ wussy ” guy with full - frontal male nudity might turn off Apatow ’s strong male fan base .
Then again , a watchable comedy has been AWOL from the cineplexes .
And Uni ’s clever teaser ad campaign — “ Who Is Sarah Marshall ? ” — sparked a lot of Internet interest .
Exits showed balance between male / female and young / old : 53 % female / 47 % male , under 30 = 56 % ; 30 and older = 44 % .
Hispanic moviegoers made up the next largest portion of the audience after Caucasians .
Sony ’s PG - 13 teen slasher pic Prom Night took 3rd its second weekend out , making $ 3.5 M Friday and $ 3.7M Saturday from 2,700 plays ( - 56 % ) for what was a $ 9.1 M weekend and new cume of $ 32.5 M .
The studio ’s newcomer 88 Minutes starring Al Pacino in a poorly reviewed thriller that already debuted in Europe opened with $ 2.3M Friday and $ 2.7M
Saturday domestic gross from 2,168 dates for what was a disappointing $ 6.8 M weekend .
The studio had hoped for $ 10 M .
“ This was a North American acquisition for about $ 5 milllion so the upside with TV and home entertainment makes this a low exposure investment , ” a Sony source told me Sunday .
The only other newcomer in the Top 10 was conservative commentator Ben Stein ’s documentary , Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed which makes the intelligent design argument .
Playing in 1,052 theaters , the pic distributed by Rocky Mountain Pictures fell over the weekend from 8th to 10th place after earning $ 1.2M Friday and $ 989 K Saturday for a $ 2.9 M weekend .
But the per screen average for Friday was a low $ 1,145 and for Saturday $ 940 ( and $ 2,830 for the entire weekend ) , showing there was n’t much pent - up demand for the film despite an aggressive publicity campaign on right - wing media .
So much for the conservative argument that people would flock to films not representing the “ agenda of liberal Hollywood ” .
( Just for comparison purposes : left - wing Michael Moore ’s most recent Sicko did $ 4.4 mil its opening weekend from only 441 theaters , and his Fahrenheit 9/11 did $ 23.9 M its opening weekend from 868 venues . )
No. 5 was Fox ’s Nim ’s Island ( $ 1.5 M for Friday , $ 2.5 M for Saturday , $ 5.6 M for the weekend and a new cume of $ 32.8 M ) ; No. 6 was Sony ’s 21 ( $ 1.8 M for Friday , $ 2.3 M for Saturday , $ 5.5 M for the weekend and a new cume of $ 21.3 M ) ; No. 7 was Fox Searchlight ’s Street Kings ( $ 1.2 M for Friday , $ 1.6 M for Saturday , $ 4 M for the weekend and a new cume of $ 19.8 M ) ; No. 8 was Fox ’s Horton Hears A Who !
( $ 930 K for Friday , $ $ 1.5 M for Saturday , $ 3.5 M for the weekend and a new cume of $ 144.4M ) ; and No. 9 was Universal ’s Leatherheads ( $ 923 K for Friday , $ 1.3 M for Saturday , $ 3 M for the weekend and a new cume of $ 26.5 M ) .

The Anthrax Letters : The Finger Points at Whom ?
by Bill Sardi by Bill Sardi
DIGG THIS
Late Friday , June 27 , 2008 , when news viewing is low and Americans are busy finishing their work week and getting home for the weekend , and with many Americans on summer vacation and away from their normal sources of news , the Justice Department announces it has settled a lawsuit with " a person of interest " in the 2001 anthrax mail case .
The " person of interest " was Steven Hatfill , identified by attorney general John Ashcroft as a potential suspect because he had worked at the Army ’s infectious diseases laboratory at Ft. Detrick , Maryland from 1997 to 1999 .
Hatfill ’s attorneys had filed a case against the Federal Government for violation of privacy rights .
Hatfill will receive $ 2.825 million up front and $ 150,000 a year for 20 years .
“ I do n’t think anyone would believe the Department of Justice would . . . pay that kind of money unless they felt there was significant exposure at trial , ” said Brian Sun , a defense lawyer who represented nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee in a leak case .
( Boston Globe )
Exposure ?
Yes , exactly what would be revealed if Hatfill ’s case were to go on ?
There is nothing new I ’m going to write here about the anthrax letter attacks , but I ’m just wondering if the American public can put all the events together and come to a conclusion on their own without waiting for the news media , which is apparently complicit in delivering the government ’s version of the anthrax fiasco , to do the thinking for them ?
It is undeniable that whoever released the anthrax letters directed them at members of the opposing party ( Senator Tom Daschle , the first letter , and Senator Patrick Leahy , the second letter , both who opposed the Patriot Act ) .
The news media was also targeted , first the tabloid press ( the National Enquirer at American Media in Boca Raton , Florida ) that often is the first to release news , and then ABC , CBS and NBC news and the New York Post , all in New York .
Was this an effort to hush the press from investigating and reporting on the events surrounding 9 - 11 ?
In those days following 9 - 11 the American public was led to believe all sorts of things regarding the anthrax letters .
One version was that the Middle Eastern terrorists who hijacked planes and directed them at the World Trade Center towers , were somehow implicated and may have even brought anthrax to the U.S. from a foreign land .
But when our own scientists were employing DNA fingerprinting technology that was leading up to the doorsteps of military biological warfare laboratories in Utah and Maryland , the story had to change .
Hatfill became the scapegoat .
USA Today reporter Tony Locy refused to reveal her sources in her news report implicating Hatfill in the anthrax case .
In all , a US District Judge ordered five reporters at various news organizations , including the Washington Post , Newsweek , USA Today , and CBS News , to answer questions about who provided them information about the Hatfill investigation .
Vanity Fair and Reader ’s Digest also released their versions of the Hatfill case .
Is n’t this how the federal government taps the news media to release propaganda and make it appear it is coming from independent journalists ?
In a written statement , Hatfill ’s lawyers said , “ We can only hope that the individuals and institutions involved are sufficiently chastened by this episode to deter similar destruction of private citizens in the future — and that we will all read anonymously sourced news reports with a great deal more skepticism . ” ( International Herald Tribune )
Chastised ?
The taxpayers paid the monetary price .
The case is unsolved and agents involved in pursuit of the anthrax terrorists ( FBI , postal inspectors ) have not lost their jobs .
The settlement with Hatfill stops further pursuit and revelations of government complicity in this case .
Hatfill was never charged , just slandered .
That is all that government need do , create public suspicion .
Somehow , someone swiped anthrax from a military biological warfare laboratory and used it to kill 5 and infect 17 .
Someone who walks in and out of the doors at these military labs was involved .
They are still at large , and probably still have access to the anthrax .
Whoever the anthrax terrorists are , they had a motive in those early days after 9 - 11 to hush the news media and target leaders of the Democratic Party .
Since we are only left with our own suspicions , just who do you think master - minded the anthrax letter attacks ?
According to an Associated Press report ( October 23 , 2001 ) , " On the night of the Sept. 11 attacks , the White House Medical Office dispensed Cipro ( the antibiotic used to treat anthrax ) to staff accompanying Vice President Dick Cheney as he was secreted off to the safety of Camp David , and told them it was u2018a precaution , ’ according to one person directly involved . "
The first anthrax letters were not postmarked till September 18 .

The French court case began a year and a half ago A French court has ordered eBay to pay 40 m euros ( £ 31.6 m ; $ 63 m ) to luxury goods group LVMH for allowing online auctions of fake copies of its goods .
LVMH said eBay 's French site had not done enough to stop the sale of counterfeit bags and perfumes .
The brands affected include Louis Vuitton , Christian Dior and Givenchy .
An eBay statement said LVMH was trying to " protect uncompetitive commercial practices at the expense of consumer choice " and added that it would appeal .
' Illicit '
The case against eBay in a commercial court in Paris was brought jointly by six brands belonging to the LVMH group .
Louis Vuitton Malletier , the group 's handbag and luggage section , and clothing brand Christian Dior Couture accused eBay of " negligence " in allowing illegal copies of their goods to be sold in online auctions .
Four perfume brands - Dior , Guerlain , Kenzo and Givenchy - sued for what they called " illicit sales " of their products .
They alleged that even auctions involving their legitimate perfumes were illegal , because only specialist dealers were permitted to sell them .
The court barred eBay from selling the four perfumes in future .
LVMH spokesman Pierre Godet welcomed the decision , telling French news agency AFP that it " protected brands by considering them an important part of French heritage " .
' Uncompetitive ' But Vanessa Canzini , an eBay spokeswoman , said : " If counterfeits appear on our sites , we take them down swiftly , but todays ruling is not about our fight against counterfeit .
" Todays ruling is about an attempt by LVMH to protect uncompetitive commercial practices at the expense of consumer choice and the livelihood of law - abiding sellers that eBay empowers everyday .
" We will fight this ruling on their behalf ; we will be seeking leave to appeal . 
According to the judgement , eBay must pay 19.28 m euros in damages to Luis Vuitton Malletier , 17.3 m to Christian Dior Couture and 3.25 m to the perfume brands .
The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the ruling is seen as a landmark , because it could oblige eBay to rethink its business model .
Until now , this has been built around the simple notion of bringing together buyers and sellers , with minimal supervision from the company .
The penalty is the second in a month imposed on eBay by French courts .
On 4 June , a court in the eastern French city of Troyes found the auction site directly responsible for the sale of fake Hermes bags .
It imposed a penalty of 20,000 euros jointly on eBay and the woman who offered the bags for sale .

What are these ?
Red Hat Inc today settled two patent lawsuits that the Linux software firm had been contesting .
It said that patent claims by Firestar Software Inc , filed in 2006 , and DataTern Inc , filed earlier this year , have now been settled .
The financial terms of both deals were kept secret .
However , the company remains embroiled in a third patent complaint filed last October by IP Innovation LLC and Technology Licensing Corporation , which has claimed damages and is demanding an injunction to stop Red Hat and Novell continuing alleged infringement .
The lawsuit accuses Red Hat and Novell of infringing three patents , all of which appear to have originally been assigned to Xerox .
The Linux vendors are accused of breaking several patents relating to " User Interface with Multiple Workspaces for Sharing Display System Objects " . ®
In the first conviction of a file - sharer in the country , Portuguese authorities have handed down a harsh sentence of 90 days imprisonment in order to " set an example " .
The unnamed individual faced court after the Portuguese version of the RIAA issued a complaint about unauthorized uploading .
It seems that every country around Europe has its own ways of dealing with file - sharers .
In the UK these days it ’s customary to send out educational warnings , but in the past borderline extortion letters seemed in order , depending on the mood of the day .
Downloading has been tolerated in the Netherlands but France would like to disconnect persistent file - sharers from the Internet .
Another day sees another country ’s interpretation of the law when it comes to dealing with file - sharers , this time from sunny Portugal .
Following a complaint from the Portuguese version of the RIAA , a court in PortimÃ£o has handed down a severe sentence in the country ’s first ever case involving a file - sharer .
One incredibly unlucky individual has been sentenced to 90 days in jail for uploading music on P2P networks , with the severity of punishment decided upon “ to set an example ” .
The individual was investigated after a complaint from the Portuguese Phonographic Association ( AFP ) , which was confirmed by JoÃ£o Teixeira , an association member and director - general of EMI in Portugal .
News reports suggest the conviction was related to ‘ downloading ’ music but this is a common mistake .
The individual was accused and found guilty of ‘ uploading ’ or distribution of copyright works and is just one of more than a hundred other complaints under investigation right now .
Mr Teixeira said that although he was pleased with the sentence ( calling it a “ necessary evil ” ) he noted that there are other methods that can be employed to stop file - sharers , such as the recent “ 3 strikes ” law in France .
However , it seems he will settle for a jail sentence sending the message to the masses :
“ The problem is people know they are doing something illegal , but they also know there are no consequences , at least until this week , ” he said .
Fortunately , it seems that the jail sentence handed down can be replaced by the individual paying fines to the court plus some compensation , although there is no indication of the amounts involved at this stage .
Taking the same stance as some of his associates in the UK , JoÃ£o Teixeira lays the blame for file - sharing at the door of the ISPs , claiming that they encourage people to do so .

The new attack on the RDBMS by techno.blog ( " Dion " )
The End of an Architectural Era ( It ’s Time for a Complete Rewrite ) - A really fascinating paper bolstering many of the anti-RDBMS threads the have popped up on the intertube .
All your life you 've used a relational database .
At the tender age of five you banged out your first SQL query to track your allowance .
Your RDBMS allegiance was just assumed , like your politics or religion would have been assumed 100 years ago .
They now say -- you know them -- that relations wo n't scale and we have to do things differently .
New databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are what 's different .
As a long time RDBMS user what can you expect of SimpleDB ?
That 's what Alex Tolley of MyMeemz.com set out to discover .
Like many brave explorers before him , Alex gave a report of his adventures to the Royal Society of the AWS Meetup .
Alex told a wild almost unbelievable tale of cultures and practices so different from our own you almost could not believe him .
But Alex brought back proof .
Using a relational database is a no- brainer when you have a big organization behind you .
Someone else worries about the scaling , the indexing , backups , and so on .
When you are out on your own there 's no one to hear you scream when your site goes down .
In these circumstances you just want a database that works and that you never have to worry about again .
That 's what attracted Alex to SimpleDB .
It 's trivial to setup and use , no schema required , insert data on the fly with no upfront preparation , and it will scale with no work on your part .
You become free from DIAS ( Database Induced Anxiety Syndrome ) .
You do n't have to think about or babysit your database anymore .
It will just work .
And from a business perspective your database becomes a variable cost rather than a high fixed cost , which is excellent for the angel food funding .
Those are very nice features in a database .
But for those with a relational database background there are some major differences that take getting used to ..
You do n't have to define a schema before you use the database .
SimpleDB is an attribute - value store and you can use any you like any time you like .
It does n't care .
Very different from Victorian world of the RDBMS ..
In relational theory the goal is to minimize update and deletion anomolies by normaling your data into seperate tables related by keys .
You then join those tables together when you need the data back .
In SimpleDB there are no joins .
For many - to - 1 relationships this works out great .
In SimpleDB attribute values can have multiple values so there 's no need to do a join to recover all the values .
They are stored together .
For many - to - many to relationships life is not so simple .
You must code them by hand in your program .
This is a common theme in SimpleDB .
What the RDBMS does for you automatically must generally be coded by hand with SimpleDB .
The wages of scale are more work for the programmer .
What a surprise ..
In a RDBMS you can select which columns are returned in a query .
Not so in SimpleDB .
In a query SimpleDB just returns back a record ID , not the values of the record .
You need to make another trip to the database to get the record contents .
So to minimize your latency you would need to spawn off multiple threads .
See , more work for the programmer ..
Records are not returned in a sorted order .
Values for multi-value attribute fields are not returned in sorted order .
That means if you want sorted results you must do the sorting .
And it also means you must get all the results back before you can do the sorting .
More work for the programmer ..
SimpleDB only returns back 250 results at a time .
When there are more results you cursor through the result set using a token mechanism .
The kicker is you must iterate through the result set sequentially .
So iterating through a large result set will take a while .
And you can't use your secret EC2 weapon of massive cheap CPU to parallelize the process .
More work for the programmer because you have to move logic to the write part of the process instead of the read part because you 'll never be able to read fast enough to perform your calculations in a low latency environment ..
Alex tested retrieving 10 record ids from 3 different database sizes .
Using a 1 K record database it took an average of 141 msecs to retrieve the 10 record ids .
For a 100 K record database it took 266 msecs on average .
For a 1000 K record database it took an average of 433 msecs to retrieve the 10 record ids .
It 's not fast , but it is relatively consistent .
That seems to be a theme with these databases .
BigTable is n't exactly a speed demon either .
One could conclude that for certain needs at least , SimpleDB scales sufficiently well that you can feel comfortable that your database wo n't bottleneck your system or cause it to crash under load .
If you have a complex OLAP style database SimpleDB is not for you .
But , if you have a simple structure , you want ease of use , and you want it to scale without your ever lifting a finger ever again , then Simple DB makes sense .
The cost is everything you currently know about using databases is useless and all the cool things we take for granted that a database does , Simple DB does not do .
SimpleDB shifts work out of the database and onto programmers which is why the SimpleDB programming model sucks : it requires a lot more programming to do simple things .
I 'll argue however that this is the kind of suckiness programmers like .
Programmers like problems they can solve with more programming .
We do n't even care how twisted and inelegant the code is because we can make it work .
And as long as we can make it work we are happy .
What programmers can't do is make the database scalable through more programming .
Making a database scalable is not a solvable problem through more programming .
So for programmers the right trade off was made .
A scalable database you do n't have to worry about for more programming work you already know how to do .
How does that sound ?
Leila Hussein lived her last few weeks in terror .
Moving constantly from safe house to safe house , she dared to stay no longer than four days at each .
It was the price she was forced to pay after denouncing and divorcing her husband - the man she witnessed suffocate , stamp on , then stab their young daughter Rand in a brutal ' honour ' killing for which he has shown no remorse .
Though she feared reprisals for speaking out , she really believed that she would soon be safe .
Arrangements were well under way to smuggle her to the Jordanian capital , Amman .
In fact , she was on her way to meet the person who would help her escape when a car drew up alongside her and two other women who were walking her to a taxi .
Five bullets were fired : three of them hit Leila , 41 .
She died in hospital after futile attempts to save her .
Her death , on 17 May , is the shocking denouement to a tragedy which had its origins in an innocent friendship between her student daughter , Rand Abdel - Qader , 17 , and a blond , 22 - year - old British soldier known only as Paul .
The two had met while Rand , an English student at Basra University , was working as a volunteer helping displaced families and he was distributing water .
Although their friendship appears to have involved just brief , snatched conversations over four months , Rand had confided her romantic feelings for Paul to her best friend , Zeinab , 19 .
She died , still a virgin , four months after she had last seen him when her father , Abdel - Qader Ali , 46 , discovered that she had been seen talking ' to the enemy ' in public .
She had brought shame on his honour , was his defence , and he had to cleanse his family name .
Despite openly admitting the murder , he has received no punishment .
It was two weeks after Rand 's death on 16 March that a grief - stricken Leila , unable to bear living under the same roof as her husband , found the strength to leave him .
She had been beaten and had had her arm broken .
It was a courageous move .
Few women in Iraq would contemplate such a step .
Leila told The Observer in April : ' No man can accept being left by a woman in Iraq .
But I would prefer to be killed than sleep in the same bed as a man who was able to do what he did to his own daughter . '
Her words were to prove prescient .
Leila turned to the only place she could , a small organisation in Basra campaigning for the rights of women and against ' honour ' killings .
Almost immediately she began receiving threats - notes calling her a ' prostitute ' and saying she deserved to die like her daughter .
Even her sons Hassan , 23 , and Haydar , 21 , whom she claimed aided their father in their sister 's killing , disowned her .
Meanwhile , her husband , a former government employee , escaped any charges , and even told The Observer that police had congratulated him on what he had done .
It is not known who killed Leila .
All that is known is that she was staying at the house of ' Mariam ' , one of the women 's rights campaigners , whose identity The Observer has agreed not to reveal .
On the morning of 17 May , they were joined by another volunteer worker and set off to meet ' a contact ' who was to help Leila travel to Amman , where she would be taken in by an Iraqi family .
' Leila was anxious , but she was also happy at having the chance to leave Iraq , ' said Mariam .
' Since the death of her daughter , her own life was at serious risk .
And this was a great opportunity for her to leave the country and to fight for Iraqi women 's rights .
' She had not been able to sleep the night before .
I stayed up talking to her about her plans after she arrived in Amman .
I gave her some clothes to take with her and she was packing the only bag she had .
She was too excited to sleep . '
Mariam said that when she awoke Leila had already prepared breakfast , cleaned her house and even baked a date cake as a thank - you for the help she had been given .
After the arrival of ' Faisal ' , the volunteer ( whose identity is also being protected ) , the three left the house at 10.30 am and started walking to the end of the street to get a taxi .
They had walked less than 50 metres when they heard a car drive up fast and then gunshots rang out .
The attack , said by witnesses to have been carried out by three men , was over in minutes .
Leila was hit by three bullets .
Mariam was hit in her left arm and Faisal in her left leg .
' I did n't realise I had been shot for a few seconds , because as I heard the gunfire I saw Leila falling to the ground and saw blood pouring from her head , ' said Mariam .
' I was so shocked , I did n't immediately feel the pain . '
Two men ran from their homes to help .
They rushed Leila to hospital and a passing taxi took the other two .
But Leila died at 3.20 pm , despite several operations to save her .
As she lay in her own hospital bed receiving treatment , Mariam said that she heard someone saying that Leila had been shot in the head .
But there were other mutterings that were clearly audible .
' I could hear people talking on the corridors and the only thing that they had to say was that Leila was wrong for defending her daughter 's mistakes and that her death was God 's punishment .
' In that minute I just had complete hatred in my heart for those who had killed her . '
Police said the incident was a sectarian attack and that there was nothing to link Leila 's death to her family .
' Her ex-husband was not in Basra when it happened .
We found out he was visiting relatives in Nassiriya with his two sons , ' said Hassan Alaa , a senior officer at the local police station in Basra .
' We believe the target was the women activists , rather than Mrs Hussein , and that she was unlucky to be in that place at that time . '
It is plausible .
Campaigners for women's ' rights are not acceptable to many sections of Iraqi society , especially in Basra where militias have partial control in some districts and impose strict laws on locals , including what clothing they should wear and what religious practice they should follow .
Since February 2006 , two other activists from the same women 's organisation have been killed in the city .
One of them was reportedly raped before being shot .
The other , the only man working for the non-governmental organisation ( NGO ) , and a father of five who was responsible for the organisation 's finances , was shot five months ago .
There could be many with a grudge against such organisations .
However , Mariam believes Leila was targeted , pointing out she had been hit by three bullets .
' When we were shot , they focused on Leila , not us , ' she said .
Since the attack the NGO has stopped its work in Basra .
' We dare n't answer the phones because we have received so many threats since we gave our support to Leila 's case , ' said Mariam .
' Most of our members are preparing to leave the city and even Iraq if they can raise the money . '
A single mother since her husband was killed for refusing to join a militia , she too intends to move when she can .
Faisal , who also survived her injuries , is still suffering post - surgical infection .
She preferred not to speak , but her mother , who wished to remain anonymous , said : ' My daughter is very shocked at what happened , and my two grandsons can't stop crying since they saw her in hospital . '
Leila 's burial was arranged within hours of her death by the husband of one of her cousins and Mariam 's father .
The Observer visited Rand 's father and two brothers at their Basra home , but they refused to talk beyond Hassan proclaiming his father 's innocence .
When asked if he would be visiting his mother 's grave , he shrugged : ' Maybe in the future . '
Leila was an orphan , raised by an uncle who died in the Shia uprising against Saddam Hussein in the early 1990s .
Hamida Alaa , 68 , a friend of the uncle , said : ' The poor woman was killed and now her name and history is buried with her .
No one wants to speak about it .
She is just one more woman killed in our country who has already been forgotten by the local society . '
In the last days of her life , Leila was suffering from the pressure of having gone against her husband .
' She was sleeping with the help of sedatives , ' said Mariam .
' She would wake up at night with terrible nightmares , even dreaming of being suffocated as her daughter was .
She had been threatened so many times and that 's why she was so scared .
Her indignation over Rand 's death is what led her to her own coffin .
Their history ends here .
But Leila was a hero .
A woman who was strong enough to say no to Iraqi men's bad attitudes .
Sadly most Iraqi women do not have the same strength and they will stay in their homes . '
Mariam has moved out of her home .
But within hours of speaking to The Observer a close friend went to her new address to deliver a message that had been left for her at her front door .
It read : ' Death to betrayers of Islam who do n't deserve God 's forgiveness .
Speaking less you will live more . '
She believes it was sent by Leila 's killers .
' They want this story to be buried with Leila , ' she said .
' But I can not close my eyes to all this . '
Star - gazing teens fall asleep in street , are run over by car
Two teenage boys who fell asleep while stargazing in the middle of a street in Danville were run over early this morning by a woman delivering newspapers from her car .
The 15 - year - olds were trapped for a time under the driver 's Nissan Sentra before being extricated by rescuers from the San Ramon Valley Fire Protection District , said Sgt. Phillip Wisotsky of the Danville Police Department .
One teen suffered a punctured lung and a broken bone , while the other youth 's injuries consisted mostly of " road rash , " Wisotsky said .
They were taken to John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek , where police questioned them today .
" They said they had gone out into the street to look at the stars , " Wisotsky said .
" They laid blankets down ... fell asleep and got run over . "
The incident occurred at 3:24 a.m. on Ashland Court .
The driver , who delivers
The Chronicle and other newspapers on the cul de sac , drove over the teens as she was leaving , apparently not seeing them .
Wisotsky said an investigation is under way " as to who is at fault .
It is illegal to lay in the street .
It is a public roadway and people are n't supposed to sleep on it . "
According to Chris Blaser , vice president of circulation at The Chronicle , the driver was a subcontractor delivering papers for a Danville distributor .
" She is very shaken up , " he said .
The train continued its journey after several hours in quarantine Canadian health officials have said the death of a woman and several people falling ill aboard a train were not due to an infectious disease .
The passenger train was quarantined in Northern Ontario on Friday , but officials said the death and illnesses were probably not related at all .
The 290 passengers and crew resumed their journey and were expected to arrive in Toronto later on Saturday .
Ontario's chief medical officer said the dead woman did not have a disease .
Dr David Williams said : " Health officials have determined that the death of the passenger and the illness of the other six passengers are not related . "
But while he said the other illnesses reported were not related , Dr Williams added it was important to anticipate the worst scenario .
" Retrospectively , maybe someone can say it was over done but if , say , there was a real problem then it certainly would have been appropriate and it was appropriate , " he said .
Praised operation
The train had been travelling from Vancouver to Toronto when a woman in her 60s fell ill and died on Friday morning .
The train was stopped in the tiny hamlet of Foleyet and surrounded by emergency services , who evacuated the local station .
Emergency and medical officials boarded the train in biohazard suits and masks and a second passenger was airlifted to hospital , where she was diagnosed with a respiratory illness and is said to be in a stable condition .
Five other passengers who complained of mild flu - like symptoms had been quarantined in a separate carriage and treated by a doctor , who was " not concerned for their immediate health , " Ontario Provincial Police Staff Sergeant Rob Knox said .
Dr Williams praised the way the operation was carried out .
" I 'm satisfied that the appropriate steps were taken , " he said .
" A lot of people acted in a calm , collected way and went about their duties and responsibilities accordingly . "
A 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) in Toronto killed dozens of people and caused widespread panic .
" We 're taking precautions and we did learn lessons from SARS , so our medical teams and the health care system in general have learned that you would put safety first , " said health ministry official Laurel Ostfield .

What are these ?
The Florida Marlins and Detroit Tigers have agreed in principle on a trade that will send
Miguel Cabrera and Dontrelle Willis to Detroit for key prospects , sources told ESPN's Peter Gammons on Tuesday .
The Tigers would send outfielder Cameron Maybin , pitcher Andrew Miller , catcher Mike Rabelo and minor league pitchers Eulogio De La Cruz , Dallas Trahern and Burke Badenhop to the Marlins .
The deal is expected to be announced Tuesday night when the physicals and paperwork are completed .
" It 's very serious , but nothing is finalized yet because some
issues need to get worked out , " Tigers manager Jim Leyland told
The Associated Press .
Miller was Detroit 's top pick in the 2006 draft and went 5 - 5 in 13 starts after being called up last summer .
Maybin was the Tigers ' first pick in 2005 and shot through the farm system , hitting .143 in 24 major league games , Rabelo batted .256 in 51 games , and 23 - year - old De La Cruz appeared in six games for the Tigers , hitting 100 mph on the radar gun .
Willis was on vacation when he heard the news .
" I 'm in Mexico right now with my family .
I 'm kind of busy , " he
told the AP .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Federal Reserve is mulling further steps to address liquidity problems in financial markets in case measures taken to date fail to gain traction , a Fed official confirmed on Wednesday .
Steps under review include the Treasury Department borrowing in excess of its requirements and depositing the surplus at the Fed .
This would allow the central to make funds available to banks and Wall Street firms without pushing down interest rates .
Other possible actions include issuing debt under the Fed ’s name and seeking authority to immediately pay interest on commercial bank reserves , the official said .
The options under consideration by the Fed were first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday .
Such moves are not imminent because the Fed ’s balance sheet can currently accommodate further lending aimed at restoring normal flows of credit in a market paralyzed by the subprime mortgage debacle .
In recent months , the central bank has announced several new facilities to extend credit to banks and Wall Street firms .
“ Evidently it ’s another attempt at seeking out non-policy based solutions to the credit crunch , which sits well with the ( Fed ) minutes yesterday which noted that monetary policy alone was insufficient to stem the credit crisis , ” said Richard McGuire , fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets in London .
EFFECT ON RATES
The Fed uses its assets to set interest rate targets and control the money supply .
The central bank can expand its balance sheet practically without limit , but that would boost reserves and push down the federal funds rate , which banks charge each other for loans .
While the central bank is not immediately constrained by the size of its balance sheet in addressing the crisis , it is preparing for the possibility that it might need to further expand the balance sheet without lowering the fed funds rate , the official confirmed .
As of April 2 , the most recent point for which data is available , the Fed held $ 581 billion in Treasury securities on its balance sheet , down approximately $ 192 billion from a year ago .
It listed roughly $ 221 billion in credits , loans , and repurchase agreements outstanding .
If the Treasury deposits funds at the Fed , and the Fed uses the funds to buy Treasuries , there would be no impact on interest rates .
One possible obstacle to this approach may be the Treasury ’s statutory debt ceiling of $ 9.8 trillion , which Congress has been reluctant to increase without a debate .
Even so , this is the likeliest option and one that the Fed and Treasury officials have discussed , the official confirmed .

A Treasury official acknowledged the discussions but did not provide details .
“ Of course we ’re thinking through contingency plans , it would be negligent for us not to , ” the official said .
“ This type of action is by no means imminent , ” the official added .
LIQUIDITY MEASURES
Since the credit crisis exploded in the summer of 2007 , the Fed has opened a series of channels aimed at funneling liquidity into parched credit markets .
Twice the central bank has narrowed the gap between the discount rate , which is what it charges banks for loans , and the federal funds rate .
That gap now stands at a narrow quarter of a percentage point .
The Fed also has initiated cash auctions for commercial banks , and it has dusted off authority not used since the Great Depression to offer discount - window - like credit and Treasury securities to Wall Street firms .
Meanwhile , the central bank has slashed its fed funds rate as well , taking it down three percentage points to 2.25 percent , including a rare three - quarter percentage point cut in January between scheduled meetings .
But Fed officials have been careful to distinguish between lowering borrowing costs , which can stimulate economic activity , and ensuring adequate liquidity to heal markets .
At the central bank ’s March 18 meeting , Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher voted against a three - quarter point reduction , arguing that relieving liquidity strains , rather than rate cuts , was a preferable therapy for the financial market malaise that has in all likelihood pushed the economy into recession .

When it comes to web design too often perfect , colorful and boxy designs make the cut ; however , the reality is different as it is hard to find objects with a perfect shape and a perfect color in our daily routine .
To achieve a unique and communicative design we need to consider more creative approaches .
For instance , we can draw sites by ourselves — or at least some parts of it .
When it comes to web design too often perfect , colorful and boxy designs make the cut ; however , the reality is different as it is hard to find objects with a perfect shape and a perfect color in our daily routine .
To achieve a unique and communicative design we need to consider more creative approaches .
For instance , we can draw sites by ourselves — or at least some parts of it .
The main purpose of hand - drawn elements lies in their ability to convey a personality and an individual note in times when perfect , boxy and rounded elements can be found almost everywhere .
They look different and they can make a web - site look different .
And this is what we usually are after in the first place .
This post presents fresh examples of hand - drawing style in modern web design .
All screenshots can be clicked and lead to the sites from which they ’ve been taken .
What ’s new ?
Few months ago we ’ve declared that , in our humble opinion , shiny and glossy design elements were officially outdated .
We have also suggested that web designs will become more subtle , more user - centric , more content - oriented and less loud .
Indeed , this is exactly what we observe at the moment .
Hand - writing , earlier often taken to extreme , now seems to become subtle , supporting and less dominating .
Below you ’ll find some examples which are supposed to prove exactly that .
Hand - drawn elements are used moderately
In particular , since designers try to provide visitors with a comforting , user - friendly presentations , they tend to use hand - drawn and hand - written elements moderately .
Sometimes , only few design elements are designed accordingly while the rest of the design is focuses on clean conten presentation and is n’t drawn at all .
For instance , often only category headers , search boxes or navigation are hand - written .
However , it is important to understand that there are still many examples of exaggerated use of hand - writing and hand - drawn elements ( see examples below ) .
Yet we ’ve observed a growing number of designs where such elements are used sparsely and accurately .
Jeff Sarmiento combines hand - written and hand - drawn elements with a classic retro-look .
Although there are only few elements which are actually hand - drawn , they give the design an authentic style which perfectly fits to its look .
More precisely , hand - drawing is used only for category headers ,
Script fonts gain on popularity
Since hand - drawn elements become more subtle , designers often tend to imitate hand - writing instead of using it .
For instance , this is done by using clean and sharp script fonts instead of literally hand - written or drawn sketches .
This approach helps designers to make the layout cleaner and easier to scan .
Paul Wallas uses script fonts in header and for category headings .
The script font is , however , easy to read and perfectly fits to the informal style of the site .
Beware : usability issues !
Regarding the usability point of view we ’ve managed to find some negative examples .
Attempting to create a distinctive design , designers often tend to neglect usability issues .
Whether some design element is hand - drawn or not , it is important that it successfully communicates its function and visitors are able to a ) find it and b ) immediately know how to use it .
Hand - written navigation options .
That may be too much hand - writing at once .
Mind Never ( screenshot above ) uses hand - writing for 6 design elements — logo , tagline , navigation , headers , illustration and all clickable elements .
The main problem with the design is the simple fact that it is hard to scan .
Furthermore , links are styled differently — sometimes they are blue , sometimes black , sometimes they have a hover - effect , sometimes they do n’t .
That ’s not effective and not user - friendly .
Here one should reduce the number of hand - drawn elements and use standard design elements instead .
Consider another example above .
Omnia.ae uses hand - drawn design elements for almost every possible element in the layout .
The image displays a country selector which is a radio- button .
Although this is definitely an interesting solution , this selection is easy to overlook as it appears to be rather a part of the background image than a standalone design element .
While the RSS - button and a sign - up - illustration are likely to be perceived as clickable design elements , in the language selection above it is not the case .
Keep in mind : if your decision to use an artistic element instead of a standard solution raises some usability issues , you should prefer a standard solution .
Let ’s now take a look at some examples of how hand - writing and hand - drawing are used in practice .
The most valuable and innovative ideas had all been handwritten first .
That ’s no big news , since designers tend to produce first sketches as paper prototypes anyway ; still it ’s important , because web design is different from “ usual ” design .
Of course , it also has a personal note and it is hand - made , however users ca n’t see that .
As CSS is “ boxy but good ” , designs tend to have a rather limited appearance — they are too boxy and too right - angled .
If designers want to achieve a different design , they have to draw their sites by themselves — or at least some parts of it .
And in fact , this is done quite often : whether a blog , a shop , an ad , a private page , or some collaborative project — does n’t matter whether with Flash or ( X ) HTML .
The main purpose of hand - drawn elements lies in their ability to convey a personality and an individual note in times when colorful , sharp and rounded Web 2.0 elements can be found almost everywhere .
Sometimes designers create whole pages with paper , pencil and / or a tablet PC .
More often single layout elements are designed in a special way — curved links , hand - made icons , backgrounds , notes , stickers and fuzzy lines are supposed to give the site a “ human touch ” .
These elements makes a web - page which might not look different from dozens of similar pages , stand out and arise users ’ curiosity .
Caution : a quickly installed hand - written font can harm more than help ( hint : Comic Sans is definitely not the way to go ) .
How impressive can the results be ?
And when can the hand - drawing style be used ?
Let ’s take a look at some excellent examples of hand - drawing style in modern web design .
All screenshots can be clicked and lead to the sites from which they ’ve been taken .
Hand - drawing as artistic minimalism
Since hand - drawing is a typical feature of graphic artists , designers and illustrators and is often associated with creativity and inspiration , it is often used in portfolios and showcases .
The interesting thing is that the hand - drawn style is often the only element which is used by designers to present their work on their site .
Below some examples of the artistic minimalism at its best .
Mel Kadel draws everything — even herself .
Both start page ( top ) and internal page ( bottom ) on this Brazilian site have hand - drawn elements .
All internal pages have its own , unique style .
Heather Sloane illustrates with Flash .
Drawn elements complete a classic portfolio design .
This design is n’t that minimalistic , but it does n’t offer that much , neither .
The style supports the content
In some cases designers experiment with hand - drawn doodles to support the main content of the site rather than use hand - writing for main design elements .
For instance , sketches are sometimes placed on the background of the site .
Sometimes it works quite well .
In the design below similar idea is used .
However , only 20 - 30 % of the page actually serves the content presentation .
This is not what most users are expecting and this is exactly what make this site different .
Jakob Nielsen would n’t be fascinated about the content presentation on this site .
Also single design elements can be used in the hand - writing style .
In the example below only an RSS - button on the right is hand - drawn .
This example uses hand - written elements all across the site .
It has a hand - written logo , hints , lines and even maps .
The hand - drawn map on the start page contains links to single areas of the site .
While this is definitely an interesting and creative design , users might experience problems in finding the information they are looking for .
In fact , visitors need to play around with the site to find out what information is actually presented .
The design also includes hand - drawn elements throughout the site , e.g. to display videos a sketch of the TV set is used , and even tables follow this style .
The content also incorporates the style in the HomeworkHouse ( wax crayons ) .
An online - shop with a number of hand - drawn elements .
Simple yet impressive .
Caution , Flash .
Hand - drawing combined with illustration
Since hand - drawn figures might sometimes lack visual appeal , this shortcoming is often addressed with the use of striking visual elements .
The result is sometimes a wild , vivid , colorful — but always innovative design approach .
It ’s important to note that such design decisions should be considered very precisely .
It ’s very easy to make the design more appealing by making it less intuitive at the same time .
The design is different — not necessarily simplified or made more difficult to grasp .
In fact , how well usability and accessibility issues are mastered depends mostly only on the developer ’s skills .
What you see looks like a prototype : Joe Grisham ’s site looks authentic , hand - made and uses illustrations .
This design combines hand - drawing style and vivid illustrations ( comics ) .
It is n’t supposed to be a Web 2.0 design .
This is a typical Web 2.0 design — with glossy buttons , reflections and ( guess what ! ) hand - drawing style used for navigation , content and footer .
Hand - made style in the advertisement of a Casio - product .
Flash in use .
Some designers intertwine the hand - drawing style with illustrations unifying them into a single design element .
This produces an artistic , unexpected and intriguing design and motivates visitors to explore the site .
Not all visitors will be willing to do that , actually .
Hand - drawing style hidden in details : Spinvox uses curved lines for the hover - effect .
A classic web - site with individual hand - written elements .
Actually , it ’s a site of a university .
More hand - drawn elements can be found across the site .
Hand - drawing delivers the message
This aspect becomes more apparent in Web 2.0 - designs .
Hand - drawing elements are used to make it easier for users to get the idea behind the product and service which is offered .
This works pretty well in both web and print design , as it gives the provided explanation a more personal , emotional and informal nature .
Take a look at the examples below .
This is how a typical Web 2.0 - site might look like once it ’s provided with some additional visual cues .
Videoegg uses artistic elements in the navigation menu .
Hand - drawing taken to extreme
Sometimes it ’s the designer ’s purpose to impress , shock or entice the reader to get noticed and create a lasting impression .
While there are a number of ways to achieve this , an unusual design style is definitely one of them ; it is also the only style that delivers the artistic side of the design extremely well .
Of course , it does n’t always lead to usable web - sites .
A “ sketchy ” weblog .
Where do you look at when you visit the site at the first time ?
A drawn navigation menu at the top of the site also has some cute hover - effects .
Retro lives in this site .
Experiments and artistic approaches
Designers are artists , or at least they should try to be .
And as such , designers tend to take radical design decisions , exploring their imagination and challenging visitors ’ creativity .
This does n’t always work , but sometimes it does .
This Flash - based site literally lets you play with its content .

The style of street paintings .
Yes , it looks quite trashy .
But it is designed like this by purpose .

And , of course , the site also changes your cursor .

Hand - drawing in logos and headers
When hand - written elements are placed in logo or in a header , the designer makes sure that visitors will detect these elements .
Since these areas are clicked more often than other layout elements , the “ hand - drawn ” - feeling will be conveyed .
That ’s what some designers are trying to achieve .
Besides , if the designer wants its design to convey a personal note and some design elements are already hand - written , it makes sense to consider adding some hand - written notes to the header as well .

Headers
Single hand - drawn design elements
To give the layout a “ hand - written ” - style design elements need to be styled accordingly .
In fact , you can apply the style to any part of your layout .
Usually designers use hand - writing for teasers , RSS - buttons , navigation , input fields , headers and background images .

Hand - drawing in navigation
Navigation is the primary element of every site design .
Designers know it and give it some unique artistic elements to make the design more unique and distinctive .
However , you should n’t experiment too much with navigation .
Make sure it works .
The function is more important than the design .
Below you ’ll find some example of how one can effectively combine the hand - drawing - style with clear and intuitive navigation .
Hand - drawn rectangles for navigation options
Hand - drawing combined with hand - writing
Hand - drawn icons appear when the navigation option is hovered
Hand - drawn icons are used to indicate navigation options
Hand - drawn icons appear when a section is hovered
A script font in use
Subtle hand - writing used for tabs
Tiny hand - writing for section headers and script font used to display navigation options
Hand - drawing used moderately .
As we have written above , designers attempt to make sure that the design looks distinctive without compromising the usability and user - friendliness of the design .
In fact , it ’s not that hard as it may look like .
Consider the examples below .
This is how we like it : huge typography , flashy colors , memorable favicon and a sweet roboter willing to help .
Well , the roboter speaks hand - writing , of course .
Harvard University 's endowment is $ 35 billion , and some people are n't happy about it .
Massachusetts legislators see money that could be theirs , and are contemplating new taxes .
Social activists see money that could be going to charity , and want to divert it .
Distinguished alumni who have landed at public universities wonder why , with all that cash , Harvard graduates such a tiny number of students .
These are all legitimate concerns , and I wo n't be suggesting the ideal policy compromise .
But there is one misimpression that people seem to have , that might as well be corrected before any hasty actions are taken : the purpose of Harvard is not to educate students .
If anything , its primary purpose is to produce research and scholarly work .
Nobody should be surprised that the gigantic endowment is n't put to use in providing top - flight educational experiences for a much larger pool of students ; it could be , for sure , but that 's not the goal .
The endowment is there to help build new facilities , launch new research initiatives , and attract the best faculty .
If it were n't for the fact that it 's hard to get alumni donations when you do n't have any alumni , serious consideration would doubtless be given to cutting out students entirely .
Sure , some would complain that they enjoy teaching , that it keeps them fresh , or that students can be useful as research assistants .
But those are reasons why the students are useful to the faculty ; they are not assertions that the purpose of the institution is to educate students for their own sakes .
Do n't believe me ?
Here is the test : when was the last time Harvard made a senior tenure offer to someone because they were a world - class educator , rather than a world - class researcher ?
Not only is the answer " never , " the question itself is somewhat laughable .
This is not a value judgment , nor is it a particular complaint about Harvard .
It 's true of any top - ranked private research university , including Caltech .
( Note that Caltech has over 1200 faculty members and fewer than 900 undergraduate students . )
And it is not a statement about universities in general ; many large public universities , and smaller liberal - arts schools , take education very seriously as a primary mission .
This is by no means incompatible with being a top - notch research institution -- the physics departments at places like Berkeley or UC Santa Barbara would be the envy of almost any private research university .
But those places also take their educational mission very seriously , which Harvard , honestly , does not .
Of course , certain individual faculty members at Harvard might be great teachers and care deeply about their students ; but that 's a bonus , not a feature of the institution .
( Harvey Mansfield , to a visiting colleague : " You should close your door .
If you do n't , undergraduates may wander in . " )
None of this is necessarily good or bad ; it 's just a recognition of the state of affairs .
Harvard et al. judge themselves by the research and scholarship they produce .
Students will always keep applying to those places and trying to get in , because the aura of intellectual attainment produced by precisely those scholarly accomplishments will always act as a powerful draw .
Such students are by no means making a mistake ; the intellectual atmosphere at such places truly is intoxicating , and if nothing else the interaction with your fellow talented students can be a life - changing experience .
But to try your best to get into Harvard and then complain once you are there that the professors seem interested in their own work rather than in teaching is to utterly miss the point .
And to complain that Harvard has a giant endowment that it chooses to use for purposes other than educating more students is equally misguided .
When Barack Obama , whose mother was white , identifies himself as black , and when Bill Richardson , whose father was white , identifies himself as Hispanic , who is white ?
The U.S. Census Bureau says the country will be majority - minority in 2050 -- that is , the combined number of blacks , Asians , American Indians and Hispanics will put whites in the minority .
Texas and California are already there .
But the definition of white keeps shifting .
Groups have been welcomed in or booted out ; people opt out , sue to get in or change their minds and jump back and forth .
The deepest racial divide , between blacks and nonblacks , endures .
But there also are identity shifts among African - Americans , as Sen. Obama 's success suggests .
Some make it into the middle class , where education and social mobility may help shape their identities as much as race does .
Others are left behind in increasingly segregated schools and neighborhoods .
The U.S. has never found it easy to assign race , although it certainly has tried .
A century ago , the people who did the counting -- demographers , sociologists , policy thinkers -- divided whites into three strata .
They considered Nordic whites , from England , Scandinavia and Germany , the most ethnically desirable and elite , followed by the Alpine whites , from eastern and central Europe , and finally the Mediterraneans .
Everyone else was identified as black , red , yellow or brown , which included South Asians .
The social web has filled our websites with too much third - party clutter as we figure out the best way to integrate content with the favorite sites and preferences of our visitors .
Intelligent websites should tune - in to the content preferences of their visitors , tailoring a specific experience based on each visitor ’s favorite sites and services across the social web .
In this post I will teach you how to mine the rich treasure trove of personalization data sitting inside your visitor ’s browser history for deep personalization experiences .
I first blogged about this technique almost two years ago but I will now provide even more details and example implementations .
Web browsers store a list of web pages in local history for about a week by default .
Your browsing history improves your browsing experience by autocompleting a URL in your address bar , helping you search for previously viewed content , or coloring previously visited links on a page .
Link coloring , or more generally applying special CSS properties to a : visited link , is a DOM - accessible page state and a useful method of comparing a known set of links against a visitor ’s browser history for improved user experience .
New Site
Visited site
A web browser such as Firefox or Internet Explorer will load the current user ’s browser history into memory and compare each link ( anchor ) on the page against the user ’s previous history .
Previously visited links receive a special CSS pseudo - class distinction of : visited and may receive special styling .
< style type =" text /css " > ul#test li a:visited {color : green ! important} </ style > < ul id =" test " > < li >< a href = " http://example.com/ "
>
Example</a></li> </ul >
The example above defines a list of test links and applies custom CSS to any visited link within the set .
Your site ’s JavaScript code can request each link within the test unordered list and evaluate its visited state .
Any website can test a known set of links against the current visitor ’s browser history using standard JavaScript .
Place your set of links on the page at load or dynamically using the DOM access methods .
Attach a special color to each visited link in your test set using finely scoped CSS .
Walk the evaluated DOM for each link in your test set , comparing the link ’s color style against your previously defined value .
Record each link that matches the expected value .
Customize content based on this new information ( optional ) .
Each link needs to be explicitly specified and evaluated .
The standard rules of URL structure still apply , which means we are evaluating a distinct combination of scheme , host , and path .
We do not have access to wildcard or regex definitions of a linked resource .
In less geeky terms we need to take into account all the different ways a particular resource might be referenced .
We might need to check the http and https versions of the page , with and without a www .
prefix to more thoroughly evaluate active use of a particular website and its pages .
I group my tests into sets of URL s with the most likely matches placed at the beginning of the set .
I evaluate each link in the set until I find a match thereby exhausting positive indicators of site activity while prioritizing the data scan .
Live demo s and examples
Sniffing a visitor ’s browser history has good and evil implications .
An advertiser can determine if you visited Audi ’s website lately , drill down on exact Audi models , and offer related information without ever placing code on the Audi website .
I have been scanning the browser history of my site visitors for the past few months and I have coded a few examples to show benevolent uses for improved user experience .
Online aggregators
Clusters of feed subscription buttons clutter our websites , displaying tiny banner ads for online aggregators of little use to most of our site visitors .
My blog checks a known list of online aggregators against the current visitor ’s browser history and adds a targeted feed subscription button for increased conversion .
A Google Reader user will see an “ Add to Google button ” and a Netvibes user will see an “ Add to Netvibes ” button without cluttering up the interface .
I insert direct links to each site ’s feed handlers to help convert the current visitor into a long - term subscriber .
Once I match a particular service I could also check to see if the current visitor is already subscribed to my feed .
I would simply need to run a second test against the data retrieval URL , such as feedid=1234 , to match web traffic with subscriber numbers .
Visit my live example of link scanning popular online feed aggregators for a demo and the applicable code .
Social Bookmarks
I like to see my latest blog posts spread all over the web thanks to social bookmarking sites and other methods of content filtering and annotation .
Most sites spray a group of tiny service icons near their blog posts and hope a visitor recognizes the 16 pixel square and takes action .
Suck .
There has to be a better way .
I can scan a current visitor ’s browser history to determine an active presence on one or more bookmarking sites .
Once I determine the current visitor is also a Digg user I can show live data from Digg.com to prompt a specific action such as submitting a story or voting for content .
I can create a much better user experience for 3 services I know my visitor actively uses instead of spraying 50 sites across the page .
Visit my live example of link scanning popular social bookmarking sites for a demo and the applicable code .
OpenID providers
OpenID is an increasingly popular single sign - on method and centralized identity service .
OpenID lets a member of your site sign - on using a username and password from a growing list of OpenID providers including your instant messenger , web portal , blog host , or telephone company account .
Visitors signing up for your site or service should n’t have to know anything about OpenID , federated identities , or other geeky things , but should be able to easily discover they can sign - in with a service they already use and trust every day .
I can scan a list of sign - in endpoints for a list of OpenID providers and only present my site visitor with options actually relevant to their everyday web usage .
Prompting a user to sign - in to your service with their WordPress.com account should be much more effective than an input field sporting an OpenID icon .
Link scanning for active usage should increase new member sign - ups , reduce support costs due to yet another username and password , and make your members happy .
Visit my live example of link scanning current OpenID providers for a demo and applicable code .
Mapping services
Online mapping services have changed the way we interact with location data .
Need to get to 123 Main Street ?
Not a problem , I ’ll just send that data over to your favorite mapping service to help you find your way .
I can scan a visitor ’s browser history to determine their favorite mapping service .
Perhaps she is most comfortable with MapQuest , Google Maps , or Yahoo .
Or maybe she uses a Garmin GPS unit and would prefer a direct sync with that specialized service .
Determining my visitors ’ favorite mapping tool helps me deliver a valuable visualization or link I know they prefer .
Visit my live example of link scanning map API providers for a demo and applicable code .
Websites should take advantage of the full capabilities of modern browsers to deliver a compelling user experience .
Built - in capabilities such as XMLHttpRequest took years of implementation before finding its asynchronous groove in data - heavy websites .
I hope we can similarly probe other latent useful features to improve the social web through more personalized and responsive experiences .
I have been the browser history of my website visitors for the past few months to gracefully enhance adding my Atom feed to their favorite feed reader .
Easily recognized branding such as “ Add to My Yahoo ” has yielded much higher conversion rates than a simple Atom link with a minimal effect on page load performance .
Dynamically checking for active usage of 50 or so aggregators allows me to extend my total test list and promote an obscure tool that might never make the cut for permanent on - screen real estate .
How will your site utilize your visitor ’s browser history for a more custom user experience ?
How will you connect data in new ways once you have concrete knowledge of the new feature developments that will be most useful to your visitors ’ online lifestyle ?

A National Journal survey of members of Congress found that 74 percent of Congressional Republicans do not believe that global warming is caused by humans .
The poll asked 39 Democrats and 39 Republicans if they thought that " it 's been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Earth is warming because of man-made pollution " .
The answers are anonymous , except for party affilliation .
Only 26 percent of Republicans answered yes , with the rest answering no .
Among Democrats , 95 percent answered yes .
The survey 's results include some choice anonymous quotes from the deniers :
" Reasonable people have doubts .
For every Al Gore , there is an intelligent scientist armed with legitimate facts to debunk him . "
" In the ' 70s , the ' consensus of scientists ' was that we were beginning global cooling .
Now it is global warming .
Excuse me if I am skeptical of this newest form of secular religion .
Perhaps we should pause and take a breath before we drink the new Kool - Aid ! " [ Ed. note :
As the scientists at RealClimate demonstrate , there was no such consensus on global cooling in the 1970s . ]
" If there 's one thing poll after poll indicates , it 's that the science is not settled on this issue . "
" What has been proven is that a well - targeted pop-culture campaign can trump even the best of science .
The bad news is , a very few will get very rich , and the rest of us will foot the bill with mythical creations like cap and trade .
The impact of such programs on the environment : Zero .
The cost to the American public : Huge .
The grin on Al Gore 's very wealthy face : Priceless ! "
The survey quotes both Democrats who responded no .
" [ Evidence is conflicting on whether ] warming is man-made , but there should n't be any doubt that a man -made solution is needed .
The trend wo n't reverse on its own . "
" This global - warming debate is a farce . "
Of the ten Republicans who responded yes , the National Journal quotes one of them :
" Put it this way :
Is there anyone who reasonably believes that the emissions caused by man have no effect on the environment ?
It does n't take a degree in science to accept the concept that the actions of billions of people driving millions of cars do indeed impact the world around us . "

Explanation : How do large storms evolve on Saturn ?
On Earth , a hurricane can persist for weeks , while the Great Red Spot on Jupiter has been in existence for over 150 years .
On Saturn , a storm system has now set a new endurance record , now being discernable for greater than three months .
Electrical signals were detected from the storm in late November of 2007 , while the above image was taken in early March 2008 .
The storm has roughly the width of planet Earth .
Planetary scientists hypothesize that the storm runs deep into Saturn 's cloud tops .
The above image is shown in exaggerated colors combining violet and green light with light normally too red for humans to see .
Visible on the upper right are shadows of Saturn 's expansive ring system .
Careful inspection will reveal Saturn 's small moon Janus just below a ring shadow .
Understanding weather on other planets helps atmospheric scientists better understand our Earth 's weather .
Observers of our Solar System 's huge ringed world will be tracking the storm to see how it evolves and how long it will ultimately last .

Re : your posting entitled " hockey ? " Thank you soooo much for your lovely posting about the upcoming Ducks / Sens finals .
Your instincts are spot on , of course , for Canadians love to be belittled by Americans not only with respect to our national pastime but on the grounds of our mere existence as well !
It was so considerate of you to get up on your Southern California soapbox in an attempt to inform your poor , deprived , igloo - dwelling neighbours to the North about things we ’ve never known .
In particular I think we really appreciated learning that hockey has never even been on your radar because of the “ … plethora of choices regarding how to fill free time … there are sports , such as baseball , or basketball . ”
Well , whaddya know !
For a few decades there I think we really believed that hockey was itself a sport ; we ca n’t thank you enough for pointing out the error of our ways .
I mean , ninety years of professional - level competition in North America , people for whom the game is a full - time job , a standard set of rules by which one must play , a nine - month NHL playing season in which there are televised matches every week , multi-million - dollar contracts for boys in men ’s bodies , organized leagues for kids , adults and seniors – male and female – across Canada , the US and Europe … oh yes , and the men ’s and women ’s teams at the winter Olympics , the mother of all sporting competitions .
Clearly nothing about hockey qualifies it as a sport , and it ’s simply that we Canadians have been mistaken these past 150 - odd years .
Thanks to you , Anaheimer , we will all start watching real sports from now on .
I ’m sure you ’ll have a list of stellar recommendations like NASCAR and WWE .
Of course , with the abundance of outdoor things to do in sunny SoCal , such as “ … mountains to hike or ride a bicycle in [ and ] the gorgeous pacific ocean to swim in or sun ourselves beside . ”
Well – Canada certainly has no mountains .
I mean , the Rockies definitely do n’t extend into Alberta or British Columbia , and the Appalachians have n’t dominated the northern Québec landscape for the past umpteen millennia .
There ’s certainly no thought of hiking or biking through these nonexistent mountains .
We would n’t dream of going hiking in our snowshoes , and we ’ve never even heard of this bicycle you mentioned – does it work like a dogsled team , but with the dogs pulling a two - wheeled sled ?
And swimming ?
Forget swimming , I ’m sure no one in Canada has ever even thought about this ocean of which you speak , especially not any of the 3 million people living in the greater Vancouver and greater Victoria metro areas .
Now granted Ottawa is n’t even remotely near the Pacific , but even still , there ’s no way you ’d catch anyone from this city swimming in or taking the sun by the Ottawa River , the St. Lawrence , Lake Ontario , or any of the hundreds of other body of water in a hundred - kilometre radius .
I mean , what would we be thinking – swimming , in the outdoors , in late May , in Canada ?
Nonsense , we ’re still in our parkas !
But what has really impressed us , Anaheimer , is actually not the way in which you so joyfully condescend towards us about sports and leisure .
Although we ’re eternally grateful for all that your posting has taught us about the great outdoors , that ’s not what impresses us most .
Nor did our jaws drop at your unequivocal prediction about two teams and a game you self - professedly “ … do n’t know shit about . ”
Rather , we are fully in awe over your ability to honestly and unapologetically be forthcoming about your own ignorance : “ [ A ]lso , since we 're being open and honest here , until about 12 hours ago i'd never even heard of ottowa [ sic ] .
” Wow , Anaheimer – we can only imagine how much courage and strength of character that kind of declaration required .
How admirable !
I mean , to tell the world that you ’d never even heard of Ottawa !
That takes guts .
Of course , I ’m sure in your case the ignorance you profess is forgivable .
After all , there ’s certainly no reason for Ottawa to appear on your radar .
As Canada ’s fourth - largest city , host of a half - dozen of internationally - acclaimed festivals such as Winterlude and BluesFest , and the seat of the Canadian federal government and the Supreme Court , not to mention its location just 95 km north of a U.S. border and its job as this year ’s host to the FIFA U - 20 World Cup ( oh wait , maybe football , or soccer as you call it , is n’t a sport either ? ) , there ’s simply no reason you should ever have heard of Ottawa .
I can understand completely how Ottawa could fail to catch your attention in the recent past .
I mean , really , our annual murder rate of under 40 victims in a city of 1.5 million is too low to draw attention to the city .
And it ’s not like anything controversial ever happens here – the permissive marijuana laws we enjoy , our legalization of gay marriage , our outspoken disapproval of the invasion of Iraq , and the extremely antagonistic relationship between your quick - witted , upstanding , brilliant president and our human - rights supporting , left - leaning , multilingual former Prime Minister Chrétien , all of which came out of Ottawa , certainly did not garner the attention of fair and unbiased American news sources such as FoxNews or CNN .
Oh and by the way , your consistent misspelling Ottawa in your post is a brilliantly effective way of driving your point home .
Excellent tactic .
So thank you , Anaheimer , for reminding those of us in Ottawa , and Canadians in general , of how insignificant we are in the grand scheme of things .
Now that we know that Southern California ’s offerings in terms of the great outdoors are vastly superior to the paltry oceans , forests , lakes , mountains , ski hills , hiking trails , white water rapids , national parks , waterfalls and wildlife reserves that are within a short distance of Ottawa , we ’ve realized the errors of our ways .
Perhaps if we were to model ourselves after you by doing such things as swimming when it ’s warm , cycling ( whatever that means ) to get to work , playing sports or “ laying out ” ( translation for Canadians : this is American - speak for what is grammatically correctly referred to as " taking the sun , " " tanning , " or " voluntarily inducing skin cancer " ) the average Joe could really learn to appreciate , treasure and preserve all of the pleasures of the outdoors .
And you know , we could learn a thing or two from people like you about how to acknowledge , respect and learn from people of other nations and cultures .
Although it would mean that we would have to forget everything we ’ve ever learned about current affairs and geography , unquestioningly assume that if it did n’t originate in America it ’s not worth our time , proclaim our superior certainty on subjects we ’re certain only that we know nothing about , and unabashedly profess our ignorance of basic general knowledge for the whole world to hear , well then tabarnac les amies et amis , we ’d certainly be better off doing so if it meant we could be more like you .
I mean , after all , what Canadian would n’t want everyone else on the planet to think we ’re a bunch of self - righteous , ignorant fucks ?
Yours truly , Woman from Montréal who Does n’t Give a Shit About Hockey
The latest iPods have a cryptographic " checksum " in their song databases that prevents third - party applications from synching with the portable music players .
This means that iPods can no longer be used with operating systems where iTunes does n't exist — like Linux , where gtkpod and Amarok are common free tools used by iPod owners to load their players .
Notice that this has nothing to do with piracy — this is about Apple limiting the choices available to people who buy their iPod hardware .
I kept my iPod when I switched to Ubuntu Linux a year ago , and I 've been using it happily with my machine ever since ( though it took me a solid week to get all my DRMed Audible audiobooks out of iTunes —
I had to run two machines 24/7 , playing hundreds of hours of audio through a program called AudioHijack , to remove the DRM from my collection , which had cost me thousands of dollars to build ) .
I 'd considered buying another iPod when this one started to show its age — it 's a perfectly nice player to use , provided you stay away from the DRM .
The new hardware limits the number of potential customers for Apple 's products , adding engineering cost to a device in order to reduce its functionality .
It 's hard to understand why Apple would do this , but the most likely explanations are that Apple wants to be sure that competitors can't build their own players to load up iPods — now that half of the major labels have gone DRM free , it 's conceivable that we'd get a Rhapsody or Amazon player that automatically loaded the non-DRM tracks they sold you on your iPod ( again , note that this has nothing to do with preventing piracy — this is about preventing competition with the iTunes Store ) .
It wo n't be the first time Apple has rejigged iTunes / iPod to lock out competitors : back when Real built a DRM player for its own music that would run on an iPod , Apple threatened to sue them and engineered a firmware update to break their code ( again , nothing to do with fighting piracy ) .
This is the soul of anti-competitiveness : Real made code that iPod owners could use to get more legal use out of their iPods , Apple threatened to sue them for endangering their monopoly over delivering iPod software .
This is all par for the course , of course .
Businesses have taken countermeasures to prevent competitors from interoperating with their products for decades .
Apple had to break Microsoft 's file - formats to give Numbers , Pages and Keynote the ability to read Office files — they 're enthusiastic participants in " adversarial compatibility . "
Decades ago , IBM lost a high - profile lawsuit against competitors who'd been making compatible mainframe accessories and selling them for less than IBM , wrecking IBM 's business - model of selling cheap mainframes and charging a fortune for accessories .
The law of the land has generally been that compatibility is legal , even if it undermines your profitability — making a product does not create a monopoly over everything that your customers might do with that product .
That was then .
Now , Apple has the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act on its side , which makes it illegal to " circumvent an effective means of access control " — that is , to break DRM .
I do n't know if Apple will invoke the DMCA against people who break this latest measure ( they threatened Real with the DMCA before ) but I guarantee you that the attorneys and investors advising potential iTunes competitors are going to be very conservative about this .
The upshot is that iPod owners and the public interest lose out , because competitive products that expand the utility of the iPod are less likely to come into existence , thanks to the DMCA and Apple 's locking technology .
I guess my next player wo n't be an iPod after all .
With the release of the new range of iPods – the new Nano , the iPod Classic and the iPod Touch , we were expecting more of the same – a few tweaks here and there and everything would be fine .
No so .
At the very start of the database , a couple of what appear to be SHA1 hashes have been inserted which appear to lock the iTunes database to one particular iPod and prevent any modification of the database file .
If you try to do either of these , the hashes will not match and the iPod will report that it contains " 0 songs " when the iTunesDB would otherwise be perfectly adequate .

As the opening of the Olympic Games in Beijing draws near , spare a thought for a Chinese peasant named Yan .
He lives in the mountains about an hour 's drive north of the main Olympic Green , not far from the Great Wall .
His village , Shijiayao , is wasting away .
That 's because authorities in Beijing , bent on fueling the capital 's epic growth , have commandeered nearly every drop of water they can pump from the surrounding countryside .
Deprived of government help to drill wells or dam springs , Shijiayao's 30 inhabitants — all that 's left of a population of about 300 peasants two decades ago — have no water to farm their terraced fields .
They subsist on a rain - dependent crop and on raising a few scrawny donkeys , which they sell for cash or slaughter for meat .
Shijiayao's main water source is a seep in a notch in the barren mountainside , which drips about a dozen bucketfuls a day — except in summer , when it dries up completely .
No one bathes in Shijiayao .
Next month , while visitors to Beijing amble along man-made lakes and fountains at the grand Olympic Green and Olympic Forest Park , Shijiayao residents will trek about 12 miles a day for drinking water .
Li Feng Xian , the village 's 91 - year - old matriarch , pleads with us to tell Shijiayao ’s story and bring its inhabitants water .
( View slideshow . )
Adding to these water woes : May 's earthquake in south - central China that killed tens of thousands and injured about 250,000 .
The quake also sent engineers scurrying to inspect 400 dams across the nation , highlighting yet another risk of relying on distant water sources for a city the size of Beijing .
What happens if the infrastructure fails ?
Part of the problem is a decade - old drought that has sapped water supplies across northern China .
But the main cause of Shijiayao 's decline and the collapse of many other nearby villages goes back over a thousand years , to the demands of imperial Beijing — which is currently in a headlong rush to stoke economic growth in China 's big cities .
Even in wet years , peasants in the highlands north of the capital are no longer permitted to cultivate rice because growing the staple requires too much water .
Instead , the runoff from their lands is captured for the Miyun Reservoir , Beijing 's last repository of unpolluted surface water .
Now the Olympics are exacerbating China 's water problems .
To ensure enough potable water for an expected 1.5 million visitors in August , Beijing is tapping 80 billion gallons of so - called backup supply from four reservoirs in neighboring Hebei Province .
Yet water levels in these reservoirs are already dangerously low .
So to sustain the population boom on the semiarid Beijing plain , China 's water planners are scrambling to build pipelines , canals , and water tunnels farther and farther into the hinterlands .
Worse , the water routed from Hebei to the Olympics site was supposed to shore up Lake Baiyangdian , an environmental jewel with its own drought problems .
To feed the lake , China is pumping 40 billion gallons of water from the Yellow River in Shandong Province , 250 miles away .
For every gallon from the Yellow River that arrives at the lake via the 1,400 - year - old Grand Canal , nearly four gallons are lost along the way , according to the Dazhong Daily , a state newspaper in China .
Beijing itself is quietly sinking .
With much of its surface water fouled by pollution — and a population that has exploded from 2 million in 1948 to 18 million today — the city relies on groundwater for most of its needs .
But drought and overpumping are rapidly depleting the area 's underground aquifer , causing sinkholes that have destroyed factories and homes .
Subsidence is threatening sections of the Beijing - Shanghai railway line and parts of the city 's international airport .
" Subsidence security " is a major issue .
So it 's easy to see why many Chinese environmentalists regard the splashy Olympic site in Beijing as a Potemkin village .
The rowing and canoeing venue is on the Chaobei River , but the Chaobei has n't flowed in nine years .
To refill two miles of dry riverbed , organizers spent $ 57 million diverting 450 million gallons of water from the Wenyu River eight miles away .
The Chaobei now boasts one of Asia 's most potent fountains , its water jet thrusting 450 feet in the air .
Almost half of the Olympic events will take place at the Olympic Green , a symbol of China 's pledge to throw a green Olympics .
The 1,000 acres of wetlands , lawns , plazas , and stadiums are carved right into the concrete core of north - central Beijing .
In 2004 , as part of an effort to find an architecture firm for the Olympic Green and the adjoining Olympic Forest Park , China 's Olympic organizers asked for bold ideas in urban ecology .
Sasaki Associates of Boston won the contest with a blueprint for an aquatic landscape of rain - fed canals and lagoons designed to support wildlife in the urban park .
Within months , though , the plan encountered problems .
" We saw it all unravel before our eyes , " says Mark Dawson , the project 's leader .
Chinese officials were concerned that locals would hunt any animals or waterfowl reintroduced to the city , Dawson says .
The officials opted instead for a shallower aquatic system — decorative , not ecological — fed by an existing canal just north of the site .
The American designers knew that farmers and others depended on that canal for water and felt such a diversion would be counter to the spirit of the green Olympics that China had promised .
In the end , the project was reassigned to several Chinese design institutes .
Beijing 's water bank , in the surrounding Hebei Province , is broke .
Among China 's provinces , Hebei ranks near the bottom for available water resources in per capita terms , at just 12 percent of the national average .
In southwest Hebei , an obelisk atop Xidayang Dam , a two - hour drive from Beijing on jammed country roads , bears slogans from Chairman Mao glorifying the " taming " of China 's rivers .
Built in 1958 by 84,000 workers , the dam created a reservoir that flooded 1,700 square miles , as well as the homes of 29,000 people .
The reservoir supplies water to Baoding , a city of 11 million ; next month , somehow , it will also supply the Olympics .
Yet since 1996 , its water level has steadily retreated ; it 's now at less than 30 percent of its capacity .
The drought has left the dam and a pair of pipeline - control stations looming 10 stories above the reservoir .
Downstream , in Wangdu County , villagers have turned a dried - up , tree - lined canal into a garbage dump .
A pipeline from Xidayang now bypasses the villages , carrying water destined for Beijing via a new cement - lined channel that workers are rushing to complete for the Games .
In Yan 's village of Shijiayao , summer rains cascade down the denuded mountainside , flooding paddy terraces and the access road .
But with no storage facilities , the village can't save the runoff .
Yan says his people have but one hope : that the sprawling capital will grow to engulf them and thus permit them to tap their own water supplies .
I am sad that the Wii as been left out , I bought this for the GameCube ( about time ! ) last week and it truly is a special game .
I had only played the first hour or so on a friends Xbox , but when I have the time , I hope to see it to the end .
Again ... another big title missing the Wii .
Well I made my choice and I will live with it .
The good still outweights the bad of other consoles by far ...
TJX Companies , the mammoth US retailer whose substandard security led to the world 's biggest credit card heist , has fired an employee after he left posts in an online forum that made disturbing claims about security practices at the store where he worked .
Security was so lax at the TJ Maxx outlet located in Lawrence , Kansas , that employees were able to log onto company servers using blank passwords , the fired employee , Nick Benson , told The Register .
This policy was in effect as recently as May 8 , more than 18 months after company officials learned a massive network breach had leaked the details of more than 94 million customer credit cards .
Benson said he was fired on Wednesday after managers said he disclosed confidential company information online .
Other security issues included a store server that was running in administrator mode , making it far more susceptible to attackers .
He said he brought the security issues to the attention of a district loss prevention manager name Allen in late 2006 , and repeatedly discussed them with store managers .
Except for a stretch when IT managers temporarily tightened password policies , the problems went unfixed .
" I was basically hitting a glass wall , " said Benson , a 23 - year - old freshman at the University of Kansas who worked at TJ Maxx beginning in October 2005 .
" Not one single thing was done .
My store manager even posted the password and username on a post - it note .
I told her not to do that . "
So last August , Benson took to Sla.ckers.org , a website dedicated to web application security , and began anonymously reporting the shoddy practices in this user forum .
Over the next nine months , he left eight posts in which he chafed at the password policy and what he should do about it .
" I am not sure if this is just an isolated incident within this specific store , but it goes to show that you can't trust a company to protect your information , especially TJX , " Benson wrote under the moniker CrYpTiC_MauleR .
" Today was a very sad day for me =o ( "
A TJX spokeswoman declined to comment for this story and turned down our request to discuss the company 's policies for passwords and other security matters .
Benson 's May 8 posting was prompted by news that managers had changed the password for employees to access the store server .
Inexplicably , it was set to blank .
When Benson first began working for TJX , his password was the same as his user name , he said .
Then came word in January 2007 that unknown hackers had brazenly intruded on the company 's network over a 17 - month period .
For a time following the disclosure , TJX employees were required to use relatively strong passwords .
The change to a blank password clearly represented a step backward , Benson thought .
The posts eventually caught up to Benson .
On Wednesday , while marking down items on the TJ Maxx retail floor , he was summoned to the store office .
Inside , a regional loss prevention manager told him his critiques had come to the attention of the company hired to monitor internet postings about the retailing giant .
The manager told Benson he was being fired for disclosing confidential company information .
No one at Sla.ckers.org was willing to defend TJX or the shoddy security practices it is accused of following , but some have questioned Benson 's decision to speak so openly .
" I would assume your disclosure of your company 's inner server workings on the internet means that they can't trust employees to protect their information ? " one forum participant wrote in a response to Benson 's posts .
But critiques like that seem to overreach .
Benson 's disclosures were n't specific enough to give attackers information needed to successfully breach TJX 's networks .
And when you consider the right of TJX's customers and employees to know that their data may be at risk , it 's not unreasonable to call him a whistleblower .
The account has us wondering if other TJX employees have tales similar to Benson's .
If so , please contact your reporter using this link .
( Anonymity assured . )
For Benson 's part , he has no regrets .
" They 're telling the public they 're PCI compliant , " he said , referring to so - called payment card industry security rules governing businesses that accept credit and debit cards .
" That I think is unethical . "
But he says his actions were also fueled by a healthy dose of self - interest .
" My information is still on that server , " he continued , referring to the machine that sits in an office at the TJ Maxx where he once worked .
" So if their network is insecure , then my information is insecure .
I 'd prefer they get it fixed . " ®

" Here 's O'Reilly 's complete , three - segment , testosterone - amped , failed attempt to take down McClellan on tonight 's O'Reilly Factor ... "
Maybe he's on steroids which would explain his thick skulled rages .

I hope you are right Brad .
And if McClellan is legitimate in his endeavors and not spinning for some potential reverse psychology win by the republican side , than he does deserve a heartfelt thank you .
And he should feel welcome in America , land of the free home of the brave .
Peace .

O'Reilly is one of the few people I can think of that I can say I truly despise .
I really find it almost impossible to listen to him , although I forced myself to , in this case .
It is simply amazing to me that such an obviously psychologically damaged person has the position and audience he has in this country .
He is really at least as misguided and self - aggrandizing as Joseph McCarthy was , although , despite his threats , bombast and self - delusion , he certainly lacks the power to make people 's lives difficult in the way that McCarthy did .
Thank goodness for that !
All that said , McClellan did hold his own and did n't back down in the face of O'Reilly 's bullying tactics .
I have to admit that , as much as I disliked McClellan for the role he played as the voice of the Bush Administration , I have to grudgingly say that what he is doing takes a lot of guts .
His book and apparent epiphany certainly put him in " No - Mans - Land " as he alienates his former allies but is unlikely to be fully accepted or trusted by the left , either .

Yeah Scotty , ( during pillow talk : ) try to get Jeff Gannon to write a book , now that 's dirt I 'd love to read .
I want to believe that he is seeing the light but will wait and see .
( Instinctively , I ask what is the ulterior motive . )
He did say he would give a percentage of the sales to returning vets ... so that 's an A +.

Brad : Nice notes .
I 've known Scott ( a little ) for a long time , and I have to say that I think ( a ) this is the strongest interview I 've seen him do , ever , with anyone , and ( b ) you are right to characterize his views as heartfelt and courageous .
Agree with Scott or not , he has clearly not taken the easy way out on any of this .
And you are right to rebuke the progressives who condemn Scott with a knee - jerk reaction .
I say integrity is welcome wherever and whenever it rears its pretty little head .

I am on the fence about Scott McClellan .
I suspect writing the book was therapeutic and probably did stir some insights .
And I agree he has not picked the easy way out .
He could have written a loyalist tract , or a sentimental memoir void of information and opinion .
He did n't .
He is being treated alot like David Addington by the Press and I suspect almost any figure from the Administration will suffer the same fate .
There will be no Deep Throat revelations I 'm afraid .
But there will be bits and pieces to fit together for quite a few years --- long enough for the NeoCon diehards to compose a counter - narrative and start over .
And that is what makes me angry .
I know they will because there has been no silver bullet , no Deep Throat , no history - making convictions .
Abramhoff's story had the most potential to bring Bush to a halt , and it was deftly shuffled off to Buffalo .

I had always thought that Ari Fleischer 's departure was due to him not being able to stomach the bullshit anymore .
Considering his reaction to McClellan , I was clearly wrong on that count - I expected a tell - all book from him .
But it was also apparent that Scott became less and less of a capable liar for the Bush Crime Family as time went on .
It 's an interesting position to be in ( interpret ' interesting ' as you will ) to have a job where your primary duty is to tell lies and dance around the truth .
Eventually it has to fall apart ( oh what a tangled web we weave ... )
Think Dana Perino will last through January ?

US women voters head to Obama after Clinton departure : poll Agence France - Presse
Published : Sunday June 15 , 2008

Print This Email This WASHINGTON 
De facto Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama has rapidly picked up support from women voters in the wake of Hillary Clinton 's withdrawal from the campaign , according to a Gallup poll out on Wednesday .
Between the eve of the final primaries on June 3 and Monday , Obama 's support among all women in polling matchups with Republican rival John McCain has jumped to give him a 13 - point margin in this voter group .
According to Gallup , in its surveys covering June 5 - 9 , Obama was supported by 51 percent of women voters compared to 38 percent for McCain .
A week earlier , Obama topped McCain with just a 48 - 43 percent spread .
Gallup pointed out that Obama 's support among women voters is now close to the steady 52 percent level Clinton had in earlier theoretical matchups with McCain , whom she led in this group by 12 points .
It said that the shift of older and married women to Obama appeared to explain his surge .
Married women backed McCain 52 - 40 percent in the previous poll , and are now evenly split 45 - 45 percent over the two .
Meanwhile unmarried women liked Obama by 57 - 32 percent and 57 - 31 percent in the earlier May 27 - June 2 poll and the most recent poll , respectively .
" Now that Clinton is no longer campaigning and the focus of voters ' decision - making is a choice between Obama and McCain , female voters may be taking a second look at Obama , " Gallup said .
" Indeed , his current 13 - point advantage over McCain is essentially the same advantage that Clinton held over McCain throughout her active candidacy . "
Among male voters Obama also picked up ground on McCain .
McCain led his Democratic rival in the earlier poll by six points , 49 - 43 percent .
In the newest poll , McCain maintained only a two - point spread , 47 - 45 percent .
The Gallup poll was conducted between May 27 and June 2 among 5,270 voters and has a two - point margin of error .
A Rasmussen Institute poll carried out June 7 - 9 shows that Obama is ahead of McCain by seven points , 50 percent against 43 percent .
An NBC / Wall Street Journal poll to appear Thursday in the newspaper confirms the tendency in Obama 's favor .
Forty - seven percent of those polled plan to vote for Obama against 41 percent that support McCain , a broader margin for Obama when compared to the same poll in April ( 46 - 43 percent ) .
According to the poll , 54 percent of those surveyed believed " it is important to look for a person who will bring greater changes to the current policies even if he is less experienced and tested , " against 42 percent that supported a " more experienced and tested person even if he brings fewer changes to the current policies . "
And 59 percent said they believed it was " time to have a president who will focus on progress and help move America forward , " against 37 percent who said it was " time to have a president who will focus on protecting what has made America great . "
The WSJ / NBC poll was conducted June 6 - 9 among 1,000 voters , and has a 3.1 point margin of error .
Bash provides two modes for command line editing - emacs and vi .
Emacs editing mode is the default and I already wrote an article and created a cheat sheet for this mode .
This time I am going to introduce you to bash 's vi editing mode and give out a detailed cheat sheet with the default keyboard mappings for this mode .
The difference between the two modes is what command each key combination ( or key ) gets bound to .
You may inspect your current keyboard mappings with bash 's built in bind command :
$ bind - P abort can be found on " \C - g " , " \C - x \ C- g " , " \M - \C - g " .
accept - line can be found on " \C-j " , " \C-m " .
alias - expand - line is not bound to any keys ...
To get into the vi editing mode type
$ set -o vi
in your bash shell ( to switch back to emacs editing mode , type set -o emacs ) .
If you are used to a vi text editor you will feel yourself at home .
The editing happens in two modes - command mode and insert mode .
In insert mode everything you type gets output to the terminal , but in the command mode the keys are used for various commands .
Here are a few examples with screenshots to illustrate the vi editing mode .
Let ' [ i ] ' be the position of cursor in insert mode in all the examples and ' [ c ] ' be the position of cursor in command mode .
Examples :
Once you have changed the readline editing mode to vi ( by typing set - o vi ) , you will be working in insert mode .
The example will be performed on this command :
$ echo arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 < strong >[ i]</ strong >
Example 1 :
Suppose you have typed a command with a few arguments and want to insert another argument before an argument which is three words backward .
$ echo arg1 < em > ( want to insert arg5 here ) </ em > arg2 arg3 arg4 < strong >[ i]</ strong >
Hit ' ESC ' to switch to command mode and press ' 3 ' followed by ' B ' :
$ echo arg1 < strong >[ c ]</ strong>arg2 arg3 arg4
Alternatively you could have hit ' B ' three times : ' BBB ' .
Now , enter insert mode by hitting ' i ' and type ' arg5 '
$ echo arg1 arg5 < strong >[ i]</strong>arg2 arg3 arg4
Example 2 :
Suppose you wanted to change arg2 to arg5 :
$ echo arg1 < strong >[ c ]</ strong>arg2 arg3 arg4
To do this , you can type ' cw ' which means ' change word ' and just type out ' arg5 ' :
$ echo arg1 arg5 < strong >[ c ] </ strong > arg3 arg4
Or even quicker , you can type ' f2r5 ' , where ' f2 ' moves the cursor right to next occurrence of character ' 2 ' and ' r5 ' replaces the character under the cursor with character ' 5 ' .
Example 3 :
Suppose you typed a longer command and you noticed that you had made several mistakes , and wanted to do the correction in the vi editor itself .
You can type 'v' to edit the command in the editor and not on the command line !
Example 4 :
Suppose you typed a long command and remembered that you had to execute another one before it .
No need to erase the current command !
You can switch to command mode by hitting ESC and then type ' # ' which will send the current command as a comment in the command history .
After you type the command you had forgotten , you may go two commands back in history by typing ' kk ' ( or ' 2 k ' ) , erase the ' # ' character which was appended as a comment and execute the command , this makes the whole command look like ' ESC 2k0x ENTER ' .
These are really basic examples , and it does n't get much more complex than this .
You should check out the cheat sheet for other tips and examples , and try them out !
To create the cheat sheet , I downloaded bash - 2.05 b source code and scanned through lib / readline / vi_keymap . c source code file and lib / readline / vi_mode .c to find all the default key bindings .
It turned out that the commands documented in vi_keymap .c were all documented in man 3 readline and I did n't find anything new .
After that I checked bashline .c source file function initialize_readline to find how the default keyboard shortcuts were changed .
I found that ' CTRL - e ' ( which switched from vi mode to emacs ) got undefined , 'v' got defined which opens the existing command in the editor , and ' strong > @ </ strong ' which replaces a macro key ( char ) with the corresponding string .
The cheat sheet includes :
Commands for entering input mode ,
Basic movement commands ,
Character finding commands ,
Character finding commands ,
Deletion commands ,
Undo , redo and copy / paste commands ,
Commands for history manipulation ,
Completion commands ,
A few misc .
commands , and

Pre-Trial Juvenile Lockup In Massachusetts Disproportionately Impacts Youth Of Color
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2582 or 2666 ; media@aclu.org
BOSTON – A widespread practice in Massachusetts of locking up youth accused of minor offenses and who pose little or no danger to their communities is unfair , threatens public safety and wastes public money , according to a report released today by the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Massachusetts .
The report , entitled " Locking Up Our Children : The Secure Detention Of Massachusetts Youth After Arraignment And Before Adjudication , " documents the use of detention by state judges as a rehabilitative tool to frighten youth never convicted of wrongdoing .
The report also addresses the woeful lack of placement availability in the state 's child welfare and mental health systems that leave detention as the only viable option for youth who cannot safely be returned to their homes .
" Massachusetts is simply locking up too many kids charged with delinquent behavior before a formal determination of their guilt or innocence , " said Robin Dahlberg , senior staff attorney with the ACLU Racial Justice Project and the principal author of the report .
" Thousands of youth who are neither flight risks nor dangers to their communities are detained while they await trial .
This only exacerbates any existing behavioral problems or educational difficulties and is a significant and wasted expense to taxpayers . "
According to the report , Massachusetts detains a higher percentage of youth pre-trial than 33 other states .
The Commonwealth detains 5,000 to 6,000 youth in secure facilities each year , many of whom do not appear to be high - risk .
Last year , 78 percent of them were charged with misdemeanors or low - level felonies , and more than 80 percent of them were eventually released back into their communities after spending an average of 25 days in lockup awaiting arraignment .
Additionally , youth of color make up 60 percent of those in detention , even though they comprise only 20 percent of Massachusetts ' juvenile population .
The report also concludes that the overuse of pre-trial lockup wastes taxpayer dollars .
In 2006 , it cost roughly $ 16,000 to detain a youth for 16 days in a secure lockup .
By comparison , it costs taxpayers less than $ 1,500 to provide six to eight weeks of supervision to ensure that youth permitted to remain at home return to court .
" Far from assisting youth in dealing with the issues that may have gotten them into trouble , secure detention is one of the most accurate predictors of future criminal behavior and other problems , " said Amy Reichbach , racial justice advocate with the ACLU of Massachusetts .
" This approach is failing both youth and our communities . "
Key communities in Massachusetts are particularly affected by the over - reliance on detention of youth .
For example , youth in Worcester County are detained at a higher rate than youth in other counties : 83 percent of detained kids are charged with misdemeanors or low - level felonies .
In Springfield , 40 percent of all youth arrests are for misbehaving or acting out at school .
And in Holyoke , 25 percent of all kids are arrested for school - based offenses .
" Massachusetts should create effective alternatives to pre-trial lockup and reserve secure detention for the relatively small number of children who truly need it , " said Carol Rose , Executive Director of the ACLU of Massachusetts .
" We should invest our scarce tax dollars more wisely to keep our kids in school rather than in lockup and , in so doing , make our communities safer in the long run . "

DRIVING less  fewer miles or smaller vehicles  is the rational response to higher fuel prices .
But there ’s something else motorists can do : drive smarter .
In Europe , where gas prices are often more than twice what they are here , eco-driving has become mandatory in the driving curriculums in Germany , Sweden and , most recently , Britain .
Beginning drivers are taught to avoid idling , unnecessary braking and jackrabbit starts at traffic lights , among other lessons that can bring fuel savings to as high as 25 percent .
Other fuel - saving tips include carefully timing one ’s approach to slowing traffic or red signals and not accelerating toward a “ stale green , ” that is , a signal that ’s about to change .
As the United States has no national driving standard , establishing a similar curriculum here would be challenging .
It may be even harder to get people to forsake the temptations of hurry - up - and - wait driving .

Noblesville Daily Times , by John W. Whitehead —
We have a president who does just about whatever he wants , the Constitution be damned .
He has , among other things , asserted unchecked unilateral power , conducted surveillance on American citizens in violation of federal law and ignored universal prohibitions on torture .
And although years from now historians may refer to the “ Bush Doctrine ”  in much the same way that they talk about the Monroe or Truman Doctrines , they will most likely not hold it in the same esteem .
President James Monroe , faced with the possible threat of Europe colonizing countries in the western hemisphere , declared the U.S. the protector of independent nations in the Americas .
Following the end of World War II , President Harry S. Truman issued a policy of foreign aid intended to challenge Soviet ambitions throughout the world .
However , unlike the attempts of Bush ’s predecessors to serve American interests by defending or aiding foreign interests , Bush ’s so - called “ preemptive military action ”  doctrine employs the very opposite strategy .
It suggests that whatever foreign nation does not stand with the U.S. must , by default , stand against us .
The critical corollary to this doctrine insists that Bush , acting in preemptive self - defense of his country , has a right to use force “ “ that is , declare war “ “ on a potentially aggressive foreign nation .
For the present time , Iran seems to fit the bill .
In fact , war with Iran may be imminent .
As security analyst Philip Giraldi , a former CIA officer , recently wrote :
There is considerable speculation and buzz in Washington today suggesting that the National Security Council has agreed in principle to proceed with plans to attack an Iranian al - Qods - run camp that is believed to be training Iraqi militants .
But does President Bush have the authority to unilaterally declare war against a foreign nation without the approval of Congress ?
Not according to our founding fathers .
The framers of the U.S. Constitution , distrustful of the British king ’s power to declare war and raise fleets and armies , intended to ensure that Congress alone should have the power to initiate military action against other nations , while at the same time making the president commander - in - chief .
As James Madison opined , “ Those who are to conduct a war cannot in the nature of things , be proper or safe judges , whether a war ought to be commenced , continued , or concluded . ” 
Thus Article 1 , Section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress “ “ not the president “ “ the power to declare war .
However , the Constitution does grant the president the authority to act without the approval of Congress , but only when it is in self - defense .
Attempts have been made over time to weaken or redefine the Constitution ’s definitive statement of who can and cannot make a declaration of war .
For example , in 1973 , Congress passed the War Powers Resolution , which gives a president the authority to wage war abroad for 60 days without congressional approval .
It is questionable whether this act , if challenged , would hold up to constitutional muster .
The Bush Doctrine of preemptive military action , at least as applied to Iran , is exactly the type of military action the framers intended to be the decision of Congress , not the president .
Even the knowledge that Iran might be developing nuclear weapons at the present time ( several other world powers share this distinction , including the U.S. , China , India , Israel , Russia and the U.K. ) , there is no indication that Iran poses an immediate threat to the U.S. , let alone a threat greater than that presented by any other rogue nation .
Yet apparently the Bush Administration has plans to conduct preemptive military action against Iran .
This has raised serious concerns in Congress .
As House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers , D - Mich. , in a letter to Bush on May 8 , writes : “ Our concerns in this area have been heightened by more recent events .
The resignation in mid-March of Admiral William J. “ ˜ Fox ’ Fallon from the head of U.S. Central Command , which was reportedly linked to a magazine article that portrayed him as the only person who might stop your Administration from waging preemptive war against Iran , has renewed widespread concerns that your Administration is unilaterally planning for military action against that country .
This is despite the fact that the December 2007 National Intelligence Estimate concluded that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in the fall of 2003 , a stark reversal of previous Administration assessments . ” 
Certainly , the framers never intended that a president , acting independent of Congress , have the power to wage war against another country merely on the basis of a potential threat .
The framers did not believe in entrusting “ a single man ”  with the decision to commit troops and finances to war , which would , in essence , be a dictatorship .
The framers left the war - making decision to the “ deliberative process in Congress . ” 
In this way , nothing but a clear national interest can draw us into war .
As the past has clearly shown , when we wage undeclared war “ “ as we did in Vietnam and now in Iraq “ “ we can be assured that the result will be immeasurable loss , regret and a nation divided .
And for Bush to ignore the rule of law under which this nation operates is to ignore our Constitution .
The duty of the president of the United States of America is not to carry out his own objectives but to lead and serve the American people while upholding the Constitution .
To act otherwise “ “ especially in matters of war “ “ is an impeachable offense under Article II , Section 4 of the Constitution .
As Senator Joseph Biden , D - Del. , has said : “ The president has no authority to unilaterally attack Iran , and if he does , as Foreign Relations Committee chairman , I will move to impeach him . ” 
And as Conyers wrote in his May 8 letter to Bush : “ We agree with Senator Biden , and it is our view that if you do not obtain the constitutionally required congressional authorization before launching preemptive military strikes against Iran or any other nation , impeachment proceedings should be pursued . ” 

Only gasoline prices nearing $ 4 a gallon could accomplish this political feat : bringing together congressional Democrats and Republicans to support a halt to oil deliveries for the nation ’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
With fuel costs becoming a crucial election - year issue , members of both parties -- separately -- pitched their ideas Wednesday for bringing down prices .
Democrats called for a windfall profits tax on oil companies , rolling back tax breaks for the industry and new protections against price - gouging , while Republicans urged increased exploration for new domestic oil sources .
About the only proposal their plans had in common was to stop the delivery of 70,000 barrels of oil a day for the emergency stockpile .
President Bush has resisted suspending deliveries , contending it would weaken the nation ’s defenses against an interruption in the flow of foreign oil .
The reserve , set up after the 1973 Arab oil embargo , holds about 700 million barrels in salt caverns along the Gulf Coast .

Bush also has asserted that halting deliveries would do little to bring oil prices down .
After all , 70,000 barrels represents a small fraction of the 20 million the nation uses every day .
Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman , in a recent letter to lawmakers , said that in light of “ significant risks in the oil market from geopolitical instabilities among some producing countries , terrorist threats to production globally , and natural disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita that can seriously disrupt supply to our country . . . the United States must look to strengthen our energy insurance policy , not weaken it . ”
But Democrats said the suspension would put more oil on the market and save motorists about 2 cents to 5 cents a gallon .
In a letter to Bush on Wednesday , nearly 100 House members said that deferring deliveries or releasing oil from the reserve could also curb speculation in oil markets .
An increasing number of Republicans have joined Democrats to back a halt to oil deliveries , noting that gas prices have never been this high .

“ There are few actions that can be taken that will have a near - term impact on the price of oil and gasoline , ” Sen. Charles E. Grassley ( R - Iowa ) said in a letter this week to Bush .
“ However , halting the deposits of crude oil in the [ Strategic Petroleum Reserve ] is a small but positive step that can increase the supply of crude oil in the market , and hopefully reduce the price at the pump . ”
Sen. Byron L. Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) said he would try to add a measure that would suspend the oil deliveries to a war - funding bill .
“ I think it ’s nuts , at $ 120 a barrel for oil , to put up to 70,000 barrels a day underground , ” he said Wednesday .
Otherwise , in a day of political maneuvering over gas prices , the parties agreed on little else .
Democrats unveiled a package that would impose a windfall profits tax on oil companies and roll back industry tax breaks to raise money to promote cleaner energy sources and energy - efficient technology .
They also proposed regulation aimed at cracking down on speculation in oil markets .

Notably missing from the bill is a summer moratorium on the federal gas tax that has become a hot issue in the presidential campaign .
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) support the idea ; Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) opposes it .
Republicans moved swiftly to attach their own proposals , heavily tilted toward promoting domestic production of oil , to a bill before the Senate .
Their proposals include opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to energy exploration and relaxing the long - standing ban on new drilling off the East and West Coasts .
Most of the parties ’ proposals are not new and have failed to pass before .
But legislation is n’t their only goal .
Lawmakers want to show they are sympathetic to public anger over high prices , and are using their energy proposals to highlight differences between the parties before the fall election .

“ The Democrats ’ plan to reduce gas prices is running on empty , ” said Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico , the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee .
“ Americans do n’t need more taxes and more investigations ; they need more oil and lower prices . ”
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) responded : “ Bush Republicans ’ only answer ” is to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
“ We can not produce our way out of the problems that we have . ”
Democrats hope to bring up their proposals for a vote in the Senate before the Memorial Day recess .

This week , the television upfronts  in which the broadcast networks present their schedules to advertisers  will open with a mystery .
Who stole six million viewers ?
That ’s the number who were watching prime time television last May , a month affectionately known as “ sweeps , ” but have disappeared this year , according to the overnight Nielsen ratings .
Each of the major broadcast networks , save for Fox , has seen its audience decline this season .
The ratings for hit shows like “ American Idol ” and “ CSI ” have approached record lows .
Where some of last May ’s 44 million viewers went is not a mystery , according to the networks .
The writers ’ strike this winter deflated the ratings and accelerated the flight of viewers to cable channels .
But the more significant shift ca n’t be blamed on the strike .
In the past television season , there has been a sharp increase in time - shifting .
Some of the six million are still watching , but on their own terms , thanks to TiVos and other digital video recorders , streaming video on the Internet , and cable video on demand offerings .
So while overall usage of television is steady , the linear broadcasts favored by advertisers are in decline .

I know extremely few people who carry around more than one mobile phone with them .
Those few that do , however , often carry a smartphone alongside a decidedly less " smart " phone ( like that free Nokia that you get when you sign up for new cell service — it works and looks like a brick house ) .
i Phone users never seem to fall into this group though — despite some gripes about AT&T's ( anecdotally horrible ) service , they tend to be pretty happy with one device .
Or so I thought .
According to new report by Rubicon Consulting , more than a third of iPhone users carry around other , second phones with them .
Not only that , but a decent chunk of those second phones are other smartphones .
Rubicon conducted a " detailed survey " on 460 randomly chosen iPhone users ( a number that our staff PhDs tell me is enough to be considered " not crap " ) and found that 36.4 percent carry a second device .
Surprisingly , the largest chunk of that 36.4 percent belongs to BlackBerry at 9.8 percent — the only explanation we can think of for this is that people are issued BlackBerrys for work and keep iPhones for personal use .
However , another 6.1 percent reported using a Windows Mobile device ( now that 's just crazy ) .
6.6 percent carry a Motorola RAZR , and the rest were split among Palm , Symbian , Sidekicks , and " other " devices .
Rubicon notes that this is just a snapshot , and the company is n't sure what will happen with the trends over time .
" As Apple adds Microsoft Exchange compatibility to the iPhone , it 's possible that some of the dual users will discard their Blackberries , " wrote the company .
" On the other hand , the people carrying both may be doing so because they want to use the Blackberry 's built - in keyboard to type messages , and Apple has announced no plans for an iPhone with a keyboard . "
Now , I might just be a purist when it comes to minimizing the crap I carry around with me , but statistically , some of you have to be carrying around more than one phone .
Fess up :
Who are you , and why do you torture yourselves like that ?
Over -fishing and demand for their fins as a delicacy have hit shark numbers Between a quarter and a third of the world 's wildlife has been lost since 1970 , according to data compiled by the Zoological Society of London .
Populations of land - based species fell by 25 % , marine by 28 % and freshwater by 29 % , it says .
Humans are wiping out about 1 % of all other species every year , and one of the " great extinction episodes " in the Earth 's history is under way , it says .
Pollution , farming and urban expansion , over - fishing and hunting are blamed .
River dolphin
The Living Planet Index , compiled by the society in partnership with the wildlife group WWF , tracks the fortunes of more than 1,400 species of fish , amphibians , reptiles , birds and mammals , using scientific publications and online databases .
DEMANDING HUMANS
See the pressure we are putting on the planet
It said numbers had declined by 27 % in the 35 years from 1970 to 2005 .
Some of the worst hit are marine species which saw their numbers plummet by 28 % in just 10 years , between 1995 and 2005 .
Populations of ocean birds have fallen by 30 % since the mid 1990s , while land - based populations have dropped by 25 % .
Reduced biodiversity means millions of people face a future where food supplies are more vulnerable to pests and disease and where water is in irregular or short supply
James Leape
Director general , WWF UK Among the creatures most seriously affected have been African antelopes , swordfish and hammerhead sharks .
Another , the baiji - or Yangtze River Dolphin - may have been lost altogether .
The findings were released ahead of a meeting of the Convention on Biodiversity in the German city of Bonn .
The convention was signed in 1992 with the aim of stabilising the loss of species .
In 2002 , member states pledged to achieve a " significant reduction " in the current rate of biodiversity loss by 2010 .
But the Zoological Society said governments had since failed to put in place policies necessary to achieve that goal .
It said that while species ' decline does appear to have flattened off in recent years , it is " very unlikely " that the 2010 target will be reached .
Impact on humans
The WWF said that over the next 30 years , climate change was also expected to become a significant threat to species .
Land - based species , such as African antelopes , have fallen by 25 % Colin Butfield , head of campaigns at WWF UK , said : " Biodiversity underpins the health of the planet and has a direct impact on all our lives , so it is alarming that despite an increased awareness of environmental issues we continue to see a downward trend . "
The charity also warned that a failure to stop biodiversity loss would have a direct impact on humans .
Director general James Leape said : " Reduced biodiversity means millions of people face a future where food supplies are more vulnerable to pests and disease and where water is in irregular or short supply .
" No - one can escape the impact of biodiversity loss because reduced global diversity translates quite clearly into fewer new medicines , greater vulnerability to natural disasters and greater effects from global warming . "
The WWF is calling on governments meeting in Bonn to honour their commitments to put in place effective protected areas for wildlife and to adopt a target to achieve net annual zero deforestation by 2020 .
The UK's Biodiversity Minister , Joan Ruddock , said the report showed that the international community had to work together to stem the decline .
" The fact that human activities have caused more rapid changes in biodiversity in the last 50 years than at any other time in human history should concern us all , " she said .
" Supporting wildlife is critical to all our futures and the UK will continue to give strong support to international action .
" Schemes such as the Darwin Initiative have used UK expertise to help more that 490 wildlife conservation , regeneration and research projects in 146 countries . "
Lifestyles and the consumption of resources vary widely from country to country .
On average each person needs 2.2 global hectares to support the demands they place on the environment , but the planet is only able to meet consumption levels of 1.8 global hectares per person .

Why a scared expression brings a survival advantage
You wrinkle your nose and squint when you see a dead rat in the road , but open your eyes , nose and mouth wide when you see a live one in your bedroom .
Why ?
Common facial expressions like disgust and fear , new research suggests , do more than just convey how you are feeling – they alter your sensory relationship to the world around you .
Charles Darwin , noticing that some facial expressions seem to hold across cultures and even species , proposed that they function to improve certain senses .
Now Joshua Susskind and colleagues at the University of Toronto , Canada , have put that to the test .
Advertisement
The team wanted to know if fear , and its apparent sensory opposite , disgust , changed the way we use our senses .
They hypothesised that the former , with its open eyes , raised eyebrows and gaping mouth , led to greater sensory acquisition , allowing greater vigilance , and disgust , with the face all scrunched up , led to less .
Face of fear
In one experiment , volunteers had to identify when a dot entered their visual field , while they maintained fearful , neutral or disgusted expressions .
In another , also with these expressions , they had to move their eyes as quickly as possible between two targets about 30 centimetres apart on a computer screen while their eyes were tracked .
The amount of air that could be breathed in while showing fear and disgust was also measured .
In each case , the researchers found , the expression of fear – or the “ Home Alone face ” , as Susskind nicknames it – let significantly more of the world in .
Speedy senses
The open eyes allowed quicker detection of objects on the periphery , as well as faster eye movements back and forth , while an open nose took in more air with each breath without any extra effort .
An MRI scan confirmed the difference in the space in the nasal cavity .
“ These changes are consistent with the idea that fear , for example , is a posture towards vigilance , ” says Susskind , “ and disgust a posture towards sensory rejection . ”
Further experiments , he says , will explore to what extent the brain actually uses this extra information to enhance performance .
Cognitive neuroscientist Elizabeth Phelps at New York University , US , thinks the research could open up a whole new way of thinking about facial expressions .
“ What was nice was the number of different ways they got at this question , ” she says .
Journal reference : Nature Neuroscience ( DOI : 10.1038/nn.2138 )
Each month , the Bureau of Labor Statistics gathers 84,000 prices in about 200 categories — like gasoline , bananas , dresses and garbage collection — to form the Consumer Price Index , one measure of inflation .
It ’s among the statistics that the Federal Reserve considered when it cut interest rates on Wednesday .
The categories are weighted according to an estimate of what the average American spends , as shown below .
I 'm on the road again today with my wife , son and two dogs .
Trish is driving us back from El Paso , Texas to Denver .
I spent a longish weekend visiting my mom and step - dad and since I 'm going to be reviewing Wii Fit soon for Kotaku , I decided to bring along my Wii and a copy of the game .
Advertisement
Shortly after setting it up my step - dad wandered into the room to see what was going on .
My son was hammering away at the Ski Jump mini game and it was n't long until he wanted to give it a try .
My step - dad , you may recall , is the one who fell asleep watching me play Grand Theft Auto IV .
It 's an understatement to say that gaming is n't his thing .
But after about 15 minutes with the game he went to go get my mom .
I think she 'd really like this , he said .
Advertisement
Turns out she did .
She likes it so much that I left my Wii Fit with them , but only after they promised to buy a Wii once they could locate one .
Even more surprising , my wife , someone who does n't like to talk about games or watch me game , let alone play games , actually stepped onto the Balance Board to give it a try and said she wanted to " check it out " in more depth when we got home .
Chills , it gave me chills .
The thing is , I 'm still slightly convinced that the Wii Fit is the Brain Age for the Wii. Brain
Age was the game that convinced thousands of aging baby boomers , including my mom , to buy the DS only to use it for a week , maybe a month , and then forget the device .
I can say with 100 percent authority that my mom has n't just given up on the DS , she 's forgotten she owns it .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
The Wii Fit will certainly strike a chord with some aging baby boomers , but I think it will strike a bigger chord for that group one generation younger so worried about their health and physique .
But will it really get them into gaming ?
I do n't think so .
When deciding whether they were going to buy a Wii , my mom and step - dad asked me if it came with Wii Sports .
Then they asked if they would ever need to buy another game again .
I 'm thinking this is more about buying an ideal , a concept : That Wii Fit will make them fit , or healthier , than it is about getting them interested in gaming .
Advertisement
As much as I want to believe Nintendo 's line , that the Wii in breaking from tradition and cutting a path into the untapped non-gamer , general population , I think what they 're really doing is finding ways to attract people to gaming who will rarely stick to it by tapping into the fears of an aging population .
* Source code and Eagle PCB files : CapsLockerPCB&Code.zip *
Just in time for April Fool 's Day !
I built a device that has the potential to drive a computer user insane .
This device plugs into a USB port and implements a USB HID keyboard .
Instead of doing anything useful , it waits between 30 seconds and 8 minutes and sends the scancode for the Caps Lock key .
This will toggle the Caps Lock status on or off .
Since the operating system controls the LED on the keyboard , the Caps Lock light also toggles .
This makes it appear the user has accidentally pressed the Caps Lock key ... until it happens 20 or 30 times and they get suspicious .
Then they might see the Caps Lock light turn on by itself .
Next is a sequence of reboots , bashing the keyboard on the desk , clicking through the Control Panel , possibly even replacing the keyboard .
Unless they notice the tiny little device sitting in one of the USB ports on the back of their computer , nothing will help .
Disclaimer :
This device provides keyboard input to a computing device outside of user control .
It is intended for experimentation and demonstration purposes only .
It should never be used in a situation that can result in loss of data , property , or finances .
It should never be used in a situation that could cause harm to a person via operation or failure .
Usage of this device is beyond my control and I am not responsible for any damages resulting .
The CapsLocker was built on an Atmel AVR ATTiny45 , and heavily based on the EasyLogger application from ObDev .
Very little code modification was necessary to get the random Caps Lock activation working .
This is a single - sided PCB with a couple of jumper wires for simplicity .
If I had decided to use the test clips from the beginning , the jumper wires would be unnecessary .
Here are some additional photos showing the installed device and heatshrink over the part that extends from the USB port .
Some have commented on the apparently dirtiness / hairyness of my computer .
It really does n't look that bad until you get up close and use a camera flash .
That particular computer has been sitting in the same place on the floor for a year or two , so dust does accumulate .
It 's probably time to find the vacuum cleaner attachment kit .
Adapter used for programming the device over ISP :
Updates :
Since using test clips directly to the ATTiny 45 leads was working fine , I modifed the PCB design so that no jumper wires are required .
The size remains the same .
Here 's the new design :
And here 's the schematic :
The PCB and schematic were created in Cadsoft Eagle .
Here is a zip file containing the Eagle project file , schematic , PCB , and a tiled PCB :
CapsLocker.zip
I 've created a tiled set of PCBs .
This is handy when using the toner transfer method of etching , or when creating more than one device .
Here is a PDF of tiled arrangement , already mirrored so that it is ready to print for toner transfer :
capslockerpcb_tiled.pdf
Parts List :
Construction :
Print the mirrored PCB on glossy photo paper and trim to the size needed .
Iron onto freshly - scoured copper clad until firmly attached .
Soak at least 30 minutes in water , then carefully peel off the paper .
Fibers will still be attached , rub these off with fingers or a soft toothbrush .
Place board in etching solution until all exposed copper is gone .
Use solvent such as acetone to scrub off the toner .
Use PCB shear or diamond cutoff wheel to cut board to edge of dotted line around PCB .
Solder parts onto PCB .
It may also help to tin the USB pads , to prevent connection problems due to oxidation .
We 're not going to be using gold plate , so solder will have to do .
Commenter " Stev " says :
I just started putting mine together and wanted to add to your section on etching & soldering .
If you coat the PCB with a clear Acrylic spray paint after removing the toner it will act as a sealant to protect the copper from oxidation .
You 'll still need to tin the USB connection pins , but the other traces will be protected .
It will also act as a flux to prevent solder crossover to adjacent pins .
Trim piece of plastic to size of PCB and super glue to the bottom side .
Important : make sure the plastic shim is wide enough to prevent the PCB from sliding sideways in a USB port ... test it .
The required thickness of the plastic will also depend on your PCB thickness .
The total thickness at the USB connector should be just under 2.0 mm or 0.079 inches ; trim or sand the plastic to match .
Too thick may break the computer 's USB connector , too thin may not allow a good connection .
Using reference from AVR ISP connector pinouts and the pin names on the schematic , find a way to connect an ISP header to the PCB temporarily .
My solution involved a USB jack and two fine - tipped test clips .
Other possible solutions may involve a jig with spring pins , kynar wire temporarily soldered to the right locations , or a clip that fits over the SOIC8 on the PCB .
All of the above eventually must connect to an AVR ISP header , and this must be connected to a PC through an AVR ISP adapter .
These are inexpensive and available from several sources : USBTinyISP , AVRISP , AVR Dragon , and many more Google can tell you about .
Download capslocker .hex and use AVR Studio or a standalone programming tool to write into the ATTiny45 Flash .
Oh , you 'll also need to select the fuse for PLL / 1 k clock source .
If you want to see and / or modify the source code , here it is : CapsLockerPCB&Code.zip
The ZIP file above contains the PCB , schematic , and C source code .
It is based on the latest version of the EasyLogger code .
I 've imported everything into an AVR Studio project , but it can be compiled with standard GCC tools that have ATTiny 45 support .
I have trimmed out the portions of code that were not necessary in this application , and added the modifications required to press the Caps Lock key at random intervals ( psuedorandom , the same pattern will occur on every powerup ) .
As the code will make evident , the Objective Development software USB library makes it extremely simple to create a USB device .
Future development :
Develop firmware that allows switching between mouse and keyboard , user selectable pools of keypress options , phrases , timing configuration , etc .
All controlled via Control reports from an application on a PC .
Device would wait for 15 seconds after being plugged in , and begin normal operation if the configuration application did not contact it during the startup time .
Now that the Stumblepede is mostly over , I 'm going to trim out some of the less - relevant comments below .
Your humor was appreciated . :)
With better imaging and analysis techniques , details about icons of design are coming into clearer focus .

5th Annual Best Visual Illusion of the Year Contest - 2008 First Prize
この画像は，視覚科学会 ( Vision Science Society ) が主催の " Best Visual Illusion of the Year " において 2008 年大賞を受賞した作品。中央の点を見つめていると，輪郭だけの十字模様の中にもうっすらと色がついているように見えてくる。いわゆる残像 ( afterimage ) を利用した錯視の一種 。
これはあまり派手な錯視ではないけれど，面白いところがいくつかある。
まず，普通に残像を利用した錯視というと，下の画像のようなものが多い。こんな感じの派手な色の模様を数十秒間凝視して，それから余所を見ると，そこに残像がモヤっと見えますよ……というようなもの。
この手の錯視では，モヤっとした曖昧な残像しか見ることができない。それに対して，件の大賞の錯視では，輪郭の中が比較的はっきりと塗り潰されているような感覚を得られる。しかも，その輪郭の変化によって残像の内容も変化する。これは非常にユニークな点だ。
元の模様の色と，残像として現れる色が，それぞれ反転しているのも面白い。元の模様では，縦横の十字が緑色で，斜めの十字が赤色なのに対して，残像の方では縦横が赤，斜めが緑になっている。
残像がそれぞれ単色になっているのも面白い。元の色付きの模様では，２つの色が部分的に混ざり合っている。これだと，残像の方も混ざった色になってしまいそうなものなのだけれど，実際には綺麗な単色で塗り潰されているように見える。
静止画の残像というのは，視神経が色の刺激に慣れてしまうことから生じる現象だから，色が反転することについては簡単に説明することができる。ただ，残像の内容が輪郭の形状によって変化することや，残像が単色になることなどは，「視神経の慣れ」だけでは理由を説明することができない。
これは，静止画の残像現象が，網膜のような感覚器のレベルで起こるものではなく，形状の認知などが影響を与えうるような比較的高次のレベルにおいて起こっていることを示唆しているように思える。
( via Mixing Memory )
I should preface this entire post by noting that I have n’t used Erlang , just read about it , and I handle most concurrency using Python threads , a model for which I have no great affection ( or hate ) .
But I was reading two posts by Patrick Logan on Erlang and it got me thinking again .
From my reading and what I ’ve heard from other people , Erlang the language - and - syntax seems quite crufty .
Erlang is not the Complete Package , the language that will make you leave your wife , the language that will have you walking into telephone polls because it ’s just so hot that you ca n’t take your eyes off it .
Erlang is not that language .
People seem to get excited about two things in Erlang : the concurrency model and pattern matching .
I ’m not quite sure why people are excited about pattern matching .
Pattern matching is n’t particularly hard to implement , though maybe it interacts with other aspects of the system in a way I do n’t understand .
I remain skeptical that it ’s anything special .
Then there is the concurrency model ( and its associated message passing ) , and this does strike me as special .
You can kind of implement that model in Python , but with none of the concrete benefits .
These are the useful features I see in the concurrency model :
Erlang processes are share - nothing .
The processes are light weight .
You can start lots of processes , and they start quickly and can die off quickly without any great overhead .
They are n’t OS - level processes .
These are sometimes called green processes or microprocesses .
There are many implementations of microthreads in Python , but you lose the benefits of share - nothing .
The runtime makes light weight processes feasible as well .
The OS overhead of a Python process is actually just a small part of the total overhead when spawning a process .
Loading and initializing the runtime libraries of a Python program of even modest complexity is problematic .
I ’m not sure exactly how Erlang does this , but I suspect it ’s because libraries can be safely shared because Erlang is a functional language .
( PHP is also like this , with most of the library written in a sharable C library . )
1 and 2 can be handled with the right VM .
This is n’t a particularly common VM design , but it ’s certainly doable .
3 is tricky , and effects the language design .
I do n’t think it effects the language design as greatly as to require a functional language .
It requires that sharable code itself be a functional ( i.e. , immutable ) subset of the language .
What the code does does n’t have to be functional , only what the code is .
To explain this , functions in most languages are immutable .
Python functions are n’t actually immutable , but they are close enough that hardly anyone would notice if you made them immutable ( right now you can overwrite their name , compiled code , and some other stuff — but almost no one actually does this ) .
The function may have side effects , but as long as the function object is immutable then it can be shared safely among processes .
You can extend this to the module as a whole .
This means you could n’t monkeypatch objects in the module , and module - level assignments would effectively be constants .
Any module - level objects would have to be immutable .
Things like classes , which are also a kind of module - level object , would also have to be immutable — meaning things like class variables would be immutable .
It could still be possible to do module - level code if there was a way of freezing the module after its instantiation ( this would be important for Python , as even decorators are a kind of code run at import time ) .
Adding a general concept of “ freezing ” to the language might be the most general and expedient way to make modules sharable .
The other half of the concurrency model in Erlang is message passing .
Erlang processes send messages around like other systems send methods .
It would be possible to use exactly Erlang ’s system , as it ’s not Erlang - specific and has been ported to many languages .
Though I ’d be somewhat more inclined to use bencode as it has some cleverness in its design .
Or perhaps JSON , just because .
Regardless of the format you are always passing around data , which I think is important .
Systems that pass around “ objects ” become complex , mostly because you just cannot pass objects around and so those systems are just complex facades built around data exchange .
Lately I ’ve become fond of thinking of objects as views over a more fundamental data structure ( WebOb is strictly based on this pattern ) .
Methods are details of the implementation , but only the data can mean something to someone else .
At least this is the worldview you start to internalize when you think about REST a lot .
( My post Documents vs. Objects is also about this . )
Arguable a plain - data - with - views world is just the dynamic - weak - typed anti-pattern .
That anti-pattern is one where you get all the disadvantages of dynamic typing , and all the disadvantages of static typing , all in one ugly bundle .
Erlang ’s records remind me of this anti-pattern .
Instead of dictionaries everything is a tuple , and getting a record is just syntactic sugar mapping record names to indexes — all in the context of a dynamically typed language where you could mistype a value and get strange output as a result .
The strong - static typing solution to the type problem involves complicated contracts , aka “ service descriptions ” , the stuff of WS -* , CORBA IDL , etc .
The strong - dynamic typing solution is that every object have an explicit type .
This is fine for things we all agree on : lists , dictionaries , bytes , numbers .
Sadly even a basic thing like unicode strings cause problems , as do dates , but at least those have straight - forward solutions ( you add more basic types to the message format ) .
More complex types , like a domain object ( e.g. , a user record ) are difficult .
Are they all just dictionaries ?
Dictionaries plus special metadata ?
XML namespaces address this problem in some ways , but are also the point at which XML starts to just piss people off and make them want to use JSON .
And for good reason , because XML namespaces force you to define entities and responsible parties very early on , possibly long before you know what you are actually trying to do .
Besides XML , are there other systems that are n’t just naive / unextendable ( bencode , JSON ) and are still basically dynamically typed ?
This is the kind of thing I would really love to see PyPy experiment with .

In a 268- 155 vote , the Democrat - held House agreed to provide the Pentagon with $ 162bn ( £ 82bn ) .
But the bill did not include any timetables for withdrawing US troops from Iraq .
President George W Bush opposes such deadlines .
The bill is now expected to be debated in the Senate in the coming days .
In a statement , the White House said it supported the measure .
Criticism
The bill allows the Pentagon to pay for US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan until mid-2009 .
It also envisages a significant increase in college education benefits for returning soldiers and help for US unemployed and flood victims in the Midwest .
If approved by the Senate , it will bring to more than $ 650 bn ( £ 330 bn ) the amount provided by Congress for the war in Iraq since the US - led invasion in 2003 .
Some Democrats criticised the bill for not setting deadlines for pulling out US troops from Iraq .
" Let us hope this is the last time another dollar will be spent without constraint , without conditions , " Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said .
Welcoming the result of the vote , House Republican Minority leader John Boehner said : " I 'm glad we 're there . "
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - The Revolutionary Guards said Iran would impose controls on shipping in the vital Gulf oil route if Iran was attacked and warned regional states of reprisals if they took part , a newspaper reported on Saturday .

Fear of an escalation in the standoff between the West and Iran , the world ’s fourth largest oil producer , have been one factor propping up sky - high oil prices .
Crude hit a record level on international markets near $ 143 a barrel on Friday .
Speculation about a possible attack on Iran because of its disputed nuclear ambitions has risen since a report this month said Israel had practiced such a strike , prompting increasingly tough talk of retaliation , if pushed , from Tehran .
“ Naturally every country under attack by an enemy uses all its capacity and opportunities to confront the enemy , ” Guards commander - in - chief Mohammad Ali Jafari told Jam-e Jam newspaper in some of the toughest language Iran has used so far .
Analysts say Iran may not match the firepower of U.S. forces but could still cause havoc in the region using unconventional tactics , such as deploying small craft to attack ships , or using allies in the area to strike at U.S. or Israeli interests .
“ Regarding the main route for exiting energy , Iran will definitely act to impose control on the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz , ” Jafari said of the Gulf waterway through which about two - fifths of all globally traded oil passes .
Iranian officials have in the past sent mixed signals about whether Iran would use oil as a weapon .
But such threats , when made , have sent jitters through the crude market for fear of disrupting supplies from big OPEC producers in the Gulf .
The Islamic Republic insists its nuclear program is peaceful and aimed at generating electricity .
But the West and Israel fear Iran is seeking to build atomic bombs .
Israel is believed to be the only Middle East state with nuclear arms .
Washington has said it wants diplomacy to end the nuclear row but has not ruled out military action should that fail .
‘ RIGHT TO RESPOND ’
“ If there is a confrontation between us and the enemy from outside the region , definitely the scope ( of the confrontation ) will reach the oil issue , ” Jafari said .
The Revolutionary Guards are the ideologically driven wing of Iran ’s military with air , sea and land capabilities , and a separate command structure to regular units .
“ After this action ( of Iran imposing controls on the Gulf waterway ) , the oil price will rise very considerably and this is among the factors deterring the enemies , ” Jafari said .
He said any military action might “ be able to delay Iran ’s nuclear activities but this delay will certainly be very short ” .
Jafari warned neighbors not to let their territory be used .
“ If the attack takes place from the soil of another country ... the country attacked has the right to respond to the enemy ’s military action from where the operation started , ” he said .
Kuwait , the launchpad for the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq , and Iraq itself , where U.S. troops are now stationed , have both said they would not let their land be used for a strike on Iran .
The U.S. military has bases in other Gulf states and Afghanistan .
Jafari said U.S. forces were “ more vulnerable than Israelis ” because of their troops in the area .
Iran ’s top authority , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has in the past said Iran would target U.S. interests if attacked .
“ Iran can in different ways harm American interests even far away , ” the Guards commander said .
Jafari suggested Iran ’s allies in the region , who include Lebanon ’s Shi’ite militia Hezbollah , could also retaliate .
He referred to Iran ’s ties with those living in Lebanon ’s Shi’ite heartland of south Lebanon but did not refer to any group .
“ Israelis know if they take military action against Iran ... the abilities of the Islamic and Shi’ite world , especially in the region , will deliver fatal blows , ” Jafari said , adding that Israel was in range of Iranian missiles .
He also hinted that Hamas , the Palestinian Islamist group that receives Iranian funding and which has sent suicide bombers into Israel , might act .
But , again , he did not name the group .

Artist 's impression of the " frog from hell "
Enlarge Image
The creature would have been the size of a " squashed beach ball " and weighed about 4 kg ( 9lb ) , the researchers said .
They added that the fossil , nicknamed Beelzebufo or " frog from hell " , was " strikingly different " from present - day frogs found on the island nation .
Details of the discovery are reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
The team from University College London ( UCL ) and Stony Brook University , New York , said the frog would have had a body length of about 40 cm ( 16 inches ) , and was among the largest of its kind to be found .
" This frog , a relative of today 's horned toads , would have been the size of a slightly squashed beach - ball , with short legs and a big mouth , " explained co-author Susan Evans , from UCL's Department of Cell and Developmental Biology .
" If it shared the aggressive temperament and ' sit - and - wait ' ambush tactics of [ present - day ] horned toads , it would have been a formidable predator on small animals .
" Its diet would most likely have consisted of insects and small vertebrates like lizards , but it 's not impossible that Beelzebufo might even have munched on hatchling or juvenile dinosaurs . "
The researchers added that the discovery of the fossil supported the theory that Madagascar and the Indian and South American land masses could have been linked until the Late Cretaceous Period ( 75 - 65 million years ago ) .
" Our discovery of a frog strikingly different from today 's Madagascan frogs , and akin to the horned toads previously considered endemic to South America , lends weight to the controversial model , " Professor Evans explained .
prime mortgage crisis , are expected to soar to as many as two million by the end of 2008 .
Two million would represent one in sixty - two households .
Even as wages stagnated in recent years , many government officials triumphantly boasted that consumer spending had continued to rise .
But this increase was largely due to soaring incomes at the top .
From 1979 to 2005 , a period when national output more than doubled , after - tax income inched up just 6 percent for the bottom fifth of American households after accounting for inflation , while it rose 21 percent for the middle fifth .
For the top fifth , income jumped 80 percent and for the top 1 percent it more than tripled , soaring by 228 percent .
A 2007 report by the Congressional Budget Office found that the top 1 percent of households had pre-tax income in 2005 that was more than two - fifths larger than that of the bottom 40 percent .
( After taxes , the top 1 percent ’s income in 2005 was still nearly 10 percent greater than the bottom 40 percent ’s . )
As Paul Krugman wrote , “ It ’s a great economy if you ’re a high -
level corporate executive or someone who owns a lot of stock .
For most other Americans , economic growth is a spectator sport . ”
The nation appears to be on the threshold of recession , and as a result , America ’s workers are likely to be squeezed not just by stagnant wages but also by rising unemployment .
One of the most worrisome  and puzzling  aspects of the economic expansion that began in November 2001 is that wages have remained stubbornly flat , after factoring in inflation , even though the jobless rate has been low by historical standards .
That wages have gone nowhere in a tight labor market underlines the American worker ’s declining ability to command higher wages , and now with unemployment increasing , workers ’
leverage to push for higher wages is bound to grow even weaker .
The squeeze is of course worst for those on the lowest rungs , including millions of workers who are part of our everyday lives : fast food workers , cashiers , child care workers , hotel maids , and nurse ’s aides .
Nearly 33 million workers  almost one - fourth of the American workforce  earn less than ten dollars an hour , meaning their wages come to less than the poverty line for a family of four ( $ 20,614 in 2006 ) .
Despite strong economic growth , the number of Americans living in poverty jumped by 15 percent from 2000 to 2006  an increase of 5.4 million to 36.5 million .
For millions of low - income workers , the promise of America has been broken : the promise that if you work hard , you will be rewarded with a decent living , the promise that if you do an honest day ’s work , you will earn enough to feed , clothe , and shelter your family .
Not only do workers on the bottom rungs lack money , but they often lack basic benefits .
Three out of four low - wage workers in the private sector do not have employer - provided health insurance , while eight out of nine do not participate in a pension plan .
Three - fourths of low - wage workers do not receive paid sick days , so if they need to miss two days ’ work because they are sick or their child is sick , they receive no pay for those days  and often risk getting fired .
A study sponsored by the Ford , Rockefeller , and Annie E. Casey foundations , “ Working Hard , Falling Short , ” concluded , “ More than one out of four American working families now earn wages so low ”  defined as income of less than twice the poverty line for a family of four ( $ 41,200 in 2006 )  “ that they have difficulty surviving financially . ”
The study continued , “ While our economy relies on the service jobs these low - paid workers fill . . . our society has not taken adequate steps to ensure that these workers can make ends meet and build a future for their families , no matter how determined they are to be self - sufficient . ”
In her book Nickel and Dimed , Barbara Ehrenreich described these workers as “ the major philanthropists of our society . ”
Ehrenreich wrote , “ They neglect their own children so the children of others will be cared for ; they live in substandard housing so that other homes will be shiny and perfect . ”
Across America more than 50 million people live in near poor households , those with incomes between $ 20,000 and $ 40,000 a year .
Katherine Newman , a Princeton sociologist , has described this large but often overlooked group as “ the missing class . ”
The mass of workers who are barely getting by is likely to grow only larger , because the Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that low - wage jobs will account for six of the top ten categories in overall job growth between now and 2014 : janitors , nursing home aides , waiters , home - health aides , retail sales workers including cashiers , and food - prep and fast food workers .
America ’s ailing health care system is a big part of the worsening squeeze .
From 2000 to 2006 , the number of Americans without health insurance climbed by 8.6 million , to 47 million .
One study found that more than two - fifths of moderate - income , working - age Americans went without health insurance for at least part of 2005 .
Not only that , for employees who want coverage , companies are requiring them to pay more for it , and as a result , the cost of family coverage has soared 83 percent in just six years .
As health costs consume more and more of the nation ’s economic output  they account for 16 percent of gross domestic product , or GDP , up from 5 percent in 1960  that necessarily leaves less money for wage increases .
Pensions , the other pillar of employee benefits , are under assault as never before .
In May 2005 , a bankruptcy judge allowed United Airlines to default on its pension plans and dump them on the federal agency that protects retirement benefits .
Because that agency guarantees pensions only up to a certain amount , many United pilots will receive only half what they expected when they retire .
United ’s move was the biggest pension default in American history , releasing it from paying $ 3.2 billion in obligations over the following five years .
One of United ’s lawyers predicted that more and more companies would use this “ strategic tool ” to increase their competitiveness .
Since then , US Airways and Delta have followed suit .
When Delphi , the auto parts giant , filed for bankruptcy in October 2005 , its chief executive , Robert S. Miller , threatened to slash the company ’s pensions unless the workers agreed to massive wage concessions .
As part of this assault on pensions , Hewlett - Packard , IBM , Verizon , Sears , Motorola , and many other companies have embraced a riskier , far less generous type of retirement plan , 401 ( k ) s , while turning away from the traditional plans that promised workers a specific monthly benefit for life after they retired .
When Hewlett - Packard took that step , a company spokesman said , “ Pension plans are kind of a thing of the past . ”
With pensions growing ever scarcer , more and more workers are convinced that they wo n’t have enough money to retire .
Ominously , some economists have begun to warn that millions of Americans might have to continue working into their seventies .
Whether it is because of an over - tetchiness but the recent report stating that stock markets were volatile because there were too many testosterone - filled men working in them just seems to be another reason for a bout of male bashing ( link ) , ( link ) , ( link ) .
However , it does again prove that men and women are different and have different motivations in life , which as ever , undermines those who think that differences in employment patterns and wages is down to sexual discrimination .
The report by John Coates at Cambridge University , and Professor Joe Herbert , a neuroscientist , set out to study the brains of City traders to discover what makes them tick .
It 's conclusion was more women and older people were needed on trading floors to stop volatility .
More ' positive action ' no doubt .
As ever , they misunderstand that no matter who works on a trading floor they are complex , challenging and competitive environments with long long hours .
By there very nature they are volatile and no matter who worked there , it would not change .
This just seemed an excuse to run an anti-male story .
In most US states , employers can ask at interview if a woman has kids - and discriminate accordingly .
Maternal profiling , as it's known , is illegal here , but , as Viv Groskop reports , in reality it is flourishing
The unlikely new face of radical women 's activism in the US ?
Meet Kiki Peppard , a 53 - year - old switchboard operator and grandmother from Pennsylvania who claims she is one of millions of victims of " maternal profiling " .
Defined as " employment discrimination against a woman who has , or will have , children " , feminist groups say that maternal profiling has reached epidemic proportions - and is getting worse .
In essence , it involves employers building up information on a woman's age , marital status and family commitments to determine whether to hire her , how much to pay her and how much responsibility to give her .
Is she likely to have children and need maternity pay ?
Will she want to work shorter hours ?
All these factors push women up against a " maternal wall " - which has been described as the new glass ceiling - potentially stopping them from landing a job for which they are specifically , even uniquely , well qualified .
Peppard has spent the past 14 years campaigning unsuccessfully for a law to ban the practice in Pennsylvania .
She experienced maternal profiling first - hand in 1994 when her husband left her and she moved from Long Island , New York , to Effort , Pennsylvania ( " The name is appropriate , " she sighs over the phone ) .
She was rejected from 19 job interviews in a row because she was a single mother to James , then 14 , and Carissa , then 11 .
" The first question was always , ' Are you married ? '
The second was , ' Do you have children ? '
After that , they stopped the interview . "
After a year on welfare she finally got a job as a secretary at a high school where they asked no questions about her childcare responsibilities .
Unbelievably , then as now , it was perfectly legal in 28 states , including Pennsylvania , for interviewers to ask questions about a job applicant 's marital status , family plans and caring responsibilities .
At the end of 2007 , the New York Times called " maternal profiling " one of the political buzzwords of the coming year .
Moms Rising , the increasingly high - profile US campaigning group which promotes mothers ' rights and has doubled its membership to 140,000 in the past year has championed Peppard 's case .
And maternal profiling is edging its way on to the election agenda : Hillary Clinton pledged her interest when campaigning in New Hampshire in October last year .
In the UK , asking questions in a job interview about a woman 's maternal status would leave an employer open to a sex discrimination case , yet there is a great deal of evidence that such profiling goes on unspoken .
And it is a practice that affects not just mothers , but all women of childbearing age .
Whether or not you intend to have children , the possibility that you might , could well be enough to put off a potential employer .
Last year , a survey by the new Equality and Human Rights Commission , headed by Trevor Phillips , found that 70 % of recruitment agencies had been asked to avoid hiring women who were pregnant or likely to get pregnant .
The commission also found that mothers face more discrimination in the workplace than any other group .
Those with children under 11 were 45 % less likely to be employed than men , with that figure rising to 49 % among single mothers .
A YouGov poll of 1,000 UK directors , also conducted in 2007 , revealed that 21 % knew of instances where their company had avoided hiring women of child - bearing age - 19 % admitted to making this decision themselves .
In the same poll , more than two - thirds of senior executives said that the bureaucracy surrounding parental leave posed a " serious threat " to their companies .
And in 2004 an extraordinary survey by HR information provider Cromer found that eight in 10 human resources managers would " think twice " before hiring a newly married woman in her 20s .
( They had fewer reservations about hiring mothers with older children , they said , as they would be " less likely to take maternity leave " . )
All of which reflects the fact that women of child - bearing age increasingly seem to be seen as " difficult " employees .
So much so , that earlier this month Alan Sugar commented that the laws preventing employers asking women about their family plans and childcare arrangements have resulted in him throwing some candidates '
CVs in the bin .
" Everything has gone too far , " said Sugar .
" We have maternity laws where people are entitled to too much .
If someone comes into an interview and you think to yourself ' there is a possibility that this woman might have a child and therefore take time off ' , it is a bit of a psychological negative thought .
" If they are applying for a position which is very important , " he continued , " then I should imagine that some employers might think ' this is a bit risky ' .
They would like to ask the question : ' Are you planning to get married and to have any children ? ' "
( In the last series of the Apprentice , of course , Sugar caused heated debate by quizzing candidate Katie Hopkins on her childcare arrangements during the final interview process . )
In the weeks since Sugar made these extraordinary comments , cyberspace has been full of ( mostly anonymous ) owners of small businesses cheering him on .
One blogger writes : " It is high time someone of high profile said what every employer is scared to say : ' I would not employ women . ' [ ... ]
The reason I do not employ women is that I run a small business and there is no way that I could fund maternity benefits . "
Another replied : " I know where you are coming from as we too are the same ... if we do look for a female staff member , we would want somebody in her late 40s or early 50s . "
And this last comment reflects an observation made by Moms Rising , which estimates that women are only safe from maternal profiling after the age of 44 , when they are considered to be past child - bearing age .
As one of the group 's activists writes on a " maternal profiling " blog : " My life and career path have not made it possible for me to settle down and have children .
However this does not keep people from discriminating against me by " assuming " that I either have children or plan to have them soon .
As if they can hear my biological clock ticking . "
This discriminatory behaviour has always taken place , of course , but it is hoped that by giving it an emotive name - with its connotations of racial profiling , and offender profiling - the problem might gain new recognition and an organised campaign of opposition .
As Kristin Rowe - Finkbeiner , president of Moms Rising , points out , " sexual harassment is a phrase that helped to spark major legislative and cultural changes .
Widespread use of the phrase ' maternal profiling ' can similarly help to spark major changes . "
She describes the incidence of discrimination as " jaw - dropping , " quoting a recent US study which showed that mothers are 79 % less likely to be hired than non-mothers with equal employment experience .
" If you 're a mother in America maternal profiling is likely to have happened to you . "
For her part , Peppard says she has never forgotten the humiliation of having to present her food stamps at the supermarket all those years ago when she was being turned down for job after job .
Her most recent attempt to pass the law stalled before it reached the state senate in November 2007 .
" Initially I kept up the momentum in the hope that I would get this law passed before my daughter was ready to enter the workforce , " she says .
" Now I 'm doing it for my granddaughter . "
Miami - based lawyer Michael Casey , who specialises in employment law , says that " so - called ' family responsibility discrimination ' claims are probably going to constitute the next wave of major litigation directed at employers in the US . "
Some US companies are already voluntarily showing support to parents , regardless of their state laws , because they fear future litigation .
But there is a knock - on effect even to these pre-emptive moves .
" Giving preferential treatment to people who have familial responsibilities has created a backlash involving employees who lack such responsibilities , " says Casey , and , in future , these childless employees could bring " reverse discrimination " suits over the injustice of always being the ones asked to work late and at weekends .
" Lawyers will be happy with that result , at least , " he adds wryly .
Meanwhile in Pennsylvania , Peppard is happy to fight on as long as it takes .
" I have written to Oprah Winfrey twice a year for the past 14 years and I contacted her again last week .
I think if she knew about this personally , she 'd call me . "
Peppard is dismissive of the ( mostly male ) legislature who wo n't pass her bill .
" I wonder if their own mothers know about what they 're doing to punish women , " she says .
" Maybe they think mothers do n't vote and do n't matter .
But we do . "
Perhaps she might do us all a favour , and write to Alan Sugar next .
Some question if report that pay - per - view system to be introduced is a hoax , but wider march to regulate the web is documented
Paul Joseph Watson / Prison Planet | June 11 , 2008
ISP ’s have resolved to restrict the Internet to a TV - like subscription model where users will be forced to pay to visit selected corporate websites by 2012 , while others will be blocked , according to a leaked report .
Despite some people dismissing the story as a hoax , the wider plan to kill the traditional Internet and replace it with a regulated and controlled Internet 2 is manifestly provable .
" Bell Canada and TELUS ( formerly owned by Verizon ) employees officially confirm that by 2012 ISP ’s all over the globe will reduce Internet access to a TV - like subscription model , only offering access to a small standard amount of commercial sites and require extra fees for every other site you visit .
These ‘ other ’ sites would then lose all their exposure and eventually shut down , resulting in what could be seen as the end of the Internet , " warns a report that has spread like wildfire across the web over the last few days .
The article , which is accompanied by a You Tube clip , states that Time Magazine writer " Dylan Pattyn " has confirmed the information and is about to release a story – and that the move to effectively shut down the web could come as soon as 2010 .
Watch the clip .
People have raised questions about the report ’s accuracy because the claims are not backed by another source , only the " promise " that a Time Magazine report is set to confirm the rumor .
Until such a report emerges many have reserved judgment or outright dismissed the story as a hoax .
What is documented , as the story underscores , is the fact that TELUS ’ wireless web package allows only restricted pay - per- view access to a selection of corporate and news websites .
This is the model that the post -2012 Internet would be based on .
People have noted that the authors of the video seem to be more concerned about getting people to subscribe to their You Tube account than fighting for net neutrality by prominently featuring an attractive woman who is n’t shy about showing her cleavage .
The vast majority of the other You Tube videos hosted on the same account consist of bizarre avante - garde satire skits on behalf of the same people featured in the Internet freedom clip .
This has prompted many to suspect that the Internet story is merely a stunt to draw attention to the group .
Whether the report is accurate or merely a crude hoax , there is a very real agenda to restrict , regulate and suffocate the free use of the Internet and we have been documenting its progression for years .
The first steps in a move to charge for every e mail sent have already been taken .
Under the pretext of eliminating spam , Bill Gates and other industry chieftains have proposed Internet users buy credit stamps which denote how many e mails they will be able to send .
This of course is the death knell for political newsletters and mailing lists .
The New York Times reported that " America Online and Yahoo , two of the world ’s largest providers of e-mail accounts , are about to start using a system that gives preferential treatment to messages from companies that pay from 1 / 4 of a cent to a penny each to have them delivered .
The senders must promise to contact only people who have agreed to receive their messages , or risk being blocked entirely . "
The first wave will simply attempt to price people out of using the conventional Internet and force people over to Internet 2 , a state regulated hub where permission will need to be obtained directly from an FCC or government bureau to set up a website .
The original Internet will then be turned into a mass surveillance database and marketing tool .
The Nation magazine reported in 2006 that , " Verizon , Comcast , Bell South and other communications giants are developing strategies that would track and store information on our every move in cyberspace in a vast data - collection and marketing system , the scope of which could rival the National Security Agency .
According to white papers now being circulated in the cable , telephone and telecommunications industries , those with the deepest pockets –corporations , special - interest groups and major advertisers –would get preferred treatment .
Content from these providers would have first priority on our computer and television screens , while information seen as undesirable , such as peer - to - peer communications , could be relegated to a slow lane or simply shut out . "
Over the past few years , a chorus of propaganda intended to demonize the Internet and further lead it down a path of strict control has spewed forth from numerous establishment organs :
The development of a new form of internet with new regulations is also designed to create an online caste system whereby the old internet hubs would be allowed to break down and die , forcing people to use the new taxable , censored and regulated world wide web .
Make no mistake , the internet , one of the greatest outposts of free speech ever created is under constant attack by powerful people who cannot operate within a society where information flows freely and unhindered .
Both American and European moves mimic stories we hear every week out of state controlled Communist China , where the internet is strictly regulated and virtually exists as its own entity away from the rest of the web .
The Internet is freedom ’s best friend and the bane of control freaks .
Its eradication is one of the short term goals of those that seek to centralize power and subjugate their populations under tyranny by eliminating the right to protest and educate others by the forum of
the free world wide web .

The consortium of American and European oil companies that had dominated Iraqi petroleum in the twentieth century is returning to Iraq to carry out service agreements aimed at expanding production in four southern oil fields .
Jonathan Steele reports ,
‘ But the deals , known as service contracts , are unusual , said Greg Mutitt , co-director of Platform , an oil industry research group .
“ Normally such service contracts are carried out by specialist companies …
The majors are not normally interested in such deals , preferring to invest in projects that give them a stake in ownership of extracted oil and the potential for large profits .
The explanation is that they see them as a stepping stone … ”
He said the companies ’ lawyers had been insisting “ on extension rights under which each company would get first preference on any future contract for the field on which it has worked ” . ’
Patrick Cockburn has more .

Bush and Cheney clearly went into Iraq primarily in order to put US petroleum firms in precisely this favored position .
The US power elite wanted this outcome and connived actively at it .
As Alan Greenspan put it , “ I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows : the Iraq war is largely about oil . ”
Poor Iraq has been looted , occupied , and disrupted by the industrialized West for a century because of the curse of its oil wealth .
The Iraqi Petroleum Company was until 1929 the Turkish Petroleum Company since it began in 1912 with a concession from the Ottoman Empire , which ruled Iraq before the 1917 British conquest .
The victors of World War I used their victory to leverage themselves into Iraqi oil .
The Ottomans had thrown in with Germany and Austria in 1914 , and were defeated by the victorious allies .
Iraq was considered a successor state to the Ottomans in its territory and so shared in the ignominy and disadvantage of defeat .
A German company was one of the original concessionaries , but the French usurped its shares as a spoil of war ; that was how the Compagnie Francaise des Petroles , now Total , got into Iraq .
And , as one of the victors in the war , the US pressed claims to enter the concession , with its oil majors eventually being awarded a quarter of the shares .
The San Remo conference of 1920 deeply disappointed Iraqis by awarding the country to Britain as a League of Nations Mandate , or colony with term limits .
The Iraqis had wanted immediate independence , and launched a months - long revolution against the British that summer .
San Remo did set aside a 20 percent share in the oil concession for Iraqis , but the Western petroleum companies refused to allow implementation of that provision , locking Iraqis out of any possession of their own petroleum .
They did offer to pay the Iraqi government a small royalty based on their profits , but said that would not kick in for 20 years !
The Iraqi Petroleum Company was notorious for not training Iraqis to fill management positions , implementing a typical colonial business model .
In 1958 the British - installed monarchy was overthrown in Baghdad by an officers ’ coup that was accompanied by popular revolt .
Gen .
Abd al - Karim Qasim [ Kassim ] in 1961 issued Law 80 , revoking the Iraqi Petroleum Company ’s claims on undeveloped fields in the rest of Iraq , beyond the ones they already had developed .
He set March , 1963 , as the date on which the decree would be implemented .
In February , 1963 , he was overthrown by the Baath Party .
It is rumored that the US was complicit with that coup , and some Baathists who made it said so .
The US also certainly did have foreknowledge of it .
If Washington thought the Baath would revoke Law 80 , however , they were disappointed .
The Baath did cooperate in destroying the Iraqi Communist Party , but it kept Qasim ’s oil law .
The Iraq Petroleum Company retaliated by keeping Iraq ’s production relatively low and so starving the government of oil rents , and by not giving Baghdad as favorable terms as some other OPEC countries .
After 8 months , the Baath was overthrown by another clique of officers , who ruled until 1968 .
The nationalist officers in Iraq were outraged by US and Dutch support of Israel in the 1967 war , and joined an oil boycott of the West that began that June .
The nationalist Iraqi regime also put pressure on other Gulf oil countries to take control of their resources away from American firms that were essentially allied with Israel via their government in Washington .
The later round of oil nationalizations were in some ways Arab revenge for the humiliating defeat in 1967 .
In 1968 the Baath returned to power in a second coup , and in 1971 President Ahmad Hasan al - Bakr nationalized the IPC .
Below is an initial CIA analysis of the 1972 nationalization of Iraqi petroleum .
I am omitting the Agency ’s incorrect prediction that Iraq would find it difficult to market its nationalized petroleum .
The CIA could not have foreseen the 1973 Arab oil boycott or the quadrupling of oil prices in the rest of the 1970s .

INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM
SOME IMPLICATIONS OF IRAQ’S OIL NATIONALIZATION
Introduction
1 . In a sudden and dramatic move on 1 June 1972 , the Iraqi government nationalized all the assets of the Iraq Petroleum Company ( IPC ) , a consortium of US , British , Dutch , and French oil firms operating in northern Iraq .
The nationalization culminates 11 years of smoldering disputes between the members of the oil consortium and the Iraqi government .
The same group of oil firms also controls the only two other non-government oil - producing companies in Iraq – the Mosul Petroleum Company ( MPC ) and the Basrah Petroleum Company ( BPC ) .
These companies , which have less production than the IPC , have not been affected by the nationalization decree .
In concert with the Iraqi move , the Syrian government seized the Syrian portion of the IPC pipeline through which the oil produced in northern Iraq is transported to ports on the eastern Mediterranean .
This memorandum describes the events leading up to the nationalization and analyzes Iraq ’s ability to maintain output and sales of the newly acquired oil .
In addition , the possible repercussions on the Iraqi economy and the world oil market resulting from the action are discussed . . .
Discussion
Background
2 . The source of the present conflict between Iraq and IPC is rooted in “ Law 80 ” promulgated in 1961 [ by Abd al - Karim Qasim ( Kassim ) ] .
From 1925 until 1961 , IPC held concessions in Iraq covering virtually the entire country .
This law withdrew from IPC all concession acreage not then being worked by IPC companies – an area amounting to more than 99 % of the total .
The canceled concessions included the potentially prolific North Rumaila oilfield that IPC had discovered and partly developed , but from which production had not yet begun .
The companies refused to acknowledge the validity of the law , and for more than a decade the dispute simmered .
Intermittent government - company discussions failed to resolve the issue .
In retaliation , IPC refused to grant Iraq the same financial benefits that other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) * were able to obtain in the mid-1960s , such as expensing royalties .
This action has led to an Iraqi claim for back payments of nearly $ 400 million .
Negotiations on the back payments claims and the North Rumaila issue took place again in January and February 1972 but ended in deadlock primarily because of IPC ’s adamant stand on compensation for the loss of the North Rumaila oilfield .
. .
3. Tensions between IPC and the government were accentuated when oil production from the northern oilfields dropped sharply during March , April , and early May 1972 .
The Iraqis regarded this cutback as a further attempt to apply retaliatory pressure against the government following the breakdown of negotiations in February .
By mid-May as the Revolutionary Command Council ( RCC ) saw the serious downturn in government oil receipts , which are vitally needed for political as well as economic reasons , IPC was threatened with confiscatory legislation if the company did not increase production from the northern oilfields , agree on a long - term production program , and make a “ positive offer ” on the other outstanding issues .
On 31 May , IPC agreed to increase production from the northern oilfields and to set up a long - range production program but continued to demand compensation for the loss of North Rumaila .
By then the RCC had already decided on the need for a dramatic political move , and Oil Minister Hamadi rejected the proposal out - of - hand , insisting that Iraq would never pay compensation for the North Rumaila field .
The nationalization law was adopted the next day .
4. IPC has six shareholders : British Petroleum ( BP ) , Shell Petroleum , and Compagnie Francaise des Petroles ( CFP ) [ Total ] , each with 23.75 % ; the two American oil companies , Mobil and Standard Oil ( New Jersey ) [ now Exxon ] , are equal partners in the Near East Development Corporation and jointly own another 23.75 % ; and the C.S. Gulbenkian Estate owns the remaining 5 % .
The company ’s production comes mainly from the Kirkuk oilfield in northern Iraq and is exported via pipeline across Syria to the eastern Mediterranean ports of Banias in Syria and Tripoli in Lebanon .
Prospects for Iraq ’s Producing and Marketing the Oil
5 . Although production has apparently now been stopped on orders from Baghdad , output could begin on short notice .
Maintaining output from the nationalized facilities and transporting the oil from the Kirkuk field to the Mediterranean ports should pose no insurmountable problems for the Iraqis .
The operation of the northern fields is already almost entirely in the hands of Iraqi nationals who are expected to remain under the new ownership .
The Syrians similarly should encounter little difficulty operating the IPC pipeline .
6. Production is not the problem , however .
The most serious problem facing the Iraqis is finding buyers .
The companies comprising IPC control a large share of the world oil market .
It is unlikely that they would agree to market the nationalized oil without an Iraqi commitment for prompt and adequate compensation .
. . “
Well , the compensation has n’t been prompt .
It is now likely to be adequate .
Pomegranate - flavoured condoms anyone ?
In Iran , sexuality in public may be cause for police harassment and worse but sexuality in private ( as long as it is heterosexual ) is there to be enjoyed as a blessing from God - or so the authorities would have it .
A decade ago there were more flavours of condom in Iran than in London , New York or Paris .
Gay people , infamously , can be singled out and killed , but gay and lesbian activity thrives in Iran 's big cities , just as in other countries that abuse such human rights .
However , it is in the realm of sex education that Iran is markedly different from most countries in the region .
HIV / Aids seems a good gauge of the effectiveness of sex education policy in terms of health .
After all , this is a country that has suffered massive violent upheaval followed by a US - fostered renaissance of drug and human trafficking on its borders .
It seems that a Shia theocracy is n't a bad system when it comes to sexual health .
While NGOs backed by politicised money like to concentrate on the bizarre emphasis of President Ahmadinejad on a ridiculous herbal " cure " for Aids , the Islamic Republic has in fact been earmarking tens of millions of dollars for Aids programmes .
It was back in 2005 that postage stamps bore the red ribbon for Aids awareness and today , vending machines in the capital sell cheap condoms and syringes .
Official estimates put the number of regular drug users in Iran at two million among a population of just over 70 million - per capita , the highest rate in the world .
The situation has worsened since start of the US - backed war in Afghanistan from where 2,500 tonnes of narcotics a year now enter the country .
It was in the 1980s - not long after Britain screened its first advertisements warning of the dangers of HIV - that the Iranian government began Aids - awareness campaigns and a modicum of sex education .
It was also around that time that campaigns were launched to promote two - children families , overturning Khomeini 's postwar policy of outlawing contraception and instructing women that their chief role was to bear children .
In 2002 , a wide - ranging study in Tabriz pointed to the effectiveness of sex education in schools in preventing the spread of HIV .
The clerics of Qom and Mashhad gave their blessing .
Nevertheless , government bureaucracy is preventing Iran from being a world - leader in HIV / Aids - prevention – specifically the lack of statistics and basic record - keeping that blights Iranian medical research in all fields .
Iran is , however , ranked by the UNDP as having some of the best health and education provision in the region .
Perhaps it 's not surprising that a country that has gone through the turmoil of a revolution and an eight - year war with Iraq should not be on top of things .
The current economic crisis alone is degenerating into a prostitution epidemic .
A remarkable facet of Shia Islam , though , is its lack of squeamishness about teaching youngsters the dangers and practicalities of sex - unlike many Christian and Sunni countries .
One only has to look across the Gulf at a fleshpot dictatorship like the United Arab Emirates where 80 % of the population live in abject poverty and the government gives a tacit nod and a wink to the massive , miserable sex trade .
But for all this , the role of women in society is the key indicator when it comes to any analysis of sex education in Iran .
Despite the high proportions of women in senior management and the professions , they still tend to be treated like children .
Given that Iranian women have not even organised themselves to get rid of the compulsory hijab let alone achieve equal property rights , sexuality even in the large middle class is dictated by men - not least when it comes to depictions of what is most alluring .
Whether it be the high rates of rhinoplasty surgery at one level to the much more shadowy world of the temporary – even hour - long - marriage , blessed by clerics , Michel Foucault would have had an easy time ascertaining the power relations here .
But a post - structuralist analysis demonstrating the importance of identity over class when looking at sex education in Iran would only be a beginning .

Rubyforge is now hosting an “ initial pre-release of a preview of an alpha of an undocumented proof - of - concept ” of the rewrite gem .
More on this presently , but the important ( and really the only thing of interest ) about rewrite is that when you use rewrite to write : Person.find_by_last_name( " Braithwaite " ).andand.first_name ...
You are not opening the Object , Person or Nil classes to add an andand method , nor are you creating a weird temporary BlankSlate object .
Rewrite does its thing by rewriting Ruby code : it performs syntactic metaprogramming , much as Lisp macros rewrite Lisp code .
Recall that when you use the “ standard ” implementation of things like andand or try , you are openly modifying core classes like Object .
Therefore , you are reaching out and touching every line of code in your project .
You probably are n’t breaking everything , but even if the chance of introducing a bug by adopting something like “ try ” is infinitesimal for each source code file in your project , the chance grows greater and greater as your application grows .
The problem is that you are introducing a change on Object , and everything depends on Object .
This is very different than introducing a change in your code .
In that case , only the other bits of code that directly depend on your code are at risk .
Also , imagine if you introduce try and are careful not to break anything .
Now somebody else wakes up one day and decides they need a method that works like Prototype ’s Try . these .
They call it “ try . ”
They just broke your code , dude !
Not only are you making everything dependant upon your version of try , but your code is dependent upon everyone else not breaking try as well .
It ’s a train - wreck waiting to happen .
Rewrite restricts things like andand or try to your code and your code alone .
Sure , if you introduce a bug in your code , you may break things that directly depend on your code .
But if you introduce “ try ” using rewrite instead of modifying Object , you will not reach out across your project and break something entirely unrelated that happens to have defined its own version of try in a completely different way .
Rewrite takes your code , converts it to an sexp with Parse Tree , then rewrites the sexp using one or more rewriters you specify .
Finally , it converts the sexp back to Ruby with Ruby2 Ruby and evals it .
It does this when the code is first read , not every time it is invoked , so we mitigate the “ do not use andand in a tight loop ” problem .
For example , rewrite converts this : Into :
And this :
Into : Note that with the examples , the names “ andand ” and “ try ” completely go away .
If someone else defines a try method elsewhere , it will not affect your code because your code never executes a method called try .
At the moment that is a huge PITA when creating new rewriters .
I do n’t think that it 's OK that a language makes it harder for a library creator than for an application developer , so I am working on making it easy to write things like andand or try .
Note that the andand example above uses gemsym for its parameter while the try example does not .
Why ?
What could break if it used a name like “ receiver ? ”
If you can figure out the salient difference between these two example rewrites , you can probably explain why rewriting try produces exactly the same semantics as the original open classes implementation , but rewriting andand produces a subtle change in semantics .
“ Oh , it ’s a horrible - sounding thing backwards , ” Bartak said .
He sat , shoeless , in an enclosed booth , just a man and his weathered 1935 Hammond organ , alone and anonymous in their timeless endeavor .
A ballpark organist is part of the unobtrusive background of baseball , or used to be , until most were quietly silenced by time and outsourced by recorded music .
But after decades of playing largely behind the scenes  as an accordion accompaniment to Johnny Carson ’s early magic shows ( both spent childhoods in Norfolk , Neb. ) , as a studio musician for a radio station and as a ballpark organist here during the College World Series  Bartak can finally be seen as something more than a lithe - fingered provider of space - filling background music .
He is a reminder of how ballparks used to sound , and feel , and how they increasingly do not .
According to the National Baseball Hall of Fame , organs gained a place at ballparks after the Chicago Cubs brought one to Wrigley Field for a game in 1941 .
It was instantly popular .
In 1942 , the Brooklyn Dodgers added a full - time organist at Ebbets Field .
Other teams followed , and the trend peaked in the 1960s and 1970s .
Their numbers have dwindled since .
The Hall ’s director of research , Tim Wiles , traced at least part of the beginning of the end to a change in ownership for the Mets after the 1979 season .
The longtime organist Jane Jarvis was nudged out at Shea Stadium in favor of canned music .
Teams wanted their music to rock , not reverberate .
Most major league teams do not employ organists anymore .
Even the Omaha Royals , Rosenblatt ’s primary tenants , stopped using Bartak a few seasons ago .
It is possible that none of the players on the eight teams that made this year ’s College World Series have played in another stadium with an organist .
First , a disclaimer : the title of this post is obviously exaggerated .
Proof is an awfully big word to throw around , and although I employed pretty good experiment design practices and statistical checks , I ca n’t really prove that Reddit should do this or that .
But I can show that what they are doing now is not working , at least when it comes to search .
So , I got an email the other day letting me know that my article , Tagging and Searching : Search Retrieval Effectiveness of Folkonsomies on the World Wide Web , is being published in the July 2008 issue of Information Processing and Management ( here ’s the official DOI link to the article ) .
In the study I compared search performance between traditional search engines ( like Google ) , subject directories ( like Open Directory ) , and social bookmarking systems ( like Reddit ) and their folksonomies .
What ’s a folksonomy ?
The word is a play on the term taxonomy – a taxonomy is a system of organizing and categorizing things , like the Dewey Decimal System .
Taxonomies usually follow very strict rules and are controlled by experts .
A folksonomy is a system of organization built by large numbers of regular users , who add things to the collection , evaluate them , and usually tag them with keywords .
In my study , the social bookmarking systems with tagging systems did surprisingly well – Del.icio.us was more precise than Open Directory , and at a cut off of 20 results it ’s precision was fairly close to that of the search engines .
Reddit , however , did not fare so well .
It consistently had the lowest precision , meaning that searches returned very few relevant results .
There could be many reasons for this , but the biggest difference between Reddit and the others is the lack of tags .
Now , it ’s possible that the folks at Reddit have no interest in search , or information retrieval in general .
I think Reddit is very effective at bringing out new and interesting links on a daily basis and encouraging commentary ( just my opinion , no stats to back that up ) .
But I think it ’s a big missed opportunity not to add tagging and see where it leads .
( One last disclaimer : this post is my personal opinion as someone who enjoys using Reddit and does not reflect on my employer .
This post refers to research done independently as a grad student . )

GAZA  The American State Department has withdrawn all Fulbright grants to Palestinian students in Gaza hoping to pursue advanced degrees at American institutions this fall because Israel has not granted them permission to leave .
Israel has isolated this coastal strip , which is run by the militant group Hamas .
Given that policy , the United States Consulate in Jerusalem said the grant money had been “ redirected ” to students elsewhere out of concern that it would go to waste if the Palestinian students were forced to remain in Gaza .
A letter was sent by e-mail to the students on Thursday telling them of the cancellation .
Abdulrahman Abdullah , 30 , who had been hoping to study for an M.B.A. at one of several American universities on his Fulbright , was in shock when he read it .
“ If we are talking about peace and mutual understanding , it means investing in people who will later contribute to Palestinian society , ” he said .
“ I am against Hamas .
Their acts and policies are wrong .
Israel talks about a Palestinian state .
But who will build that state if we can get no training ? ”
Do n’t get Duncan Watts started on the Hush Puppies .
“ Oh , God , ” he groans when the subject comes up .
“ Not them . ”
The Hush Puppies in question are the ones that kick off The Tipping Point , Malcolm Gladwell ’s best - seller about how trends work .
As Gladwell tells it , the fuzzy footwear was a dying brand by late 1994 – until a few New York hipsters brought it back from the brink .
Other fashionistas followed suit , whereupon the cool kids copied them , the less - cool kids copied them , and so on , until , voilà !
Within two years , sales of Hush Puppies had exploded by a stunning 5,000 % , without a penny spent on advertising .
All because , as Gladwell puts it , a tiny number of superinfluential types ( “ Twenty ?
Fifty ?
One hundred–at the most ? ” ) began wearing the shoes .
advertisement
advertisement
These tastemakers , Gladwell concluded , are the spark behind any successful trend .
“ What we are really saying , ” he writes , “ is that in a given process or system , some people matter more than others . ”
In modern marketing , this idea–that a tiny cadre of connected people triggers trends –is enormously seductive .
It is the very premise of viral and word - of - mouth campaigns : Reach those rare , all - powerful folks , and you ’ll reach everyone else through them , basically for free .
Loosely , this is referred to as the Influentials theory , and while it has been a marketing touchstone for 50 years , it has recently reentered the mainstream imagination via thousands of marketing studies and a host of best - selling books .
In addition to The Tipping Point , there was The Influentials , by marketing gurus Ed Keller and Jon Berry , as well as the gospel according to PR firms such as Burson - Marsteller , which claims “ E - Fluentials ” can “ make or break a brand . ”
According to MarketingVOX , an online marketing news journal , more than $ 1 billion is spent a year on word - of - mouth campaigns targeting Influentials , an amount growing at 36 % a year , faster than any other part of marketing and advertising .
That ’s on top of billions more in PR and ads leveled at the cognoscenti .
Yet , if you believe Watts , all that money and effort is being wasted .
Because according to him , Influentials have no such effect .
Indeed , they have no special role in trends at all .
In the past few years , Watts–a network - theory scientist who recently took a sabbatical from Columbia University and is now working for Yahoo –has performed a series of controversial , barn - burning experiments challenging the whole Influentials thesis .
He has analyzed email patterns and found that highly connected people are not , in fact , crucial social hubs .
He has written computer models of rumor spreading and found that your average slob is just as likely as a well - connected person to start a huge new trend .
And last year , Watts demonstrated that even the breakout success of a hot new pop band might be nearly random .
Any attempt to engineer success through Influentials , he argues , is almost certainly doomed to failure .
“ It just does n’t work , ” Watts says , when I meet him at his gray cubicle at Yahoo Research in midtown Manhattan , which is unadorned except for a whiteboard crammed with equations .
“ A rare bunch of cool people just do n’t have that power .
And when you test the way marketers say the world works , it falls apart .
There ’s no there there . ”
And this is not , he argues , mere academic whimsy .
He has developed a new technique for propagating ads virally , which can double or even quadruple the reach of an ordinary online campaign by harnessing the pass - around power of everyday people–and ignoring Influentials altogether .
Not everyone appreciates the mind bomb Watts has tossed into their midst .
He says one music executive pronounced his work “ bullshit ” on the spot .
But a growing group of marketers believes Watts is radically altering the way companies attempt to produce trends .
“ He is changing the way people think about the way we communicate , ” raves Robert Barocci , president of the Advertising Research Foundation .
“ He ’s one of the best thinkers in the industry today . ”
But is Watts right ?

Watts , ironically enough , is precisely the type of person you ’d peg as an Influential : tall , gruff , and handsome ; a jut - jawed Navy man who left the service to study engineering .
A former rock - climbing addict , he solved his first big intellectual challenge after hanging from a cliff at Joshua Tree .
He has written about his work in Harvard Business Review and The New York Times , as well as in his new book Six Degrees .
His Australian accent is disarming , even when he ’s assuring you that everything you believe is probably crap .
Watts ’s journey into trend research began , improbably , with the snowy tree cricket .
As a grad student in the mid-1990s , he was exploring the mystery of how crickets synchronize their chirping .
Clearly , information about when to chirp spreads like a contagion through the cricket network ;
Watts began to wonder how information flowed through human networks .
So he began programming the first computer models of how influence spreads .
Like a kid experimenting with The Sims , Watts created a virtual community of individuals , then “ infected ” one with a “ virus ” –a virtual disease , or contagious idea–to see how far it would spread .
He fiddled with his models , varying the degree and frequency of “ exposure ” needed to pass along the virus .
He noticed that the success of an epidemic varied dramatically with seemingly tiny changes in his virtual society .
Yet even as Watts was conducting his research , marketers were becoming increasingly convinced that trends were the product not of murky social forces , but of charismatic , connected social alphas .
In truth , it was an old–even hoary –marketing concept , dating back to 1955 , when the pioneering sociologists Elihu Katz and Paul Lazarsfeld wrote Personal Influence .
They had argued that advertising affected society through a two - step process : Companies broadcast messages , which were then seized upon by “ opinion leaders ” who proselytized their peers .
They were n’t talking about celebrities like Oprah or even Paris Hilton , but about the rare everyday people who catalyze trends .
Reach those opinion leaders , Katz and Lazarsfeld argued , and you ’d quickly convert the masses .
Gladwell reanimated this concept in The Tipping Point .
To help illustrate the cultural sway of his hypernetworked protagonists , he tapped the renowned 1967 “ Six Degrees of Separation ” study by sociologist Stanley Milgram .
In that experiment , Milgram had given letters to 160 people in Nebraska , with instructions to ferry them to a particular stockbroker in Boston by passing the letters along to a colleague socially closer to the target .
It famously took roughly six links to deliver each letter .
But in a finding that particularly excited Gladwell , it was the same three friends of the stockbroker who provided the final link for half the letters that arrived successfully .
They were the Connectors , as Gladwell dubbed them , who govern the flow of social information .
If you wanted to get to that stockbroker , you could n’t approach just anyone .
You had to go through those three friends .
Possessed of huge Rolodexes , these folks are the gatekeepers , Gladwell wrote , “ and the rest of us are linked to the world through those special few . ”
Gladwell ’s book laid out many other factors that can “ tip ” a trend .
He described other influential types : Mavens , who love to collect information and help others make decisions , and suave Salesmen of ideas .
In order to spread , an idea or product had to be “ sticky , ” and appear in a fertile social context .
But as The Tipping Point climbed the charts , marketers fixated on Gladwell ’s Law of the Few , his suggestion that rare , highly connected people shape the world .
For anyone involved in pitchmanship , it was an electrifying notion , one that took a highly complex phenomenon –the spread of memes through society –and made it simple .
Reach the gatekeepers , and you reach the world .

Marketers seized on Malcolm Gladwell ’s “ Law of the Few , ” his suggestion That rare , highly connected people shape the world .
But Watts , for one , did n’t think the gatekeeper model was true .
It certainly did n’t match what he ’d found studying networks .
So he decided to test it in the real world by remounting the Milgram experiment on a massive scale .
In 2001 , Watts used a Web site to recruit about 61,000 people , then asked them to ferry messages to 18 targets worldwide .
Sure enough , he found that Milgram was right :
The average length of the chain was roughly six links .
But when he examined these pathways , he found that “ hubs ” –highly connected people –were n’t crucial .
Sure , they existed .
But only 5 % of the email messages passed through one of these superconnectors .
The rest of the messages moved through society in much more democratic paths , zipping from one weakly connected individual to another , until they arrived at the target .
Why did Milgram get it wrong ?
Watts thinks it ’s simply because his sample was so small–only a few dozen letters reached their mark .
The dominance of the three friends could have been a statistical accident .
“ And since Milgram ’s finding sort of made sense , nobody even bothered to redo the experiment , ” Watts shrugs .
But when you perform the experiment with hundreds of successfully completed letters , a different picture emerges : Influentials do n’t govern person - to - person communication .
We all do .
The more Watts examined the theory of Influentials , the less sense it made to him .
The problem , he explains over lunch in a Midtown restaurant , is that it ’s incredibly vague .
None of its proponents ever clearly explain how an Influential actually influences .
“ It sort of sounds cool , ” Watts says , tucking into his salad .
“ But it ’s wonderfully persuasive only for as long as you do n’t think about it . ”
For example , in The Influentials , Keller and Berry argue that trendsetters draw their social power from being active in their communities .
Their peers naturally turn to them for advice .
Need to buy a new car or navigate city hall ?
Everyone knows whom to trust .
Gladwell , for his part , argues that trends spread like diseases ;
Influentials are the vectors who amplify and propagate the infection .
Fair enough , as a top - down view .
But it ’s murky , and for Watts , this is a critical flaw , because precision matters when you ’re trying to explain highly social epidemics .
Merely arguing that influence spreads like a disease is n’t enough , because , he says , diseases spread in very different ways .
Some require multiple exposures ; some do n’t .
Some reward “ superspreaders , ” and some do n’t .
( SARS broke out in Hong Kong not because the first victim was a superspreader but because a doctor mistakenly hooked him up to an aspirator–ventilating SARS - infected breath into the hospital air . )
As Watts argues , there are a lot of ways an Influential could convert the masses .
Merely talking to a friend once could infect her with an idea .
Or it might take several conversations .
Or maybe Influentials are so persuasive they ’re like trend vampires , and each victim they bite becomes hyperpersuasive too .
Depending on how you define the specific mechanics of influence , you ’d get totally different types of epidemics–or maybe none at all .
But gurus of the Influentials theory never directly clarify these mechanics .

“ All they ’ll ever say , ” Watts insists , is that a ) there are people who are more influential than others , and b ) they are disproportionately important in getting a trend going .
That may be oversimplifying it a bit , but last year , Watts decided to put the whole idea to the test by building another Sims - like computer simulation .
He programmed a group of 10,000 people , all governed by a few simple interpersonal rules .
Each was able to communicate with anyone nearby .
With every contact , each had a small probability of “ infecting ” another .
And each person also paid attention to what was happening around him :
If lots of other people were adopting a trend , he would be more likely to join , and vice versa .
The “ people ” in the virtual society had varying amounts of sociability –some were more connected than others .
Watts designated the top 10 % most - connected as Influentials ; they could affect four times as many people as the average Joe .
In essence , it was a virtual society run–in a very crude fashion –according to the rules laid out by thinkers like Gladwell and Keller .
Watts set the test in motion by randomly picking one person as a trendsetter , then sat back to see if the trend would spread .
He did so thousands of times in a row .
The results were deeply counterintuitive .
The experiment did produce several hundred societywide infections .
But in the large majority of cases , the cascade began with an average Joe ( although in cases where an Influential touched off the trend , it spread much further ) .
To stack the deck in favor of Influentials , Watts changed the simulation , making them 10 times more connected .
Now they could infect 40 times more people than the average citizen ( and again , when they kicked off a cascade , it was substantially larger ) .
But the rank - and - file citizen was still far more likely to start a contagion .
Why did n’t the Influentials wield more power ?
With 40 times the reach of a normal person , why could n’t they kick - start a trend every time ?
Watts believes this is because a trend ’s success depends not on the person who starts it , but on how susceptible the society is overall to the trend–not how persuasive the early adopter is , but whether everyone else is easily persuaded .
And in fact , when Watts tweaked his model to increase everyone ’s odds of being infected , the number of trends skyrocketed .
“ If society is ready to embrace a trend , almost anyone can start one–and if it is n’t , then almost no one can , ” Watts concludes .
To succeed with a new product , it ’s less a matter of finding the perfect hipster to infect and more a matter of gauging the public ’s mood .
Sure , there ’ll always be a first mover in a trend .
But since she generally stumbles into that role by chance , she is , in Watts ’s terminology , an “ accidental Influential . ”

Perhaps the problem with viral marketing is that the disease metaphor is misleading .
Watts thinks trends are more like forest fires :
There are thousands a year , but only a few become roaring monsters .
That ’s because in those rare situations , the landscape was ripe : sparse rain , dry woods , badly equipped fire departments .
If these conditions exist , any old match will do .
“ And nobody , ” Watts says wryly , “ will go around talking about the exceptional properties of the spark that started the fire . ”
It should come as no surprise that marketers have not all warmed to Watts ’s work .
In September , he presented his findings to a standing - room - only crowd at a meeting of the Advertising Research Foundation .
Ed Keller–The Influentials coauthor himself –then gave a polite but heated rebuttal .
Watts ’s computer models are “ interesting , ” Keller admitted , but too academic to reflect reality .
In contrast , Keller argues , his firm has studied tens of thousands of Influentials by identifying people highly active in their communities , an elite 10 % that engage in advice - giving conversation up to five times more frequently than the average American .
“ They ’re fonts of word of mouth , ” Keller insists .
And ahead of the curve , too :
In the 20 years he has been polling them , Keller has found they began using computers , mobile phones , and the Internet years before the mainstream .
What ’s more , his polls have found that more than two - thirds of people who get word - of - mouth product recommendations either buy something based on it , or plan to .
“ The data are crystal clear , ” Keller adds , when I call him up .
“ They give and receive advice more .
If I had $ 100 to spend , and I could spend it focusing on the mass market or I could put some chips on a group that could get me somewhere between two and five times as much energy with word of mouth , well , they ’re going to get my message out more quickly and more efficiently . ”
He points to a recent example : Before Nintendo launched its hugely successful Wii video - game console last year , it handed out thousands of demo units to “ mom influencers ” around the country , creating a “ built - in base of evangelists . ”
In any case , Keller concludes , “ Duncan is making a straw - man argument .
Because nobody , including myself , thinks that Influencers are the only group of consumers who matter . ”
Keller makes good points ( although it ’s a bit hard to swallow his last assertion , given that the subtitle of his book flatly states that “ one American in 10 tells the other 9 how to vote , where to eat , and what to buy ” ) .
And even Watts , for all his bombast , can be quite self - critical .
“ My models might be totally wrong , ” he says cheerfully .
“ But at least I ’m clear about what I ’m saying .
You can look at them , and tell me if you disagree .
But none of these other thinkers are actually clear about what they ’re saying .
You ca n’t tell if they ’re wrong . ”
advertisement
No researcher , he points out –including Keller–ever analyzes interactions between specific Influentials and the friends they ’re supposedly influencing ; no one observes influence in action .
In essence , Keller appeals to common sense–our intuitive sense of how the world works .
Watts thinks common sense is misleading .
Mind you ,
Watts does agree that some people are more instrumental than others .
He simply does n’t think it ’s possible to will a trend into existence by recruiting highly social people .
The network effects in society , he argues , are too complex–too weird and unpredictable –to work that way .
If it were just a matter of tipping the crucial first adopters , why ca n’t most companies do it reliably ?
As Watts points out , viral thinkers analyze trends after they ’ve broken out .
“ They start with an existing trend , like Hush Puppies , and they go backward until they ’ve identified the people who did it first , and then they go , ‘ Okay , these are the Influentials ! ' ”
But who ’s to say those are n’t just Watts ’s accidental Influentials , random smokers who walked , unwittingly , into a dry forest ?
East Village hipsters were wearing lots of cool things in the fall of 1994 .
But , as Watts wondered , why did only Hush Puppies take off ?
Why did n’t their other clothing choices reach a tipping point too ?
For his part , Gladwell is diplomatic .
“ Duncan Watts is exceedingly clever , and I ’ve learned a great deal from his research , ” he emailed me .
“ In the end , though , I suppose that I feel the same ways about his insights as I do about Steve Levitt ’s disagreements with me over the causes of the decline in violent crime in the 1990s .
I think that all books like The Tipping Point or articles by academics can ever do is uncover a little piece of the bigger picture , and one day –when we put all those pieces together –maybe we ’ll have a shot at the truth . ”
Marketing , of course , has always relied heavily on instinct and intuition .
Admen like to believe they ’re creative geniuses , gifted at truffling out social trends ( which is why , they hasten to point out , they ’re irreplaceable ) .
Joe Pilotta , research VP for a firm called Big Research ( and one of Watts ’s bigger fans ) , suspects marketers cling to their belief in Influentials partly because they ’re lazy .
They love the idea of needing to reach only a small group of people to “ tip ” a product , he says with a laugh .
Plus , it strokes their egos : “ Think about it .
You ’re saying , ‘ I am in control –I am the biggest influencer , because I am going to influence the influencers !’
It ’s an arrogance that only the corporate world could enjoy . ”
But the Internet has cranked up the pressure to show a return on advertising dollars , spawning incipient panic at agencies worldwide .
It is into this world that Watts has injected himself , with his unwelcome insistence that basic marketing wisdom be tested scientifically .
“ The whole reason why Duncan ’s work upsets people , ” Pilotta points out , “ is that he demonstrates that the world is complex , that it ’s not that easy . ”
advertisement
Actually , if you believe Watts , the world is n’t just complex–it ’s practically anarchic .
In 2006 , he performed another experiment that chilled the blood of trendologists .
Trends , it suggested , are n’t merely hard to predict and engineer –they occur essentially at random .
Watts wanted to find out whether the success of a hot trend was reproducible .
For example , we know that Madonna became a breakout star in 1983 .
But if you rewound the world back to 1982 , would Madonna break out again ?
To find out , Watts built a world populated with real live music fans picking real music , then hit rewind , over and over again .
Working with two colleagues , Watts designed an online music - downloading service .
They filled it with 48 songs by new , unknown , and unsigned bands .
Then they recruited roughly 14,000 people to log in .
Some were asked to rank the songs based on their own personal preference , without regard to what other people thought .
They were picking songs purely on each song ’s merit .
But the other participants were put into eight groups that had “ social influence ” :
Each could see how other members of the group were ranking the songs .
Watts predicted that word of mouth would take over .
And sure enough , that ’s what happened .
In the merit group , the songs were ranked mostly equitably , with a small handful of songs drifting slightly lower or higher in popularity .
But in the social worlds , as participants reacted to one another ’s opinions , huge waves took shape .
A small , elite bunch of songs became enormously popular , rising above the pack , while another cluster fell into relative obscurity .
But here ’s the thing :
In each of the eight social worlds , the top songs–and the bottom ones–were completely different .
For example , the song “ Lockdown , ” by 52 metro , was the No. 1 song in one world , yet finished 40 out of 48 in another .
Nor did there seem to be any compelling correlation between merit and success .
In fact , Watts explains , only about half of a song ’s success seemed to be due to merit .
“ In general , the ‘ best ’ songs never do very badly , and the ‘ worst ’ songs never do extremely well , but almost any other result is possible , ” he says .
Why ?
Because the first band to snag a few thumbs - ups in the social world tended overwhelmingly to get many more .
Yet who received those crucial first votes seemed to be mostly a matter of luck .
Word of mouth and social contagion made big hits bigger .
But they also made success more unpredictable .
( And it ’s worth noting , no one in the social worlds had any more influence than anyone else . )
So yes , Watts figures , if you rewound the world to 1982 , Madonna would likely remain a total unknown–and someone else would have slipped into her steel - tipped corset .
“ You can not predict in advance whether a band gets this huge cascade of popularity , because the social network is liable to throw up almost any result , ” he marvels .
Predictably , the music industry received the analysis– “ Experimental Study of Inequality and Unpredictability in an Artificial Cultural Market , ” published in Science in 2006 – with a cocked eyebrow .
When Watts presented his findings to executives at a major record label last spring , the younger among them were reasonably receptive .
They ’re accustomed to the unpredictability of hit - making online , so they can grasp the terrifying randomness of success .
advertisement
But the older execs ?
Watts laughs .
“ They were all like , ‘ I think it ’s bullshit .
I ’m still going to go with my gut , ' ” he recalls .
“ And I ’m like , Okay , good luck to you .
You ’re going to need it . ”
If Influentials cannot tip a trend into existence–and if success in a networked society is quite random – what ’s a poor marketer to do ?
Is there any way to intentionally infect people with an idea or a product ?
Watts believes there is .
In the past three years , he has worked on a new form of advertising he calls Big Seed marketing ( this is part of his work at Yahoo , where he is a principal research scientist ) .
Watts developed the concept with a friend , Jonah Peretti , a veteran of the viral wars .
While a student at MIT in 2001 , Peretti had an email exchange with Nike that turned into an accidental pass - around hit , reaching 50 million people and catapulting him onto the Today show .
A year or so later , a satirical Web site Peretti created in one weekend–blackpeopleloveus .
com–amassed 30 million page views in a few weeks .
Soon , companies were frantically trying to hire him to help their online ad campaigns “ go viral . ”
Peretti partly disagrees with Watts about the randomness of trends ; he thinks it ’s possible to intentionally make a funny Web site into a pass - around hit online .
But as Peretti discovered , real - world goods are harder .
When he tried to pitch “ some company ’s shitty product , ” he could n’t force it to go viral .
In their hunt for a practical way to create maximum exposure for any given ad , Watts and Peretti developed a way to marry the benefits of old - school mass marketing with clever six - degrees effects .
Their first test case came when the Brady Campaign , the gun-control group , asked for help with an online petition .
Watts and Peretti set up a regular mass - market ad buy , running banner ads on several prominent blogs and news sites .
Like many ads these days , they added a button on the ad that allows people to forward the ad to a friend–a way of collecting eyeballs for free .
Typically , people ignore this “ share with your friends ” pitch .
But Watts and Peretti included technology called ForwardTrack , which displays the route the ad travels once you ’ve forwarded it .
This turned ad forwarding into a piece of social cartography .
People would pass the ad specifically to those friends most likely to keep it moving .
It became a Facebook - like contest to sign up the most friends .
advertisement
The technique marries Watts ’s two main epiphanies : Cascades require word - of - mouth effects , so you need to build a six - degrees effect into an ad campaign ; but since you can never know which person is going to spark the fire , you should aim the ad at as broad a market as possible–and not waste money chasing “ important ” people .
And it worked .
The pass - around effect doubled the number of people who saw the Brady Campaign ’s ad .
They paid for 22,582 hits and received an additional 31,590 for free .
Another campaign they ran for the Oxygen network quadrupled the audience size , adding 23,544 hits to the initial 7,064 .
Neither was , technically , a viral hit .
Neither passed the disease threshold , where the meme spreads exponentially and engulfs the mainstream .
“ But you can double your impact , which is still pretty good , ” Watts says .
The ultimate irony of Watts ’s research is that , if you really buy it , the most effective way to pitch your idea is … mass marketing .
And that is precisely what the wizards of Madison Avenue , presiding over our zillion - channel microniche market , have rejected as obsolete .
“ But that ’s the thing about magic , ” says Watts .
“ If it sounds too good to be true , it probably is . ”
I have a love / hate relationship with calculus : it demonstrates the beauty of math and the agony of math education .
Calculus relates topics in an elegant , brain - bending manner .
My closest analogy is Darwin ’s Theory of Evolution : once understood , you start seeing Nature in terms of survival .
You understand why drugs lead to resistant germs ( survival of the fittest ) .
You know why sugar and fat taste sweet ( encourage consumption of high - calorie foods in times of scarcity ) .
It all fits together .
Calculus is similarly enlightening .
Do n’t these formulas seem related in some way ?
They are .
But most of us learn these formulas independently .
Calculus lets us start with $ \text {circumference} = 2 \pi r$ and figure out the others — the Greeks would have appreciated this .
Unfortunately , calculus can epitomize what ’s wrong with math education .
Most lessons feature contrived examples , arcane proofs , and memorization that body slam our intuition & enthusiasm .
It really should n’t be this way .
Math , art , and ideas
I ’ve learned something from school : Math is n’t the hard part of math ; motivation is .
Specifically , staying encouraged despite
Teachers focused more on publishing / perishing than teaching
Self - fulfilling prophecies that math is difficult , boring , unpopular or “ not your subject ”
Textbooks and curriculums more concerned with profits and test results than insight
‘ A Mathematician ’s Lament ’ [ pdf ] is an excellent essay on this issue that resonated with many people :
“ … if I had to design a mechanism for the express purpose of destroying a child ’s natural curiosity and love of pattern - making , I could n’t possibly do as good a job as is currently being done — I simply would n’t have the imagination to come up with the kind of senseless , soul - crushing ideas that constitute contemporary mathematics education . ”
Imagine teaching art like this : Kids , no fingerpainting in kindergarten .
Instead , let ’s study paint chemistry , the physics of light , and the anatomy of the eye .
After 12 years of this , if the kids ( now teenagers ) do n’t hate art already , they may begin to start coloring on their own .
After all , they have the “ rigorous , testable ” fundamentals to start appreciating art .
Right ?
Poetry is similar .
Imagine studying this quote ( formula ) :
“ This above all else : to thine own self be true , and it must follow , as night follows day , thou canst not then be false to any man . ”
— William Shakespeare , Hamlet
It ’s an elegant way of saying “ be yourself ” ( and if that means writing irreverently about math , so be it ) .
But if this were math class , we’d be counting the syllables , analyzing the iambic pentameter , and mapping out the subject , verb and object .
Math and poetry are fingers pointing at the moon .
Do n’t confuse the finger for the moon .
Formulas are a means to an end , a way to express a mathematical truth .
We ’ve forgotten that math is about ideas , not robotically manipulating the formulas that express them .
Ok bub , what ’s your great idea ?
Feisty , are we ?
Well , here ’s what I wo n’t do : recreate the existing textbooks .
If you need answers right away for that big test , there ’s plenty of websites , class videos and 20 - minute sprints to help you out .
Instead , let ’s share the core insights of calculus .
Equations are n’t enough — I want the “ aha ! ” moments that make everything click .
Formal mathematical language is one just one way to communicate .
Diagrams , animations , and just plain talkin’ can often provide more insight than a page full of proofs .
But calculus is hard !
I think anyone can appreciate the core ideas of calculus .
We do n’t need to be writers to enjoy Shakespeare .
It ’s within your reach if you know algebra and have a general interest in math .
Not long ago , reading and writing were the work of trained scribes .
Yet today that can be handled by a 10 - year old .
Why ?
Because we expect it .
Expectations play a huge part in what ’s possible .
So expect that calculus is just another subject .
Some people get into the nitty - gritty ( the writers / mathematicians ) .
But the rest of us can still admire what ’s happening , and expand our brain along the way .
It ’s about how far you want to go .
I ’d love for everyone to understand the core concepts of calculus and say “ whoa ” .
So what ’s calculus about ?
Some define calculus as “ the branch of mathematics that deals with limits and the differentiation and integration of functions of one or more variables ” .
It ’s correct , but not helpful for beginners .
Here ’s my take : Calculus does to algebra what algebra did to arithmetic .
Arithmetic is about manipulating numbers ( addition , multiplication , etc. ) .
Algebra finds patterns between numbers : $ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $ is a famous relationship , describing the sides of a right triangle .
Algebra finds entire sets of numbers — if you know a and b , you can find c .
Calculus finds patterns between equations : you can see how one equation ( $ \text{circumference} = 2 \ pi r$ ) relates to a similar one ( $ \text{area} = \pi r^ 2 $ ) .
Using calculus , we can ask all sorts of questions :
How does an equation grow and shrink ?
Accumulate over time ?
When does it reach its highest / lowest point ?
How do we use variables that are constantly changing ?
( Heat , motion , populations , … ) .
And much , much more !
Algebra & calculus are a problem - solving duo : calculus finds new equations , and algebra solves them .
Like evolution , calculus expands your understanding of how Nature works .
An Example , Please
Let ’s walk the walk .
Suppose we know the equation for circumference ( $ 2 \ pi r$ ) and want to find area .
What to do ?
Realize that a filled - in disc is like a set of Russian dolls .
Here are two ways to draw a disc :
Make a circle and fill it in
Draw a bunch of rings with a thick marker
The amount of “ space ” ( area ) should be the same in each case , right ?
And how much space does a ring use ?
Well , the very largest ring has radius “ r ” and a circumference $ 2 \ pi r$ .
As the rings get smaller their circumference shrinks , but it keeps the pattern of $ 2 \ pi \cdot \ text{current radius} $ .
The final ring is more like a pinpoint , with no circumference at all .
Now here ’s where things get funky .
Let ’s unroll those rings and line them up .
What happens ?
We get a bunch of lines , making a jagged triangle .
But if we take thinner rings , that triangle becomes less jagged ( more on this in future articles ) .
One side has the smallest ring ( 0 ) and the other side has the largest ring ( $ 2 \ pi r$ )
We have rings going from radius 0 to up to “ r ” .
For each possible radius ( 0 to r ) , we just place the unrolled ring at that location .
The total area of the “ ring triangle ” = $ \frac { 1} {2} \text { base} \cdot \text {height} = \ frac { 1} { 2 } ( r ) ( 2 \ pi r ) = \ pi r^2 $ , which is the formula for area !
Yowza !
The combined area of the rings = the area of the triangle = area of circle !
( Image from Wikipedia )
This was a quick example , but did you catch the key idea ?
We took a disc , split it up , and put the segments together in a different way .
Calculus showed us that a disc and ring are intimately related : a disc is really just a bunch of rings .
This is a recurring theme in calculus :
Big things are made from little things .
And sometimes the little things are easier to work with .
A note on examples
Many calculus examples are based on physics .
That ’s great , but it can be hard to relate : honestly , how often do you know the equation for velocity for an object ?
Less than once a week , if that .
I prefer starting with physical , visual examples because it ’s how our minds work .
That ring / circle thing we made ?
You could build it out of several pipe cleaners , separate them , and straighten them into a crude triangle to see if the math really works .
That ’s just not happening with your velocity equation .
A note on rigor ( for the math geeks )
I can feel the math pedants firing up their keyboards .
Just a few words on “ rigor ” .
Did you know we do n’t learn calculus the way Newton and Leibniz discovered it ?
They used intuitive ideas of “ fluxions ” and “ infinitesimals ” which were replaced with limits because “ Sure , it works in practice .
But does it work in theory ? ” .
We ’ve created complex mechanical constructs to “ rigorously ” prove calculus , but have lost our intuition in the process .
We ’re looking at the sweetness of sugar from the level of brain - chemistry , instead of recognizing it as Nature ’s way of saying “ This has lots of energy .
Eat it . ”
I do n’t want to ( and can ’t ) teach an analysis course or train researchers .
Would it be so bad if everyone understood calculus to the “ non-rigorous ” level that Newton did ?
That it changed how they saw the world , as it did for him ?
A premature focus on rigor dissuades students and makes math hard to learn .
Case in point : e is technically defined by a limit , but the intuition of growth is how it was discovered .
The natural log can be seen as an integral , or the time needed to grow .
Which explanations help beginners more ?
Let ’s fingerpaint a bit , and get into the chemistry along the way .
Happy math .

Thanks ! )

Following Mininova and The Pirate Bay , isoHunt is now the third BitTorrent site to enter the list of top 100 most visited websites on the Internet .
Together the three sites generate more than a billion pageviews a month and they continue to grow .
Most recently , isoHunt managed to get a spot among the 100 120 most visited domains on the Internet , according to Alexa ’s new and improved statistics .
Isohunt – the third largest BitTorrent site with 350.000.000 pageviews a month – is one of the older BitTorrent sites and predates both The Pirate Bay and Mininova .
The site started in January 2003 , and added support for torrents by the end of that year just a few months after the BitTorrent protocol went public .
At the time , no - one could have guessed that BitTorrent sites would ever become as dominant as they are now .
Gary Fung , the founder of isoHunt did n’t foresee it either , as he told TorrentFreak : “ I never expected the site to grow to this volume initially , until we started seeing explosive growth with the uptake of BitTorrent . ”
About the future of his site Fung said : “ By indexing any and all BitTorrent links , we expect to grow as much as usage of BitTorrent would . ”
Right now , there is no sign that BitTorrent ’s usage will stop growing , so it is safe to say that like any other BitTorrent site , is oHunt will keep on growing .
Another interesting observation is that The Pirate Bay has outgrown Mininova traffic wise .
For over a year Mininova has been the most visited BitTorrent site , but now – for the first time ever – The Pirate Bay is in the lead .
Update : apparently there was a glitch in the traffic rank numbers , they are back to normal right now and show that Mininova is still in the lead .
We corrected the graph and the figures below .
The title of the article is still correct , as it is based on direct reports .
WASHINGTON  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton needs three breaks to wrest the Democratic presidential nomination from Senator Barack Obama in the view of her advisers .
She has to defeat Mr. Obama soundly in Pennsylvania next month to buttress her argument that she holds an advantage in big general election states .
She needs to lead in the total popular vote after the primaries end in June .
And Mrs. Clinton is looking for some development to shake confidence in Mr. Obama so that superdelegates , Democratic Party leaders and elected officials who are free to decide which candidate to support overturn his lead among the pledged delegates from primaries and caucuses .
For Mrs. Clinton , all this has seemed something of a long shot since her defeats in February .
But that shot seems to have grown a little longer .
There are few things more anxiety - inducing for parents than watching their children learn to drive  and for good reason .
Even the most mature teenager can take ill - advised risks , and inexperience behind the wheel can be deadly .
Automobile accidents are the leading cause of death for 15 - to 19 - year - olds .
One way to reduce the risks is called graduated licensing , which is the phasing in of privileges for young drivers .
The best state programs have reduced the number of accidents involving 16 - year - olds by 20 percent to 40 percent .
Research shows that accidents involving young drivers increase significantly after 10 p.m .
For a driver under 18 , the likelihood of an accident increases with each additional young passenger in the car .
While researchers know what works , state regulations vary widely .
A few states , such as Arkansas and Idaho , allow teens as young as 14 and 15 to drive .
Rhode Island ’s nighttime ban on driving for younger drivers starts at 1 a.m. , while New York ’s far more sensible approach restricts night driving after 9 p.m .
Congress flexed its muscle in the mid-1980s and pressed states to adopt a minimum drinking age of 21 .
More recently , it did so to pass tougher drunken driving laws .
The country ’s highways are safer for those efforts .
Congress now needs to do the same for teenage driving .
The knives had been out and sharpened long before M. Night Shyamalan ’s latest movie , “ The Happening , ” opened on Friday .
A fine craftsman with aspirations to the canon , this would - be auteur has , in the last few years , experienced a sensational fall from critical and commercial grace , partly through his own doing  by making bad movies and then , even after those movies failed , by continuing to feed his ego publicly  and partly through the entertainment media that , once they smell weakness , will always bite the hand they once slathered in drool .
The signal - to - noise ratio has become so lopsided when it comes to Mr. Shyamalan that “ The Happening ” was marked for failure even before it had a chance to fail  or succeed .
Its worth as a cultural and aesthetic object had been rendered moot , never mind that it turns out to be a divertingly goofy thriller with an animistic bent , moments of shivery and twitchy suspense and a solid lead performance from Mark Wahlberg .
Much like Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix in “ Signs , ” which this film resembles in mood , effectiveness and flaws , Mr. Wahlberg fits into the Shyamalan universe comfortably .
He rides the spooky stuff with as much ease as he does the jokes , the manufactured sincerity and cornball messages .
I wo n’t say too much about the gimmick that Mr. Shyamalan has come up with this time around , only that it ’s funny , dark and weird and involves some nasty payback from the natural world .
The story opens on a bustlingly bright New York day with two women sharing a bench in Central Park .
One hears something , the other does n’t , and before you know it , one benchwarmer has slipped a hair stick out of her do and into her own neck .
The blood continues to trickle , but soon runs into the streets as men and women across the city commit similarly inexplicable acts of self - annihilation , with bullets to the head or , in a queasy , presumably intentional visual echo of Sept. 11 , plunges from on high .
This is the first R-rated feature from Mr. Shyamalan , who ’s left the PG - 13 world behind presumably to entice that much - coveted demographic , the young male bloodsucker .
Going graphic has neither hurt nor harmed him , though from all the inventive ways he ’s found to do away with characters , it ’s hard not to wonder if he ’s not extracting symbolic revenge on the fickle moviegoing public .
Whatever the case , the opening ’s body count works to his foundational purposes , creating an uneasy , unsettled atmosphere .
Mr. Shyamalan ’s words consistently fail him , as they have in the past .
But working again with the cinematographer Tak Fujimoto ( a longtime shooter for Jonathan Demme ) , he creates images  bodies falling , trees rustling  that at their most potent speak louder and more eloquently than those words .
Food price inflation is causing civil unrest worldwide and in the UK the cost of putting food on the table has soared .
This year basic staples will cost £ 780 more than they did last year according to grocery comparison site mysupermarket .co.uk , with the cost of bread , butter , eggs and potatoes increasing by as much as 60 per cent in 12 months .
Spurred on by rocketing supermarket bills , we are now turning in droves to cheaper alternatives and many are beating food inflation by growing their own .
Not since the 1970s , when The Good Life was first shown , has sustainable living enjoyed such a growth period .
And the numbers add up – dropping out and digging in could save as much as £ 1,400 a year .

But you do n't need a very large garden to make it pay .
Garden Organic believes a plot as small as 4ft x 4ft ( 1.2 m x 1.2 m ) could supply vegetables all year round for as little as £ 50 .
If you 've got a garden or can get your hands on an allotment , you can save a fortune in vegetables .
A standard allotment can yield around a ton of vegetables .
If you bought the same amount of organic potatoes , onions , carrots and parsnips in a year , it would cost you around £ 1,700 from Sainsbury 's or a minimum of £ 1,227 from Asda – even more if you have spent £ 30 a week on organic vegetables delivered in an attractive crate .
What you 'll need
You can spend a fortune on trowels , pruning sheers , pitch forks , shovels , a bit of space , compost bins , water butts and compost .
If buying new at Homebase for example , you 'll pay at least £ 130 for this list of equipment .
But buying second - hand equipment or using old shovels at the back of the garage , can work out much cheaper – and turning soil rather than pumping weights could save the cost of that expensive gym membership fee .
" For seeds in pots , you can just use your fingers and for digging your garden , raid the family garage or shed to see what has been forgotten and you can reclaim , " says Guy Barter , head of horticultural advice for the Royal Horticultural Society .
" Often older tools are better than today 's equivalents – just because of the care and attention that was put into the making of them .
Just remember to keep your tools clean and occasionally sharpen them and they will serve you well . "
You can choose to either buy packets of seeds to sow yourself , or you can opt for small plants that you put straight into a big pot on a windowsill or directly into the ground , he says .
" To save money on seeds , keep an eye out for seed - swapping events near you , " says Corner .
" These events have really taken off in the last few years , and even if you do n't have seeds to swap , you can still pick some up for a few pence .
If this is n't an option , buy seeds through a seed supplier . "
" Start composting your green waste and vegetable peelings by throwing them on a heap instead of in the bin and you can save pounds on bags of compost , " she adds .
" With home composting you will get a rich compost , full of organic matter , great for growing . "
What to grow
If you choose to grow onions , potatoes carrots and parsnips organically ( with a £ 300 budget for equipment , water and seeds ) , you could still save at least £ 1,400 compared to buying the same amount in Sainsbury 's or at least £ 927 if you usually shop at Asda .
These crops require the least effort , and are least likely to fail .
Even if you do n't consume a ton , root vegetables can be stored .
The cost of bread has gone up by a massive 20 per cent in the major supermarkets , from 54 p to as much as 65 p for a basic loaf .
But if you happen to have a spare 297sq m ( 3196sq ft ) you can grow enough wheat to supply the bread for a family of four every year , that 's worth over £ 100 a year if your family eats two loaves a week .
Indoor gardening
You do n't even have to have any outside space to grow your own .
Potatoes , mushrooms , tomatoes , and herbs can be produced indoors in windowsills and under sinks .
" Some vegetables thrive in containers on a windowsill or patio , " says Barter .
" Salad leaves , herbs , chillies , broad beans and beetroot will all grow indoors .
It also means your plants are less likely be attacked by a pest or disease . "
" The budget option would be to use old plastic bottles as pots , buckets , bins , or even an old pair of wellies , " says Corner .
" But if you have a little cash to spare then how about buying some planters , compost and seeds , which could cost as little as £ 30 . "
Economies of scale may mean the indoor option will not save as much , but the upside is by growing spuds indoors you wo n't find yourself furiously digging in the dark and rain in February to source the chips for dinner .

Added eggstras – the benefits of keeping your own chickens
Why stop at growing your own vegetables ?
The cost of free - range eggs has increased by almost 50 per cent in a year .
A dozen free - range eggs have gone up from an average of £ 1.75 to £ 2.58 .
So why not invest in your own chickens ?
Hens yield around four eggs a week each .
Three chickens should cost around £ 10 to £ 15 .
A bag of feed will be around £ 5 to £ 6 and lasts around three weeks .
A coop can be bought new from around £ 150 , although you could pick up a cheaper one second hand .
An outside space of at least 30x30 cm should be available for each bird .

How to get an allotment
By Photini Philippidou
Cultivating an allotment provides numerous social , health , environmental and economic benefits , but getting hold of a plot is becoming increasingly difficult .
The National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners ( NSALG ) says applications have doubled in the last five years .
Most councils have a waiting list , and around a third of applicants wait more than a year for a plot .
In central London , waiting lists can be as long as 10 years .
The good news is that all local authorities in England and Wales are legally obliged to provide any group of adults ( aged 18 and over ) with allotments of 250sq m , even if you own a garden , although some boroughs offer half plots of 125sq m .
However , inner-London local authorities are exempt from this statutory obligation , claiming a lack of money and a lack of available land .
If you live in central London the NSALG recommends you apply outside of your borough .
If your nearest site is not owned by your local authority , it may be privately owned in which case contact your local allotment association or your council to find out who the owner is , and whether you can rent there .
If you feel there is a need for allotments which are not being met , get together with a group of any six residents who are registered on the electoral roll and put your case to the local authority .
If you manage to get a plot from your local authority , it is for life .
The authority will need to apply to the Secretary of State to change the land 's use so you are technically safeguarded if you stay within the bounds of your tenancy agreement .
Allotments can cost anywhere between £ 5 and over £ 100 a year to rent , and this may or may not include your water .
But if you are renting from a local authority , it is your landlord 's responsibility to at least provide access to a mains water supply , as well as to maintain hedges and gates and paths and hauling ways .

As Frey stared at a copy of a scorecard from the game , he was resting in a recliner with his feet propped on a wheelchair .
Soon , the scorecard helped transport
Frey from a cozy room in an assisted - living facility here back to 1939 .
He noticed an advertisement promoting 10 miniature cigars for 15 cents .
“ Oh , those were the days , ” Frey said .
Similarly , Feller was transfixed by the game ’s box score .
After talking for almost an hour about his museum in Van Meter , Iowa ; about Babe Ruth ; about how he learned to throw a curveball ; about Lou Gehrig ; and about several other topics , Feller turned quiet .
He studied the names and numbers in the box score , steadying his glasses to gaze more intently .
He was silent for two minutes .
“ I see Lonny Frey went 1 for 4 , ” Feller eventually said , knowing that they were the only two living players from that game .
Three weeks before the game , Frey ’s son , Tom , was born .
Maggie ,
Tom ’s wife , teasingly said that family legend had it that Lonny was out late with his teammates the night before the birth .
Lonny was smart enough not to confirm that tale .
Although Frey played in three All - Star Games , he spoke humbly about them and referred to them as “ just another train ride . ”

The ride in 1939 carried Frey to the second spot in the lineup , hitting behind Stan Hack of the Chicago Cubs and in front of his teammate Ival Goodman .
Frey faced the Yankees ’ Red Ruffing , a control pitcher who he said “ made you hit the ball . ”
That worked for Frey , who described himself as “ base - hit crazy . ”
He said he tried to “ punch the ball somewhere . ”
He punched a double to right field in the third to put the N.L. ahead , 1 - 0 .
One inning later , the 62,892 fans , about 10,000 short of a sellout , saw the A.L. respond with two runs .
In the fifth , DiMaggio , who was hitting .435 , homered to put the A.L. ahead , 3 - 1 . Feller said DiMaggio was friendly , but added that the great , guarded Yankee was “ a recluse ” who isolated himself from his teammates .
Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails made headlines again this week as he released his new , four - part instrumental album Ghosts I - IV , at a variety of price points , including a $ 300 super - deluxe package .
He 's also giving away Ghosts I at no charge , even throwing the tracks up on The Pirate Bay for anyone to download .
And it appears to be working quite well for Reznor , who has managed to sell all 2,500 copies of his $ 300 package without major label backing or much in the way of splashy marketing .
If Reznor 's earlier experiments in digital distribution failed to recoup their costs , he 's clearly learned his lesson : grossing $ 750,000 in the space of three days is n't a bad haul for any businessperson .
Reznor was disappointed by an earlier experiment in which he released the music of his friend Saul Williams .
That album was available online either for free or for $ 5 ( for a higher - quality version ) .
Under 20 percent of downloaders paid up , and Reznor complained that he could n't even cover his costs for producing the album .
With Ghosts , Reznor had some obvious advantages .
NiN is a better - known brand with a devoted following , and Reznor 's strategy of using multiple price points made his music easily accessible to fans .
Those who wished to pay nothing could download a free version of Ghosts I . For $ 5 , a digital version of all four albums was available , and for only $ 10 , fans could get all the music on CD along with an immediate digital download .
$ 75 and $ 300 deluxe versions were also made available and include things like a Blu-ray disc , a DVD of the multitrack audio files from the project , videos , deluxe packaging , and more .
Can a ghost make you a millionaire ?
For all the talk of Reznor " pulling a Radiohead , " though , the actual strategy was different .
There is no " choose your price " component , and there is no free download of the complete project from the NiN site .
Instead , Reznor 's strategy is more akin to the " free sample " model .
It 's also an attempt to move beyond the music biz 's long - term fixation with a single product , the CD .
Reznor is using five price points to segment his offerings , and the extra work this required appears to have paid off .
In covering the story , the New York Times noted that " one option Mr. Reznor is not offering fans is a way to obtain the entire collection free , " but Ghosts I - IV is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike license that does allow noncommercial redistribution .
Even without a major marketing campaign , the album release generated so much interest that the NiN servers were knocked offline .
Reznor apologized to fans , saying , " Sorry again about the hassle .
Somebody kicked the plug out of our internets , but we 're all set now . "
Reznor gains something valuable from every transaction , even if downloaders elect not to pay ; he harvests the e-mail addresses of fans interested in his music .
These addresses are obviously marketing gold , but Reznor makes sure to treat his fans with respect , even when asking for their information .
" We hate spam as much as you do , if not more so , " he writes .
While it 's routine now to hear media execs talk about how " people want to do the right thing " when it comes to paying artists , those comments are generally followed by a defense of lawsuits , DRM , and ISP filtering plans .
The thinking goes that even in a world in which all locks can be picked , most people do n't stop locking their doors .
Reznor 's experiment shows that the carrot approach can work well for artists , even with the stick .
It was all going so predictably well .
Coldplay 's new album went straight to No 1 on Sunday , selling 300,000 copies in three days ; concerts sold out ; that iTunes ad was everywhere .
Even their notoriously sniffy critics in the music press seemed , with the odd exception , unusually muted .
Then , things took a sudden turn for the worse – with a plagiarism row .
Yesterday , the band was forced to issue a categorical denial of allegations that they copied the title track to their new record , Viva La Vida Or Death and All His Friends from a little - known US group , Creaky Boards .
In a video posted on the video - sharing website YouTube , Andrew Hoepfner , Creaky Boards ' singer and songwriter , claimed that the melody of Coldplay 's song , " Viva La Vida " , is pinched from a track he wrote last year called , ironically , " The Songs I Didn't Write " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
He blamed Chris Martin for the alleged artistic theft , saying that Coldplay 's frontman attended a Creaky Boards concert in New York last year .
" We were flattered when we thought we saw Chris Martin in the crowd , " said Mr Hoepfner .
" He seemed pretty into it ... Maybe TOO into it ? "
The clip , which was first posted on Sunday , rapidly went viral .
By last night , it had been watched by nearly 300,000 people , many thousands of whom had typed comments remarking upon the various similarities between the two tracks .
In an industry where even small chord sequences can become subject of costly copyright disputes , allegations of plagiarism are as potentially damaging to a musician 's finances as they are to their reputation .
Little surprise , then , that Coldplay responded with a vigorous denial .
" We totally refute their claims , and there are two facts that make it easy to disprove them , " said the band 's spokesman Murray Chalmers .
" First , on the night in October when the band say Chris Martin was watching them , he was actually working at the Air Studio in London , and we can prove that .
Second , even if he had been at the gig , " Viva la Vida " was written and demoed seven months before the night in question , so it could n't possibly have been copied . "
Sources close to the band said they were unlikely to pursue legal action against Creaky Boards , since it would " look bad " to start a David versus Goliath lawsuit against a group of young musicians .
They are , however , pushing for them to publicly withdraw the allegations of plagiarism .
The two tracks have different lyrics , say the Coldplay camp .
Although certain elements of their melody sound remarkably similar , the band say this is due to simple coincidence rather than a case of artistic theft .
Either way , the trite nature of Mr Hoepfner 's video clip has succeeded in gaining a new following for his band , and was driving traffic to their MySpace page .
The YouTube video concludes : " I wish Coldplay the best of luck .
If they ever want to collaborate , I 've got some microphones we could use in my bedroom . "
JANE WELLS of CNBC keeps a blog called Funny Business , but her recent reports on California ’s medical marijuana industry are about a business that is increasingly being taken seriously .
They amount to a short primer on how the business works and how the operators of the state ’s estimated 500 dispensaries deal with the high risks and high costs of working in a legal gray area ( cnbc.com ) .
Medical marijuana is legal in California , but federal law still bans sales .
Amid the uncertainty that this creates  including the occasional raid by federal agents  a full - fledged industry has blossomed , taking in about $ 2 billion a year and generating $ 100 million in state sales taxes , CNBC reported .
Setting up a clinic “ can cost as much as a hundred grand , ” Ms. Wells reports .
The equipment , the cuttings from which plants are grown and office space all tend to be expensive .
And from there , the costs only grow , mostly in the form of legal fees .
Many clinics keep lawyers on retainer .
Nonetheless , “ this is the business model of the future , ” says JoAnna La Force of Farmacy , an herbal remedy shop in Southern California .
Ms. LaForce says her business is close to breaking even ( medicalmarijuanafarmacy.com ) .
The volatile qualifier in C / C++ is widely misunderstood .
Because it is described so vaguely in language standards , many people interpret it as a do - what - I - mean qualifier .
What the standard says is that accesses to volatile objects must be evaluated strictly according to the abstract machine defined by the language standard ; this means that if the C/C++ code reads the volatile object twice , then the machine code must do so as wel .
The standard says that volatile objects must be stable at sequence points ; this means , approximately , that in between statements all reads and writes of volatile objects must have been completed –the value may not be cached in a register .
The standard makes clear that it is possible that the values of volatile objects may change in some unknown way between accesses .
One relatively unimportant misunderstanding is due to the fact that the standard only talks about accesses to volatile objects .
It does not talk about accesses via volatile qualified pointers .
Some programmers believe that using a pointer - to - volatile should be handled as though it pointed to a volatile object .
That is not guaranteed by the standard and is therefore not portable .
However , this is relatively unimportant because gcc does in fact treat a pointer - to - volatile as though it pointed to a volatile object .
A way to think about volatile is to observe that it was invented to support memory mapped hardware .
Some hardware is controlled by accesses to specific memory addresses .
For example , a serial controller often handles input by setting a bit in one memory location and making the new byte available in another memory location .
The kernel code must observe that the bit is set , read the byte , and set another bit to tell the serial controller that the byte has been read ( I ’m skipping the interrupt which is also involved ) .
These accesses should use volatile to make sure that they happen in the exact order written in the program .
The standard also explicitly describes two other uses of volatile .
One is for setjmp and is relatively uninteresting .
The other is that a variable of type volatile sig_atomic_t may be set in a signal handler and read by code outside the signal handler .
In fact , just about all that a portable signal handler may do is set such a variable .
For dealing with memory mapped hardware , volatile is exactly what you want .
For most other types of code , including multi- threaded code , volatile does not help .
Using volatile does not mean that the variable is accessed atomically ; no locks are used .
Using volatile does not mean that other cores in a multi- core system will see the memory accesses ; no cache flushes are used .
While volatile writes are guaranteed to occur in the program order for the core which is executing them , there is no guarantee that any other core will see the writes in the same order .
Using volatile does not imply any sort of memory barrier ; the processor can and will rearrange volatile memory accesses ( this will not happen for address ranges used for memory mapped hardware , but it will for ordinary memory ) .
Conversely , if you use the locking primitives which are part of any threading library , then you do not need to use volatile .
The locking primitives will include the required memory barriers or cache flushes .
They will include whatever special directives are needed to tell the compiler that memory must be stable .
There is one case where volatile may be used for multi- threaded programming with some reliability .
You may use a single volatile sig_atomic_t variable to communicate between threads , much as you may use such a variable to communicate between a signal handler and the main program .
You should not use more than one such variable to communicate between any pair of threads , as there is no guarantee that the different threads will see the accesses in the same order .
In summary , if you are using volatile for anything other than manipulating memory mapped hardware , or for very limited communication between threads , it is very likely that you are making a mistake .
Think carefully about what volatile means and about what it does not mean .

For the past year , STRATFOR has been focusing on what we see as the critical global geopolitical picture .
As the U.S. - jihadist war has developed , it has absorbed American military resources dramatically .
It is overstated to say that the United States lacks the capacity to intervene anywhere else in the world , but it is not overstated to say that the United States cannot make a major , sustained intervention without abandoning Iraq .
Thus , the only global power has placed almost all of its military chips in the Islamic world .
Exploiting U.S. Distractions Russia has taken advantage of the imbalance in the U.S. politico - military posture to attempt to re-establish its sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union .
To this end , Russia has taken advantage of its enhanced financial position — due to soaring commodity prices , particularly in the energy sector — as well as a lack of American options in the region .
The Russians do not have any interest in re-establishing the Soviet Union , nor even in controlling the internal affairs of most of the former Soviet republics .
Moscow does want to do two things , however .
First , it wants to coordinate commodity policies across the board to enhance Russian leverage .
Second , and far more important , it wants to limit U.S. and European influence in these countries .
Above all , Russia does not want to see NATO expand any further — and Moscow undoubtedly would like to see a NATO rollback , particularly in the Baltic states .
From a strategic point of view , the United States emerged from the Cold War with a major opportunity .
Since it is not in the United States ' interests to have any great power emerge in Eurasia , making certain that Russia did not re-emerge as a Eurasian hegemon clearly was a strategic goal of the United States .
The Soviet disintegration did not in any way guarantee that it would not re-emerge in another form .
The United States pursued this goal in two ways .
The first was by seeking to influence the nature of the Russian regime , trying to make it democratic and capitalist under the theory that democratic and capitalist nations did not engage in conflict with democratic and capitalist countries .
Whatever the value of the theory , what emerged was not democracy and capitalism but systemic chaos and decomposition .
The Russians ultimately achieved this state on their own , though the United States and Europe certainly contributed .
The second way Washington pursued this goal was by trying to repeat the containment of the Soviet Union with a new containment of Russia .
Under this strategy , the United States in particular executed a series of moves with the end of expanding U.S. influence in the countries surrounding Russia .
This strategy 's capstone was incorporating new countries into NATO , or putting them on the path to NATO membership .
NATO Expansion and Color Revolutions
The Baltic states were included , along with the former Soviet empire in Central Europe .
But the critical piece in all of this was Ukraine .
If Ukraine were included in NATO or fell under Western influence , Russia 's southern flank would become indefensible .
NATO would be a hundred miles from Volgograd , formerly known as Stalingrad .
NATO would also be less than a hundred miles from St. Petersburg .
In short , Russia would become a strategic cripple .
The U.S. strategy was to encourage pro-American , democratic movements in the former Soviet Republics — the so - called " color revolutions . "
The Orange Revolution in Ukraine was the breaking point in U.S. - Russian relations .
The United States openly supported the pro-Western democrats in Ukraine .
The Russians ( correctly ) saw this as a direct and deliberate challenge by the United States to Russian national security .
In their view , the United States was using the generation of democratic movements in Ukraine to draw Ukraine into the Western orbit and ultimately into NATO .
Having their own means of influence in Ukraine , the Russians intervened politically to put a brake on the evolution .
The result was a stalemate that Russia appeared destined to win by dint of U.S. preoccupation with the Islamic world , Russian proximity , and the fact that Russia had an overwhelming interest in Ukraine while the Americans had only a distant interest .
U.S. interest might have been greater than the Russians thought .
The Americans have watched the re-emergence of Russia as a major regional power .
It is no global superpower , but it certainly has regained its position as a regional power , reaching outside of its own region in the Middle East and elsewhere .
The Iranians and Germans must both take Russia into account as they make their calculations .
The Russian trajectory is thus clear .
They may never be a global power again , but they are going to be a power that matters .
The Closing Window
It is far easier for the United States to prevent the emergence of a regional hegemon than to control one that has already emerged .
Logically , the United States wants to block the Russian re-emergence , but Washington is running out of time .
Indeed , one might say that the Americans are already out of time .
Certainly , the United States must act now or else accept Russia as a great power and treat it as such .
This is why U.S. President George W. Bush has gone to Ukraine .
It is important to recall that Bush 's trip comes in the context of an upcoming NATO summit , where the United States has called for beginning the process that will include Ukraine — as well as Georgia and other Balkan powers — in NATO .
Having gone relatively quiet on the issue of NATO expansion since the Orange Revolution , the United States now has become extremely aggressive .
In traveling to Ukraine to tout NATO membership , Bush is directly challenging the Russians on what they regard as their home turf .
Clearly , the U.S. window of opportunity is closing : Russian economic , political and military influence in Ukraine is substantial and growing , while the U.S. ability to manipulate events in Ukraine is weak .
But Bush is taking a risky step .
First , Bush does n't have full NATO support , which he needs since NATO requires unanimity in these issues .
Several important NATO countries — particularly Germany — have opposed this expansion on technical merits that are hard to argue with .
Germany ’s stance is that not only is Ukraine not militarily ready to start meaningful membership talks , but that the majority of its population opposes membership in the first place .
Assuming Bush is n't simply making an empty gesture for the mere pleasure of irritating the Russians , the United States clearly feels it can deal with German objections if it creates the proper political atmosphere in Ukraine .
Put another way , Bush feels that if he can demonstrate that the Russians are impotent , that their power is illusory , he can create consensus in NATO .
Russia 's relatively weak response over Kosovo has been taken by Washington and many in Europe ( particularly Central Europe ) as a sign of Russian weakness .
Bush wants to push the advantage now , since he wo n't have a chance later .
So the visit has been shaped as a direct challenge to Russia .
Should Moscow fail to take up the challenge , the dynamics of the former Soviet Union will be changed .
The Russians have three possible countermoves .
The first is to use the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , its intelligence service , to destabilize Ukraine .
Russia has many assets in Ukraine , and Russia is good at this game .
Second , Russia can use its regional military power to demonstrate that the United States is the one bluffing .
And third , Russia can return the favor to the Americans in a place that will hurt very badly ; namely , in the Middle East — and particularly in Iran and Syria .
A decision to engage in massive transfers of weapons , particularly advanced anti-aircraft systems , would directly hurt the United States .
Of these options , the first is certainly the most feasible .
Not only is it where the Russians excel — and will such a strategy leave few fingerprints and produce results quickly — but the other two options risk consolidating the West into a broad anti-Russian coalition that may well return the favor across the entire Russian periphery .
The latter two options would also commit much of Russia 's resources to a confrontation with the West , leaving precious little to hedge against other powers , most notably a China which is becoming more deeply enmeshed in Central Asia by the day .
The Middle East Connection Still , the United States must focus on where most of its troops are fighting .
It would thus appear that provoking the Russians is a dangerous game .
This is why events in Iraq this week have been particularly interesting .
A massive battle broke out between two Shiite factions in Iraq .
One , led by Abdel Aziz al - Hakim — who effectively controls Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki due to the small size and fractured nature of al - Maliki 's party — confronted the faction led by Muqtada al - Sadr .
Clearly , this was an attempt by the dominant Shiite faction to finally deal with the wild card of Iraqi Shiite politics .
By the weekend , al - Sadr had capitulated .
Backed into a corner by overwhelming forces , apparently backed by U.S. military force , al - Sadr effectively sued for peace .
Al - Sadr 's decision to lay down arms was heavily influenced by the Iranians .
We would go further and say the decision to have al - Sadr submit to a government dominated by his Shiite rivals was a decision made with Iranian agreement .
The Iranians had been restraining al - Sadr for a while , taking him to Tehran and urging him to return to the seminary to establish his clerical credentials .
The Iranians did not want to see a civil war among the Iraqi Shia .
A split among the Shia at a time of increasing Sunni unity and cooperation with the United States would open the door to a strategically unacceptable outcome for Iran : a pro-American government heavily dominated by Sunnis with increasing military power as the Shia are fighting among themselves .
The Americans also did n't want this outcome .
While the Iranians had restrained al - Sadr at the beginning of the U.S. surge — and thereby massively contributed to the end of the strategy of playing the Sunnis against the Shia — Tehran had not yet dealt with al - Sadr decisively .
Just like Iran , the United States prefers not to see a new Sunni government emerge in Iraq .
Instead , Washington wants a balance of power in Baghdad between Sunnis , Shia and Kurds , and it wants intra-communal disputes to be contained within this framework .
If a stable government is to emerge , each of the communities must be relatively ( with an emphasis on " relatively " ) stable .
Thus , not for the first time , American and Iranian interests in Iraq were aligned .
Both wanted an end to Shiite conflict , and that meant that both wanted al - Sadr to capitulate .
This is the point where U.S. and Iranian interests can diverge .
The Iranians have a fundamental decision to make , and what happens now in Iraq is almost completely contingent upon what the Iranians decide .
They can do three things .
First , they can hold al - Sadr in reserve as a threat to stability if things do n't go their way .
Second , they can use the relative unity of the Shia to try to impose an anti-Sunni government in Baghdad .
And third , they can participate in the creation of that government .
We have long argued that the Iranians would take the third option .
They certainly appeared to be cooperating in the last week .
But it has not been clear what the U.S. government thought , partly because they have been deliberately opaque in their thinking on Iran , and partly because the situation was too dynamic .
Bush 's Long Shot
It is the decision to visit Ukraine and challenge the Russians on their front porch that gives us some sense of Washington 's thinking .
To challenge Moscow at a time when the Russians might be able to support Iran in causing a collapse in the Iraqi process would not make sense .
The U.S. challenge is a long shot anyway , and risking a solution in Iraq by giving the Iranians a great power ally like Russia would seem too much of a risk to take .
But Bush is going to Ukraine and is challenging the Russians on NATO .
This could mean he does not think Russia has any options in the Middle East .
It also could mean that he has become sufficiently confident that the process ( let 's not call it a relationship ) that has emerged with the Iranians is robust enough that Tehran will not sink it now in exchange for increased Russian support , and that while a crisis with Syria is simmering , the Russians will not destabilize the situation there —
Syria lacks the importance that Iran holds for U.S. strategy in Iraq , anyway .
Bush 's decision to go to Ukraine indicates that he feels safe in opening a new front — at least diplomatically — while an existing military front remains active .
That move makes no sense , particularly in the face of some European opposition , unless he believes the Russians are weaker than they appear and that the American position in Iraq is resolving itself .
Bush undoubtedly would have liked to have waited for greater clarity in Iraq , but time is almost up .
The Russians are moving now , and the United States can either confront them now or concede the game until the United States is in a military position to resume Russian containment .
Plus , Bush does n't have any years left in office to wait .
The global system is making a major shift now , as we have been discussing .
Having gotten off balance and bogged down in the Islamic world , the only global power is trying to extricate itself while rebalancing its foreign policy and confronting a longer - term Russian threat to its interests .
That is a delicate maneuver , and one that requires deftness and luck .
As mentioned , it is also a long shot .
The Russians have a lot of cards to play , but perhaps they are not yet ready to play them .
Bush is risking Russia disrupting the Middle East as well as increasing pressure in its own region .
He either thinks it is worth the risk or he thinks the risk is smaller than it appears .
Either way , this is an important moment .
Kristoff Wennersten figured his prom proposal had to be one - of - a - kind if it would have any chance of being accepted .
But the Huron High School senior never imagined it would result in a suspension for himself and 12 of his varsity lacrosse teammates , whom he recruited to help spell out the message at a school soccer match via their derrieres .
The players displayed the question , " Will You Go To The Prom With Me? Yes or No ? " on their posteriors while mooning Huron senior Carolyn Campbell at a game .
Reporter Jeff Arnold can be reached at 734-994-6814 or jarnold@annarbornews.com .
All 13 players were suspended for a undetermined number of games and ordered to complete 20 hours of community service .
The students were also suspended for one day of school .
Huron 's lacrosse matches , scheduled for this past Saturday and Monday , were postponed .
" Inappropriate is inappropriate , " Huron athletic director Dottie Davis said Monday after meeting with lacrosse varsity players and their parents .
" It disrespects women , and that 's the clear message we need to have the students understand - what may be fun to them is n't necessarily fun to everyone else . "
Campbell , who accepted the prom invitation by patting the lower back of the player displaying the word ' Yes , ' described Wennersten 's method as " cute " and said she was n't upset by the manner in which she was asked .
" People get pretty creative with prom .
Anyone who 's done anything has been pretty outlandish , " Campbell said .
" This is pretty epic , I would say .
" I did n't think it would become this big of a deal . "
Neither did Wennersten , who said the idea was more " spur of the moment " than anything .
Originally , his friends suggested a sign .
But Wennersten pushed for a grander plan .
After serving his one - day school suspension Friday , Wennersten said he understands why he and his teammates were disciplined .
" I can appreciate the fact that ( school officials ) need to exercise a certain amount of punishment just to follow the rules , but I think they may have stretched it out of proportion , " he said .
" It was just something to do .
" I enjoyed every bit of it . "
The prom proposal , which took place during a Huron junior varsity soccer match Thursday night , has drawn attention in Huron 's hallways .
Most students said they found the proposal humorous and thought school officials blew it out of proportion .
But Davis said she has heard from parents offended by the incident .
Carolyn's mother , Melinda , said she and her husband were stunned when their daughter informed them of Wennersten 's prom invitation .
" It 's hard to know what to do , " Melinda Campbell said .
" It just happened .
I hate to say , ' No harm , no foul ' because some people were harmed .
But it has certainly caused a lot of excitement . "
Karen Van Eck , whose sophomore son , Forrest , plays for Huron 's junior varsity lacrosse team , was n't among those upset .
But she said she saw the need for punishment .
" Some very nice kids made a really bad choice , " Van Eck said .
" I think it all boils down to respect .
Who wants a bunch of boys with their butts hanging out ( representing the school ) ?
They had to do something . "
Davis , who has n't yet decided the length of the players ' suspension , said she hopes other students learn from the incident .
" We 're always preaching educational athletics , " she said .
" So we 'll deal with it , move on and hope it does n't happen again . "
Aid from a number of Asian countries has been arriving in Burma The World Food Programme says it will resume aid flights to Burma on Saturday , despite a row over the local authorities impounding deliveries .
The government said it had taken control of the aid to distribute it .
The UN secretary general urged Burma to allow in aid teams " without hindrance " .
Later , the UN launched a $ 187.2 m ( £ 96 m ) appeal to help victims of the cyclone .
Burma 's envoy to the UN expressed his gratitude and said they would accept aid from any quarter .
The sheer survival of the affected people is at stake

" What we urgently need are medical supplies , food , clothes , emergency generators , food and shelter .
This flash appeal is timely and welcome . "
He added that the first US plane to be allowed in is expected to arrive in Burma on Monday .
Announcing the appeal , UN humanitarian chief John Holmes said it was vital that any obstacles that had hindered aid deliveries until now be resolved soon .
" If we do not act now and do not act fast , more lives will be lost , " he said .
Burmese state media say 22,980 people were killed , but the UN fears between 63,000 and 100,000 people could be dead or missing .

The country 's ruling generals have faced mounting criticism over their handling of the crisis , their reluctance to allow international aid teams into the country and their insistence on distributing aid themselves .
Mr Ban said he had been unable to contact the head of the ruling junta , General Than Shwe , to ask him directly to allow relief teams in .
" If early action is not taken and relief measures put in place the medium - term effect of this tragedy could be truly catastrophic , " he said .
The generals have also been criticised for going ahead with a national referendum on a new constitution on Saturday , while so many people are in desperate need of aid .
The government says the referendum will pave the way for democratic elections in 2010 , while the opposition says it is intended to tighten the generals ' rule .
The BBC's Andrew Harding says it is a gamble and now there is a chance that public anger could translate into big " No " vote , particularly given the military handling of the storm 's aftermath .
Disease fears
The UN fears more than 1.5 million people have been affected by the cyclone , with tens of thousands made homeless and vulnerable to disease .

In pictures : Cyclone survivors The World Health Organization says access to clean drinking water and outbreaks of communicable diseases such as dengue and malaria are a major concern .
Hundreds of thousands of people have no food , water or shelter .
International aid agencies on the ground say some aid has been distributed in the delta region , but they have reached only 10 % of those that need help .
The World Food Programme says discussions with the government will continue about the impounded aid - which includes 38 tonnes of high - energy biscuits , enough to feed 95,000 people .
But regional director Tony Banbury said talks on Friday had stalled and he was worried that a national referendum being held on Saturday would scupper further negotiations .
" I do n't know what channels will be open to us to communicate with the relevant authorities , and to encourage them to reverse this very unfortunate decision , " he said .
' Murdering own people '
Some charities say they have succeeded in getting some help through but are worried that reports of aid efforts being hampered could stop people making donations if they think it is not making a difference .

Send us your comments " That would be a huge irony because they 're getting there and it would be a tragedy if those stopped flowing in the next few days , " said Save the Children 's Jasmine Whitbread .
" Every day we 've been able to reach another 10,000 people with bottled water , food , plastic sheeting , blankets , the basic life - saving response kit that we do in all humanitarian responses . "
The BBC's Jonathan Head in neighbouring Thailand said the military leaders appeared to be putting their pride and entrenched suspicion of foreigners before the lives of their people .
One aid official told him the Burmese government was " murdering their own people by letting them die " .
Tim Costello , from World Vision Australia , said aid workers in Burma were experiencing feelings of guilt about not being able to do enough and felt fear and frustration as a result of that .
" But their job is to work with the situation and keep hope alive and keep going , " he told a Disasters Emergency Committee news conference in London .
Thai pressure The BBC's Paul Danahar , in southern Burma despite restrictions on journalists , says the survivors need more than food .
He says they have been cut off and helpless for seven days and are surrounded by tens of thousands of rotting corpses .
What they really need , he says , is the corpses to be moved , clean water , shelter , and efforts to start rebuilding the devastated infrastructure .
The UN refugee agency , the UNHCR , says two trucks with shelter supplies are due to cross the border from Thailand on Saturday .
Spokeswoman Vivian
Tan said the agency had assurances from the government that it would be allowed to monitor the distribution process .
Thailand 's Foreign Minister , Noppadon Pattma , said he would be asking his Burmese counterpart to be more flexible regarding the admission of aid and aid teams .

Morgan Tsvangirai feared for supporters ' safety at the polls Zimbabwe 's opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has taken refuge in the Dutch embassy in the capital , Harare .
A Dutch foreign ministry spokesman said Mr Tsvangirai had spent the night at the embassy as he feared for his safety but had not requested asylum .
On Sunday , he announced he was withdrawing from a presidential election run-off in the face of violence from ruling party militias .
Zimbabwean officials have said the second round will still go ahead .
But Botswana 's Foreign Minister Pando Skelemani said leaders of the Southern African Development Community ( Sadc ) would have to decide whether Zimbabwe could have a legitimate president in the current political climate .

" If in fact the atmosphere for an election is not free and fair you then can't have someone having won , " he told the BBC .
" It would be the same as if you had been through the election and they are declared not free and fair , then you are back at square one . "
Ahead of a UN Security Council discussion about Zimbabwe , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said President Robert Mugabe 's regime " cannot be considered legitimate in the absence of a run-off " .
Mr Tsvangirai says pressure from the UN and Sadc could force Mr Mugabe to give up power .
" My assessment is that if there is a collective position by all Sadc leaders , that would be sufficient pressure - that voice is essential , " he told US National Public Radio .
Police told AFP people were removed from the MDC HQ for hygiene reasons " The conditions of the Security Council on Zimbabwe has one outcome that we will expect ... to appoint a mission to investigate the level of abuses that have taken place - rape , torture , murder - and the various human rights abuse that has taken place . "
Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan told the BBC that he believed the elections should be postponed : " Honestly , given what has happened , I doubt that anyone would accept the results , so they should put off the elections .
But I think it is important that we all realise that Zimbabwe needs our help . "
Zimbabwe 's Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa said Mr Tsvangirai's announcement of his withdrawal was a ruse as he had not sent a formal notice yet .
Arrests
The BBC's Peter Biles in Johannesburg says Mr Tsvangirai is now considering his next move , but he remains in the Dutch compound .
ZIMBABWE AND ITS NEIGHBOURS Zimbabwe 's opposition wants neighbouring countries to persuade Robert Mugabe to step down .
So how are relations changing ?
South Africa 's leader Thabo Mbeki remains the key mediator .
He has not criticised Mr Mugabe , despite pressure from the ruling ANC .
Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa called Zimbabwe a " regional embarrassment " , before suffering a stroke on 29 June .
Angola 's President Jose Eduardo dos Santos is one of Robert Mugabe 's closest allies .
He has urged Mr Mugabe to end the violence .
Botswana said Zimbabwe 's 27 June run -off vote was so flawed by violence that it could not be considered legitimate .
Namibia is an ally of Robert Mugabe .
It wants to re-distribute white - owned farms to black villagers .
It has not criticised the violence .
Mozambique has hosted some white farmers forced out of Zimbabwe when their land was seized .
It is seen as sympathetic to the opposition .
Tanzania 's ruling party has a history of backing Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party .
Its foreign minister has condemned the violence .
DR Congo's President Joseph Kabila is an ally of Robert Mugabe who sent troops to help his father , Laurent Kabila , fight rebels .
Malawi is seen as neutral .
But 3 m people from Malawi are in Zimbabwe and many were badly hit by the farm invasions .
BACK NEXT 1 of 9 Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen said that if Mr Tsvangirai was looking for safety at the diplomatic mission , he was welcome .
" We 've seen the last weeks a new low in the tortured history of Zimbabwe and I think that Mr Mugabe no longer has any moral legitimacy in the eyes of the people of Zimbabwe , " he told the BBC .
Mr Tsvangirai blames supporters of President Mugabe and the ruling Zanu - PF party for the death of 86 of his supporters in the run-up to the second - round , due to be held on Friday .
On Monday , more than 60 supporters of Mr Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) party were arrested at its Harare headquarters .
MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said those arrested were women and children who had fled political violence .
Zimbabwean police told AFP news agency they had only moved 39 people from the building for " hygiene reasons " .
President Mugabe and Zanu - PF blame the opposition for political violence across the country .
The MDC won the parliamentary vote in March , and claims to have won the first round of the presidential contest outright .
In the official results , Mr Tsvangirai led but failed to gain enough votes to avoid a run-off .

" I think the questions were asked .
I think we pushed .
I think we prodded .
I think we challenged the president .
I think not only those of us in the White House press corps did that , but others in the rest of the landscape of the media did that .
…
The right questions were asked .
I think there ’s a lot of critics - and I guess we can count Scott McClellan as one - who think that , if we did not debate the president , debate the policy in our role as journalists , if we did not stand up and say , ‘ This is bogus , ’ and ‘ You ’re a liar , ’ and ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ that we did n’t do our job .
And I respectfully disagree .
It ’s not our role .
" That was NBC correspondent David Gregory , appearing on MSNBC ’s “ Hardball With Chris Matthews . ”
He was responding to former White House press secretary Scott McClellan ’s new book , “ What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington ’s Culture of Deception . ”
McClellan has challenged the role of the U.S. media in investigating and reporting U.S. policy in times of conflict , especially when it comes to covering the government itself .
While the diversity of the United States dictates that there will be a divergence of consensus when it comes to individual values and ideals , the collective ought to agree that the foundation upon which all American values and ideals should be judged is the U.S. Constitution , setting forth as it does a framework of law which unites us all .
To hold the Constitution up as a basis upon which to criticize the actions of any given president is perhaps the most patriotic act an American can engage in .
As Theodore Roosevelt himself noted , “ No man is above the law and no man is below it ; nor do we ask any man ’s permission when we ask him to obey it .
” Now David Gregory , and others who populate that curious slice of Americana known as “ the media , ” may hold that they , as journalists , operate on a different level than the average American citizen .
As Mr. Gregory notes , it is not their “ role ” to question or debate policy set forth by the president .
This is curious , coming from a leading member of a news team that prides itself on the “ investigative ” quality of its reporting .
If we take Gregory at face value , it seems his only job ( or “ role ” ) is to simply parrot the policy formulations put forward by administration officials , that the integrity of journalism precludes the reporter from taking sides , and that any aggressive questioning concerning the veracity , or morality , or legality of any given policy would , in its own right , constitute opposition to said policy , and as such would be “ taking sides .
” This , of course , is journalism in its most puritanical form , the ideal that the reporter simply reports , and keeps his or her personal opinion segregated from the “ facts ” as they are being presented .
While it would be a farcical stretch for David Gregory , or any other mainstream reporter or correspondent , to realistically claim ownership of such a noble mantle , it appears that is exactly what Gregory did when he set forth the parameters of what his “ role ” was , and is , in reporting on stories such as the issue of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and the Bush administration ’s case for war .
For this to be valid , however , the issue of journalistic integrity would need to apply not only to the individual reporter or correspondent , but also to the entire system to which the given reporter or correspondent belonged .
In the case of Gregory , therefore , we must not only bring into the mix his own individual performance , but also that of NBC News and its parent organization , General Electric .
The media were not interested in reporting the facts , but rather furthering a fiction .
Time after time , I backed my opposition to the Bush administration ’s “ case ” for war on Iraq with hard facts , citing evidence that could be readily checked by these erstwhile journalists had they been so inclined .
Instead , my integrity and character were impugned by these simple recorders of “ fact ” , further enabling the fiction pushed by the administration into the mainstream , unchallenged and unquestioned , to be digested by the American public as truth .
Scott McClellan is correct to point out the complicity of the media in facilitating the rush to war .
David Gregory is disingenuous in his denial that this was indeed the case .
Jeff Cohen , a former producer at MSNBC , has written about the pressures placed on him and Phil Donahue leading to the cancellation of the latter ’s top-rated television show just before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 .
Katie Couric , the former co-host of NBC ’s “ Today Show ” ( and current news anchor for CBS News ) , has tacitly acknowledged “ PRESSURE ” from above when it came to framing interviews in a manner that was detrimental to the Bush administration ’s case for war .
Jessica Yellin , who before the war in Iraq worked for MSNBC , put it best : “ I think the press corps dropped the ball at the beginning , ” she told CNN ’s Anderson Cooper .
“ When the lead - up to the war began , the press corps was under ENORMOUS PRESSURE FROM CORPORATE EXECUTIVES , frankly , to make sure that this was a WAR THAT WAS PRESENTED in a way that was CONSISTENT WITH THE PATRIOTIC FEVER AND THE PRESIDENT'S HIGH APPROVAL RATINGS .
” Now , one would think that a journalist with the self - proclaimed integrity of Gregory would jump at the opportunity to take the bull by the horns , so to speak , and focus on this story line , if for no other reason than to prove it wrong and thereby clear his name ( guilty by association , at the very least ) and the name of the organization he represents .
The matter is simple , on the surface : NBC network executives either did , or did n’t , pressure their producers and reporters when it came to covering and framing stories .
Surely an investigative reporter of Gregory ’s talent can get to the bottom of this one ?
David Gregory has vociferously defended the role he and NBC News played in the lead - up to the Iraq war .
Scott McClellan ’s new book , combined with testimony from other sources , including those from within the NBC News family , has called into question the integrity of the operation Gregory serves .
An allegation from a credible source has been made , and any denial must therefore be backed with verifiable , documented information .
To paraphrase former Secretary of State Colin Powell when talking about Iraq before the invasion , the burden is on NBC to prove that it was n’t complicit with the Bush administration concerning its reporting on Iraq and administration policies , and not on NBC ’s critics to prove that it was .
The old proverb notes that " a fish stinks from its head . "
Something that aptly describes the General Electric / NBC News team when discussing the issue of Iraq .
I challenge David Gregory to demonstrate otherwise .- Scott Ritter ( " Investigate This , " TruthDig , 6-10 - 2008 )
Designer Yves Béhar has unveiled the successor to the XO laptop for the One Laptop Per Child project - a folding tablet design called XOXO .
The computer , which is half the size of the XO and features two hinged touch - screens , was launched in Boston today .
The original XO laptop won the Design of the Year award at the Design Museum in London earlier this year .
Here is a statement from Béhar , followed by the official announcement from OLPC :
--
With the XO ( 1.0 ) , we pushed the boundaries of what a laptop could be by lowering the cost dramatically , being green ( no heavy metals , lowest energy consumption ever ) , and a human - driven unique design approach .
Now , with XOXO ( 2.0 ) , we are challenging what a truly collaborative and creative computing experience could be ... a true departure from the traditional keyboard and screen layout , a new way to interface and play with data , information and communication :
imagine if your learning machine was an uninterrupted screen one could interface with from any direction
imagine if it was a reading experience just like a book , and at the same time a seamless large visual tablet
imagine if children could play board games sitting across from each other ( or computer games ) .
The XOXO is a book , a tablet , a board ... and yes , a laptop too if that is what you need .
The design is still green and white , but thin , simple , and un-interrupted by keyboards , buttons , speaker holes , input devices and visible connectors .
And it is soft to the touch , like a piece of luggage , everyday luggage you can take anywhere .
Planned for early 2010 , the XOXO should be the next learning object of desire , from Bogota , to Istanbul , to New York .

ONE LAPTOP PER CHILD FRAMES NEXT GENERATION OF REVOLUTIONARY XO LAPTOP
Second - generation XO laptop will continue to break through technology and cost barriers to deliver affordable learning tools for children in the poorest countries
Cambridge , Mass. , May 20 , 2008 – One Laptop per Child ( OLPC ) , a non-profit organization focused on providing educational tools to help children in developing countries “ learn learning , ” announced today that work is already underway on a second - generation version of its revolutionary XO laptop computer .
Leveraging new advances in technology , the primary goal of the “ XO - 2 ” will be to advance new concepts of learning as well as to further drive down the cost of the laptop so that it is affordable for volume purchase by developing nations .
“ Based on feedback from governments , educators and most important , from the children themselves , we are aggressively working to lower the cost , power and size of the XO laptop so that it is more affordable and useable by the world ’s poorest children , ” said Nicholas Negroponte , founder and chairman of One Laptop per Child .
“ The delivery of the first generation XO laptop has sparked tremendous global interest in the project and provided valuable input on how to make the XO laptop an even better learning tool moving forward . ”
“ One Laptop per Child and the XO laptop are crucial to the fulfillment of the proposed UN Ninth Millennium Goal : to ensure that every child between the ages of 6 and 12 has immediate access to a personal laptop computer by 2015 , said , Nirj Deva , Member of the European Parliament .
“ It ’s only through access to education that young people will be able to develop the skills necessary to compete globally and to develop the solutions required to break the cycles of poverty , disease and malnutrition .
Learning unites the child with the world , binds the village into a community , and joins that community to the global village . ”
The first generation XO laptop went into production in early November 2007 , and there are approximately 600,000 units in deployment in a number of countries including Peru , Uruguay , Mongolia , Haiti , Rwanda , Mexico , Cambodia , Ethiopia , Ghana , Iraq , Afghanistan , and the US and Canada ( as a result of the Give One Get One charitable giving campaign that ran last November 12 – December 31 , 2007 ) .
Key goals for the XO - 2 include :
Cost Reduction – Set in early 2005 , the original target price of the XO laptop was $ 100 .
Although that target has not yet been met ( it is now at $ 188 ) , it is clear that OLPC must aim for an even lower target price of $ 75 .
New developments in display , processor and other hardware and software technologies will make it possible to achieve the $ 75 target in the future
Lower Power Consumption –
While the first generation XO laptop already requires just one - tenth ( 2 - 4 watts versus 20 - 40 watts ) of the electrical power necessary to run a standard laptop , the XO - 2 will reduce power consumption even further to 1 watt .
This is particularly important for children in remote and rural environments where electricity is scarce or non-existent .
Lowering the power consumption will reduce the amount of time required for children to generate power themselves via a hand crank or other manual mechanisms
Smaller Footprint –
The XO - 2 laptop will be about half the size of the first generation device and will approximate the size of a book .
The new design will make the XO laptop lighter and easier for children to carry with them to and from school or wherever they go .
The XO - 2 will continue to be in a green and white case and sport the XO logo in a multitude of colors that allow children to personalize the laptop as their own possession
Enhanced Book Experience – Dual - touch sensitive displays will be used to enhance the e-book experience , with a dual - mode display similar to the current XO laptop .
The design provides a right and left page in vertical format , a hinged laptop in horizontal format , and a flat two - screen wide continuous surface that can be used in tablet mode
Younger children will be able to use simple keyboards to get going , and older children will be able to switch between keyboards customized for applications as well as for multiple languages .
The dual - touch display is being designed by Pixel Qi , which was founded in early 2008 by Mary Lou Jepsen , former chief technology officer of One Laptop per Children and a leading expert on display technology .
“ It ’s crucial that the design of the XO laptop produce something that is both highly functional and a lot of fun for children to use , ” said Yves Behar , founder of the fuseproject , a San - Francisco - based design and branding firm , and the industrial designer of the XO laptop .
“ Children have an amazing capacity to let us know how they use the laptop and what they want .
The design of the next - generation XO is in response to their passion for learning , for sharing with each other , and for self - expression . ”
Availability of the XO - 2 is planned for delivery in 2010 .
XO - 1.5 will be released in the spring of 2009 with the same design as the first generation but with fewer physical parts and at a lower cost than XO - 1 .

" A nation of sheep must in time beget a government of wolves . " ~ Bertrand de Jouvenal
At this point in time , few people have not heard the stories about the West Texas Polygamists who had some 440 children seized by local authorities .
The courts recently ruled that there was insufficient evidence to seize the children in the first place .
The authorities acted outside their rights in taking the children from their mothers , members of the sect , so says the Austin - based , Texas Third Court of Appeals .
Regardless of one 's feelings about this particular group of people , it still strikes me as convenient selective logic to attack this group , or any other supposed cult , particularly when those attacks come from the State .
When those attacks are supplemented with the cataclysmically misnamed Child Protective Services it just makes bad matters worse .
Imagine a scenario where people have been , over centuries , conditioned to support the cohesive social grouping (s ) into which they are born .
A random twist of fate makes them members .
From the time they are born until their death , they are subjected to repeated assurances — both by other members and by the directors of the group (s ) — that the most important aspect of their lives is their unmitigated support for their way of life , their culture , which is largely defined by membership in this group .
In fact , they are told in no uncertain terms , via practiced pledges of allegiance to the cult 's coat of arms at schools funded by the cult , that the cult is " indivisible " and endowed by a holy creator with " liberty and justice for all . "
The cult has managed to infiltrate every aspect of life : land management , ownership of everything from real property to DNA , education , agriculture , medicine , appropriate personal choices , trade and sale of all goods , and even trade between the cult and other equally oppressive cults around the world .
Imagine that this cult is so controlling that it requires — at gunpoint — allegiance to its geographical dominion .
Attempts to leave the cult , either geographically or jurisdictionally , without permission , are grounds for lethal force by cult representatives .
Indeed , for the organization to survive , its participants must not be allowed to easily leave as this could be construed as a sign of weakness .
To make sure its subjects understand its power , this cult requires that those born into it continue to pay tribute to it no matter where they live , i.e. , even if they do succeed in escaping its geographic boundaries .
Anyone who fails to follow this edict will have their personal liberty taken away immediately upon returning to the cult 's geographic boundaries .
Punishment is swift for those who fail to pay " their fair share " of income they made even while not within the geographic boundaries of the cult .
Periodically , this cult stages a great spectacle during which the members ostensibly get to select their leaders .
History has shown that those who rise to the highest ranks of leadership during these spectacles are almost uniformly of the same socio- economic class , educational attainment , and have been , for the overwhelming majority of the cult 's existence , of the same race and sex .
Not only do they think alike , but they look alike as well .
Careful analysis of the founding of this cult shows that its progenitors were simply well - to - do subjects of another cult looking for a scam they could themselves enjoy .
Not - so - careful analysis of the outcome of these leadership - selection spectacles shows that little , if anything , in the normal daily lives of the lower - echelon cult members ' changes as a result of these leader - selection pageants .
Interestingly , the cult 's stated highest principles appear to pander to the " equality of men " and other supposedly egalitarian concepts .
Simultaneously , those who govern the cult exist in a socio- economic stratum nearly impenetrable by their subjects .
In an effort to appease those who might wonder why these trappings are not more generally available , that is , why their best efforts do not result in economic outcome that one might otherwise expect , the cult 's leaders set up laws that supposedly guarantee equality of access and equality of outcome for those far below them in status .
Ironically , these laws — since they fly directly in the face of basic Austrian economic theory — preserve the conditions that the lower echelons hope to escape .
Often they further enrich those at the top of the bureaucratic food chain .
Worse , they pit factions at the lower ends of the socio- economic spectra against each other while preserving the position of the cult leaders .
Minimum wage legislation — a price floor — guarantees that those employable below that specific wage threshold will not get a job : unemployment must therefore result .
Maximum price control legislation — a price ceiling — guarantees that demand will far exceed supply : shortages must therefore result .
Believing that this cult has successfully discovered the Rosetta stone of cult dogma and operation , well - schooled members of the cult routinely travel outside its geographic boundaries and physically attack those who ostensibly threaten it .
Interestingly , few seem to notice or care that the leaders of this cult — chickenhawks to their core — rarely endanger themselves in these misadventures , instead filling their armies with sacrificial lambs from socio-economic strata far below them .
These crusades are always couched in the rhetoric of securing the blessings enjoyed by those within the cult for those unlucky enough to live outside its geographic boundaries or beyond its direct governance .
More often , these wars are either wag - the - dog exercises or outright profit - generating exploits for the cult 's leaders or their cronies .
This cycle continues interminably .
Lather .
Rinse .
Repeat .
We are , of course , talking about the State .
The disconnect , the query , the puzzlement , from whence the idea for this essay arose relates to why the State , obviously a cult , is not more vigorously decried , particularly outside libertarian circles , while voluntary organizations which have been labeled as “ cults ” by the State , are .
Amazingly , those who exist under the State ’s vicious talons also simultaneously support attacks on voluntary organizations simply because the State labels them as cults .
How many among us , after hearing that a cult has been " taken down " would not almost reflexively think , " Good .
We ’re all safer now ! "
This while enjoying membership — if one can call it enjoying — in a cult that arrests and incarcerates anyone who decides they ’d rather not contribute to the coffers .
Voluntary ?
Hardly .
Draconian ?
Absolutely .
The moral inconsistency necessary to deride sects like the one in West Texas — or any other similar organization as described by the mainstream media — while simultaneously chanting “ USA ! USA ! " at a ballgame spins the mind .
The irony is overwhelming .
Maybe I overstate .
Do you think one ca n’t end up in a " U.S. Rape Room , " A.K.A. a prison , for failing to contribute to whatever cause the State dreams up ?
Well , Wesley Snipes — who has apparently been granted an appeal that will keep him out of prison for the time being — would beg to differ .
Marion Jones is doing time right now because she lied in statements to representatives of the cult of state .
( She lied about taking part in an exploit that was not against the law per se , so she is effectively in jail for lying , not for taking part in the exploit ! )
The list of people in similar ( and much worse ) circumstances to Jones is long , and that 's even if one ignores the people being dishonestly held at places like Guantanamo Bay , where they are often held without formal charges or any idea of exactly the edict against which they have transgressed .
One hears the stories about how cult members on some compound can’t leave and laments their plight .
Then we hear about illegal aliens getting arrested as they attempt to leave the U.S.
Does that not sound similar ?
Have you ever watched an episode of the Sopranos and wondered how the soldiers of le Cosa Nostra can so blindly follow the orders of a crime boss ?
You should n’t , well , unless maybe you missed a little story about a place called Abu Graib .
While one might , if he ignores years of evidence , suppose that this one time the rights - infringers acted outside the orders of their superiors , the evidence points in another direction .
When one of those current superiors , someone like Michael Mukasey is even to this day somehow unclear , at least publicly , on whether or not water boarding is actually torture , it does n’t require a great deductive leap to think that the behavior of those at Abu Graib was more about getting caught enforcing orders than acting out against orders .
Conclusion
The classical ( read : statist ) definition of a cult seems to be any organization that does n’t meet some standard of normalcy in its construction , its basis , its membership , or its practices .
By that account , any socially - cohesive organization not fully authorized ( read : paying tribute to , after being licensed by ) the State , is a cult .
That this definition ( or maybe those who ascribe to it ) often does n’t include the most “ cultish ” organization ever invented is an example of intellectual gymnastics worthy of Olympic gold .
Here ’s a suggestion : Forget about all the other cults .
Do n’t worry about them .
Just leave them alone .
Break free from the vicious grasp of selective logic and decry the most dangerous cult of all .
One of the rubrics employed by Austrian economists to determine if an activity is illegal or unethical evaluates the level of choice employed by the participants .
Simply put , was the transaction voluntary for all involved .
For example , in the case of prostitution as long as there is a willing buyer and a willing seller , ceteris paribus there can be no activity warranting law enforcement or bureaucratic concern .
Similarly , if one voluntarily joins an organization that requires him to wear a chicken suit while baying at the moon on Wednesday nights , that is fine as well .
While this activity might not appeal to everyone , anyone is free to partake , or not .
However , the instant the participants and their chicken - suit - wearing friends require all in some arbitrary geographical region ( country , state , county , city ) to pay for buying , cleaning , and repairing the chicken suits , well , that ’s a problem .
Just because one may have been taught , for as long as they can remember , that the original chicken suit wearers were founding fathers or that wearing chicken suits is patriotic is truly irrelevant .

Contrary to popular belief , the sailors of Columbus 's day did not think they would sail right off the edge of the Earth .
They were , however , apprehensive about what they would find in their travels .
Mistakes about marine life have ranged from inaccurate assumptions about the behavior of known species to fanciful depictions of animals that " might " exist .

This excerpt of a map of Iceland by a Flemish cartographer shows sea monsters that some believed inhabited the surrounding waters .
Some speculation about this monster - riddled map , however , is that it aimed to dissuade Europeans from moving to an island that the current settlers preferred to keep to themselves .

Although many of the monsters that decorated Renaissance maps were just that — decorations —
Olaus Magnus took great care to label the creatures on his Carta Marina and provide an explanatory key to what they were , which suggests that he depicted animals he believed to be real .
And some of the animals on his map can be related to real animals , such as the walrus , the blue whale and the giant squid .
But other animals were more fanciful .
This sea monster duo includes a lobster , just one described as 12 feet long .
The monster dining on lobster is apparently a sea rhinoceros , but unlike most of the other sea monsters on Olaus 's map , this one was not named in his key .
The sea rhino was likely inspired by a real animal , but not one that ever lived in the ocean .

After pointing out that a " monstrous Fish " appeared off the coast of England in 1532 , Olaus Magnus wrote , " Now I shall revive the memory of a monstrous Hog that was found afterwards , Anno 1537 , in the same German Ocean , and it was a Monster in every part of it .
For it had a Hog 's head , and a quarter of a Circle , like the Moon , in the hinder part of its head , four feet like a Dragon's , two eyes on both sides of his Loyns , and a third in his belly inkling toward his Navel ; behind he had a Forked - Tail , like to other Fish commonly . "
Olaus Magnus then went on to compare the beast to heretics who , he believed , lived like swine .
The naturalist had been born a Catholic , but his homeland of Sweden , like most of northern Europe , was Protestant by the time he produced his map so rich in sea monsters .
Remaining a Catholic , Olaus was evetually named Archbishop of Uppsala , though he had hardly any fellow believers to oversee there ; he and his brother had already moved to southern Europe .
His Catholic disdain for Protestants was more than reciprocated , with Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon distributing pictures of a " pope-ass " and a " monk - calf . "
Besides claiming thousands of lives , Europe 's religious divisions in the 16th and 17th centuries caused a renewed interest in monsters ( sea bishops proliferated ) with Christians of both flavors blaming each other for the weird new creatures .

Though unusually colorful and flamboyant compared to the actual animals , these late - 16th - century whales appear less monstrous than creatures inhabiting maps made just a few decades earlier .
The gaggles of pinnipeds poking their heads above the sea surface also look more realistic .
It 's not surprising that the animals would be more realistic given that Barentsz earned a reputation for accurate depictions of landmasses of the Arctic regions .

And the frowning swimmer in the lower right is a pretty recognizable dolphin , even if it 's uncharacteristically grumpy for a cetacean .
The most interesting creature is the one in the left half of the image carrying a human passenger .
That odd animal bears a combination of mismatched features : sea-serpent tail , mammalian face with an almost human expression , winged arms and front flippers .
( The humanoid figure with the shell should probably pass without comment . )
The ocean was still full of unknowns in the 16th century , and maritime travel would remain perilous for centuries to come .
No doubt sailors and their sweethearts worried about sea creatures , but it's also possible that some of these illustrations served as pure decoration .

He went on to say that this fish " shines at night like a star . "
The other fish was described as " like a bunch of grapes . "
Perhaps the so - called plume could be explained by a fleeting glimpse of a nudibranch , jellyfish , flatworm , or annelid , and plenty of marine animals are bioluminescent .
Explaining the bunch of grapes , however , is harder .
Much harder .
It looks like the Muppet Gonzo dressed in a floral - print bodystocking , neither of which existed in the 16th century .

Whatever misconceptions existed about cetaceans in his day , Paré relayed what was likely an accurate account of whale hunting , explaining that whenever a whale was sighted in one seaside city , " all the inhabitants of the town run to the spot with whatever of their equipment is necessary to catch it .
. . . and with all their might they throw [ their harpoons ] upon the whale , and when they perceive that it is wounded — which is recognized by the blood that is issuing from it — they loosen the ropes of their [ harpoons ] , and follow it so as to fatigue it and catch it more easily ; and drawing it on board , they rejoice and are merry ; and they divide [ it ] up , each getting his portion according to the duty he will have performed . "
This woodcut , possibly borrowed from an earlier source , has some hits and misses .
The blowhole , issuing a plume , is n't bad .
The tail looks like that of a fish , but more conspicuous are the menacing eye and man-sized tusks .
Perhaps the tusks served the purpose of making this cetacean - human encounter appear more evenly matched .

Garraway 's ranked among his favorites ; when he started his own splinter philosophical club , he and his pals gathered at Garraway's .
In November 1679 , he bought himself a " sea hog " ( porpoise ) .
It was no longer living , and refrigeration was nowhere near invented yet , so the specimen would have been slippery and aromatic by the time he took possession of it .

Originally appeared in : Church of Saint Martin in Zillis , Switzerland
Now appears in : Sea Monsters on Medieval and Renaissance Maps by Chet Van Duzer
The painted ceiling of the Church of Saint Martin serves as a sort of medieval bestiary .
Surrounding the Earth on the church ceiling is an ocean populated by an assortment of hybrid creatures , each one a land animal mixed with a fish .
The ceiling boasted a horse fish , goat fish , rooster fish , etc .
One of the hybrids was an elephant fish .
This picture suggests that the painter had some idea of what an elephant trunk looks like — notable since medieval Europeans did n't often see elephants .
It also reflects the belief common at the time that every land - dwelling animal had a marine counterpart .

The common medieval belief that every land animal had its counterpart in the sea did n't just play out on church ceilings ; printed bestiaries also highlighted marine versions of familiar animals .
This woodcut from Hortus Sanitatis features a sea cow ( top ) , sea dog ( middle ) , and sea horse ( bottom ) .
Medieval and Renaissance Europeans also believed the vast ocean held watery counterparts of things they could see in the sky .
Remnants of these old beliefs linger in the names of some aquatic and marine animals today , such as catfish and starfish .

This woodcut is labeled " pistris , " a term Nigg likens to " prister " or " physter . "
It may have been loosely based on a sperm whale .
Although The King 's Mirror , a 13th - century manuscript written in Old Norwegian , characterized the sperm whale as a gentle giant , a more common view was that the cetaceans were malicious .
In the 16th century , Olaus Magnus opined , " They roam about in all the seas looking for ships , and when they find one they leap up , for in that way they are able to sink and destroy it the more quickly . "
This illustration shows a scaly creature with legs and a pig - like snout attempting to do just that .

Perhaps this was another example of an assumed marine counterpart to every terrestrial animal .

" Polypus " means multi-legged , but the term did n't tell medieval and Renaissance Europeans very much about any other aspect of the animal 's body .
Decades after this woodcut appeared in Hortus Sanitatis , Olaus Magnus showed the polyp on his map Carta Marina and discussed the animal in his book Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus .
But while the map showed an animal that looked like a big lobster , the book described an animal sounded more like an octopus .
This image looks like neither .
Instead , it looks like the artist took advice along the lines of , " Well , it 's a fish with eight legs . "

Van Duzer notes that some of Gastaldi's 16th - century maps showed creatures such as camels and elephants on the giant landmass assumed to exist in the Southern Hemisphere — even though naturalists of his time knew that cold conditions likely predominated in both polar regions .
Van Duzer remarks , " This abundance of geographically inappropriate monsters in the southern continent confirms the impression that the sea monsters give , namely that Gastaldi ( or the buyers of his maps ) was interested in monsters purely as exotic decoration , rather than as conveying information about what specific creatures lived in specific distant parts of the world .

Centuries ahead of the Expressionist artist Edvard Munch , an illustrator placed a similarly terrified , screaming face in the Indian Ocean .
Because many of the maps rich in sea monsters were prepared for rich armchair travelers — who could afford the extra fees for the clever illustrations — it might be a mistake to assume that this fin-framed face belonged to a creature that anybody truly believed to be real .
But monster lore did survive well beyond the late 16th century .

Not only does this sea turtle fly , but it does so in the frigid waters of Northern Europe .
This almost - smiling turtle might have been an exaggerated version of a sea turtle with front flippers transformed into wings , but Chet Van Duzer points out that another map published the same year by Arnold Nicolai bore an explanation that it was published " In Antwerp by Arnold Nicolai at the sign of the turtle , " and that turtles also appeared around the text that accompanied the map .
Van Duzer remarks , " This it seems that in the extravagant flying turtle we are to see a subtle advertisement for the publisher . "
This cheerful little creature was published by a different individual , but it was n't the only example of Nicolai 's flying turtle being copied ; another winged turtle appeared in a map published 20 years later .
So a possible advertisement might have been transformed into a creature that at least by some map readers came to regard as real .

In literature and maps from the Middle Ages and Renaissance , creatures known as the swordfish , sawfish and Ziphius " morphed from one animal into another under different names , " in the words of Joseph Nigg .
Unlike the " rapier - billed " animals known as swordfish and sawfish today , the animals bearing these names during the Renaissance might have been inspired by the orca , or killer whale .
And in medieval bestiaries , and the natural - history - as - moral - instruction book Physiologus , the swordfish / sawfish was an entirely different animal .
It had wings .
" There is an animal in the sea called the swordfish , which has long wings ; and , when he sees the ships sailing , he imitates them and raises his wings and strives with the ships as they sail .
Growing tired , after racing three or four miles or more , he folds up his wings and the waves carry him back to his former abode where he was at first .
The sea is the world , the ships are the prophets and apostles who cross through this world .
The swordfish who does not keep pace with the crossing ships represents those who are abstinent for a time but who do not persevere with good pace .
These begin with good works but do not persevere to the end because of greed , pride , and love of wicked gain . "

In the mid-19th century , the captain and crew of Daedalus were convinced they had seen a sea serpent .
Richard Owen was equally convinced they had not .
When pressed for a hypothesis on what they had seen , he ventured a sea lion .
Owen did n't dismiss " monsters " out of hand , having named a big group of extinct reptiles " deinos sauros " ( " terrible lizard " ) , but he wanted physical evidence .
The insistence on physical evidence — a carcass of a dead sea serpent , or a fossilized bone of an extinct one — was a change in common practice when it came to verifying the validity of sea-serpent stories .
Such sightings were considered proven if eyewitness accounts could be assembled before a lawyer , judge , or other government official .
When respectable citizens vouched for the existence of such a creature and respectable judges ruled their testimony truthful , challenging the monster 's existence was bad form indeed .

How could a serpent coil on top of the water like that ?
But the background was equally interesting .
This giant serpent slithered over the water in close proximity to ships and a densely populated coast .
The apparent intent of this lithograph was to argue that sea serpents not only existed , but that they existed in busy shipping lanes .

Plesiosaurs might have been able to use their heads as rudders to change direction while swimming , but they could n't very well swim in a straight line while turning their heads to take in the scenery .
But while the curvy necks may have been wrong , the caption accompanying this image about " the sea that once covered the plains " in North America has turned out to be right .

Edward Drinker Cope was an early champion of bipedalism in some dinosaurs , and as the 19th century wore on , a growing inventory of theropod fossils would support his argument .
But this illustration also shows his initial interpretation of the plesiosaur Elasmosaurus .
Cope argued that Elasmosaurus was bigger than Plesiosaurus described decades earlier in Britain .
Cope also thought his new plesiosaur genus had a relatively short neck and very long tail , and that it relied more on its long tail than its flippers to move through the water .
Cope was wrong .
He had n't found a plesiosaur with a completely different body shape .
He had simply mounted the head on the wrong end of the body , a mistake that provided Cope 's fossil - hunting rival , O.C. Marsh , a great deal of schadenfreude .

But he might have done himself a favor to give more weight to long - necked plesiosaur fossils found by earlier fossil diggers .
His desire to defeat his arch - rival Marsh might have driving his conviction that he'd found something wholly unprecedented .

A motley assortment of marine reptiles cozy up with cephalopods in this scene .
The caption describing the species did n't quite match with the animals depicted in 1873 , but a couple could be easily recognized .
On is the ichthyosaur that practically floats on the water surface across the middle of the picture .
Another is E.D. Cope 's not - yet - corrected , short - necked , long - tailed Elasmosaurus .
Near the right edge of the picture , the elasmosaur dangles its forked tongue , goggle eyes staring right at the reader .
It 's almost a cartoon villain .

Edward Drinker Cope first identified the plesiosaur Elasmosaurus and made the significant mistake of placing its head on the end of its tail .
Cope apparently based his initial reconstruction on his work with lizards .
His mistake had been corrected by the time Charles Knight produced this illustration , but while this picture was far more accurate , it was still problematic .
Modern reconstructions of Elasmosaurus indicate that its neck was n't flexible enough to coil like a snake .

According to the caption in the original publication , this picture shows " the ichthyosaurus in the act of devouring a fish ; the plesiosaurus , which has seized a pterodactyle , or flying reptile , on the wing ; together with crocodiles and alligators , which are depicted on the shores .
Turtles and tortoises are prowling on the banks , and the waters of this primeval sea are tenanted by corals , shells , crustacea , and fish , appropriate to this peculiar period of the history of nature . "
Although this image does give the plesiosaur a dragon - like appearance , the scene is much less apocalyptic than other depictions of prehistoric life at the time ; this picture looks cheerful , except maybe for the poor creatures becoming meals .

Using another artistic convention , the scene shows low tide — enabling the reader to see the sea lilies and shells on the sea floor .
The reptile is a Nothosaurus .
Modern depictions of the animal look less crocodilian , but this image is in keeping with modern interpretations in showing a semiaquatic animal that could live in water or on land .

A plesiosaur , an ichthyosaur and an apparent squid engage in a three - way confrontation in a choppy sea under a threatening sky .
This late - 19th - century engraving upholds a tradition that started decades earlier , according to Zoë Lescaze .
She writes , " The study of prehistoric marine reptiles began in the immediate aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars , which were characterized by spectacular maritime battles .
This context shaped both scientific conceptions and artistic depictions of the aquatic creatures , giving rise to assumptions that they were inherently violent . "
The plesiosaur appears grouchy .
The ichthyosaur looks like a cheerful warrior .

Designed in the era of Art Nouveau , the Berlin Aquarium opened to great fanfare in 1913 .
The Allied bombing of Berlin 30 years later largely flattened the aquarium , which was rebuilt a decade later .
In 1977 , aquarium director Heinz - Georg Klös found something that , remarkably , had survived World War II : original plans for the bombed - out building .
Appealing to the public for saved photos or postcards of the original structure , Klös began a project to recreate murals of prehistoric life .
In the early 1980s , the recreations were completed , in flamboyant Miami Vice colors .
Harder 's surviving plesiosaur picture , alas , lacks the pretty pastels , but preserves what some paleontologists believed in the early 20th century .
Some argued that plesiosaurs waddled up onto land to lay eggs , like modern marine turtles .
Recent fossil finds suggest that at least some plesiosaurs gave live birth , similar to modern whales .

By the late 18th century , Europe 's savants had begun wrapping their brains around the concept of an ancient Earth that had both predated humans by an unimaginable time span and crawled with strange creatures .
The savants also hired capable artists and engravers to render accurate depictions of the fossils they found .
The year 1780 marked the discovery of an enormous fossil reptile in underground quarries near the Dutch town of Maastricht .
Nineteen years later , Faujas published a description of the reptile .
The excavation picture may be a little dramatic , but the illustration of the fossil itself is pretty accurate ( the oval - shaped objects with the skull are fossil sea urchins ) .
Faujas 's interpretation was n't quite as accurate as the pictures .
He classified it as a giant crocodile .
Today , the fossil is identified as a mosasaur , an extinct marine reptile .
Considering how little was then known about prehistoric life , Faujas 's mistake is pretty forgivable .

The plesiosaur might be on land for the necessity of laying eggs considering Waterhouse Hawkins painted this picture before paleontologists found evidence of live birth in those marine reptiles .
A slightly less forgivable mistake is the plesiosaur 's serpentine neck .

Robert Darwin gave the fossil to the Royal Society of London , and William Stukeley wrote a paper about it , which was published the following year .
Stukeley described the fossil as " a rarity , the like whereof has not been observ'd before in this Island . "
He was right about that .
He continued that it " cannot be reckon 'd Human , but seems to be a Crocodile or Porpoise . "
He was partially right about that .
It was n't human .
But it was n't a porpoise or crocodile , either , though crocodile was n't a bad guess .
In fact , Charles Darwin 's great - grandfather found the first recognized fossil of a Jurassic reptile , one that spent even more of its time in the water that a crocodile would .
It was a plesiosaur .
A generation later , Charles Darwin 's grandfather , Erasmus , would puzzle over fossils turned up in canal excavation , animals only partially resembling modern life forms .
Erasmus Darwin would begin to suspect what biologists understand today : Life evolves .

Thomas Hawkins was passionate about paleontology , eccentric ( as the Brits like to euphemize lunacy in affluent people ) , and sometimes dishonest .
Hawkins was convinced he had the world 's best collection of Mesozoic marine reptiles , and he might have been right .
Writing both men separately , he convinced William Buckland and Gideon Mantell , the men who formally described the first dinosaurs known to science , that his own collection was worth a fortune .
Buckland then persuaded the trustees of the British Museum to buy Hawkins 's collection , and after the fossils were delivered , museum natural history curator Charles König gave a 25 - foot - long ichthyosaur a closer inspection .
He soon suspected something was off .
The delivered fossil was several feet longer and more complete than the specimen pictured in Hawkins 's Memoirs .
That image , spanning two pages in Hawkins 's collection catalog , is shown here .
With the aid of a small knife , König confirmed that Hawkins had " completed " a fin ( outlined in black in this image ) and several feet of the tail .
The ensuing scandal eventually involved the British House of Commons .
Just how unethical Hawkins 's behavior was is actually open to debate .
Aiming to make specimens look complete , many museums supplemented fossils with plaster well into the 20th century .
This ichthyosaur is still on display in the Natural History Museum , London .

Around 1884 , a man with the surname of Davis ( his first name is lost to history ) found a strange , fragmentary fossil in Western Australia .
It was curved , and it bore what looked like teeth .
Mr. Davis gave the fossil to a naturalist , the Reverend J.G. Nicolay , who passed it along with the request that it be named for its finder .
A photo of the fossil , followed up by the object itself , reached the British desk of Henry Woodward , editor of The Geological Magazine .
Woodward later recounted , " I readily identified the fossil photographed as the impression of a fish - spine , similar in form , but more highly curved than those . . . originally described by Prof. Leidy as a fish - jaw , and named by him Edestus vorax in 1855 . "
In fact , the good Professor Joseph Leidy had been right about the teeth part .
The fossil Woodward identified consisted of teeth , not spines .
In fairness , Edestus was not easy to identify .
The fossil comprised a curved line of teeth , and it was a pioneering female paleontologist , Fanny Rysam Mulford Hitchcock , who realized that the Edestus fossil was a midline tooth structure .
Think about your own teeth .
On both your upper and lower jaw , you have two pairs of incisors , a pair of canines , two pairs of premolars , and ( depending on whether you 've had your wisdom teeth yanked out ) two or three pairs of molars .
In other words , on both jaws , your teeth come in pairs .
In Edestus , there were medial lines of teeth sprouting from the front of the fish .
That 's kind of weird .
Weirder still , though Woodward originally identified this fossil as Edestus davisii , it later proved to be a partial whorl of the spiral - toothed Permian shark Helicoprion .
Helicoprion would be described by Alexander Karpinsky in 1899 , and reconstructing that species would entail a series of colorful mistakes for more than a century .

Before the first dinosaurs walked the Earth , a strange breed of sharks swam its oceans .
Dating to about 270 million years ago , Helicoprion left few remains for paleontologists , having bodies made of cartilage .
What remains have been found defy easy explanation because they consist of teeth arranged in whorls with older , smaller teeth in the middle of the whorl , and newer , bigger teeth around the perimeter .
Scientists across Eurasia and North America offered multiple explanations for the odd fossil , and some of the earliest interpretations showed the whorl teeth as defensive weapons , as in this illustration by Karpinsky .
More recent interpretations of Helicoprion fossils place the whorl in the lower jaw , teeth facing upward — a circular saw in the mouth .
So earlier paleontologists can certainly be forgiven for their misfires ; the real animal was hardly less weird than guesses from a century ago .

How the fish could eat with this thing in the way is n't clear .
Other interpretations have placed the whorl on the tip of the tail , or on top of the animal where the dorsal fin would be .
The weird whorl teeth have inspired the long - term artistic fascination of fish - and - fossil artist Ray Troll .

Atopodentatus unicus lived around 244 million years ago in what is now China .
Fossil remains described in 2014 were well - preserved , except for the head , where nature played a cruel trick on paleontologists ( main image ) .
The fossilization process had apparently folded the animal 's mouth , prompting the original team of scientists to hypothesize that the animal fed flamingo style , foraging in the mud for tiny invertebrates .
Science writer Brian Switek described the mouth as " a zipper smile of little teeth . "
In 2016 , better - preserved remains of Atopodentatus unicus pushed a serious rethink about the reptile 's face ( inset ) .
The new interpretation shows a wide , flat , vacuum - style mouth designed to scrape algae off rocks .
In fairness to the 2014 research team , the new interpretation is ( a ) a hammerhead , " a shape previously unknown in the reptilian fossil record , " according to Science News , ( b ) perhaps the oldest recognized marine reptile that subsisted on plants , and ( c ) still weird , just in a different way .

The Whirlpool , or Prister , is of the kind of Whales , two hundred Cubits long , and is very cruel . "
To scare off the monster , Olaus recommended noisy war trumpets or cannons , or pouring lye into the water .
He also recommended " casting out huge great Vessels , that hinders this Monsters passage , or for him to play with all . "
Indeed , the worried sailors in this picture drop big barrels into the sea , perhaps hoping to distract the monsters with playthings .
Joseph Nigg surmises that the prister legend might have been inspired by the sperm whale , though sperm whales rarely act as aggressively as Olaus indicated .
Whether sperm whales truly measure 200 cubits long depends on how you size a cubit .

The Roman Sea Devil , he pointed out , did n't have horns .
Gesner was such a prolific natural historian thanks largely to a wide network of associates .

This improbable creature is probably based on the monk seal .
Once common in the Mediterranean , the species was decimated by human hunting .
Fishermen considered the seals a smelly nuisance .

Contrary to what we might guess today , Renaissance naturalists were plenty skeptical about many of the descriptions and illustrations they encountered .
Getting by on a small salary in a landlocked country , however , Gesner could n't see many sea creatures for himself .
He had to rely on the work of others , including a book about the northern European ocean by Olaus Magnus .
Of Magnus 's sea creatures , Gesner wrote , " It seems that he depicted many according to seafarers ' tales rather than from life . "
Still , Gesner published this picture of a walrus .
Gesner had a big reservation about it : " Fish do n't have feet . "
He confessed that fins can resemble feet in large fish skeletons , but thought the artist took too many liberties here ( which he did ) .
Why would Gesner think of a walrus as a fish ?

Gesner suspected that the walrus ( which he called " rosmarus " ) was the same as another creature known as " morss piscis . "
That was an accomplishment , considering how different they looked .
This especially fuzzy , scrappy picture was likely made from a dried skin .
Poorly preserved specimens and confusing illustrations meant that the two animals were n't recognized as the same thing until the end of the 17th century .

More outlandish than the walrus that Conrad Gesner depicted in 1558 were the mountain - sized animals that Olaus Magnus showed a few years earlier , with curving tusks protruding upward from their lower jaws .
His accompanying text was a bit less hyperbolic than the picture , merely comparing their size to that of elephants .
Olaus employed both terms in use at the time : rosmarus and morss .
" The Norway Coast , toward the more Northern parts , hath huge great Fish as big as Elephants , which are called Morsi , or Rosmari , may be they are so from their sharp biting ; for if they see any man on the Sea - shore , and can catch him , they come suddenly upon him , and rend him with their Teeth , that they will kill him in a trice . . .
They will raise themselves with their Teeth , as by Ladders to the very tops of Rocks , that they may feed on the Dewie Grasse , or fresh Water , and role themselves in it , and then go to the Sea again . . . "

This very quadrupedal creature looks ill - suited to life in the ocean , looking more like an elephant missing its proboscis .
Pliny once described a " sea elephant , " perhaps in keeping with the long - held belief that every land animal had a marine equivalent .
This early - 16th - century depiction of the " morsus " might have been based on that belief , or might have resulted from confusion about the correct terminology for walruses .
Walrus tusks had been traded for centuries , sometimes carved into exquisite pieces such as the Lewis Chessmen .
But , as Lawrence explains , " Nobody except the hunters who killed walruses on the Arctic ice saw living walruses : carcasses were immediately channeled through the marketplaces of Northern European shores , into apothecary shops , curiosity cabinets , and natural histories . "
To confuse matters even more , Russians occasionally traded mammoth teeth around the same time .

In his map and book on Scandinavia , Olaus Magnus did n't just describe monsters .
He wrote about the occasional kind fish as well .
This vignette , which resembled a similar picture in his map , shows a swimmer assailed by multiple small troublesome fish while simultaneously aided by the benevolent rockas , or ray .
The ray is trying to drive away the smaller fish , which he characterizes as " Sea - Dog fish , " and spare the swimmer from drowning .
Olaus compared the ray 's kind actions to those of the dolphin , also believed to come to the aid of human swimmers in danger .

It 's not clear what the sea monster that Olaus Magnus referred to as a prister really was .
It might have been inspired by the sperm whale , which is not so aggressive as the porcine animals shown here .
Whatever the sea monster was , sailors under attack could deter their cetacean assailants by blowing noisy trumpets , throwing empty barrels sat the animals , or pouring lye into the water .
This illustration also shows other hazards mariners faced : mean birds and sucking fish .

Olaus Magnus 's monster - rich sea map included multiple creatures that inspired Conrad Gesner , even when Gesner had his doubts about the accuracy of the original illustration .
One such animal was what Gesner termed the " boar whale . "
Ambroise Paré adapted the popular depiction and pointed out its " scailes set in a wonderfull order . "
Joseph Nigg speculates that the boar whale shown on Olaus Magnus 's map might have been inspired by the walrus , and this animal certainly boasts walrus - style teeth , though they 're pointing in the wrong direction .
What might have inspired the tapestry - like body pattern remains a mystery .

At a time when naturalists were still puzzling over classifications of broad groups , however , Belon classified all flying vertebrates as birds and all swimming vertebrates as fish , including those that gave live birth .

The sea monster might have been inspired by tempestuous seas as much as by a glimpse of any actual animal .

Amsterdam apothecary Albertus Seba portrayed another hydra in the 18th century .
Seba had his doubts about its authenticity , but more than one " respectable eye witness " vouched for the accuracy of the stuffed specimen , so he published this picture of it .
Seba 's mistake is understandable in light of the fact that most genuine animals were either preserved in spirits or stuffed by the time they reached him .

Most of Seba 's work was more realistic than the hydra .

This picture does n't show any egregious errors , only differences between the 18th century and the current day .
Most shells are dextral , meaning if you hold the shell so the spire is up and the aperture is facing you , the aperture will usually be on your right side .
In these shells , the aperture is flipped .
Seba did n't accidentally flip every shell ; printing techniques of the time produced mirror images .
What 's probably more striking is the artistic representation .
This circular arrangement was actually part of a larger ornate page of mollusks .
In Seba 's day , the line between science and art was pretty fuzzy , but it arguably made the science more entertaining .

The trouble with trying to identify exotic species of blowfish from remote regions was that savants had to rely on dried specimens of dubious preservation .
Working in the Netherlands , Clusius admitted that he could n't dissect the fish to see their internal organs .
Some of his contemporaries were starting to do just that , recognizing that superficial characteristics did n't tell the whole story .
In the case of these blowfish , each woodcut represents what Clusius identified as a distinct species , but they were probably all the same species — preservation problems made them look so different .

The 17th - century German Jesuit polymath Athanasius Kircher established a fabulous museum in Rome , filled with antiquities , speaking tubes , odd animals and fossils .
Some of these " wonders " were too fantastic to be true .
( Kircher believed every story he ever heard about someone catching a dragon — assuming that someone was a pope . )
But much of what he collected was absolutely real .
These fish carcasses and shark teeth must have looked outlandish to the visitors to Kircher 's museum , but fish like these swim in the sea today .
After Kircher died , Buonanni took over his collection and published a catalog in the early 18th century .
These images from the catalog show some 18th - century progress in accurately depicting sea life .

Strange as it looks by today 's standards , this picture of a dissected head of a giant white shark actually marked significant progress in marine biology .
For years , fossilized shark teeth were believed to be tongues of serpents turned to stone by Saint Paul , and hence were named glossopetrae , or " tongue stones . "
Niels Stensen correctly identified tongue stones as shark teeth , though he was not the first person in history to do so .
In fact , Steno 's picture was derived from a 16th - century unpublished work by papal physician Michele Mercati .

Although Steno 's depiction of a dissected shark head was a step forward in scientific accuracy , Scilla felt he could improve upon Steno 's work .
Scilla was an accomplished painter and a coin collector .
He believed — and informed his readers — that his experience in these fields gave him insights into fossils and other natural specimens that others could not .
Rare were the ancient coins that depicted the same emperor and came from the same mint .
Likewise , rare were the human faces that looked the same .
Where others perhaps saw uniformity in sharks and their teeth , Scilla saw individuality .
He delivered detailed depictions to different kinds of sharks , including a hammerhead , advancing accuracy even a little further than Steno .

In contrast to the sober assessments of shark heads by Steno and Scilla from the previous century , this 18th - century etching of a dried shark head was much more sensational , with a name to match .
The so - called sea dragon 's eye leers at the viewer , perhaps sizing up a potential meal .
The title and picture highlighted an accurate feature of the shark 's anatomy : multiple rows of sharp teeth .
This depiction 's sensationalism likely had a shrewd purpose .
It might have been an advertisement for the display of this creature at the 1775 Frankfurt Easter Fair .

Sixteenth - century naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi correctly rejected the notion that the biblical 40 - day flood could embed shells inside the rocks of mountain ranges .
He incorrectly endorsed the idea that fossils could grow in place from inorganic processes making crude imitations of living things .
He clung to this belief even when he was astonished by the exquisite details of fossil fish .
But fossilization was hardly understood in his day .
( Aldrovandi lived a century before Stensen ; Musaeum Metallicum was published more than 40 years after Aldrovandi's death ) .
He did n't connect glossopetrae to sharks , but instead recommended them as an antidote for snake venom , to be mixed in wine or water .

This artifact , photographed from a private collection , shows a Greek hero fighting a creature known as the ketos .
Showing some characteristics of sea serpents ( frilly back and gaping , toothy mouth ) and some of whales ( flippers and a whale fin ) might have been inspired by a glimpse of an actual whale .
The fanciful depiction of this creature , however , contrasts with the accurate renditions of dolphins , an octopus and even a seal .
The seal , mostly likely a monk seal , turns out to be a far more accurate rendition than most of the pictures that would follow in succeeding centuries .
Year : c. 130 BC
Now appears in : Sea Monsters by Joseph Nigg
The ketos figured prominently in Greco - Roman lore .
Poseidon was said to have produced multiple sea creatures with his sea -nymph queen Amphitrite .
Meaning " sea monster or very large fish , " the term " ketos " apparently first appeared in Homer 's epics , when Odysseus worried about an attack from one of Amphitrite 's troublesome pets .
This crested ketos carries a sea nymph on the silver lid of a circular container known as a pyxis .
It was found at Canosa di Puglia , Italy .

Whatever real animal might have inspired the mermaid legend , a creature that is human above and fishy below the waist may also have had numinous roots .
The earliest religious inspiration for the mermaid could be Atargatis , an ancient Syrian goddess associated with water and charged with safekeeping her worshippers ' overall welfare .
Belief in the goddess spread , eventually adopted by Greek culture .
This crude but recognizable Atargatis came to share coin space with Demetrius III .

Not only does it provide a picture of natural history in Renard 's time , it also gives a picture , albeit a distorted one , of wildlife in the waters around Ambon , Indonesia .
As those ocean waters are now polluted , Renard 's book offers our only clues about much of the wildlife around Ambon in the 18th century .
That said , almost 10 percent of the species shown in his book are imaginary .

This pretty little dolphin puts to shame some dolphin depictions that follow by more than 2,500 years .
It appears as a decoration on a blade from the Late Helladic I period , now on display at the National Museum in Athens .
This image suggests that observations of dolphins were more factual than fanciful several centuries before Homer composed his epic poems .
In fact , Mesolithic hunter - gatherers likely traveled the Mediterranean Sea some 13,000 years ago , so locals had plenty of time to learn about the region 's wildlife .
Modern biologists suspect that this cetacean might be the striped dolphin , or Stenella ceruleoalba .

At the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America ( GSA ) in October 2011 , Mark McMenamin made an unbelievable announcement : A heap of Triassic ichthyosaur bones in Berlin - Ichthyosaur State Park , Nevada , was the work of a 100 - foot - long giant cephalopod , or kraken .
The kraken killed the ichthyosaurs , carried them home , munched away their squishy parts then daintily arranged their vertebrae into a self portrait of its own suckers .
While horrified fellow paleontologists realized this was not a story from The Onion , breathless journalists whose idea of journalism is repeating press releases of even the most outlandish claims without getting second opinions spread the news of the giant , sadistic , artistic kraken .
Skepticism crept into news reports a day or so later , including the headline " Smokin ' Kraken " and " Scientist Definitively Proves Existence of Hyper- Intelligent Mythical Octopus . "
Was McMenamin joking ?
Could he really be serious ?

So maybe this was bound to happen .

Centuries later , a very talented naturalist , Japetus Steenstrup , gave a presentation in which he compared Rondelet 's illustration ( on the left ) and Belon 's illustration ( on the right ) to the likeness of a squid captured in 1853 .
He also took into consideration a 16th - century description of the Sea Monk by Conrad Gesner .
Steenstrup made an amazing deduction : " Could we , given these bits of information of how the Monk was conceived at that time , come so near to it that we could recognize to which of nature 's creatures it should most probably be assigned ?
The Sea Monk is firstly a cephalopod . "

In Gesner 's day , sharks were commonly known as " seadogs " or " dogfish , " and of the " sledgedog , " he wrote , " It eats all kinds of fish , and will also swallow and tear apart swimming people .
When sighted , it is considered a sign of hateful bad luck . "
Gesner and Aldrovandi continued a Western tradition dating back to Ancient Greece of demonizing sharks .
If their legends are any indication , however , Pacific islanders — who spent much more time around the animals — respected sharks more than they loathed them , and deified some sharks .
Pacific islanders told stories about shark gods somewhat similar to stories about Greek gods ; the deities were fallible and complicated .
But shark deities exhibited their worst behavior not as unalloyed sharks , but as shark - human hybrids .

In the third century , the natural historian Aelian relayed the tale of the Scolopendra cetacea , a creature so fearsome that " if cast up on the shore no one would have the courage to look at it . "
These sea monsters , he claimed , had " numerous feet in line on either side as though they were rowing themselves . "
The name for this animal was derived from a common sea scolopendra , a type of centipede , but the creature Aelian described was much larger .
It might have been based on observations of a real animal , such as a whale or giant squid .
The feet are n't easily explained , but an animal causing ripples on the water 's surface might have been assumed to have numerous feet .

( This woodcut was published about a century after some of Gesner 's other works by Edward Topsell in London . )

Boitard offered his readers a first - person tour of the early Jurassic Period ( then referred to as the Liassic ) .
Accompanied by a magician who could transport him back in time , the narrator saw prehistoric monsters fleshed out and up close .
The plesiosaur announced itself with a " menacing whistle , " and , the narrator recounted , " I recoiled in terror on seeing the scaly head of a horrible reptile looking at me with flashing eyes .
Its open mouth with sharp teeth menaced me with a forked sting ; its neck was of a prodigious length , like a cable , or rather like a huge snake . . . "
So the humans in this scene are just a way of telling the story .
But plesiosaurs almost certainly could n't coil their necks , snakelike , around trees .
And what 's it doing on land anyway ?

In antiquity , the sea monster Scylla was believed to have a dozen feet and half a dozen heads — each with three rows of teeth .
Here , she is simplified , looking perfectly respectable from the neck down .
The sirens , in contrast , look normal from the waist up , but sport chicken legs and wings .
In both cases these sea monsters touch upon the beastly nature that medieval Europeans often attributed to the fairer sex .

Should using doctor - prescribed marijuana be a deal - breaker for someone needing an organ transplant ?
It is not a theoretical question but a pressing and emotional one confronting hospitals and patients in states where medical use of marijuana is legal .
This month , Timothy Garon , 56 , a Seattle musician , died after being turned down for a liver transplant .
He was rejected partly because he had used medical marijuana .
Now , a second critically ill patient in Washington state says he has been denied a spot in two organ transplant programs because he uses doctor - prescribed marijuana .
Jonathon Simchen , 33 , of Fife , a town south of Seattle , is a diabetic whose kidneys and pancreas have failed .

He said he was removed from the transplant program at Virginia Mason Hospital in Seattle because he admitted using medical marijuana .
Later , he said , University of Washington Medical Center transplant officials refused to accept him because of the medical marijuana issue .
“ I ’m just so discouraged , ” said the community college student , who wants to be a teacher .
“ I ’ve lost all remnants of hope .
I look at my life right now as if it is a prison term .
I just have to serve each day . ”
The lawyer who represented Garon has taken on Simchen ’s case .
Douglas
Hiatt argues that his clients are the victims of a loosely defined transplant policy , one not based on science .

“ They are really killing people over this , ” he said .
Hospital transplant programs , wanting to ensure the best possible outcome for each transplant and to make optimum use of the limited number of organs available , have strict standards about drug use and smoking in determining who is eligible for a transplant list .
Hiatt and advocates of medical marijuana are urging hospitals to adjust their policies after Garon ’s death May 1 .
Garon used marijuana with a doctor ’s approval to ease the symptoms of hepatitis C . He died without gaining admission to the University of Washington Medical Center ’s transplant program .
Hiatt wants to negotiate on behalf of Simchen to get him on a transplant list , but he expects he may have to file a lawsuit to get that accomplished .
If nothing else , Hiatt intends to compel judicial review of the policy .

“ No , it ai n’t over , ” Hiatt said .
“ Jonathon needs help .
He ’s going to get on that list one way or another .
“ You can not treat people like this .
There ’s no rational basis for it . ”
Although marijuana remains an illegal substance under federal law , about a dozen states , including Washington , Oregon , California and Nevada , allow doctors to prescribe it for medical purposes .
It is used for conditions such as glaucoma , diabetes , high blood pressure and AIDS .
University of Washington officials , citing privacy laws , declined to discuss specifics of individual cases , but issued a statement acknowledging that they took marijuana use into consideration .

“ Although medical marijuana may be an issue in rare cases , it is never the sole determinant in arriving at medical decisions about candidates for organ transplants , ” the statement said .
A spokeswoman for Virginia Mason Hospital said smoking of any kind could “ lead to patient - safety and transplant - effectiveness issues ” and was precluded .
She said the hospital ’s transplant committee would also weigh a patient ’s use of medical marijuana in pill form .
At the University of Washington , the transplant committee said it reviewed “ behavioral concerns such as a history of substance abuse or dependency .
If such a history exists , then the committee looks at the period of abstinence the candidate has demonstrated to date , ” as well as the patient ’s efforts to maintain abstinence and potential to abuse again .
Asked why the committee considered marijuana use under a doctor ’s supervision “ a history of substance abuse , ” a hospital spokesman cited the federal law categorizing marijuana as an illegal drug .

The United Network for Organ Sharing , which oversees the organ transplant system nationally , leaves it up to hospitals to determine how to allocate organs .
The network ’s members include 254 U.S. transplant centers .
There are nearly 100,000 people on waiting lists for transplants , the network said .
On average , there are about 6,000 donors a year .
Some medical ethicists say standardized written policies on marijuana use by transplant patients are needed .
“ Medical marijuana is opening a can of worms , ” said Peggy Stewart , a clinical social worker with the liver transplant program at UCLA Medical Center .
Advertisement
Her studies of transplant centers found discrepancies in eligibility criteria .
She said bias existed in the medical community against marijuana because of the federal law .
Some transplant committee members see it as an illegal substance and as grounds for automatic rejection .
“ If we are going to discriminate in this way , then we need to inform doctors that maybe they should n’t be prescribing marijuana , ” Stewart said .
“ It ’s a problem right now .
There ’s no distinction between a recreational drug user and somebody who used it only for medicinal purposes . ”

She said many other addictive prescriptions , particularly pain medications , did not automatically disqualify patients from transplant lists because they were not illegal substances under federal law .
She said UCLA excluded marijuana users until they could demonstrate that they had abstained for six months .
She said the policy was being reexamined .
The policy debate has done little to soften the grief for family and friends of Garon , the late singer , songwriter and acoustic guitarist .
His death triggered a flood of reaction .

The website Stop the Drug War called it evil to deny transplants to medical marijuana patients .
One Seattle - area alternative newspaper was so outraged that it listed the telephone numbers of University of Washington transplant center staff members .
In an editorial , the Ventura County Star wrote : “ So , be warned , medical marijuana -- legal for the last 12 years in California with a doctor ’s authorization -- could cost you your job .
And if you need an organ transplant , it could cost you your life . ”

June 17 , 2008  -- Senators Barack Obama ( D - IL ) and John Cornyn ( R - TX ) are calling for an investigation after an ABC News / Washington Times report revealed that veterans are being recruited for government tests on suicide - linked drugs .
" It is outrageous and unacceptable that our government would irresponsibly endanger veterans who have already sacrificed so much for our country , " said Sen. Obama Tuesday morning .
Republican Senator Cornyn , a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , is also calling for an investigation this afternoon and has sent a letter to the Secretary of the Veterans Administration , James B. Peake .
" I 've requested that VA Secretary Peake look into the allegations and , if needed , take the immediate steps necessary to identify the responsible parties , provide appropriate care to any veterans who have undergone this testing , and ensure that any unethical practices are immediately brought to a halt , " said Sen. Cornyn .
Meanwhile the White House slammed the report .
In a briefing today Deputy Press Secretary Tony Fratto called the story " irresponsible reporting " that took " the experience of this one veteran and trying to leave the impression that this was a situation for all veterans . "
" And to try to imply that and , in fact , not even imply , see the words scrolled on a television screen this morning , that the VA is using our veterans as guinea pigs , I thought , was one of the most awful things I 've ever had to watch on television , " said Fratto .
ABC News ' report on Good Morning America focused on the story of James Elliott , who was given the anti-smoking drug Chantix as part of a government test , without being warned that there are suicide - linked and other violent side effects associated with taking the drug .
Veterans Administration doctors waited more than three months before warning veterans about the possible serious side effects , including suicide and neuropsychiatric behavior .
Chantix is one of the drugs being used in an estimated 25 clinical studies using veterans by the VA .
( click here to watch the Good Morning America report )
" Our veterans - particularly those suffering from mental health injuries - should have the very best health care and support in the world , they should never be needlessly exposed to drugs without proper notification of the dangers involved or effective monitoring of the side effects .
I will immediately be asking for a full and thorough investigation of how our government could yet again let down our veterans and their families who have given so much to their country , and who have paid so much for the failures of civilian leadership in Washington , " said Sen. Obama .
" It is time to demand accountability and to ensure that this kind of breach of trust never takes place again , " said Sen. Obama .

It took less than one week for the White House to begin publicly lying about New Hampshire House Bill 1623 , which seeks to make the possession of up to one - quarter ounce of pot a fine - only offense .
In a factually and grammatically challenged press release , Deputy Drug Czar Scott Burns alleged that the proposal — which passed the House last week by a 193 to 141 margin — would decriminalize the “ manufacturing ” and “ distributing ” of “ over 90 marijuana joints . ”
Okay , aside from the fact that the measure applies to possession offenses only , one has to ask , what is up with the White House calculators ?
If one - quarter ounce of pot equals roughly seven grams , and if one joint contains roughly one gram of marijuana , then what the Hell does the Drug Czar ’s office think is in the other 83 + joints ?
Of course , regardless of whether it ’s the Deputy Drug Czar Scott Burns , White House Drug Czar John Walters , or UN Drug Czar Antonio Maria Costa , there ’s not a Drug Czar alive who ca n’t help but lie about marijuana .

If you 're not familiar with the legend of ' Ken ' by now , you 're about to be .
The album cover widely considered to be the ' Worst Of All - Time ' has been an endless source of humor to hipsters like myself , cementing its place in Internet Infamy by being featured in every ' Wost Album Cover ' list and book on the planet .
When thecompiled our own list of the Worst Album Covers Of All - Time , By Request Only came in at # 2 .
It was one of our most popular posts ever , and did nothing but spread the Internet Phenomenon that was Ken .
Who was this guy ?
What was on the record ?
Was it even a real record ?
These were the questions that filled message board threads for years , as outsider music collectors and Internet historians debated the merits of this one and only photograph .
Mere sleeves of this record were said to be going for big money on eBay .
Surely , it was too good to be true .
Just a little too nostalgic , just a little too funny , perhaps .
People wanted their hands on this album , but nobody even knew if it actually existed .
Until now .
Snopes , the Internet 's premiere Urban Legend website , has finally cracked the mystery of By Request Only , actually tracking down Ken himself for the straight dope .
Besides Snopes , I 'm confident that theis currently the only place on the Internet where you can see the entire story of Ken from beginning to end .
First off , this album is real .
The first big clue came when the album , vinyl and all , went up on eBay and sold for .
This gave the world their first look at the back cover of the album , along with the actual record itself .
Finally being able to see the back cover of By Request Only opened the floodgates of information .
We got a track listing , an idea of the musical genre it entailed ( Christian ) , a personal message from Ken himself , a last name ( Snyder ) and full contact information !
Things were going well for us Internet investigators .
The next step , of course , was to break the fourth wall and actually track this guy down .
Did Ken know that he was an Internet Celebrity ?
Was he aware that By Request Only was making big bucks on eBay and considered the worst album cover of all - time ?
After some more digging , a Ken Snyder who matched the description and location of the album recording was linked to a church in Sheldon , Iowa , along with an updated photograph and contact information !
Surely , this was the same man .
Now , not only did we know that the album was real , we also knew that Ken was still alive and well , spreading his message of faith throughout the Bible Belt .
This was a very good thing .
Eventually , someone had the balls to make the phone call , and contact was made .
Here 's the Snopes entry on said conversation : " Talked with Ken , he said he was somewhat aware of the notoriety , but was surprised to hear about the eBay auction and wanted a link .
He had n't received any calls about it , hopefully I did n't start anything , he 's a really nice guy .
" Contact with Ken !
The Internet truly is an amazing thing .
After this conversation with Ken , he was happy to know that people were still interested in his music , and actually put up the LAST 4 COPIES OF BY REQUEST ONLY THAT HE HAD .
In the eBay auctions , he actually put ' Worst Album Cover ' in the title , so it 's clear that the man has a very good sense of humor about this .
In fact , shortly after finding out this news , Ken 's daughter posted on the Snopes board and offered this information :
" Hey , I 'm Ken 's daughter .
Just thought you would like to know my dad has loved reading these sites about him .
That record is from 1976 .
He used to travel and sing all over the U.S. , and that was one of his records he sold .
He only has about 4 left now , decided ' why not try selling them if people are actually interested in buying them ? '
He called me up immediately after he got a call saying that one of you had told him his record sold on eBay .
He knew the album cover was under " Worst Album Cover " but did n't realize he was the talk of people online .
Crazyness !
" So , that pretty much brings everyone up to speed .
The album is real , Ken is real ( with a great sense of humor ) , and he 's selling off the last 4 copies of By Request Only known to exist .
He 's even going to sign them !
I love it when mysteries like this end with happy endings , although I am a bit sad that the Internet has halted yet another great Urban Legend .
Ken - By Request Only .
Solved .
You should also know that I 'm getting myself a copy , and I do n't care the price .
I 'm currently the highest bidder on one of the auctions that ends tomorrow .
I 'll tell you how I did when it 's over .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Mark Windsor looks exhausted .
For a week he 's been undergoing radiation treatment on a cancerous tumor in his neck .
A metal rod fused to his spine keeps his head stable .
His muscles there are gone , the result of multiple failed surgeries to rid him of his disease .
He can't turn his head sideways or look up or down .
So his look stays fixed , despite his fatigue .
The radiation Mark Windsor is receiving will only prolong his life , not save it .
" If I probably had gotten some good treatment several years ago I probably would have been cured , " Windsor said from his home in Atlanta , Georgia .
The reason he did n't get care sooner -- he could n't afford it , because he did n't have insurance .
Windsor , a self - employed photographer , has had bone cancer -- a rare chondrosarcoma -- for more than 25 years .
At 52 , that 's almost half his life .
While he 's found help from a few generous doctors , his efforts to survive have often been desperate .
And now he 's learned , largely in vain .
" I 've been given anywhere from 18 months to three years , " Windsor said .
" And of course that 's if I continue to go through these brutal treatments that I do n't know that my body is capable of doing anymore .
I 'm tired .
I 've had a lot of operations in my life .
And this radiation treatment was n't much better on it .
It 's now taken my ability for taste away .
My smell is horrible .
I feel nauseated every day .
And I just do n't think this ever had to get to this . "
Windsor first asked for the radiation therapy 13 years ago , long before his cancer had advanced into the brutal disease that 's now assailing him .
If he had been treated anytime sooner , the therapy might have worked to eradicate his tumors , when they were still small .
But without insurance , Windsor could n't afford the proper surgeries and follow - up care needed for the radiation to be effective .
The American Cancer Society says uninsured patients are 60 percent more likely to die within five years of their diagnosis .
Without insurance , the diagnosis is twice as likely to come in the later stages of cancer .
Just when Windsor 's lack of insurance started killing him is difficult to say .
His timeline is long .
But Windsor points to a period in the fall of 2006 .
Health Care : Critical Condition Dr. Sanjay Gupta investigates the crisis in health care and takes a hard look at proposals for a better safety net .
Saturday - Sunday , 8 , 11 p.m. ET see full schedule »
His cancer had returned .
But this time , the surgeon who had donated his services was no longer on staff at the hospital where Windsor was on a charity plan .
His lifesaving operation would n't be possible .
" All of a sudden I 'm out here in this world with no hospital and no doctor .
And everybody I faxed -- I got on my computer and sent out e-mails and faxes to at least 20 neurosurgeons in Atlanta and not a single one responded , " Windsor said .
If Windsor were poor , he could 've found insurance through Medicaid , but his $ 30,000 income was too much to qualify .
So instead , he walked into an Atlanta emergency room .
" All they did for me ... was check my blood pressure and my temperature , " Windsor recalls .
" I said , ' This is not the answer . ' "
Thirteen hours later , feeling frustrated , he left .
A few months later , he found his answer :
He got health insurance when he married his good friend , Val Chamberoam , who put him on her health policy .
By the time Windsor got to the operating room , in the summer of 2007 , his tumor was so large that it covered his entire neck .
It had been growing for 10 months .
" It 's just never recovered , " Windsor said .
" It 's gone from grade one to grade three , and also now has spread to my lungs . "
Today , there 's nothing more doctors can do .
The radiation Windsor is receiving will only prolong his life , not save it .
And what about his wife , Val ?
" We 're going through a divorce , " he said .
" Because I have so many hospital bills now , insurance companies have denied to pay them ... so I 've done what I think is proper , filed for divorce , so that my wife is not stuck with my hospital bills . "
For now , Windsor finds pleasure in the smiles of the people he photographs .
As for his own , you never see it .
His face is grim and angry .
" I'm angry at the greed of the insurance companies , " Windsor said .
" Everybody has the right to make profits .
Every corporation has the right to be strong , make the right decisions .
But I do n't think that it is proper to deny people with chronic disease the opportunity to get well . "
Windsor 's sentiment is probably shared by many of the nearly 50 million Americans who have no health insurance .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Health Library
Karen Ignani , president and CEO of America 's Health Insurance Plans , says the organization would like to see all Americans covered .
" Anytime anyone falls through the cracks , this is a major societal , national problem .
What we 've done recently is our members have recognized that individuals who are not being sponsored by employers , do n't have employer coverage or are n't eligible for public programs need additional help , " Ignani said .
" We proposed a strategy that involves setting up risk pools at the state level and our members agreeing to backstop those risk pools by taking everyone who may not be able to be eligible . "
In May , Windsor will begin government - sponsored disability insurance .
He 'll be covered for the remainder of his life , however short it may be E- mail to a friend

Spencer Kelly reports .
Stronger evidence now links increased colon cancer risk to low vitamin D levels in the body , which may also be tied to other forms of cancer and heart disease .
The role of vitamin D – the sunshine vitamin – in keeping bones strong is already well - established .
In the midst of summer , there 's plenty of daily sunlight to boost vitamin D levels in your body .
The challenge lies is balancing skin protection from sun overexposure while reaping vitamin D's health benefits .
Concerned about skin cancer risks and sun-aging , many health authorities continue to warn against any outdoor sun unless you 're wearing sunblock or sunscreen .
Ideally , people should get enough vitamin D from their food .
However , that 's difficult to do , Many folks do n't get enough of the nutrient from dietary sources like fatty fish and fortified milk .
It can also be tricky to strike the right sunlight balance .
Dark - skinned individuals produce less vitamin D than those with fair skin , and older adults make less vitamin D than younger people .
In the winter , it 's virtually impossible to produce vitamin D from the sun if you live 37 degrees above the equator ( or north of Atlanta ) , because the sun never gets high enough in the sky for its ultraviolet B rays to penetrate the atmosphere , according to Harvard Womens ' Health Watch .
But summer is a great time to stock up on the nutrient .
When the sun 's UV - B rays hit the skin , a reaction takes place that enables skin cells to manufacture vitamin D .
Safer Sun Strategies
Dr. Michael Holick , a professor of medicine , physiology and biophysics at the Boston University Medical Campus , is a long - time proponent of what he calls sensible sun exposure .
However , " you should never , ever get a sunburn , " he says – that 's what increases the risk for melanoma and other skin cancers .
If you decide to get limited , unprotected sun exposure for the sake of vitamin D , he suggests the following rules of thumb :
Always protect your face and top of your ears at the beach , because those are the most sun-exposed and sun-damaged skin areas .
Allow 10 to 15 minutes or so of unprotected sun exposure to your arms , legs , abdomen and back .
After that , follow up with good sun protection , like a 30 - SPF or higher sunblock .
Choose the right time of day .
" If your shadow is longer than your body height , you can't make any vitamin D , " Holick says .
Between 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. is the usual window for significant sun exposure , he says .
He 's helped develop the dminder app , which uses multiple factors – time of day , location and skin type – to recommend optimal sun exposure and provide sun-safety warnings .
" You can not get an adequate amount of vitamin D from your diet , " Holick says , even with fortified foods .
He recommends vitamin D supplements in appropriate doses for adults and children .
According to other experts , you can get enough vitamin D by eating the right foods – combined with supplements if needed .
Fish such as wild - caught salmon , mackerel , tuna and sardines ; beef liver , eggs , cod liver oil and mushrooms are good vitamin D sources .
Fortified milk and foods such as breakfast cereals , yogurt and orange juice can help boost vitamin D intake .
Beginning in late July , the recommended daily values for vitamin D on food nutrition labels will double from 400 to 800 IUs .
The increase is based on newer scientific evidence from the Institute of Medicine and reports like the one used to develop the 2015 - 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans .
Vitamin D and Disease
The sunshine vitamin may protect against a host of diseases , including osteoporosis , heart disease and cancers of the breast , prostate and colon .
What 's more , sunlight has other hidden benefits – like protecting against depression , insomnia and an overactive immune system .
A large , international study on colorectal cancer and low vitamin D levels offers some of the most definitive results to date .
The study , released June 14 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute , analyzed more than 5,700 cases of colorectal cancer from 17 studies of people from the U.S. , Europe and Asia .
With blood samples taken before participants were diagnosed with colorectal cancer , researchers measured vitamin D levels using a consistent method of analysis .
A control group consisted of a matching number of people who did not develop colorectal cancer .
Over an average period of 5.5 years , participants who were vitamin - D deficient had a 31 percent higher risk of developing colorectal cancer than those with adequate blood levels of vitamin D .
" This study strengthened the evidence that vitamin D may lower the risk of colorectal cancer , " says Marji McCullough , senior scientific director for epidemiology research at the American Cancer Society and a study co-first author .
It 's possible that vitamin D has a protective role in preventing colon cancer by slowing or stopping cells from becoming malignant , she says .
About a decade ago , a study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine ( now JAMA Internal Medicine ) showed that those with the lowest vitamin D levels have more than double the risk of dying from heart disease and other causes over an eight - year period compared to those with the highest vitamin D levels .
The researchers cited " decreased outdoor activity " as one reason that people may become deficient in vitamin D .
The American Cancer Society does not support sun exposure for increasing vitamin D. " Because excessive ultraviolet radiation is a major risk factor for skin cancer , we do not recommend obtaining vitamin D from the sun as a way to boost vitamin D levels in the blood , " McCullough says .
If you 're concerned about your vitamin D levels , talk to your health care provider .
You can also take other preventive measures .
" There are many modifiable risk factors that have been established , including maintaining a healthy body weight , being physically active and eating an overall diet that 's rich in plant foods and low in red and processed meat , " McCullough says .
" Very importantly , get your screening done .
Follow screening recommendations .
That 's really critical for reducing your risk of getting colorectal cancer . "
Balancing Solar Risks and Benefits
There are upsides to basking at least briefly in the summer sun .
Public health messages that advocated sun avoidance now focus on sun protection when the UV rays are very intense , but recommend getting a little bit of sun on the skin most days of the week , says Robyn Lucas , an epidemiologist at Australian National University .
Lucas led a related study published in the February 2008 issue of the International Journal of Epidemiology .
Her finding :
There may be a much larger risk to health and well - being from not having any sun exposure than from too much that increases the risk of skin cancer .
Lucas discussed her results with U.S. News shortly thereafter and recently updated her remarks .
" Sun protection messages arose in response to rapidly increasing rates of skin cancers , and they were an essential public - health message , " Lucas said .
" But we now recognize that some sun exposure is important for health , at the very least , to maintain healthful vitamin D levels . "
Taking this into account , she said , the Cancer Council of Australia slightly eased its sun protection message concerning sunscreen , outdoor clothing and hats .
Skin pigmentation affects how much radiation your skin absorbs , Lucas pointed out .
" The darker the skin , the more it 's protected against skin cancer but the less able it is to absorb UV - B rays , " she said .
" It also depends on how much skin is exposed and the time of day . "
If you 're a fair - skinned person , she says , spending a few minutes outside in the middle of the day without sunscreen would be enough to get vitamin D. However , she adds , " If you 're already tanned or of Hispanic origin , you need maybe 15 to 20 minutes .
Black skin may require six times the sun exposure to make the same vitamin D levels as a very fair - skinned person . "
Bill Moyers : Every American should have ' Cheneycare ' David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Monday May 12 , 2008

Print This Email This Esteemed veteran news broadcaster Bill Moyers takes aim at health care in his latest report for PBS .
" You do n't need me to tell you that 47 million Americans are uninsured , and it's not news to you that medical costs are increasing faster than the rate of inflation , or that more Americans than ever are afraid a single major illness could bankrupt them , " says Moyers .
" It 's little wonder that when the Gallup poll asked people on the eve of this election year to name the most important thing that can be done to cope with health care , 63 % mentioned universal coverage . "
Moyers reports that nurses are now among those at the forefront of the battle for affordable health care for all Americans .
The report cites the high quality , condition - free medical insurance enjoyed by the likes of Vice President Dick Cheney , who , despite four major heart attacks and other serious coronary issues , " ca n't be denied health insurance no matter how serious his heart condition is " because he is a U.S. government employee .
The California Nurses Association ( CNA ) criticizes such " Cadillac healthcare " favoritism and contrasts it to the limited options afforded to the majority of Americans .
The CNA has launched an ad campaign saying that " if Cheney were just a regular American , he 'd probably be dead by now . "
The CNA 's executive director rues the " double standard , " saying , " There should be an excellence in care that applies to all people .
We , as the public , pay for Dick Cheney 's care .
...
Why is the government not providing the same type of care to all Americans ? "

I was n’t going to write another Firefox article tonight , but after restarting Firefox the automatic updater ran without my permission and broke my favorite extension .
I could obviously crack open the extension and manually fix the problem , but it ’s just ridiculous to have to do that .
Short Rant :
Why does an x.x.x.1 release have to break any of my extensions ?
That ’s just completely ridiculous .
I realize that the extension developers could have picked a better version number in order to handle this , but it worked fine with 2.0.0.5 , so it should work with 2.0.0.6 .
Back to the topic … you have a few options at this point :
Crack open the extension in your profile directory and change the version number in the extensions.rdf file .
Install the Nightly Tester Tools which will let you override the incompatibility .
Once you install the Nightly Tester Tools extension and restart Firefox , open up your Add - ons folder , right - click on the incompatible extension , and choose the “ Make Compatible ” option from the menu .
Now once you restart Firefox yet again , your extension should be back to normal and working fine .
Second Rant : Installing themes , plugins , changing options , restarting because of memory leaks …
Rebooting Firefox is beginning to remind me of Windows 98 .

As John wrote about earlier , James Dobson attacked Barack Obama Tuesday for what he called his " confused theology . "
Leaving aside the obvious projection on Dobson 's part , today really marked the beginning of a rather dramatic shift in traditional American politics .
Think about it :
Not only is Barack Obama aggressively courting the evangelical base , he is currently involved in a dispute over theology and public policy with James Dobson .
And he 's winning .
After Dobson trashed Obama for " distorting the Bible , " Obama put out this statement , which pretty much sums up why Dobson and his ilk are a cancer on the American political process :
[ That speech that Dobson criticized urged that ] people of faith , like himself , " try to translate some of our concerns in a universal language so that we can have an open and vigorous debate rather than having religion divide us . "
Obama is trying to introduce a new kind of " faith - based " participation in politics , one that seeks to unite people of faith around a common goal , rather than driving them apart with divisive wedge issues .
I think it 's pretty obvious which of the two is more healthy and productive .
What 's more , Rev. Kirbyjon Caldwel , a Methodist pastor from Texas and longtime supporter of President Bush who has endorsed Obama , has actually started a website bashing Dobson and proclaiming he " does n't speak for me . "
In what can be considered the best news of all , John McCain faces a big uphill climb when it comes to earning the support of the evangelical Republican base -- the same coalition that helped propel George W. Bush to two terms .
McCain is trying to play the " strong conservative " and " maverick " cards at the same time , apparently not realizing that they end up canceling each other out .
Robert Novak ( of all people ) writes extensively about this in a column called " McCain 's Evangelical Problem . "
Senator McCain may be a " straight - shooter " who appeals to independents , but he 's also a Republican who can't lock down his own base .
The D / Objective - C Bridge
There ’s an interesting thing about bridging two programming language : you have to learn a lot about the fundamentals of the two languages .
As I love to learn , and I ’m pretty fond of both D and Objective - C , building that bridge was the natural thing to do for me .
Early Bridge
D is a language capable of accessing C functions directly : you just need to declare them as extern ( C ) inside a D code file and they ’ll be made available ( provided you link to the right libraries afterwards ) .
So basically , since the whole Objective - C runtime is accessible from C calls , it ’s pretty easy to do whatever we want with it .
With the Objective - C runtime you can do introspection , or to create new classes and methods .
Methods are pretty easy to implement too : D functions are called with the C ABI , which means that they ’re callable from C code .
A function in D only need to have the right prototype to be able to receive Objective - C messages .
But on the other side , D is a statically - typed language , in the same spirit as C ++.
This means that very little information is known at runtime about D objects : their name , their members , their methods , almost all of this disappear once the program has been compiled .
This also mean that you ca n’t dynamically add classes or methods like you can do in Objective -C .
So the early version of that bridge was pretty simple : there was a couple of D classes which were wrapping their Objective - C counterpart .
For instance , D class NSObject contained a pointer to a corresponding Objective - C object instance and could use objc_msgSend to call methods on it .
This works , until you try to actually do something useful , like a subclass .
Since Objective - C is completely unaware of that D class , it ca n’t call any of its methods .
If you override NSObject to do something useful , you better not count on Cocoa calling that method : it does n’t exist to the outside world .
So basically , that method has to be defined as a method of an Objective - C object to work .
We ’ll get to that in a moment .
Object Posing
The key to a successful bridge in object - oriented languages is to make objects seemingly transferable between the two languages .
In the D / Objective - C Bridge , this is done by proxy objects posing an object in the foreign language .
There are two kind of proxies in the current implementation of the bridge :
a capsule is an Objective - C object which serves as a proxy to a D object so that it can be sent as a parameter to a function expecting an Objective - C object .
The process of creating a capsule for an object is called encapsulation and retrieving the object from a capsule ( when a function returns a capsulated object for instance ) is called decapsulation .
a wrapper is a D object representing an Objective - C object within D code .
When decapsulating an Objective - C object , after checking it is n’t a capsule , a wrapper D object is created to represent that Objective - C object .
When encapsulating a D object , if that object is a wrapper , instead of creating a capsule the wrapped Objective - C object is returned .
That process of encapsulation / decapsulation repeated every time an object passes through a cross- language function call , either as an argument or as a return value .
Clearly , this becomes tedious fast - enough .
Templates to the Rescue
Just like its cousin C++ , D has templates .
Templates allows what we call metaprogramming : code which create code .
D supports metaprogramming only at compile - time ( just like C++ ) , but this allows us to perform a lot of work .
Templates are used to encapsulate and decapsulate function arguments and return values as needed depending on their type .
For instance , a function which call an Objetive - C method would be like this :
Object opIndex ( Object key ) { SEL selector = sel_registerName ( " objectForKey : " .ptr ) ; id key_id = encapsulate ( key ) ; id result = objc_msgSend ( self , selector , key_id ) ; return decapsulate ( result ) ; }
With the proper template , it now becomes this :
Object opIndex ( Object key ) { return invokeObjcSuper !( Object , " objectForKey : " ) ( key ) ; }
The invokeObjcSuper template function accepts any number of argument and will properly convert them as needed based on their type .
Note that the first example above , the one without the template , is pretty much alike what you can do in plain C .
D templates makes it easy to convert arguments and return values on the fly , but what about receiving method calls from the Objective - C side ?
Well , there is a template for that too .
In D , you can mixin a template ’s content in the current context .
Used this way , a template can be used to add methods and variables to a class , which is what we use here .
Continuing from the previous example , here is how one woud bind opIndex to the objectForKey : selector of an Objective - C capsule class :
mixin ObjcBindMethod !( opIndex , Object , " objectForKey : " , Object ) ;
Basically , the syntax reads like this : bind method opIndex to selector objectForKey : with return type Object and one argument of type Object .
Mixing in this template creates a receiver method suitable for calling from Objective - C , and a method_info structure to be given to the Objective - C runtime when initializing the class .
Object arguments are decapsulated , and object return types are encapsulated by the binding method , all this is done completely transparently to the programmer .
Exceptions
What about exceptions ?
Both D and Objective - C have exceptions , but in implementation they ’re incompatible .
D catch and finally statement ( as well as scope ( failure ) and scope ( exit ) and destructors for scope - qualified objects ) wo n’t be called when the stack is rewinded at the result of an Objective - C exception .
The same applies to Objective - C code whenever a D exception is thrown .
So when you have D code which calls Objective - C code which calls D code which calls Objective - C code , things can become quite messy when an exception throws in .
Note that Objective - C++ , which is a mix of Objecitve - C and C++ and which is supported by Apple has this exact same problem .
As of now , this is unresolved for Objective - C++.
But the D / Objective - C bridge solves that .
There is an “ exception bridge ” in the D / Objective - C bridge .
The exception bridge catches Objective - C exceptions raised during a call to Objective - C , wrap them into D objects , then throw that object back .
The exact same thing is done in reverse : when D code is called from Objective - C , if an exception is thrown , it gets encapsulated into an Objective - C exception , and raised .
The templates for calling Objective - C methods and binding D methods to selectors use the exception bridge to make the process completely transparent .
So you do n’t have to worry about exceptions when using the D / Objective - C bridge : catch them and throw them as in any D program .
Class Hierarchy
The class hierarchy becomes a funny thing in the D / Objective - C bridge .
As stated earlier , the bridge has two kinds of proxy objects : capsules and wrappers .
Capsules are Objective - C objects posing for a D object ; wrappers are D objects posing an Objective - C object .
That ’s all convenient , but how does polymorphism works in all that ?
Let ’s look at wrappers first .
Wrappers
Wrappers are descendent of ObjcWrapperObject ( in the objc.wrapper module ) , but that ’s mostly an implementation detail you should ignore .
The first wrapper you should worry about is called …
NSObject !
The D class NSObject is a wrapper for the Objective - C class of the same name .
Confused ?
From now on , I ’ll call it the NSObject wrapper , and the object it wraps will be called its Objective - C instance .
The NSObject wrapper implements methods which simply calls their corresponding methods on its Objective - C instance , methods alike the opIndex example above using the invokeObjcSuper template .
This wrapper is the base of all wrappers , just like NSObject is the base of all objects in the Cocoa hierarchy .
Therefore other wrapper classes , like NSString , inherit from NSObject , and thus inherit all the methods of NSObject .
When an Objective - C object is decapsulated , the bridge first checks if a corresponding wrapper has been registered ( we will get to registration later ) .
If no wrapper class is found , the bridge will search using the Objective - C object ’s superclass , super - superclass and so on , until it find a matching wrapper .
Eventually , a corresponding wrapper will be found , and a wrapper object will be created .
In the “ worst - case ” senario , a NSObject wrapper will be returned .
So basically , the NSObject wrapper can wrap all Objective - C objects .
This fits , since all Objective - C objects are instances of NSObject .
And since no more specific wrapper has been registered for a given object , it ’s probably that you do n’t need to know about the more specific object anyway , so nothing is lost .
Capsules & Subclassing
So capsules are those Objective - C objects posing for D objects inside Objective - C code .
The capsule for a regular D object is an instance of the Objective - C class called D_Object .
This class will simply forward method calls for isEqual : , hash , and description to their counterparts in the base D Object class , namely opEquals , toHash , and description ( converting types as necessary ) .
Objective - C is is therefore able call these methods on any D class .
Overriding and defining methods is achieved by subclassing .
If you override one of the three already bound methods above , you do n’t need to do anything special to get them working from Objective - C .
If you wish to add methods and want those methods to be accessible from Objective - C , each of them need to be bound in a Objective - C capsule class corresponding to your D class .
That capsule class is automatically created on the first use of the ObjcBindMethod template , using the name of your class as the name of the class in Objective - C , so you should rarely need to worry about the Objective - C class under the hood .
Now , what about subclassing an existing Objective - C class ?
That ’s easy too .
Each wrapper class has a corresponding capsule .
The capsule for the NSObject wrapper is called D_NSObject , the capsule for NSString is called D_NSString , and so on , but you do n’t really need to worry about that unless you ’re debugging .
If you override a method of a wrapper which has been bound to its corresponding Objective - C capsule class , the bridge will dispatch the call to your method .
If you wish to bind a new method to an Objective - C selector , you can do it just like you would for other objects , using ObjcBindMethod .
It ’s that simple .
There is a notable exception : cluster classes .
Cluster classes in Objective - C are classes like NSString , NSArray , NSDictionary , etc. for which the initializer returns a different object .
For these classes , you ’ll need to do the traditional alloc–init sequence from your D class constructor .
If you do n’t , you ’ll end up with the wrong capsule class , methods wo n’t be forwarded and you ’ll get exceptions when using your class .
For other classes , most of them really , you can just call one of the superclass constructors and be done with it .
In some cases , you ’ll want Objective - C code to be able to create instances of some of your subclasses .
This is particularly interesting for objects you want unserialized from a nib file .
For that you need to bind a constructor to an initializer method .
This can be done with the ObjcBindInitializer template , which is used like that :
mixin ObjcBindInitializer !(" initWithObject : " , Object ) ;
This will bind selector initWithObject : to the constructor taking one argument of type Object .
Class Registration
There are two kinds of registrations , which are handled , mostly , in a transparent manner .
When crossing the D / Objective - C bridge , objects are decapsulated on the fly .
Capsules are no problem to decapsulate : since they already exist as D objects , the D object can be found easily .
But for wrapping Objective - C objects into D wrappers , the bridge must know which D class maps to which Objective - C class .
Wrapper classes know how to register themselves with the bridge the first time they ’re used , and generally you do n’t need to worry about that .
Registration works the other way around too .
For Objective - C to know about a D class , the class has to be registered with , or added to , the Objective - C runtime .
Again this is done transparently on the first use of the class .
There is a specific case however which may force you to register the class explicitly : when Objective - C code is expected to create an instance of your class .
This happens when loading nib files for instance .
So for these cases , you simply need to get the objcClass property of the object you want to register .
YourDClass.objcClass returns a pointer to the Objective - C class for your D class ( which you can ignore ) , and getting this property will initialize the capsule class and register it both ways .
Future Directions
The biggest challenge yet will be creating bindings for Cocoa as a whole .
Creating wrapper classes is still a manual task .
As there ’s no way to add classes dynamically in D , we ca n’t create them at runtime by inspecting defined Objective - C classes .
Moreover , in D , objects are constructed much differently from Objective - C , and any attempt to bridge that automatically is n’t likely to give good results .
Having to define wrappers manually may seem inconvenient , but it ’s also an opportunity to make bindings better suited for D .
For instance , the wrappers for NSString , NSArray , and NSDictionary I ’ve taken advantage of D operator overloading to make them behave almost exactly like their language - defined counterparts ( D arrays and associative arrays ) , and many method names have been shortened because D supports function overloading .
There is also a lot of improvements and optimisations to be done to the bridge itself .
The method - call bridging routines for instance generate more code than is necessary and can be confusing in a stack trace because of the many template function calls involved .
Today
I ’ll finish this by telling you that you can try out the D / Objective - C bridge today .
I ’ve added it as a project to the project section of my website .
The Xcode project includes the bridge , a small part of the Foundation and AppKit frameworks I ’ve created wrappers for , and a demo application called Decagon .
The whole thing is available under the GPL license , version 3 .
Oh , and by the way , if you ’re unfamiliar with D , I suggest you take a look at the official website for the D programming language .

Amazing New Trade Data
Wow .
We really do live in the midst of a tidal wave of more detailed and interesting data .
The latest : importgenius.com , the brainchild of brothers Ryan and David Petersen , with Michael Kanko .
They exploit customs reporting obligations and Freedom of Information requests to organize and publish — in real - time — the contents of every shipping container entering the United States .
There ’s a neat ticker on the bottom of their page showing a trickle of these data .
Watch it for a few minutes : it ’s mesmerizing and provides a sometimes beautiful window into the wonders of international trade .
How might these data be useful to firms ?
Well here ’s an example :
On May 23 , Ryan identified a spike in imports of a new type of device from Apple , leading him to ( correctly ) predict the arrival of the new iPhone .
Apple ’s secrecy throughout its supply chain is legendary , but not even Steve Jobs dares lie to U.S. customs .
Massive shipments of a new product code led to a pretty clear inference that something was up .
I can only begin to imagine the business implications of data like this .
For instance , Samsung was still readying its new “ Instinct ” cellphone to compete with the ( first - gen ) iPhone , even as these data predicted that their real target should have been the ( vastly improved ) second - gen iPhone .
More generally :
How will the forces of competition change now that firms can track shipment volumes of their suppliers , competitors , and customers ?
While more data can mean stronger competition , more information can also make it easier to enforce collusive agreements .
Stay tuned , this will be interesting .
I can only imagine ( and hope ) that there are bright economists already thinking about how these new data can be used to fine tune our understanding of the dynamics of international trade .
See also TechCrunch on ImportGenius .
It is no coincidence that I have to thank Ryan ’s former econ professor , Ray Fisman , for the pointer , as Ray is no stranger to analyzing detailed trade data .
TUCSON , ARIZONA --
What was intended to be a friendly kiss of a cactus in the Arizona desert turned into a nasty situation !
Not satisfied with placing his lips on the thorns of a large barrel cactus , Steve " Colorado Guy " Garufi stupidly wrapped his arms around the cactus and was stuck for 30 seconds as the thorns hooked into his shirt .
Only after pulling hard enough off was Steve able to release himself from the cactus , but not before causing rips in his shirt and scratches on his arms .
" I kind of liked kissing the cactus " explained Steve , " But when my shirt got caught in the thorns , I panicked and moved my arms and it got ugly . "
Joel Smith , a Tucson resident and advocate for Arizona 's desert environment , was hiking with Steve and witnessed the entire event .
" I have no idea why you would want to do that , " said Joel , as he stood next to a 5 - foot tall saguaro ( left photo ) , " I walked into a cholla a few months ago and spent all day pulling prickles out of me . "
Steve 's History of Kissing Cacti ; Reactions From Friends And Foes
Steve has a history of kissing cacti which has been profiled on www.CactusLovers.com, a popular web site for cactus and succulent information .
Still , this is the first disturbing incident where Steve gave a " bear hug " to a large cactus .
" I just do n't know about you sometimes , " stated Kansas Kelly , " Sometimes I wonder , ' What exactly is going on in your head when you do things like this ? ' "
Bill Rogan in Denver had an interesting perspective .
" Did it feel like instant accupuncture ?
You could have laid there and enjoyed the needles until someone pulled you out off the cactus . "
This is definitely not the first time Steve has gotten in trouble with a cactus .
As seen in the right photo , he once needed a friend to pull out hundreds of small spines from his lower face when he kissed a prickly pear cactus near Lake Isabella , California .
There are also two videos below when he kissed cacti in Colorado Springs and Wellsville .
" The prickly pear thorns in my lips was rough , " admitted Steve , " I 'm not sure I would do that again , but who knows ? "
Steve has never explained why he occasionally kisses cacti , but in one video ( included at the bottom of the page ) , he alluded to fact that it might be because he does not have a girlfriend .
Shana B. in San Diego , California , shared her opinion on what some of the deeper " root issues " might be that are driving Steve 's behavior .
" I think you have an abusive relationship with your cactuses and you 've just got to let it go , " she said , " They 've got support groups for people like you . "
JOHANNESBURG ( Reuters ) - President Robert Mugabe ’s government is using food as a weapon ahead of Zimbabwe ’s June 27 presidential run-off election , U.S. - based group Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
The accusation came a day after CARE International said the government had ordered it to suspend its operations in Zimbabwe over allegations it was backing opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai ’s presidential campaign .
It denies the charge .
Other humanitarian groups have been told to stop their work for the same reasons , the government said on Wednesday .
It did not respond to the charge that it was using food for political advantage in the election race .
“ The decision to let people go hungry is yet another attempt to use food as a political tool to intimidate voters ahead of an election , ” said Tiseke Kasambala , the rights group ’s researcher for Zimbabwe .
“ President Mugabe ’s government has a long history of using food to control the election outcome . ”
Zimbabwe ’s once prosperous agricultural sector has collapsed since 2000 , when Mugabe ’s government began seizing thousands of white - owned farms as part of a land redistribution policy designed to help poor blacks .
Many of the farms have ended up in the hands of senior officials with Mugabe ’s ruling ZANU - PF party and other supporters , while others have been tilled by farmers who lack experience and capital .
Zimbabwe now suffers chronic shortages of meat , milk , bread and other basic foodstuffs and relies on imports and handouts from foreign governments and relief agencies to feed its people .
Mugabe blames the country ’s economic collapse on sanctions imposed by foes in the West .
CARE had planned to start a food distribution program in Zimbabwe before it was suspended last week , said Ken Walker , the group ’s communications manager for Africa .
He said CARE had 300 people working on various projects in Zimbabwe .
A senior Zimbabwean official said that CARE and other suspended non-governmental agencies would only be allowed to pursue their work if they swore off involvement in politics .
“ If they want to continue with their programs , they know what to do .
They must choose between politics and genuine humanitarian work , ” Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga said , adding that Zimbabwe did not want to rely on NGOs .
Mugabe faces a tough battle in the election run-off against Tsvangirai , who defeated the veteran ruler in the March 29 presidential poll , but did not win enough votes to avoid a second round .
The MDC says 50 people have been killed by Mugabe ’s supporters since the first round vote , and it said on Wednesday that soldiers and ZANU - PF activists were beating and threatening to shoot Zimbabweans who wanted to meet and support Tsvangirai .
“ Mugabe is determined to turn the whole country into a war zone in order to subvert the will of the people and steal the June 27th election by any means possible , ” Tsvangirai said while campaigning in Bulawayo on Wednesday .
Mugabe and his ZANU - PF say the opposition is responsible for violence .
Wow , he really is McSame , is n't he ?
Huff Po :
Tonight was the first in a much - hyped series of ' town hall ' forums scheduled by John McCain 's campaign , in which Barack Obama had been challenged to show up to discuss the issues directly with the GOP nominee .
Except , as Fox News reported , McCain 's campaign misled the public about the nature of the event .
The forum was " billed by the McCain campaign as a town hall with independent and Democratic voters , " but Fox News noted at the end that the audience was actually " made up of invited guests and supporters , " the Democratic National Committee said in a statement .
Shepard Smith ' fesses up :
I reported at the top of this hour that the campaign had told us at Fox News that the audience would be made up of Republicans , Democrats , and independents .
We have now received a clarification from the campaign and I feel I should pass it along to you .
The McCain campaign distributed tickets to supporters , Mayor Bloomberg , who of course is a registered Republican , and other independent groups .
Uh huh .
And this is EXACTLY the reason why Barack Obama should politely refuse to do any Town Hall with McCain on Fox .
Next , McSame will be demanding loyalty oaths .
DNC Head Howard Dean had something to say about it too :
Earlier this year , when astronauts attached the first section of Japan ’s Kibo research laboratory to the orbiting International Space Station , most people probably did n’t notice the small symbol painted on the module ’s side — an airplane made of Japan ’s traditional folded - paper origami .
Shinji Suzuki did notice .
The University of Tokyo aerospace engineer hopes to watch real paper airplanes “ launch ” from the space station next year .
From This Story [ × ]
CLOSE Utah Senator Jake Garn , who flew as a guest astronaut on the STS - 51D space shuttle mission in April 1985 , plays with a paper airplane inside Discovery ’s mid-deck cabin .
The stunt was part of an educational “ Toys in Space ” demonstration that also had astronauts playing with yo - yos and jacks in weightlessness .
Video : NASA Video : Light Flight Related Content Konnichi Wa , Kibo
The idea started with Takuo Toda , president of the Origami Paper Airplane Association in Japan , who asked Suzuki a few years ago to study the possibility of a paper airplane re-entering the atmosphere from orbit .
“ At first , many aerospace engineers thought it would burn out , ” says Suzuki .
Objects returning from space begin their atmospheric re-entry at speeds of Mach 20 .
By the time the shuttle drops to an altitude of 37 miles , temperatures on parts of its surface reach as high as 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit .
But a much lighter paper aircraft would slow to Mach 6 earlier in its descent — at altitudes of 62 miles or so , where the air is thinner .
As a result , the aerodynamic heating would n’t be as severe .
Suzuki knew of a method developed by a small Japanese company to coat paper with a kind of glass that would increase its heat resistance while still allowing it to be folded easily .
In February , he decided to test his creations .
A three - inch - long origami airplane made of specially - coated paper and folded like a space shuttle was placed in a Mach 7 airflow inside the University of Tokyo ’s hypersonic wind tunnel .
It withstood aerodynamic heating up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 seconds — enough to give Suzuki the confidence to move forward .
Last year Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata expressed an interest in joining the project , after he ’d learned that some materials made of paper — including a flight diary and notes taken by Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon — had survived space shuttle Columbia ’s violent breakup on reentering the atmosphere in 2003 .
Suzuki now had a means to launch his aircraft from orbit .
Wakata or one of his crewmates will release about 30 eight - inch - long origami airplanes during a spacewalk planned for his STS - 127 shuttle mission early next year .
The Japanese Space Agency , JAXA , recently announced its support for the research , one of four projects that will receive a combined total of 30 million yen ( $ 285,700 ) a year for a maximum of three years .
Success could pave the way for designing lightweight space reentry vehicles , says Suzuki .
Astronauts have flown paper airplanes inside spacecraft ( see the video link on this page ) , but have never dropped one overboard to see what happens .
This wo n’t be the first high - altitude flight , however .
“ We have some true stories , and some we hope are true because they are so cool , ” says Andy Chipling , author of Flying Paper Airplanes and president of the Paper Aircraft Association .
He himself has “ let one or two go while paragliding , ” and once dropped a paper airplane from a hot air balloon 7,000 feet over Kenya .
( “ We started at 5,000 feet ground height , so it ’s cheating , I think ! ” )
Then there was the time , recalls Chipling , that someone in the United States “ let one go down a mountain .
It was said that half an hour later , when he drove into the lower parking at the bottom of the mountain , the aircraft landed at about the same time .
It sounds far - fetched , but it is not impossible , as thermals could have slowed its descent . ”
For Suzuki , the biggest challenge was figuring out how to predict the landing point for a paper airplane dropped from orbit .
Basically , he can’t .
No one can determine with any precision where or when the origami airplanes will come down , except that they have a good chance of falling into the ocean .
A bigger airplane would be more visible , but could pose a hazard to the space station or to people on the ground .
Attaching an electronic transmitter would increase the airplane ’s weight and make it more subject to aerodynamic pressure .
Therefore , says Suzuki , “ I decided to expect someone on earth to pick it up ” rather than try to track its flight .
If all goes well , the paper airplanes will land on Earth a few months after they ’re released .
“ I will write messages in several languages on the planes to ask the finder to let me know , ” Suzuki says .
May 14 , 2008  --
Almost a year after an amusement park ride severed both her feet , Kaitlyn Lasitter says it 's " sad " that " it took my legs being taken from me " to have more attention called to the issue of amusement park ride safety .
She and her family spoke at a press conference on Capitol Hill as part of the latest push to put the issue on lawmakers ' agenda .
The ride at the Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom in Louisville , Ky. , was called the Superman Tower of Power , described as a " stomach - wrenching thrill ride that lifts passengers 176 feet straight up , pauses , and then plunges them down at 50 miles an hour . "
On June 21 , 2007 , 13 - year - old Lasitter and her friends decided to experience the thrill .
When they were about 20 feet in the air , pieces of cable began beating against their necks , arms and faces .
One of the 10 cables snapped , wrapped around Lasitter 's legs and cut off both her feet .
An investigation by the state of Kentucky concluded , among other things , that maintenance workers at Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom failed to properly care for and lubricate the 10 cables that lift the Superman Tower of Power .
Eight months after the accident , the park shut down the ride .
Lasitter , now 14 , has one reattached foot and one prosthesis .
At Wednesday 's press conference , she described her painful recovery , saying she " wo n't be the person I was before , " and that she fears for her life when she gets in a car or steps into an elevator .
" It 's hard for me to live my days like I used to ... I 'm not as carefree as a 14 - year - old child should be .
And that , that really sucks . "
She also said she has trouble sleeping , frequent headaches and bouts of nausea .
She will heal , but " I do n't want to wait for ' eventually , ' " she said .
Though states set and enforce their own inspection guidelines for the rides , there are no federal regulations that cover " fixed - site " amusement park rides such as the Superman Tower of Power .
Rep. Ed Markey , D - Mass . , wants to change that .
" In 1981 , a special - interest loophole was built into this bill , the 1981 budget , " Markey said at the press conference , holding up a copy of the bill .
" Inside of here , there is one page that repeals the authority of the Consumer Product Safety Commission to regulate over the amusement park industry . "
Markey said that , because of the loophole , the federal government is powerless to investigate accidents at amusement parks or put a system in place to facilitate information - sharing among states .
Markey pointed out that the CPSC does have authority over " more than 15,000 other types of other consumer products , " including rides at traveling carnivals and fairs , but not rides fixed in place at amusement parks .
" In short , the federal government has no role if there is a huge accident on a roller coaster going a hundred miles an hour where children are injured in one state to ensure that it is inspected , that the safety problem is corrected , and the other 49 states are then warned that there is a problem , " Markey said .
But he also charged that the amusement park industry is " using all of its power " to block a law change , a claim the industry 's largest trade organization has denied .
The International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions says the additional level of regulation is not necessary .
" The current [ inspection ] system works very well .
The industry is very safe and regulated , " David Mandt , IAAPA vice president of communications , told ABC News .
He added that it 's " not a huge industry , " so there is already " a tremendous amount of information - sharing " about topics , including safety issues through manufacturers ' bulletins , industry Web sites , and distribution of news reports by industry organizations , such as IAAPA .
Between states , insurance companies and industry organizations , Mandt added , " there are many eyes regulating and reviewing ride safety . "
Mandt said different states should be able to tailor their regulations to their respective needs , and that " there 's no evidence that CPSC oversight would improve the outstanding safety record of the industry .
And it could cost taxpayers millions . "
But the current regulatory system does n't go far enough for some parents .
Kathy Fackler , whose then - 5 - year - old son son lost part of his foot in a 1998 amusement park ride incident , said at the press conference that she was " appalled by the absence of public accountability " at the time of her son's accident , and that " 10 years later , when I look at the national picture , I 'm still appalled . "
" If this girl 's legs had been severed in a lawnmower accident , or an ATV accident , the Consumer Product Safety Commission would have investigated .
If she were an employee of Six Flags , instead of a paying customer , OSHA [ Occupational Safety and Health Administration ] would have investigated , " Fackler said .
Fackler , who founded advocacy group Saferparks in 2000 , says children , like her son and like Lasitter , are especially vulnerable , with children younger than 13 involved in half of ride - related accidents and three - quarters of falls and ejections from moving rides .
" Certainly , our hearts go out " to families like the Lasitters , Mandt said .
" One injury is too many , and our industry is extremely committed to providing a safe , enjoyable experience . "
But he contends the odds of being hurt while on a ride are small .
" The chance of being seriously injured while riding a fixed - site ride in the United States is one in 9 million , and that 's because of all the safety measures our industry goes through to make sure guests have a safe experience , " Mandt said .
He cited 2005 industry figures which show more than 300 million visitors took more than 1.8 billion rides that year , and National Safety Council data that show for every million rides taken in the United States , less than one injury results .
For Lasitter , being one of those one in 9 million has " affected my life dramatically . "
" I was in bed for 10 months , " she said .
" I wo n't have memories of my eighth - grade year , well , I will , but they 're memories of me laying in the hospital .
They 're memories of me learning to walk again . "
Though she is able to walk again , it 's not without its challenges .
Lasitter described how impaired normal teenage activity can be , such as hitting the mall with a group of friends .
" I want to be able to go to the mall with my friends , but I can 't , " she said .
" You know , when I do , I have to have crutches or I have to have my dad there to hold my hand , or I have to have a wheelchair , just in case I get tired , which , I mean , I want to be a 14 - year - old girl , you know , my parents at home , me shopping with my friends , and I can't do that right now . "
Lasitter 's parents , Randy and Monique , have quit their jobs to take care of their daughter .
" It 's been a long 11 months at our house , " Monique said , fighting back emotion , " and no one can even imagine , and it could have been your child .
So , please do n't let it be .
Help us with the fight , that 's all I 'm asking . "
Markey has secured a promise from the Energy and Commerce Committee subcommittee chairman , with jurisdiction over this bill , that he will hold hearings this year -- possibly as early as this summer .
He first introduced similar legislation in 1999 , and has reintroduced it several times since , but Mandt says it has n't made progress " because members of Congress understand how much we already do to ensure safety ; they agreed congressional oversight is not necessary . "
ABC News ' parent company , The Walt Disney Co. , owns and operates amusement parks with fixed - site rides .
Game Company Uses Breasts to Get Players
In Japan , business is war .
And nowhere is this truer than in the gaming industry where every game developer tries to outsmart ( and thereby , also outsell ) the next rival , by coming up with innovative ways of doing business .
So the creators of the PC - based game Married Women Harem :
This is the Married Women Paradise Inn , came up with an unusual ad strategy to draw customersâ€ ” through boobs ( genuinely - fake ones ) .
If you go up to the fifth floor of the recently - opened megastore ( September 2007 ) of the Japanese electronics retailer , Sofmap , in the heart of the Akihabara shopping district , you ’ll be greeted with not the regular pile of fliers and brochures , but life - sized cardboard cutouts fitted with ginormous silicone - breasts draped in sexy lingerie .
And what ’s more , they ’re meant to be fondled .
That ’s right .
A large sign that reads , â€ œSqueeze All You Want , â€ actually tells a buyer that ’s it quite all right , to cop a feel .
What could happen next is that you may want to fill out that ( pre ) order form , before you exit the store .

No matter how corrupt , greedy , and heartless our government , our corporations , our media , and our religious and charitable institutions may become , the music will still be wonderful .
If I should ever die , God forbid , let this be my epitaph : THE ONLY PROOF HE NEEDED FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD WAS MUSIC Now , during our catastrophically idiotic war in Vietnam , the music kept getting better and better and better .
We lost that war , by the way .
Order could n't be restored in Indochina until the people kicked us out .
That war only made billionaires out of millionaires .
Today 's war is making trillionaires out of billionaires .
Now I call that progress .
And how come the people in countries we invade can't fight like ladies and gentlemen , in uniform and with tanks and helicopter gunships ?
Back to music .
It makes practically everybody fonder of life than he or she would be without it .
Even military bands , although I am a pacifist , always cheer me up .
And I really like Strauss and Mozart and all that , but the priceless gift that African Americans gave the whole world when they were still in slavery was a gift so great that it is now almost the only reason many foreigners still like us at least a little bit .
That specific remedy for the worldwide epidemic of depression is a gift called the blues .
All pop music today ­ jazz , swing , be - bop , Elvis Presley , the Beatles , the Stones , rock - and - roll , hip - hop , and on and on ­ is derived from the blues .
A gift to the world ?
One of the best rhythm - and - blues combos I ever heard was three guys and a girl from Finland playing in a club in Krakow , Poland .
The wonderful writer Albert Murray , who is a jazz historian and a friend of mine among other things , told me that during the era of slavery in this country ­ an atrocity from which we can never fully recover ­ the suicide rate per capita among slave owners was much higher than the suicide rate among slaves .
Murray says he thinks this was because slaves had a way of dealing with depression , which their white owners did not :
They could shoo away Old Man Suicide by playing and singing the Blues .
He says something else which also sounds right to me .
He says the blues can't drive depression clear out of a house , but can drive it into the corners of any room where it 's being played .
So please remember that .
Foreigners love us for our jazz .
And they do n't hate us for our purported liberty and justice for all .
They hate us now for our arrogance .
When I went to grade school in Indian apolis , the James Whitcomb Riley School # 43 , we used to draw pictures of houses of tomorrow , boats of tomorrow , airplanes of tomorrow , and there were all these dreams for the future .
Of course at that time everything had come to a stop .
The factories had stopped , the Great Depression was on , and the magic word was Prosperity .
Sometime Prosperity will come .
We were preparing for it .
We were dreaming of the sorts of houses human beings should inhabit ­ ideal dwellings , ideal forms of transportation .
What is radically new today is that my daughter , Lily , who has just turned 21 , finds herself , as do your children , as does George W Bush , himself a kid , and Saddam Hussein and on and on , heir to a shockingly recent history of human slavery , to an Aids epidemic , and to nuclear submarines slumbering on the floors of fjords in Iceland and elsewhere , crews prepared at a moment 's notice to turn industrial quantities of men , women , and children into radioactive soot and bone meal by means of rockets and H - bomb warheads .
Our children have inherited technologies whose by - products , whether in war or peace , are rapidly destroying the whole planet as a breathable , drinkable system for supporting life of any kind .
Anyone who has studied science and talks to scientists notices that we are in terrible danger now .
Human beings , past and present , have trashed the joint .
The biggest truth to face now ­ what is probably making me unfunny now for the remainder of my life ­ is that I do n't think people give a damn whether the planet goes on or not .
It seems to me as if everyone is living as members of Alcoholics Anonymous do , day by day .
And a few more days will be enough .
I know of very few people who are dreaming of a world for their grandchildren .
Many years ago I was so innocent I still considered it possible that we could become the humane and reasonable America so many members of my generation used to dream of .
We dreamed of such an America during the Great Depression , when there were no jobs .
And then we fought and often died for that dream during the second world war , when there was no peace .
But I know now that there is not a chance in hell of America becoming humane and reasonable .
Because power corrupts us , and absolute power corrupts us absolutely .
Human beings are chimpanzees who get crazy drunk on power .
By saying that our leaders are power - drunk chimpanzees , am I in danger of wrecking the morale of our soldiers fighting and dying in the Middle East ?
Their morale , like so many lifeless bodies , is already shot to pieces .
They are being treated , as I never was , like toys a rich kid got for Christmas .
Human beings have had to guess about almost everything for the past million years or so .
The leading characters in our history books have been our most enthralling , and sometimes our most terrifying , guessers .
May I name two of them ?
Aristotle and Hitler .
One good guesser and one bad one .
And the masses of humanity through the ages , feeling inadequately educated just like we do now , and rightly so , have had little choice but to believe this guesser or that one .
Russians who did n't think much of the guesses of Ivan the Terrible , for example , were likely to have their hats nailed to their heads .
We must acknowledge that persuasive guessers , even Ivan the Terrible , now a hero in the Soviet Union , have sometimes given us the courage to endure extraordinary ordeals which we had no way of understanding .
Crop failures , plagues , eruptions of volcanoes , babies being born dead ­ the guessers often gave us the illusion that bad luck and good luck were understandable and could somehow be dealt with intelligently and effectively .
Without that illusion , we all might have surrendered long ago .
But the guessers , in fact , knew no more than the common people and sometimes less , even when , or especially when , they gave us the illusion that we were in control of our destinies .
Persuasive guessing has been at the core of leadership far so long , for all of human experience so far , that it is wholly unsurprising that most of the leaders of this planet , in spite of all the information that is suddenly ours , want the guessing to go on .
It is now their turn to guess and guess and be listened to .
Some of the loudest , most proudly ignorant guessing in the world is going on in Washington today .
Our leaders are sick of all the solid information that has been dumped on humanity by research and scholarship and investigative reporting .
They think that the whole country is sick of it , and they could be right .
It is n't the gold standard that they want to put us back on .
They want something even more basic .
They want to put us back on the snake - oil standard .
Loaded pistols are good for everyone except inmates in prisons or lunatic asylums .
That 's correct .
Millions spent on public health are inflationary .
That 's correct .
Billions spent on weapons will bring inflation down .
That 's correct .
Dictatorships to the right are much closer to American ideals than dictatorships to the left .
That 's correct .
The more hydrogen bomb warheads we have , all set to go off at a moment 's notice , the safer humanity is and the better off the world will be that our grandchildren will inherit .
That 's correct .
Industrial wastes , and especially those that are radioactive , hardly ever hurt anybody , so everybody should shut up about them .
That 's correct .
Industries should be allowed to do whatever they want to do : bribe , wreck the environment just a little , fix prices , screw dumb customers , put a stop to competition , and raid the Treasury when they go broke .
That 's correct .
That 's free enterprise .
And that 's correct .
The poor have done something very wrong or they would n't be poor , so their children should pay the consequences .
That 's correct .
The United States of America cannot be expected to look after its own people .
That 's correct .
The free market will do that .
That 's correct .
The free market is an automatic system of justice .
That 's correct .
I 'm kidding .
And if you actually are an educated , thinking person , you will not be welcome in Washington , DC .
I know a couple of bright seventh graders who would not be welcome in Washington , DC .
Do you remember those doctors a few months back who got together and announced that it was a simple , clear medical fact that we could not survive even a moderate attack by hydrogen bombs ?
They were not welcome in Washington , DC .
Even if we fired the first salvo of hydrogen weapons and the enemy never fired back , the poisons released would probably kill the whole planet by and by .
What is the response in Washington ?
They guess otherwise .
What good is an education ?
The boisterous guessers are still in charge ­ the haters of information .
And the guessers are almost all highly educated people .
Think of that .
They have had to throw away their educations , even Harvard or Yale educations .
If they did n't do that , there is no way their uninhibited guessing could go on and on and on .
Please , do n't you do that .
But if you make use of the vast fund of knowledge now available to educated persons , you are going to be lonesome as hell .
The guessers outnumber you ­ and now I have to guess ­ about 10 to one .
I 'm going to tell you some news .
No , I am not running for President , although I do know that a sentence , if it is to be complete , must have both a subject and a verb .
Nor will I confess that I sleep with children .
I will say this , though :
My wife is by far the oldest person I ever slept with .
Here 's the news : I am going to sue the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company , manufacturers of Pall Mall cigarettes , for a billion bucks !
Starting when I was only 12 years old , I have never chain - smoked anything but unfiltered Pall Malls .
And for many years now , right on the package , Brown and Williamson have promised to kill me .
But I am now 82 .
Thanks a lot , you dirty rats .
The last thing I ever wanted was to be alive when the three most powerful people on the whole planet would be named Bush , Dick and Colon .
Our government 's got a war on drugs .
That 's certainly a lot better than no drugs at all .
That 's what was said about prohibition .
Do you realise that from 1919 to 1933 it was absolutely against the law to manufacture , transport , or sell alcoholic beverages , and the Indiana newspaper humourist Ken Hubbard said : " Prohibition is better than no liquor at all . "
But get this :
The two most widely abused and addictive and destructive of all substances are both perfectly legal .
One , of course , is ethyl alcohol .
And President George W Bush , no less , and by his own admission , was smashed , or tiddley - poo , or four sheets to the wind a good deal of the time from when he was 16 until he was 40 .
When he was 41 , he says , Jesus appeared to him and made him knock off the sauce , stop gargling nose paint .
Other drunks have seen pink elephants .
About my own history of foreign substance abuse , I 've been a coward about heroin and cocaine , LSD and so on , afraid they might put me over the edge .
I did smoke a joint of marijuana one time with Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead , just to be sociable .
It did n't seem to do anything to me one way or the other , so I never did it again .
And by the grace of God , or whatever , I am not an alcoholic , largely a matter of genes .
I take a couple of drinks now and then and will do it again tonight .
But two is my limit .
No problem .
I am , of course , notoriously hooked on cigarettes .
I keep hoping the things will kill me .
A fire at one end and a fool at the other .
But I 'll tell you one thing : I once had a high that not even crack cocaine could match .
That was when I got my first driver 's licence ­ look out , world , here comes Kurt Vonnegut !
And my car back then , a Studebaker as I recall , was powered , as are almost all means of transportation and other machinery today , and electric power plants and furnaces , by the most abused , addictive , and destructive drugs of all : fossil fuels .
When you got here , even when I got here , the industrialised world was already hopelessly hooked on fossil fuels , and very soon now there wo n't be any left .
Cold turkey .
Can I tell you the truth ?
I mean this is n't the TV news is it ?
Here 's what I think the truth is :
We are all addicts of fossil fuels in a state of denial .
And like so many addicts about to face cold turkey , our leaders are now committing violent crimes to get what little is left of what we 're hooked on .
I turned 82 on November 11 , 2004 .
What 's it like to be this old ?
I can't parallel park worth a damn any more , so please do n't watch while I try to do it .
And gravity has become a lot less friendly and manageable than it used to be .
When you get to my age , if you get to my age , and if you have reproduced , you will find yourself asking your own children , who are themselves middle - aged : " What is life all about ? ' "
I have seven kids , three of them orphaned nephews .
I put my big question about life to my son the pediatrician .
Dr Vonnegut said this to his doddering old dad : " Father , we are here to help each other get through this thing , whatever it is . "

Wikipedia , the free , user - generated online encyclopedia , faces a court battle to protect itself from liability for everything that users post on the site .
The company behind the site will argue that it should be granted immunity under US law .
A literary agent is suing Wikipedia owner the Wikimedia Foundation over a comment posted on the site that she was " the dumbest " of a list of the 20 worst literary agents .
Barbara Bauer said the comment was defamatory .
A science fiction authors ' organisation called Writers Beware created a list of the 20 literary agencies about which it received the most complaints .
Bauer was on that list , and she has claimed that comments on Wikipedia then called her " the dumbest of the 20 worst " agents .
Wikimedia denies that those comments ever appeared but argues that even if they did they are protected under the US Constitution 's guarantee of the right to free speech .
Wikimedia argues overall , though , that it is protected from liability by the Communications Decency Act ( CDA ) , whose section 230 protects a publisher from liability for things said by other people on its electronic services until it is made aware of the comments .
At that point it must take action or risk becoming liable .
The section of the Act says that " [ n ] o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider " .
In its application for summary dismissal of the case , Wikimedia says that the law applies directly to it .
" As the operator of the Wikipedia website , Wikimedia is indisputably a user and a provider of an interactive computer service under [ section ] 230 , " said its claim .
" In addition , the statements on which Plaintiffs ' claims are based were posted on Wikipedia by another information content provider .
The Complaint itself indicates that the allegedly defamatory statements on Wikipedia originated elsewhere , alleging that virtually identical statements to those appearing on the Wikipedia site appeared on numerous other websites . "
The case is a vital one for Wikipedia , which exists to hold encyclopedia entries created by other people .
If would be a serious blow to its way of operating if it were not granted immunity under the CDA .
" We provide a platform through Wikipedia for smart citizens to give their knowledge back to a larger culture , " said Wikimedia Foundation general counsel Mike Godwin .
" Our ability to offer citizens that platform is what 's at stake in this case . "
" Congress passed Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in order to protect websites ' operators like Wikipedia from suits like this one , " said James Chadwick of Sheppard Mullin , the US law firm that is acting for Wikimedia .
" It 's simple but it 's fundamental : Congress has decided that internet censorship is n't the answer , so websites are n't liable for statements posted by their users . "
The case is being supported by digital rights body the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
" Without strong liability protection , it would be difficult for Wikipedia to continue to provide a platform for user - created encyclopedia content , " said EFF senior staff attorney Matt Zimmerman .

Berkeley -
A new analysis of Martian soil data led by University of California , Berkeley , geoscientists suggests that there was once enough water in the planet 's atmosphere for a light drizzle or dew to hit the ground , leaving tell - tale signs of its interaction with the planet 's surface .
The study 's conclusion breaks from the more dominant view that the liquid water that once existed during the red planet 's infancy came mainly in the form of upwelling groundwater rather than rain .
To come up with their conclusions , the UC Berkeley - led researchers used published measurements of soil from Mars that were taken by various NASA missions : Viking 1 , Viking 2 , Pathfinder , Spirit and Opportunity .
These five missions provided information on soil from widely distant sites surveyed between 1976 and 2006 .
" By analyzing the chemistry of the planet 's soil , we can derive important information about Mars ' climate history , " said Ronald Amundson , UC Berkeley professor of ecosystem sciences and the study 's lead author .
" The dominant view , put forward by many now working on the Mars missions , is that the chemistry of Mars soils is a mix of dust and rock that has accumulated over the eons , combined with impacts of upwelling groundwater , which is almost the exact opposite of any common process that forms soil on Earth .
In this paper , we try to steer the discussion back by re-evaluating the Mars data using geological and hydrological principles that exist on Earth . "
The final version of the study will appear online in Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta , the journal of the International Geochemical Society , by the end of June , and in a print issue in August .
Martian soil has made headlines in recent weeks as NASA 's Phoenix lander began sampling soil from the planet 's north pole and analyzing its chemical elements .
The goal of the tests is to determine whether Mars was once capable of supporting life , an idea that got a boost on Friday ( June 20 ) when Phoenix scientists announced the discovery of ice underneath the Martian soil .
While the UC Berkeley - led study does not delve directly into evidence of life on Mars , it does suggest what kind of climate that life , if it existed , might have encountered .
The planet is currently too cold for water to exist in a liquid state , but scientists generally agree that during the planet 's earliest geological period , known as the Noachian epoch and dating 4.6 billion to 3.5 billion years ago , there were enough atmospheric greenhouse gases to warm the air and support lakes and flowing rivers .
But unlike Earth , Mars does not have plate tectonics to help generate volcanoes and other terrestrial sources of greenhouse gases to sustain heat , explained Amundson .
He said that many scientists believe that by the time the planet moved from the Noachian epoch to the Hesperian epoch , dating from 3.5 billion to 1.8 billion years ago , water on Mars had either frozen or evaporated .
( The planet is now in its third geological time period , the Amazonian epoch , which started about 1.8 billion years ago . )
The new study , however , suggests that liquid water existed in the Martian atmosphere into the Hesperian era .
To support this view , the team showed that soil at the Viking , Pathfinder and Spirit landing sites had lost significant fractions of the elements that make up the rock fragments from which the soil was formed , a sign that water once moved downward through the dirt , carrying the elements with it .
Amundson also pointed out that the soil records a long period of drying , as evidenced by surface patterns of the now sulfate - rich land .
The distinctive accumulations of sulfate deposits are characteristic of soil in northern Chile 's Atacama Desert , where rainfall averages approximately 1 millimeter per year , making it the driest region on Earth .
" The Atacama Desert and the dry valleys of Antarctica are where Earth meets Mars , " said Amundson .
" I would argue that Mars has more in common geochemically with these climate extremes on Earth than these sites have in common with the rest of our planet . "
Amundson noted that sulfate is prevalent in Earth 's oceans and atmosphere , and is incorporated in rainwater .
However , it 's so soluble that it typically washes away from the surface of the ground when it rains .
The key for the distinctive accumulation in soil to appear is for there to be enough moisture to move it downward , but not so much that it is washed away entirely .
The researchers also noted that the distribution of the chemical elements in Martian soil , where sulfates accumulate on the surface with layers of chloride salt underneath , suggest atmospheric moisture .
" Sulfates tend to be less soluble in water than chlorides , so if water is moving up through evaporation , we would expect to find chlorides at the surface and sulfates below that , " said Amundson .
" But when water is moving downward , there 's a complete reversal of that where the chlorides move downward and sulfates stay closer to the surface .
There have been weak but long - term atmospheric cycles that not only add dust and salt but periodic liquid water to the soil surface that move the salts downward . "
Amundson pointed out that there is still debate among scientists about the degree to which atmospheric and geological conditions on Earth can be used as analogs for the environment on Mars .
He said the new study suggests that Martian soil may be a " museum " that records chemical information about the history of water on the planet , and that our own planet holds the key to interpreting the record .
" It seems very logical that a dry , arid planet like Mars with the same bedrock geology as many places on Earth would have some of the same hydrological and geological processes operating that occur in our deserts here on Earth , " said Amundson .
" Our study suggests that Mars is n't a planet where things have behaved radically different from Earth , and that we should look to regions like the Atacama Desert for further insight into Martian climate history . "

This article explains about free recycle recycling initiative at its best .
All about free recycling groups .
If you ’ve ever been involved in recycling , I ’m pretty sure you ’ve come across a free recycle group in your community or you ’re a member of one already .
Based on communication and totally - free sharing of recyclable goods , the concept of free recycle has become phenomenally successful here in the US and worldwide , in the past few years .
What made free recycle successful ?
One word – convenience – much like in any other widely - accepted innovation .
Do you have a sofa you want to give away ?
An old fridge you ’d like to haul off to the dump site ?
An old TV set you no longer need ?
Old clothes ?
A kid ’s bike ?
Stuff you want to dispose of but do n’t know how .
These things have a way of staying in your storage room or garage for months or years collecting dust – only to be transported to a landfill somewhere in the end .
No worries , free recycle can help you move that unwanted stuff .
Within just a few minutes , you can find people who actually needed or want the item you are giving away , and will pick it up eagerly from your doorstep – for free .
All you need to do is to post a brief description of the freebie item in a free recycle community site or forum and wait for other users to find your post and leave their responses for you .
You get to choose who to give your stuff to .
One such network of free recycle organizations is Freecycle , founded by Deron Beal in 2003 .
Back then , Beal who was newly married wanted to dispose of a bed he no longer needed .
He sent out a bunch of emails to his friends .
No one wanted the bed , but to his amazement , people started emailing back or communicating with each other ( through the cc in his original email ) with things they also wanted to give away and things that they needed .
Beal realized there was a clear need for a forum or web venue where people from a certain locality can exchange information on what reusable items are available and who needs what – all in the spirit of free giving and receiving .
That ’s how he started his hugely successful free recycle group – Freecycle .
If the concept of free recycle is new to you , the process is quite simple and convenient .
You can locate your local free recycle group in the web , join up , and start posting items you would like to give away for free .
You can also try to see what items are available and see if there ’s anything you needed or would like to have .
You then contact the owner and if you ’re lucky , you ’re chosen to go and pick up the item .
Here are some recycling and environmental networks that you can visit to see which free recycle group caters to people in your area : Freecycle , Earth911 , Don’tDumpThat , FreeGeek ( computers ) .
Volunteer moderators usually facilitate free recycle groups or forums and oversee the posts and the interaction of members .
Of course , just like in joining any group in the web , basic courtesy and respect for the others will make you a valued member .
The basic requirement is that you ’re giving away the item you ’re posting totally free , no strings attached and that the items are “ legal and appropriate for all ages . ”
Trading ( or auctioning ) of items in a free recycle forum is deemed inappropriate .
As always , you should also exercise caution to protect your privacy , in dealing with people in the web .
It is perhaps this very simplicity of the free recycle concept that has made it very popular in thousands of communities worldwide .
Free recycle networks now boast of memberships in the millions belonging to independent free recycle communities in the US and in a good number of countries abroad .
Freecycle , Beal ’s group founded here in the US , now has 4,356 groups within its network with 5,070,000 members worldwide .
DontDumpThat , a free recycle network based in the UK , now has 21,475 members covering 184 towns in the UK .
Free recycle as a movement performs a strategic function in the recycling loop – remember “ reduce , reuse , recycle ? ”
It allows people to do their part in protecting the environment by reducing the amount of trash that gets dumped into the landfills by reusing products or items that may be second - hand but are still perfectly usable .
Ultimately , free recycle is about creating a deeper sense of community of people joined together by a common concern for the environment and selfless sharing and generosity .
For you and me , as individuals , joining a free recycle group or forum is a win -win option .
You get rid of unnecessary items from your household , you ’re able to give it to someone who actually would reuse it ( and keep it away from the landfill ! ) , you win friends , and help build community .

Time to probe corruption in Oakland City Hall
Whether Oakland City Administrator Deborah Edgerly leaves office quietly or fights tooth and nail to keep her job , it 's time for a higher authority to take a look at operations inside Oakland City Hall during her term in office .
A police investigation dubbed Operation Nutcracker , which resulted in the arrests of 56 suspected gang members last week , also raised suspicions about Edgerly 's intervention on behalf of her nephew , William Lovan , who was among those arrested .
In cracking open the activities of a violent street gang , the police investigation has opened up a Pandora 's box in City Hall .
The two stories converged on June 7 when Edgerly showed up at a West Oakland liquor store as police questioned Lovan , and intervened on his behalf , police say .
According to a police report , Edgerly bullied officers and threatened an internal Police Department probe - presumably aimed at their actions .
This was n't the first time that Edgerly has intervened on behalf of a co-worker , friend or family member , police sources say :
-- Two years ago , Edgerly and Assistant City Administrator Cheryl Thompson showed up and made similar threats when police arrested Thompson 's son , also a city employee , for disorderly conduct outside a bar in downtown Oakland .
He remains a city employee .
-- Last year , Debra Taylor - Johnson , a civilian police employee , was called into an administrative hearing by Police Department officials for vouching for a recently hired employee .
The employee she endorsed was hired under an alias and had arrest warrants issued for identity theft and welfare fraud , authorities confirmed .
But when officials recommended Taylor - Johnson 's dismissal , Edgerly stepped in , overturned the decision and approved the expenditure to keep her friend employed .
--
Two years ago , nothing was done when allegations of illegal kickbacks were raised against District Six City Councilwoman Desley Brooks , another of Edgerly 's allies , after police investigators linked bank deposits made by the mother of one of Brooks ' employees to several personal checks for $ 1,200 written to Brooks ( exactly half the employee 's paycheck ) .
On Friday , Taylor - Johnson was among a handful of Edgerly supporters demonstrating inside Oakland City Hall after news reports that Mayor Ron Dellums had given Edgerly an ultimatum to retire , resign or be fired in the wake of her alleged actions in the gang investigation .
Brooks , too , came to Edgerly 's defense Friday , notifying Dellums ' office by e-mail that the mayor had no authority to take control of city agencies - if you can believe that .
Through all the smoke and mirrors surrounding the latest debacle , it 's obvious to the average Oakland resident - like me - that there is something terribly wrong with the way business is conducted in Oakland City Hall .
Since former Mayor Jerry Brown appointed Edgerly four years ago , she has changed hiring policies in the Police Department to the benefit of her daughter , a then - struggling police recruit .
And last year , Edgerly ordered a change in the annual Fire Department recruiting call , with disastrous results .
Some candidates were hand - picked by friends in the department while solid recruits , some of whom waited in line for days , were overlooked .
The city had to toss out the process and start over .
The city 's finance and management division includes nearly a dozen relatives of Edgerly and Thompson .
One of Edgerly 's sons works for the city 's Office of Information Technology .
And if you 're waiting for the Oakland City Council to stand up and be heard , do n't hold your breath .
There has n't been one peep from anyone on the council on this matter .
Nothing .
It 's as if it does n't exist .
I do n't know if the council 's inaction is driven by apathy , fear or complacency , but they provide us with no alternatives .
This goes way beyond coincidence , and it's clear that the office of Brown , who is now California 's attorney general , needs to get involved .
It would also be appropriate given Brown 's decision to hire Edgerly in 2004 .
There are so many errors in Oakland 's hiring practices that it's a wonder the bad guys have n't ended up with access to the personal information of our police officers .
Before his arrest last week , Mark Candler , the purported leader of the Acorn street gang , the target of the police raids , boasted to police that he could get all the information he needed about them anytime he wanted .
And when he was arrested in a raid at a house in the 1000 block of Filbert Street in Oakland last year , he proved it .
He called his mother upon his arrest and when she arrived , police were shocked to see a woman they recognized : Candler 's mother was a civilian employee assigned to the department 's personnel files on the building 's fifth floor .
She was dismissed .
Dellums clearly does n't have the resolve to act .
Edgerly was in her office Monday and it was business as usual , and the city administrator attended a staff meeting led by Dellums as if nothing was happening .
The dysfunction and corruption in City Hall has spread beyond local government 's ability to address it .
Oakland desperately needs some help - and quickly .
E.P.A. figures for 2004 to 2006 show there were 166 counties around the country that could have met a standard of 75 parts per billion but not 70 .
They include populous ones , like Miami - Dade in Florida , King County in Washington , and the Bronx in New York .
In all , 345 counties now violate the standard of 75 parts per billion .
Bringing them into compliance would prevent 900 to 1,100 premature deaths a year , according to the agency , and result in 5,600 fewer hospital or emergency room visits .
Reaching the standard will cost $ 8.8 billion a year , according to the agency , but the figure does not take account of health benefits .
Counties that cannot meet the standard face the threat of limits on new highways and industries .
Technically the administrator set a standard on ground - level ozone , which is the main ingredient of smog .
Ozone is formed by the action of sunlight on two kinds of pollutants , volatile organic compounds , which come from gasoline and various industrial processes , and nitrogen oxides , which are produced in cars and power plants .
Ground - level ozone is also a greenhouse gas .
While many groups and elected officials complained , not all the complaints were in the same direction .
The Edison Electric Institute , the trade association of the investor - owned utilities , said in a statement that the precise relationship between ozone and human health was still the subject of scientific dispute .
“ E.P.A. is promising health benefits that people may never receive , even though they ’ll end up paying for them at the pump and through higher energy bills , ” said a statement from John Kinsman , the utility group ’s senior director for the environment .
“ Hundreds of counties have n’t been able to meet the current standard set a decade ago , and moving the goal posts again will inflict economic hardship on these areas without speeding air quality improvement . ”
But others said the Bush administration was setting its sights too low .
“ It will be close to a decade from now before the first ounce of pollution is reduced by any industry , ” said S. William Becker , executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies , whose members are state and local officials .
“ That decade is an eternity in terms of technological advancement , ” Mr. Becker said .
The debate in coming days is likely to center on why Mr. Johnson chose a number outside the range recommended by his 23 - member scientific advisory board .
Representative Henry A. Waxman , Democrat of California and head of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , told Mr. Johnson in a letter that the decision was similar to one in 2006 to overrule a recommended standard on fine particles .
The decisions “ suggest that science is not the primary basis for your decisions , ” he wrote , asking for an explanation .

' Culturally offensive ' music is being used to break prisoners
Heavy metal music and popular American children 's songs are being used by US interrogators to break the will of their captives in Iraq .
Uncooperative prisoners are being exposed for prolonged periods to tracks by rock group Metallica and music from children 's TV programmes Sesame Street and Barney in the hope of making them talk .
The US's Psychological Operations Company ( Psy Ops ) said the aim was to break a prisoner 's resistance through sleep deprivation and playing music that was culturally offensive to them .
However , human rights organisation , Amnesty International , said such tactics may constitute torture - and coalition forces could be in breach of the Geneva Convention .
Sergeant Mark Hadsell , of Psy Ops , told Newsweek magazine : " These people have n't heard heavy metal .
This is an issue that seriously concerns us .
If there is a prolonged period of sleep deprivation , it could well be considered torture
Amnesty International spokesperson
" They can't take it .
If you play it for 24 hours , your brain and body functions start to slide , your train of thought slows down and your will is broken .
That 's when we come in and talk to them . "
Sgt Hadsell 's favourites are said to be ' Bodies ' from the XXX film soundtrack and Metallica 's ' Enter Sandman ' .
The theme tune from the US children 's programme Sesame Street and songs from the purple singing dinosaur Barney are also on their hit list .
" In training , they forced me to listen to the Barney " I Love You " song for 45 minutes .
I never want to go through that again , " one US operative told the magazine .
' No lasting effect '
Rick Hoffman , vice president of the Psy Ops Veterans Association , told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such a tactic would have no long - lasting effect on prisoners .
" The use of this kind of audio - technique is rather new in interrogation , " he said .
" There have been other kinds of non-lethal , non-harmful techniques , such as sleep deprivation ... which leave no long - lasting effects but do have the end result of breaking down the individual 's will to resist questioning . "
The TV theme tunes are repeated over long periods
Amnesty International told BBC News
Online that at least one Iraqi captive - a civilian , later released - had reported being kept awake for up to four days by loud music .
" This is an issue that seriously concerns us .
If there is a prolonged period of sleep deprivation , it could well be considered torture , " said a spokeswoman .
" It is a very difficult line to draw between what constitutes discomfort and what constitutes torture - that line will vary for individuals and it would depend on each particular case , " she added .
She said they were looking into whether the US and UK were abiding by their responsibilities under the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war .
The UK's Ministry of Defence has said all its prisoners are being held under the terms of the Geneva Convention and are visited by members of the International Red Cross .

Fifteen prominent civil rights groups are taking a conspicuous swing at Federal
Communications Commission Chair Kevin Martin's proposals for a wholesale based à la carte cable system .
The idea , if implemented , would deliver
" a crushing blow to channels targeting minority communities , " they
charge in a May 29th FCC filing .
The groups include the National Congress of
Black Women , the League of Latin American
Citizens , the
National Council of Women 's Organization , and the National Gay & Lesbian
Chamber of Commerce .
Ironically , some of these protesters have signed on to the à la carte idea in another context .
Read on :
We are baffled
For months , Martin has been talking up reforms that would allow cable operators to dump a channel from expanded basic cable service if it charges more than the monthly rate of 75 ¢ for each subscriber .
The ejected channels would then be made available to subscribers on a pick and choose , or " à la carte " basis .
" I believe that if a cable operator only wants to carry one channel , it should not be required to buy 10 or 20 channels in order to do so , " Martin told the American Cable Association 's 15th Annual Summit in early April .
" I believe this is a particularly important issue for those of you who are small operators or serve rural communities . "
But the fifteen civil rights groups see things differently , and they include the executive director of the League of Rural Voters .
Their statement says that Martin 's plan will leave niche minority channels , which often depend on being bundled in big packages , in the lurch .
" Wholesale à la carte would strike a deadly blow ... " they write , " by eradicating the benefits of bundling .
Viewers of minority programming would suffer as a result .
It is difficult enough to launch and earn carriage of these channels .
We are baffled by the Commission 's interest in throwing obstacles in the way of distributing this programming . "
This is a bad blow to Martin 's à la carte ideas .
It 's not like these groups are the first to make this point .
Rep. Hilda Solis ( D - CA ) , who represents part of Los Angeles , argued against it last year in an op - ed piece .
But most of the anti-à la carte flack has come from the mega cable programming providers , whose protests some observers will dismiss as the usual big media rhetoric .
Martin's 75 ¢ plan probably stems from his impatience with glacially moving Congressional efforts to encourage a retail based à la carte system , such as Senator John McCain 's Consumers Having Options in Cable Entertainment Act — the CHOICE Act .
McCain launched the bill with great fanfare in late May of 2006 ; it provided incentives for cable to offer pick and choose plans .
McCain and Martin promoted CHOICE in a series of widely distributed newspaper op - ed columns .
But the bill went nowhere very slowly and seems to have sunk into the background auto flow of the Federal lawmaking landscape .
A thorn is a thorn
The civil rights group protesters see Martin 's wholesale plan as a back door version of the CHOICE plan .
" The thorn of a rose by any other name would still cut deep , " they poetically conclude .
" Whether one calls it ' unbundling ' or ' wholesale ' or ' retail ' , à la carte is harmful to consumers and diversity of programming .
We urge you to continue opposing this and other versions of an idea that has virtually no support among civic groups or lawmakers . "
But that last claim is not quite true .
In fact , some of these groups have endorsed the proposed merger of XM / Sirius satellite radio , whose principals have promised to offer à la carte packages to subscribers of the merged entity .
These will include a " Pick Your Own 50 " package at $ 6.99 and a " Pick Your Own 100 " at $ 14.99 .
The merged XM / Sirius boosters include Lillian Rodriguez - Lopez , who signed onto today 's petition , but also voiced support for the XM / Sirius deal last November .
Same for the Niel Ritchie 's League of Rural Voters .
" Most important , " Ritchie wrote to the Commission last April , " XM and Sirius contend , if allowed to merge , that they will offer more channels for a lower price than the current cost of both services combined . "
Ditto for the National Black Chamber of Commerce .
" Further , XM and Sirius have committed to offering both opportunities for programmers and more choice for consumers at a lower per-unit cost , " the group told the FCC in May of 2007 .
To be fair , these organizations commented on behalf of XM / Sirius because they appreciate the niche channels the two services have sponsored over the years .
And XM / Sirius stepped up their à la carte rhetoric after some of these parties filed .
But they might have wanted to double check what they signed onto then , giving what they 're telling the FCC now .

Some animals like tigers are identifiable as individuals in ‘ camera trap ’ shots .
Others that are n’t could be estimated by the new method ( Image : ZSL )
Even the shyest , most reclusive animals should now yield their secrets to a new census method that uses automatic cameras to snap photos of passing animals .
Until now , such animals could only be counted through much more painstaking , expensive methods .
Conservation biologists already use such automatic cameras routinely in their field work .
Triggered by infrared sensors , these “ camera traps ” can record the presence of stealthy animals such as tigers or deer , which tend to flee an approaching biologist long before they can be glimpsed .
For a few animals , such as tigers , which can be individually recognised by their pattern of stripes , these photos already give good estimates of population size .
However , for the vast majority of species , in which individuals cannot be recognised , biologists cannot tell whether they are seeing a few individuals many times or many individuals a few times .

Gas molecules
Now Marcus Rowcliffe , a conservation biologist at the Institute of Zoology in London , UK , and his colleagues have figured a way around this problem .
Rowcliffe began by assuming that animals move around randomly , just like molecules in a gas .
By modifying physicists ’ equations for the motion of gas molecules , he found that he could estimate the population density of the animals from the frequency with which they are photographed , as long as he had some measure of the animals ’ speed of movement .
“ It ’s surprisingly simple , given the amount of mathematics behind it , ” says Rowcliffe .
The researchers tested their method by placing cameras in an animal park , Whipsnade Zoo in southern England , for a total of 3277 camera hours .
For three animal species – two kinds of deer and a wallaby – the population size calculated from the camera sightings and observers ’ estimates of movement speeds matched the actual , known population in the park .
Speed checks
Other biologists are excited about Rowcliffe ’s technique .
“ It really shows the potential to monitor the abundance of a whole community of animals with one technique , ” says Roland Kays , curator of mammals at the New York State Museum in Albany , US .
In the wild , though , the technique wo n’t work until biologists have accurate information about how fast animals move around .
“ That ’s the big sticking point at the moment .
We are not there yet , ” Rowcliffe concedes .
Radio - collaring animals is one way to get that information , but he and Kays are also developing a method for using video camera traps to record both presence and speed at the same time .

Men and women view one night stands differently Many women are left unhappy in the aftermath of casual sexual encounters , a survey has revealed .
Just under half of women who answered the internet poll , published in the journal " Human Nature " , said they felt it had been a bad idea .
Four out of five men , in contrast , said they were happy with a brief fling .
The academic leading the research said it showed that there was no evolutionary advantage for women in one night stands .
Basic emotions guide us down pathways that have been advantageous for our ancestors
Professor Anne Campbell
Durham University ?
The survey was answered by 1,700 people who had all experienced this kind of relationship .
While men reported feeling more content , sexually satisfied and confident after meaningless sex , women were more likely to worry about feeling used and " letting themselves down " .
Some of the their reasons for the encounters were because they felt there was the possibility of a longer term relationship .
Professor Anne Campbell , from Durham University , who carried out the research , said this was evolution at work .
" In evolutionary terms women bear the brunt of parental care and it has been generally thought that it was to their advantage to choose their mate carefully and remain faithful to make sure that their mate had no reason to believe he was raising another man 's child .
" Recently , biologists have suggested that females could benefit from mating with many men - it would increase the genetic diversity of their children , and , if a high quality man would not stay with them forever , they might at least get his excellent genes for their child . "
However , she said that if women were designed by evolution for short - term relationships , they would enjoy them more , and the survey suggested this was not the case .
" Basic emotions guide us down pathways that have been advantageous for our ancestors , " said Professor Campbell .

What are these ?
The neocon regime and its supporting masses of sheeple can be characterized in many ways but honesty is n't one of them .
However , violence , disrespect for the law and the U.S. Constitution are high on the list .
They will use any excuse to destroy the basic rights of the citizens of this country , or human beings in general ( as in “ torture of anyone we THINK might be a terrorist ' is just fine .. and after all , we are CHRISTIANS so do n't say we are doing anything illegal or immoral .. ” ) and do it in the name of keeping law and order , of protecting us .
The murder of over a million Iraqis and the deaths of over 4,000 American soldiers due to an illegal invasion of a sovereign nation show their total lack of morality when it comes to matters of life and death .
So should we really be surprised that neocon talk show host Michael Reagan has threatened the life of 9/11 and Iraq War truther Mark Dice ( [ link edited for length ] ) ?
Dice 's big sin , according to Ronald Reagan 's adopted spawn Michael , was to want to send information about the true nature of the Iraq invasion to the troops .
So Reagan convicted Dice of being a traitor obviously , Reagan has god - like powers in his own mind and decided Dice must be executed .
And Reagan has n't been arrested .
Hell , he has n't even been fired .
Although with the deluge of outraged callers and e-mails , I hear he is quivering enough to have invited Dice on the show to apologize .
Why is n't this enough ?
Death threats are not a trivial thing .
He was n't joking .
He offered to buy the bullets for some crazy to do the job .
He described in detail how Dice should be killed ( no blindfold ..
let 's add some extra torture the neocons are so fond of to the scenario is Reagan 's creed , apparently ) .
Reagan broke the law .
Here 's the proof , California 's Penal Code 422 , which states in part : Punishment for ( Terrorist ) Threats
Any person who willfully threatens to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to another person with the specific intent that the statement made verbally in writing or by means of an electronic communication device is to be taken as a threat even if there is no intent of actually carrying it out which on its face and under the circumstances in which it is made is so unequivocal unconditional immediate and specific as to convey to the person threatened a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat and thereby causes that person reasonably to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or her immediate family 's safety shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year or by imprisonment in the state prison .
In case you missed it , this is what Reagan said specifically : “ We ought to find the people who are doing this , take them out and shoot them .
Really .
You take them out , they are traitors to this country , and shoot them .
You have a problem with that ?
Deal with it .
You shoot them .
You call them traitors , that 's what they are , and you shoot them dead .
I 'll pay for the bullets .
How about you take Mark Dice out and put him in the middle of a firing range .
Tie him to a post , do n't blindfold him , let it rip and have some fun with Mark Dice . ”
Reagan and Dice both live in California and California law enforcement needs to get off their collective butt and do something .
I want you to imagine if Dice went on a national radio show and said Reagan should be killed and went on to explain in detail how serious he was and how it should happen .
Do you think for one minute Reagan would n't be all over Dice with lawyers and threats and outrage shrieked on every stupid Fox News program he could waddle onto and blither , jowls quivering in outrage ?
There 's a lot of talk about at a “ minimum ” Michael Reagan should apologize for threatening to kill Mark Dice on his radio show .
But it should n't be enough .
It is time for all of us to stand up and say we will fight for free speech , but we will uphold the law and that means death threats are NOT to be ignored , just because you are a talk host show with big ratings .
If such outrageous behavior is passed off as “ entertainment ” or not serious , where do we draw the line ?
What has happened to our civilization ?
Does n't the law count at all ?
And I am talking about the REAL extant law , not the phony baloney “ homeland security ” fascist rewrite - the - law - as - we - go - along agenda of the Bush regime .
Don Imus , a man I consider tiresome , tacky and boring , was publicly vilified for making a tasteless , stupid , racially clichd remark about ” nappy headed ho 's ” that he clearly thought was just a funny outrageous sarcasm .
It was n't funny and it was catastrophically in bad taste .
But it hardly threatened a life .
And he as treated as though he should be publicly flogged , if not executed , and held up to ridicule and rants on every national news show .
And fired .
Where are the media when Reagan attacks free speech and threatens a life on his radio show ?
We have to become the media the new media .
Get the word out .
Complain to the FCC ( step by step directions are here [ link edited for length ] ) .
If you live in California , rant like hell at the attorney general to DO SOMETHING , enforce the law .
Call up or write Radio America and complain to the management ( [ link edited for length ] ) .
BOYCOTT the station until they say , no , their talk show hosts can NOT break the law and threaten lives on the air .
Take action .
Do n't just sit there baa baa baa-ing along and waiting for some great miracle to happen to save this country .
You and I and all those who are willing to stand up and speak up and fight back are the only “ miracle ” out there .
Here 's an opportunity to not be a sheeple .
Just do it …
Perino punts on Pentagon Pundit propaganda
It ’s been nearly two weeks since the New York Times first reported on a Pentagon program in which retired military officers , who ’ve since become lobbyists or consultants for military contractors , were recruited to become propaganda agents of the Bush administration .
Throughout the war in Iraq , these retired officers — or “ message multipliers , ” as they were described by internal Defense Department documents — took on roles as military analysts for all of the major news networks , without noting their puppet - like relationships with the Pentagon .
Given their complicity in the scandal , most of the major news networks have been reluctant to even mention the story to the public .
The Washington Post ’s Howard Kurtz , to his enormous credit , said the media ’s “ coverage of this important issue has been pathetic . ”
He added , “ The story makes the networks look bad , and their response , by and large , has been to ignore it . ”
But a few brave souls are doing their level best to keep the story alive .
At yesterday ’s White House press briefing , Raw Story reporter Eric Brewer had raised his hand to ask a question for quite a while .
Dana Perino ignored him until others intervened , urging Perino to call on him .
Brewer , after noting that the retired officers ’ access was cut off if they departed from the Pentagon ’s talking points , asked , “ [ D ] id the White House know about and approve of this operation ? ”
Perino responded :
“ Look , I did n’t know — look , I think that you guys should take a step back and look at this — look , DOD has made a decision , they ’ve decided to stop this program .
But I would say that one of the things that we try to do in the administration is get information out to a variety of people so that everybody else can call them and ask their opinion about something .
“ And I do n’t think that that should be against the law .
And I think that it ’s absolutely appropriate to provide information to people who are seeking it and are going to be providing their opinions on it .
It does n’t necessarily mean that all of those military analysts ever agreed with the administration .
I think you can go back and look and think that a lot of their analysis was pretty tough on the administration .
That does n’t mean that we should n’t talk to people . ”
And with that , she abruptly ended the press briefing .
Not surprisingly , there are a few problems with that response — starting with the fact that Perino does n’t seem to know what the program was all about .
The press secretary ’s spin makes it sound quite innocuous .
The Defense Department , the White House story goes , was simply “ proving information to people who are seeking it . ”
In turn , those people “ provided their opinions on it . ”
What could possibly be controversial about that ?
In reality , however , this was as sophisticated a media - manipulation scheme as anything the Bush gang has hatched to date .
A small group of Pentagon political appointees would “ cater to ” more than 75 retired officers , giving them the message that needed to be multiplied .
As one Pentagon official marveled , “ You could see they were taking verbatim what the secretary was saying or what the technical specialists were saying .
And they were saying it over and over and over .
We were able to click on every single station and every one of our folks were up there delivering our message .
You ’d look at them and say , ‘ This is working . ' ”
The Pentagon kept this program secret , and would n’t acknowledge its existence until it was forced to as a result of a lawsuit .
If this was simply “ proving information to people who are seeking it , ” why , do you suppose , the Bush administration went to such lengths to keep it hidden from public view ?
If it was ethical and appropriate , why the need for secrecy ?
What ’s more , some of these retired officers were pressured to say things they knew to be false , but were driven by a financial incentive : they work for military contractors who could n’t risk upsetting the Pentagon .
So , the officers were given talking points , they repeated them on the air , and their employers continued to win lucrative contracts .
The goal was to “ transform the analysts into a kind of media Trojan horse — an instrument intended to shape terrorism coverage from inside the major TV and radio networks . ”
And , it worked , with these respected retired officers going on national television , without disclosing their role in the propaganda program , and insisting that Bush administration ’s policies were working , even when they were failing .
The dishonesty of the program is rivaled only by the dishonesty of the White House ’s response yesterday .
As for why it took a writer from Raw Story to press the White House press secretary on this , nearly two weeks after the revelations came to public light , that ’s a question for ABC , NBC , CBS , and Fox News to consider .
A mini-protein found in sunflower seeds could be the key to stopping tumors spreading in prostate cancer patients , according to QUT researchers .
Dr. Jonathan Harris , a senior lecturer in Queensland University of Technology 's Faculty of Science , and PhD student Joakim Swedberg , both from the University 's Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation , are working on the naturally occurring molecule .
" We are interested in this miniprotein as a potential treatment of prostate cancer , in particular for those patients who relapse , " said Dr Harris .
" The best thing to do in those cases is block the disease spreading to other organs , particularly the spine , which is very debilitating ; it is not the prostate tumour that kills you , it is when the cancer cells escape from the prostate so we want to prevent that . "
Another QUT researcher , Professor Judith Clements , had previously shown that the action of enzymes called proteases was a key event in tumour spread , and Dr Harris said that the sunflower mini-protein , known as the protease inhibitor , was able to block these enzymes in test tube - based assays .
" However , it also inhibits a whole range of proteases , some of which control important processes in the body , so we have re-engineered the molecule so it should just block the proteases produced in prostate cancer and hence stop tumour spreading , whilst leaving other processes intact , " he said .
The National Health and Medical Research Council grant will allow Dr Harris and his team to perform tests on the re-engineered inhibitor in animals over the next months .
" It feels like we have been covered in a shower of gold at the moment , it is very exciting for us because we are a small team but we have been working very hard on this for a long time , " he said .
" We are extremely happy because now we can carry out trials in mouse - models of prostate cancer and if we have positive results , we could get a pharmaceutical industry partner interested in the work .
The dream end - product is having a drug which could be produced in sunflower seeds and given as a simple dietary supplement for people with prostate cancer . "
Researchers have received over $ 600,000 worth of grants this year .
The grants came from Queensland Cancer Research , the Prostate Cancer Foundation , and the National Health and Medical Research Council .
( Natural News ) A Rhode Island school district has announced a pilot program to monitor student movements by means of radio frequency identification ( RFID ) chips implanted in their schoolbags .
The Middletown School District , in partnership with MAP Information Technology Corp. , has launched a pilot program to implant RFID chips into the schoolbags of 80 children at the Aquidneck School .
Each chip would be programmed with a student identification number , and would be read by an external device installed in one of two school buses .
The buses would also be fitted with global positioning system ( GPS ) devices .
Parents or school officials could log onto a school web site to see whether and when specific children had entered or exited which bus , and to look up the bus 's current location as provided by the GPS device .
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) has criticized the plan as an invasion of children 's privacy and a potential risk to their safety .
" There 's absolutely no need to be tagging children , " said Stephen Brown , executive director of the ACLU 's Rhode Island chapter .
According to Brown , the school district should already know where its students are . " [ This program is ] a solution in search of a problem , " Brown said .
The school district says that its current plan is no different than other programs already in place for parents to monitor their children 's school experience .
For example , parents can already check on their children 's attendance records and what they have for lunch , said district Superintendent Rosemary Kraeger .
Brown disputed this argument .
The school is perfectly entitled to track its buses , he said , but " it 's a quantitative leap to monitor children themselves . "
He raised the question of whether unauthorized individuals could use easily available RFID readers to find out students ' private information and monitor their movements .
Because the pilot program is being provided to the school district at no cost , it did not require approval from the Rhode Island ethics commission .
Finnish architect Matti Suuronen designed this UFO shaped dwelling in 1968 , initially for use as a ski-cabin or holiday home .
The idea behind the design reflects the optimism of the sixties .
At the time people believed technology could solve all problems for the human race .
The ideal was of a new era , a space - age , where everybody would have more leisure time to spend on holidays away from home .
The Futuro house was completely furnished and could accommodate 8 people .
It was constructed entirely out of reinforced plastic , a new , light and inexpensive material back then .
The plan was to mass - produce it , so it would be cheap enough to house all people around the earth .
Because it was so light - weight , it was easily transportable by helicopter .
Mobile living was the new possibility for the future .
People could now take their moveable home with them , to wherever they went , and live like modern nomads .
Unfortunately the 1973 oil crisis spoiled all these plans .
Prices of plastic raised production costs too high to be profitable .
Only 96 Futuro houses were ever built .
Besides the 48 made in Finland , also at least 48 were manufactured abroad on license .

Gloucester High School has seen a sharp rise in pregnancies
A US town mayor says there is " no evidence " to support claims that 17 Massachusetts schoolgirls became pregnant because of a " pregnancy pact " .
When details first emerged of the high rate of pregnancies at Gloucester High School , the school 's principal had speculated that the girls had a pact .
The number of pregnancies at the school has quadrupled since last year .
But Gloucester Mayor Carolyn Kirk said the spike in pregnancies was comparable to increases in other cities .
" Any planned blood - oath bond to become pregnant - there is absolutely no evidence of , " she said .
Memory failure
Ms Kirk said she had asked Gloucester High School 's principal about his comments and he had been " foggy in his memory " about how he had come to believe there had been a pregnancy pact at the school .
" When pressed , his memory failed , " she said .
The news of the Gloucester pregnancy cluster comes as statistics suggest that teenage pregnancy rates are increasing throughout the US .
Birth rates for girls aged 15 to 17 rose by 3 % in 2006 , the first increase since 1991 , according to preliminary data released in December by the National Center for Health Statistics .
David Landry , a researcher at the Guttmacher Institute , a New York - based non-profit group focusing on reproductive issues , said the declining teenage pregnancy rate of recent years appeared to be reversing .
@cargogh : My apologies for my use of cunt language .
Aussie use the term cunt ( as well as other cuss words ) A LOT in general conversation .
I could be talking about an old mate for example , " look at this ol ' mate trying to open a jar of vegemite with a broken finger , poor cunt , it must hurt "
One American by the name of Arj Barker was here and asked for directions , the conversation went like ...
" Could you please tell me where the tourist centre is ? "
" yeah mate !
Just take a fucken left down there , then two blocks down and turn a fucken right and it should be 2nd building on the left , you can't miss the cunt "
" thanks officer "
And two minutes later he does !
This is pretty funny .
Hillary spokesperson Phil Singer blasted out an email at 11:23 insisting that Obama release his tax returns for back years ,
Exactly two minutes later , at 11:25 , Obama spokesperson Tommy Vietor emailed out word that Obama had posted his tax returns for 2000 - 2006 on his campaign web site .
Turns out the Obama camp has been planning this for some time .
In pure political terms , this will obviously give more political potency to the Obama camp ’s efforts to make Hillary ’s failure to release her returns a key issue in the campaign .
The Obama camp is now free to beat this drum between now and mid-April , when the Hillary camp has promised to release hers .
Reaction from the Clinton camp ?
Cue crickets …
Find Obama ’s returns here .
Find Hillary ’s returns … three days before the Pennyslvania primaries .
Anybody else have the feeling that there ’s going to be something really interesting in there ?
Otherwise , why not just release them sooner rather than later ?
UPDATE :
TIME says they received the Obama email 2 minutes before they got the Clinton email .
And they have a screenshot to prove it .
As they put it …
[ … ] the Obama campaign apparently defied the laws of TIME AND SPACE .
Heh .
Fifteen years ago in Whole Earth Review , Kevin Kelly and Brian Eno ran a list of outrageous future scenarios .
Kevin says it was " a small game Brian Eno and I played to loosen up our expectations of what might happen in the near future . "
Kevin republished the list on his blog , Conceptual Trends and Current Topics .
Here are the first few from the list :
* A new plague seizes the world .
As fatal as AIDS , but transmitted on a sneeze , and spread by airplane travelers , the virus touches billions within a year .
* Computer power plateaus .
The expected doubling of power and halving of chip size slacks off .
More computer power can be had , but it costs .
* Computer screens ( both CRT and flat screens ) are found to be dangerous to the health .
Working at a computer is viewed as a toxic job .
* Alcohol is so severely restricted that people need " licenses " to drink it .
Tobacco is , of course , prohibited from being sold .
You can grow your own , though , and some do .
The underworld moves to North Carolina as cigarets become contraband .
* American education works .
Revived by vouchers , a longer school year , private schools and for - profit schools , the majority of Americans ( though not the most disadvantaged ) get the best education in the world .
* Japan is eclipsed by the Asian tigers .
The success of Japan subverts itself : women rebel , the young drop out , the workers play , and the system declines .
* Catalog direct marketing dies .
Inherently private electronic money and stricter privacy laws kill the hopes of bar - code dreams and direct marketing in general .
* Nobody wants to be a doctor .
It becomes an over - whelming bureaucratic job with low status .
Women and minorities become working doctors ; men do medical research .
* The human genome project is halted by activists .
Placards at demonstrations say : " Our DNA , Our Selves . "
* Third World nukes become commonplace .
Everybody has one , because everyone has nuclear power plants .
* Mass advertising is restricted .
Billboards are categorically banned ; advertising in subways , buses , removed .
Towns take up " Advertising - Free Zones . "
* People begin leaving the U.S. Many arrivals to the US keep resident status but choose not to adopt citizenship .
The world sees more people without allegiance .
* It costs half a day 's pay to drive your car into the downtown area of a big city , and a day 's wages to park .
I ’m starting a new chapter , on wind power , and have spent the past few days digging into newspaper archives ( digital digging , that is ) to learn about the history of windmills and wind power .
I came across a strange story published in the Chicago Daily Tribune , August 31 , 1873 , titled “ The Story of a Windmill . ”
I ca n’t quite tell whether it ’s made up or not , or if it ’s meant to be funny .
In any case , here it is :
:: continue ::
“ We went out to Slaymaker ’s in June , to spend the summer , but we have been obliged to leave .
Slaymaker had a small stream near his house , from which he used to pump water into the tank in hisgarrot .
It occured to him some time ago that it would be a good idea to put up a windmill which co do the pumping for him , so he built one at a cost of $ 200 .
The first day it began to revolve it frightened Slaymaker ’s best horse so that it ran against the fence and was killed , and the arms were so long that they nearly brained Slaymaker ’s oldest boy , who was standing beneath watching the machine , when it suddenly stopped work , and refused to move an inch .
Slaymaker accordingly pumped the tank full , and just as he stopped the mill began to pump like fury .
Slaymaker , in alarm , procured a rope and tied one of the wings to a tree .
When the tank was empty he tried to make the windmill fill it again , but the concern was immovable .
Then Slaymaker waited for a couple of weeks , and carried the water up to the house in buckets , because he was afraid to fill the tank , when the mil might get to work at any moment .
Finally , as there seemed to be no hope of the machinery getting all right again , he did pump the tank full , and then went to bed .
That night there was the first hurricane ever known in that neighborhood .
The windmill made about found hundred revolutions a minute , and left the bed of the stream below it completely dry , while it poured nearly six hundred gallons an hour into Slaymaker ’s garret .
The boarders all swam out the windows , and spent the rest of the night in the barn , while Slaymaker took to a tree , from which , at daylight , he had a magnificent view of the falls as they poured picturesquely from the attic windows every minute or two brining out with them a chair or a hair trunk , or one of Slaymaker ’s shirts , or a waistband .
Mrs. Slaymaker will not clean house this summer , but Slaymaker has a windmill that he is anxious to sell .
He will probably close it out cheap to a purchasers who wants to take it away right off .

Would you like a side of food poisoning with that salad ?
Salmonella can infect plant cells and successfully evade all the defense mechanisms of plants so cleaning the surfaces of raw fruits and vegetables , e.g. by washing , is not sufficient to protect against food poisoning , according to a study published today .
The results of the project are based on a model plant , which also represents the ideal basis for future development work on treatment and testing systems in the area of food safety .
1.5 billion (! ) cases of food poisoning are caused by Salmonella bacteria each year ( World Health Organisation ) .
If the bacteria survive particularly well in a person , they can even infect intestinal cells and persist for longer .
Previously , the only known sources of infection were infected meat products and plants that had come into contact with contaminated water .
Unnoticed on your plate - here marked with a fluorescent protein , Salmonella in plant cells .
Credit : Heribert Hirt
Work by the Unité de Recherche en Génomique Végétale ( URGV ) in Evry , France , and the Max F. Perutz Laboratories ( MFPL ) in Vienna , Austria , has now shown that this is not entirely true .
Work carried out by a team led by geneticist Prof.
Heribert Hirt , and published today in PloS ONE , shows that the strain of bacteria known as Salmonella typhimurium can also invade , and multiply inside , plant cells .
It is already known that Salmonella can survive for up to 900 days in contaminated soils , which creates a rich source of infection for plant material .
However , Prof .
Hirt 's team can now show that bacteria from such a source can actively achieve the infection of plant cells , thereby disproving the previous assumption that infection was coincidental and - as regards the bacteria - passive .
Prof .
Hirt explains : " We marked individual bacteria with a fluorescent protein , which enabled us to observe them as they quite clearly penetrated root cells and multiplied .
Just three hours after the bacteria came into contact with the roots , they had penetrated inside the cells of the finest root hairs .
17 hours later , the cells inside of the roots had also become infected . "
In principle , plants are anything other than helpless when under bacterial attack , and know how to defend themselves .
They have a whole range of defence mechanisms they can use to ward off infection .
The team also investigated the efficacy of these mechanisms when under attack from Salmonella bacteria .
Prof .
Hirt describes their results : " The defence mechanisms fail completely .
Although regulating proteins such as the two mitogen - activated protein kinases 3 and 6 are activated just 15 minutes after Salmonella has infected the plant , they cannot prevent the bacteria from multiplying .
Another defence mechanism , which is activated by the plant messengers salicylic acid , jasmonic acid and ethylene , proves similarly ineffective .
Although these messengers are important to coregraph the plant defense responses , they too are unable to halt the infection . "
Prof .
Hirt 's discovery has important implications for the production and processing of foodstuffs .
As emerging nations develop into industrial countries , a development that can be witnessed around the world , their needs for food and water also grow .
Besides the use of organic manures , many of which come from animals , these needs also necessitate irrigation , often with contaminated - and therefore potentially infectious - water .
If , as has now been discovered , Salmonella survives and multiplies in plant cells , then washing raw fruit and vegetables does nothing to prevent food poisoning .
Instead , scientists need to develop new methods of treatment and testing to tackle Salmonella infections in plants .
This FWF - supported project has already created the ideal basis for this work in the form of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana , which was used by the team from URGV and MFPL in its study .

Smalltalk gets a lot of attention for its object - orientedness , which is fine , but I 've already learned those lessons , thanks .
What I think deserves more attention is its syntax .
Much of what is distinctive about Smalltalk does n't come from its semantics but from its unusually simple , clear syntax .
There are several things language designers could learn from it .
Simple infix
In the perennial argument between infix and prefix syntax , almost everyone assumes infix is much more complicated .
Smalltalk shows it need n't be .
You can read most Smalltalk code with only three kinds of infix expressions , one postfix , and a few other constructs .
There are no special features to support infix , because everything is infix , even ordinary user - defined messages .
It 's still more complicated than S - expressions , but not by much .
If you like infix or dislike superfluous parentheses , it does n't look like a bad deal .
Keyword arguments
First , an implementation note : the simplest way to handle keyword arguments is to consider them part of the function 's name , and have foo ( bar=1 ) be syntax for foo_bar ( 1 ) .
A different set of keyword args calls a different function : foo ( baz=1 ) is foo_baz ( 1 ) .
This approach does n't work for large numbers of independent optional arguments , but most of the time it 's simple and efficient .
Calling a function with keyword arguments becomes equivalent to calling one with positional arguments .
There 's no overhead for passing or processing a table of keyword args .
The downside is that you can't do things like pass keyword arguments to an unknown function : ( lambda ( f ) ( f : reverse t : silent - error nil ) ) .
On the other hand , you can pass functions that take keyword arguments as if they took positional arguments - because they do .
Smalltalk takes this approach thoroughly .
All arguments except the receiver are keyword arguments , so all message sends use keywords , and therefore all methods have names like value : with : .
Rather than having method definitions define multiple names ( one for each combination of optional keyword arguments ) , Smalltalk just makes all keyword arguments required .
If you want optional ones , you have to define each combination separately .
That 's a bit of an annoyance ( and probably discourages people from using optional arguments ) but overall this system is easy to understand , easy to implement , and easy to use .
Is it verbose ?
Yes , a bit .
But it 's a form of verbosity that lends itself well to self - explanatory code .
For people like me , who do n't know the language very well , Smalltalk can be surprisingly easy to read , because nearly every argument has a helpful label beside it .
It might be slightly longer than in a keywordless language , but it 's longer in the right place .
Multiple infix
All these keyword arguments mean that many message sends are multiple infix : arguments alternate with pieces of the operator .
This sounds hard to read , like C's ternary operator : a ? b : c .
But it 's not actually a problem .
This is puzzling : if multiple infix is n't hard to parse , why is the ternary operator so unreadable ?
Is it because ?
and : are so short and easily overlooked next to their arguments ?
Because the ternary operator is the only multiple infix operator in C , and rare , so you do n't look for it ?
Because many programmers forget its precedence and swaddle it in parentheses ?
Is it only unreadable when it is used in inconveniently large expressions , as seems to happen a lot ?
λ
Lambda is n't common when it has a six - letter name , but if it 's shorter it is much easier to use casually .
Smalltalk uses syntax to abbreviate its lambdas , and it's hard to beat them for terseness , or ubiquity .
It also calls them blocks to be less intimidating - remember , this was originally a language for children - and it works :
Smalltalkers do n't seem to have a lot of trouble learning the mysteries of anonymous functions .
Surprisingly , Smalltalk does n't abbreviate function call .
But lambda is very useful even when calling is verbose , because it 's much more common to pass a function as an argument than to accept one .
It 's especially useful when it's as short as Smalltalk's .
The easy lambda alleviates much of the pressure of not having macros .
It easily handles three of the most common uses of macros : binding constructs , control structures , and laziness .
It 's not transparent like macros , and it introduces a distracting asymmetry in expressions like foo and : [ bar ] , but it 's a lot better than nothing , and some people prefer the explicit lambdas , at least when they 're only two characters long .
Unfortunately , the use of square brackets does n't mix well with deeply nested parentheses , because of the difficulty of keeping the parentheses matched when editing .
Smalltalk does n't have a lot of parentheses , so this is only a minor problem , and it would n't be a problem at all in a structure editor , but it means this approach to lambda does n't mix well with S - expressions .
The brackets are also sometimes easy to overlook , due to their similarity to parentheses .
Maybe a different syntax would be better , or even a short name , like , say , λ .

The seizure comes ahead of a major international donor conference Afghan police working with British special forces have uncovered a drugs stash of 237 tonnes of hashish .
Afghan and British officials say they believe it to be the world 's biggest seizure of drugs in terms of weight .
The drugs were found hidden in trenches in Kandahar province on Monday .
The haul was so large that British jets bombed it to destroy the hashish .
Nato 's top general in Afghanistan said the find would seriously cripple the Taleban 's ability to buy weapons .
' Welcome boost ' Afghan and British officials said the hashish had a value of more than $ 400 m ( £ 203 m ) .
The Nato - led International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) said the hashish weighed as much as 30 double - decker London buses .
[ The find ] was so large that two aircraft were brought in to destroy the underground bunker in which the hashish was being stored
UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband
" With this single find , they have seriously crippled the Taleban 's ability to purchase weapons that threaten the safety and security of the Afghan people and the region , " said Isaf 's commander , US General David McKiernan .
Afghan police received a tip about the drugs cache on Monday morning and found it later that day , Isaf said .
Three men were arrested during the operation .
The find " reflects the efforts of the Afghan government against the drug trade , and was so large that two aircraft were brought in to destroy the underground bunker in which the hashish was being stored " , British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said in a statement .
The BBC's Martin Patience in Kabul says the announcement should provide a welcome boost to the Afghan government on the eve of a major international donor conference in Paris in support of the country .
In the past , Afghanistan has been criticised by the international community for not doing enough to tackle drugs - especially the opium trade .
Afghanistan is estimated to account for 90 % of the world 's opium .
The previous record drugs haul is believed to be 81 tonnes of cocaine seized in Colombia .

Re : Homegrown Terrorism
Governmental efforts to deal with the problem of “ homegrown terrorism ” raise serious civil liberties concerns .
House and Senate committees charged with overseeing these efforts , the House Homeland Security Committee and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs , have conducted a series of hearings on the matter and received some troubling recommendations .
Legislation to address the problem , the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act ( H.R. 1955 ) passed the House and companion legislation , S. 1959 , is stalled in the Senate .
We understand that the Senate Committee plans to issue a report based on the hearings .
We encourage the committee to take the following concerns and issues into consideration in writing that report .
We must be clear ; the need to prevent criminal acts of violence is unquestionable .
Studying and understanding the origin of terrorism and what provokes violence is an important element of prevention .
But one of the greatest challenges to countering such movements is drawing the line between advocacy of ideas , including violence , and taking concrete steps toward carrying out a violent act .
It is also important to distinguish between violence that injures or kills people and minor acts of vandalism that are part of an act of civil disobedience .
Properly viewed , dissent can be an antidote to terrorism , not a precursor to it .
Defining the Problem
The first challenge policy makers face is to define the problem that is to be addressed .
It is critically important that the articulation of the problem does not cause people merely exercising their First Amendment rights to fear being swept into the net of suspicion .
For example , any definition of the problem must recognize that it is perfectly permissible for Americans to hold and promote a system of beliefs that others might find “ extreme , ” and for those who hold those beliefs to seek , without violence , political , religious and social change based on those beliefs .
The reference in pending homegrown terrorism legislation to “ the process for adopting an extremist belief system ” raises concern that advocacy of particular beliefs would become the subject of study , instead of studying the causes of violence that a person engages in , citing such beliefs .
A second challenge is to determine whether there even is an identifiable process that leads to terrorism .
A statistically and methodologically flawed study by the New York Police Department purports to identify a four - step “ radicalization process ” that terrorists go through , but even the authors of the study admit limitations to the application of their model , namely :
that not all individuals who begin the process pass through all the stages ;
that many “ stop or abandon this process at different points ; ” and finally ,
that “ individuals do not always follow a perfectly linear progression ” through the four steps .
What is dangerous is that the four steps each involve religious conduct , and the authors fail to note that millions of people may progress through these “ stages ” and never commit an act of violence .
The Government should not be in the business of trying to thwart the adoption of belief systems to which some in government object .
And , when assessing whether particular advocacy can be stifled – including objectionable advocacy of violence – it is useful to recall that the Supreme Court set a high bar to governmental prior restraint .
Under the Brandenburg v. Ohio incitement test , speech cannot be curtailed unless it is intended to and has the effect of causing imminent lawless conduct .
Mere abstract advocacy of violence , however objectionable , may not be barred .
The Danger of Focusing on the Internet
Much of the discourse on homegrown terrorism has singled out Internet communications in a troubling way .
For example , the pending homegrown terrorism legislation notes , " The Internet has aided in facilitating violent radicalization , ideologically based violence , and the homegrown terrorism process in the United States by providing access to broad and constant streams of terrorist - related propaganda to United States citizens . "
The truth of this statement lies in its universality : the simple fact is the Internet has become an essential communications and research tool for everyone .
Our concern is that this focus on the Internet could be a precursor to proposals to censor and regulate speech on the Internet .
Indeed , some policy makers have advocated shutting down objectionable websites .
The Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee heard testimony from a Dutch counterterrorism official whose government monitors mosques and works to take “ the most radical ” websites offline : “ Our message is clear : we do not allow them to preach intolerance . ”
This is not consistent with American values of free speech or the First Amendment .
Moreover , testimony at the hearings indicates that such an approach not only fails muster under free speech principles , but is unlikely to be effective .
The Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee also heard testimony indicating that the content of many of the websites that are objectionable is “ mirrored ” on other websites , and that as a result , shutting down one or two will not make the information disappear .
Lt. Col. Joseph Felter , Ph D. , Director of the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point , testified to the Senate Committee that “ Attempts to shut down websites have proven as fruitless as a game of whack - a- mole . ”
It can even be counter - productive .
Attempts to shut down websites often draw attention to the very content that may be objectionable .
If the Internet is a focus of efforts to stop “ homegrown terrorism ” it should be because it can be a tremendous tool for dissemination of vast amounts of material that could counter the messages of the terrorists .
The Internet , and the free speech it facilitates , can be an antidote to terrorism .
The Counterproductive Focus on Islam
Much of the discourse about homegrown terrorism in these hearings has focused on Muslims and Islam , even though perpetrators of terrorism in the United States have had many religious and ethnic backgrounds .
Suggestions have been made that Muslims need to be watched because any particular Muslim might at any time become a homegrown terrorist .
The Los Angeles Police Department , for example , launched a program to “ map ” mosques in the Los Angeles area as part of its efforts to counter homegrown terrorism .
Focusing the discussion of homegrown terrorism on Muslims may actually increase the potential for violent radicalization in the United States .
Many witnesses before the Committee spoke of the growth of Islamophobia and the polarization of the Muslim community as risk factors that raise the potential for extremist violence .
Unfairly focusing suspicion on a community tends to create the very alienation these witnesses said could lead to homegrown terrorism .
Moreover , there is not one monolithic Muslim community in the United States , according to Committee witness Farooq Kathwari , who co-chaired the Task Force for Muslim American Civic and Political Engagements .
Muslim Americans emigrated from many different countries across the globe , with many different religious , ethnic and social traditions , while a significant number , particularly African American Muslims , are not immigrants at all .
A focus on Muslims can create an impression that all adherents of Islam are suspect and lead to racial ( or religious ) profiling .
Dr. Marc Sageman , who conducted research on terrorists in Europe and the United States , suggested religion may be less of a driving factor than local police actions :
“ It is important to realize that the terrorists are not – and I emphasize not – Islamic scholars . ”
Discriminatory profiling is a counterproductive anti-terrorism strategy .
It shifts the locus inquiry away from indicia of violence to characteristics such as race and religion which are not predictors of terrorism .
Moreover , it can contribute to feelings of alienation that can be preyed upon by those who intend to do harm .
Learning from History
A look back at U.S. history shows that many major social change movements advocated ideas that were considered radical at the time and used tactics that could fall into an overbroad definition of homegrown terrorism .
Any plan of action to address the problem that suggests that “ extremist beliefs ” will become a subject of suspicion will discourage people from advocating their beliefs and ideas in an open and democratic process .
That result would harm our society , not protect it .
Indeed the civil liberties of U.S. citizens can be respected while protecting national security .
Unfortunately , recent U.S. history is full of discouraging examples of nonviolent groups being subjected to unwarranted surveillance , even incarceration and deportation based not on any crime , but on political beliefs or ethnic identity : the Palmer raids , the internment of Japanese Americans in World War II , and the FBI ’s counterintelligence program ( Cointelpro ) of the 1960 ’s and 1970’s .
The legislative branch has a history of using innuendo and guilt by association to ruin reputations and silence dissent , from the New York legislature ’s Lusk Committee ( which published a report in 1920 entitled Revolutionary Radicalism ) to the House Un- American Activities Committee hearings of the 1940 ’s , 50’s and 60’s .
Most Americans agree that these violations of civil liberties were more harmful than the threat from ‘ radical ’ groups .
Conclusion
Broad definitions of terrorism and radicalization , coupled with the public 's knowledge of surveillance of nonviolent groups by the Justice Department , give cause to concern that Americans ' ability to speak freely will be threatened by efforts to address homegrown terrorism .
We believe that efforts to prevent people in the United States from turning to terrorism can only succeed if we protect the free speech , religious and associational rights of those against whom these efforts are directed .
We strongly urge policy makers to tread lightly and carefully in this area , and to make every effort to preserve free speech and association rights .
It 's somewhat of a tradition here in our house to shower with a beer ( separately ) before we head out to party on the weekend .
After doing it for quite sometime we got sick of having to drink the water that would find its way into our beer ( because we had no place to put it but the ground ) .
To fix this problem our good friend Greg came up with a genius way to have a beer holder for the shower .
What you need :
1 - Cup holder ( found at any car parts store )

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power dropped the ball Monday .
Actually , it dropped 400,000 of them .
The agency started dumping thousands of floating plastic balls into Ivanhoe Reservoir -- the dwarf sibling next door to Silver Lake Reservoir , the neighborhood ’s crown jewel -- to protect the drinking water supply needed for summer .
The water needs to be shaded because when sunlight mixes with the bromide and chlorine in Ivanhoe ’s water , the carcinogen bromate forms , said Pankaj Parekh , DWP ’s director for water quality compliance .
Bromide is naturally present in groundwater and chlorine is used to kill bacteria , he said , but sunlight is the final ingredient in the potentially harmful mix .

The DWP drop was designed to stop the three from mingling in the 10 - acre , 58 - million - gallon Ivanhoe Reservoir .
The 102 - year - old facility serves about 600,000 customers downtown and in South Los Angeles .
Elected officials , community activists and two dozen DWP officials and maintenance workers grabbed a few balls out of a white tub and tossed them into the aquamarine pool after a brief news conference .
Pebble - heavy “ plops ” permeated the laughter of smiling onlookers .
City Councilman Tom LaBonge shouted , “ For quality of water for all of Los Angeles ! ” with each of three balls he chucked into the water .
At a signal from DWP General Manager David Nahai , a dozen crew members began opening dozens of white nylon bags that lined the reservoir .
Each bag bulged with 2,100 balls .

Resembling a slithering stream of oversized caviar , the black balls rolled thunderously down the reservoir ’s slopes .
“ Water quality does n’t get more exciting than this , ” Marina J.F. Busatto , a DWP biologist , said with a smile to a colleague as she helped slide ball - filled bags to the reservoir ’s edge .
Within 30 minutes , a portion cordoned off in Ivanhoe was blanketed with the black balls .
“ It looks like an oil spill , ” quipped Marilyn Oliver , 63 , who has lived on a hill overlooking the reservoir for 45 years .
But , she quickly added , “ it ’s OK because it ’s temporary and the water quality is more important than the looks . ”
Open reservoirs exposed to sunlight are now rare .
The area ’s reservoirs -- Silver Lake , Ivanhoe and Elysian -- first registered elevated levels of bromate between June and October 2007 .

But state health officials said the dangers were minimal because bromate poses a small cancer risk only after consumed daily over a lifetime .
Silver Lake Reservoir ’s contaminated water was drained this year .
The reservoir does n’t need covering because the recently replenished supply is not chlorinated until after it leaves its basin .
But the discovery of bromate prompted officials to look for ways of shading Elysian and Ivanhoe .
A tarp would have been too expensive and a metal cover would take too long to install , especially in a year of drought .
So one of the DWP ’s biologists , Brian White , suggested “ bird balls , ” commonly used by airports to prevent birds from congregating in wet areas alongside runways .

DWP officials and Orange Products , the Allentown , Pa. , company that produces the balls , said this was the first time a major utility had used the globes to solve a water - quality problem for a drinking supply .
White said Orange Products is the only company in the United States that could manufacture the balls , which are environmentally safe for drinking water and approved by NSF International , a government - sanctioned , nonprofit water quality organization .
The balls , which cost 40 cents each , are made of polyethylene .
The coating contains carbon .
Black is the only color strong enough to deflect ultraviolet rays , said Paul Sachdev , president of Orange Products .
The company is producing about 100,000 balls a day -- its largest order this summer -- to meet DWP ’s order of 6.5 million .
Each bag will be dumped as it arrives , with Ivanhoe getting the first batches until fully covered .
The DWP ’s Parekh noted that the “ balls require no construction , no parts , no labor , no maintenance . ”

Ivanhoe and Elysian reservoirs will be blanketed by about 3 million balls each for about four years , Parekh said .
They will be removed when a covered replacement reservoir is built near Griffith Park ’s Travel Town area .
LaBonge acknowledged that the black layer was n’t as pretty as the old face of Ivanhoe , but said its beauty would come back when the area ’s reservoirs are retired and probably made into recreational areas that the public is working with officials to design .
“ We know the beauty and purpose underneath , ” he said .

Whether you took Mozzy 's stance that Apple quietly slipping Safari into its Software Update for Windows users " bordered on malware " or just did n't give a shit , looks like you 'll have to admit it worked like gangbusters : Net Applications reports that it tripled Safari 's marketshare in only a month .

Before the update , Safari 's marketshare on Windows was a barely detectable 0.07 percent at its peak , with basically flat growth for nearly a year .
Then BOOM , there 's a huge spike post - update shenanigans .
Wonder if it'll correspondingly drop as people rip it out of their computers ( or not , if they actually like it ) since it 's got its own pane in Software Update now .

May 9 , 2008  -- Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , faces enormous pressure from social conservatives to ignore his repeated commitment to change the GOP 's platform on abortion .
" If he were to change the party platform , " to account for exceptions such as rape , incest or risk to the mother 's life , " I think that would be political suicide , " said Tony Perkins , the president of the conservative Family Research Council , to ABC News .
" I think he would be aborting his own campaign because that is such a critical issue to so many Republican voters and the Republican brand is already in trouble . "
A senior Republican close to McCain told ABC News that building a more inclusive GOP is a top priority for the Arizona senator .
But this adviser does not see changing the party platform to include exceptions for rape , incest , and the life of the mother as necessary for achieving that vision .
The problem for McCain , however , is that he excoriated then - Gov. George W. Bush during a 2000 debate for not being willing to make this change to the platform , and Democrats are salivating at the prospect of arguing , in the words of one strategist , " that another four years of Bush begins with another four years of Bush 's platform . "
Watch McCain 's heated exchange with Bush here .
McCain Reaffirmed Position in 2007
While McCain has not addressed the abortion platform since becoming the presumed Republican nominee , he reaffirmed his desire to change the GOP 's official abortion stance following a multicandidate forum that took place in Des Moines , Iowa , April 14 , 2007 .
Despite McCain 's support for changing the platform in 2000 and 2007 , Sen. Sam Brownback , R - Kan. , the co-chairman of McCain 's Justice Advisory Committee , significantly downplays the possibility that McCain would revise the party 's call for a nationwide constitutional ban on abortion with no exceptions .
" I do n't think that 's going to happen .
I think you 're going to see a platform process that is going to maintain that plank , " said Brownback , a leading abortion rights opponent who endorsed McCain after ending his own White House bid .
" There are going to be a number of people supporting his nomination that want that plank left exactly as it is , " he said .
" They 're going to be a strong majority . "
The GOP 's platform committee will meet in Minneapolis - St .
Paul the week before the Sept. 1 - 4 Republican National Convention .
Winning Conservatives , Alienating Moderates ?
While leaving the platform untouched would please many in the GOP 's socially conservative base , it could alienate some of the more moderate voters that McCain hopes to woo .
" If he does n't change the platform , then he 's being the same kind of hypocrite that he accused Bush of being in 2000 , " said Jennifer Blei Stockman , the co-chairwoman of Republican Majority for Choice .
" To not accept abortion in cases of rape and incest , give me a break .
That 's sick .
That 's inhumane . "
" And the life of the mother ? " she added .
" These are things that we can't even put our arms around because they are so inhumane . "
Brownback defended McCain against the prospect of being called a flip - flopper .
" I do n't know how you can accuse John McCain of being a flip - flop on a topic where the party rank and file that will be at the convention will support that plank even if his views differ slightly , " said Brownback .
" Newt Gingrich had the right statement :
It 's a pro-life party with a pro-choice wing . "
Stockman said that McCain 's team is ignoring his previous commitments on this issue and is intentionally downplaying his clout .
" If McCain chooses not to revise the platform , I think he will say it's ' the system ' and he will try to distance himself from it , " said Stockman .
" But he absolutely has the power to change it . "
" Many people think of him as a moderate , " she said .
" But when it comes out that he does n't want to change this extreme , right - wing Republican platform , the word ' moderate ' is going to disappear from any description of McCain . "

The first rule of Site R is :
You do not talk about Site R. Or , as the security guidance about the Pentagon ’s nuclear war bunker ( AKA Raven Rock Mountain Complex , or RRMC ) , states : “ Avoid conversations about RRMC with unauthorized personnel . ”
The other two rules of Site R are : “ Do not confirm or deny information about RRMC to reporters or radio stations , ” and “ Do not post RRMC information on Internet web pages . ”
We might suggest a fourth rule : do not send information about RRMC to reporters working on a travelogue about nuclear weapons .
In our book released this week , A Nuclear Family Vacation : Travels in the World of Atomic Weaponry , we start off in the American southwest and travel all the way to Iran in search of a better understanding of nuclear weapons and warfare .
In an itinerary that includes underground missile alert facilities , uranium plants and remote Pacific outposts , we try to answer the question :
What is the current nuclear strategy , and does it make any sense ?
Nuclear bunkers , a Cold War holdover , embody many of the contradictions in today ’s nuclear policy .
First built as a way to shield top leaders from atomic fallout , they quickly became obsolete with the advent of thermonuclear weapons and precise , long - range missiles .
Some , like the congressional bunker at the opulent Greenbrier resort in West Virginia , have closed their doors ; others , like Cheyenne Mountain , have teetered on the brink of shutdown .
But our interest in Site R was piqued by an announcement that was posted in 2006 on the website of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency ( DTRA ) , the Pentagon ’s nonproliferation agency :
Raven Rock Military Complex The Hardened Facilities Managers Conference , co-sponsored by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Raven Rock Military Complex * , will focus on priority issues of both countering enemy underground facilities ( UGF ) and protecting friendly underground facilities .
Managers of U.S. operated UGF's will provide overviews of their corresponding complexes .
In addition technical and vulnerability issues will be discussed and site tours will be provided .
If Site R is so gosh - darn secret , why did they post this notice , and more importantly , how did we get our grubby little mitts on documents relating to this conference , including an an informational overview , a “ Welcome Package " , an agenda , security guidance for attendees , and a schedule of shuttles to Site R ( which we are not posting ) ?
Cunning subterfuge ?
A Deep Throat inside the mountain ?
A Freedom of Information Act request ?
Sadly , we just asked for them .
We e-mailed the contact person for the conference , provided our affiliation , and asked for the conference materials .
We did say “ please . "
All of the information was unclassified , and it provides for us at least a small window into what goes on underground at Site R .
Within a few days , the Defense Threat Reduction Agency had scrubbed the conference posting from their website , and we were informed that the event most certainly was not open to the press .
Somewhere inside the halls of DTRA , we suspect someone was being reprimanded .
For all the secrecy surrounding Site R , the mountain facility suffers from the obvious flaw of just about every bunker out there :
Its existence is n’t secret , and in the era of Google Earth , it really ca n’t be kept secret .
And if it ’s not a secret , what good is it ?
A modern thermonuclear warhead would destroy it in an instant .
In fact , Site R was almost mothballed prior to September 11 .
As we learned from our travels , bunkers are typically obsolete the day they open their doors , but they live off the inertia of bureaucracy .
The terrorist attacks of 2001 gave new purpose to the Cold War bunker in Pennsylvania , known as the " underground Pentagon , " first as the alleged undisclosed location of Vice President Dick Cheney , and then as a base for revitalized “ continuity of government ” operations .
Are bunkers good for combating terrorism ?
Probably not .
As the nation learned on September 11 , what you want in the event of a terrorist attack is information : immediate , accurate and unfiltered .
Site R , where government workers are stripped of their personal cell phones and PDAs , is arguably the worst place to be .
When you walk into a government office these days , the big board equivalent is not a classified feed , but a flat screen playing CNN .
And what exactly would a bunker provide the government in the event of terrorism , other than a temporary safe haven for bureaucrats ?
As Hurricane Katrina demonstrated , the weakest link in disaster response is not shielding government officials — they appear to do quite well — but protecting the most vulnerable members of the population .
The bunker mania , then , is not a rational response to current threats , but part of the renewed obsession with " continuity of government , " a holdover from Cold War -era days .
So , what do bunker managers do at meetings like this ?
Judging from the conference agenda , they look for things to worry about : pandemics ; electromagnetic pulse weapons ; and biological attacks .
But as one item on the agenda hinted — “ Tunnel Collapse Briefing ” — possibly the most dangerous threat to life in the bunker is the bunker itself .
Site R is one of those places that exists somewhere between the worlds of secrecy and lunacy : we ’re told the government bureaucrats ordered to go there generally regard it as a colossal waste of time ; it ’s of questionable utility in any realistic scenario , and like all bunkers , it presents more disadvantages than advantages when it comes to coordinating disaster response .
We 're also told the largest tenant at Site R is DTRA , an obscure agency that – though certainly involved in important work and home to many dedicated scientists – is , even by its own employees , regarded as a dysfunctional bureaucracy ( On the other hand , when not in hidden in a bunker , DTRA does important nonproliferation work ) .
Secrecy does not protect the occupants of the bunker from nuclear weapons , from terrorists , or from foreign enemies , it only protects them from the public .
That ’s why the instructions on the security guidelines strike us as both absurd and arrogant :
“ The more the public knows about this facility , the more our adversaries do , and the more vulnerable we become . ”
Site R is not secret , but details of what 's inside are hidden from view .
The agenda provides some hints about what 's there : a presidential weather support facility ( presumably for Air Force One ) and construction related to electromagnetic pulse protection .
But perhaps the most eye - catching item on the agenda is a “ Gorilla Rock Update ” provided by miners , suggesting that there is new construction going on inside the mountain .
That should come as little surprise .
As we write in our book , “ a permanent government bureaucracy would always find a reason for digging .
Standing by the tightly guarded entrance to the mountain complex , the true purpose of which is obscured from the public it is designed to protect , we could n't help but think that perhaps the only thing Site R protected was its own existence . ”

* Although the conference announcement referred to " Raven Rock Military Complex , " DTRA later told us the official name is the " Raven Rock Mountain Complex . "
Both names are used in official documents , though " Mountain " is the dominant usage .
