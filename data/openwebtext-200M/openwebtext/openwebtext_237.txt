In the parable of the lost sheep , in the Gospel of Luke , Jesus says there shall be more joy in heaven over “ one sinner that repenteth ” than over 99 just persons who need no repentance .
Never mind heaven : check out the joy on the Internet .
In 2001 , rumors started to hit the blogosphere that Antony Flew , a British philosopher born in 1923 , had found God after six decades of atheism .
At first Flew denied the reports .
But in May 2004 he told a conference in New York that he had indeed changed his mind and become a believer .
A flurry of online pundits debated the meaning of this shocking conversion .
Now , in a book written , according to its title page , “ with ” Roy Abraham Varghese  of whom more later 
Flew tells the story of his “ discovery of the divine . ”
This sounds like a victory for the faithful in the God wars : a welcome riposte to the atheist tomes of Richard Dawkins , Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris .
Although Flew is not “ the world ’s most notorious atheist , ” as the subtitle of “ There Is a God ” claims , and never was , even in his native Britain , he ought to count as quite a catch .
Now retired from the University of Reading in Berkshire ( he has also taught at Oxford and in Scotland , Canada and the United States ) , he is the author of several cogent and elegant works of philosophy , including accomplished critiques of religion .
In many public debates he has vigorously made the case for unbelief .
But I doubt thoughtful believers will welcome this volume .
Far from strengthening the case for the existence of God , it rather weakens the case for the existence of Antony Flew .
The book has five main parts : a preface and an appendix by Varghese ; an intellectual autobiography and an account of his case for God , attributed to Flew ; and another appendix , on the historical evidence for the resurrection of Jesus , by N. T. Wright , the Anglican bishop of Durham .
Varghese is an Indian - born business consultant who founded the Institute for MetaScientific Research in Texas , and writes and edits books on the interplay between science , religion and philosophy .
He helped organize the conference at which Flew announced his conversion and is the author of a book , “ The Wonder of the World , ” that Flew recommends .
Varghese has also written “ God -Sent : A History of the Accredited Apparitions of Mary , ” which argues that more than 50 such apparitions cannot be explained away as hallucinations and that there is better evidence for them than there is for any ostensible U.F.O. sighting .

Wondrous apparitions and the Sci Fi Channel are a long way from the Oxford of the late 1940s , where Flew cut his philosophical teeth .
But throughout his career , he has , he says , been willing to follow an argument wherever it leads and to be open to new evidence .
Although he does not yet follow Varghese into Marianism ( or even Christianity ) , Flew now thinks “ the world picture ... that has emerged from modern science ” points to an “ infinite Intelligence ” that brought the universe into being .
He believes the fact that nature obeys precise mathematical laws , the fact that life and mind have emerged from inanimate matter , and the fact that the universe exists at all are best explained by positing a God .
WASHINGTON , Dec. 4 — President Bush warned today that Iran remained a threat despite an intelligence assessment that it had halted a covert program to develop nuclear weapons four years ago , as the administration struggled to salvage a diplomatic process now in disarray .
Once again facing criticism over the handling — and meaning — of intelligence reports , Mr. Bush said the new assessment underscored the need to intensify international efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon .
He said Iran could not be entrusted with acquiring even the scientific knowledge to enrich uranium for peaceful civilian use , explicitly declaring for the first time what has been an underlying premise of the Bush administration ’s policy .
He also appeared to rule out any new diplomatic initiative with the current president of Iran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
“ Look , Iran was dangerous , Iran is dangerous , and Iran will be dangerous , if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon , ” Mr. Bush said , sounding defensive at times , during a news conference dominated by questions about the assessment , known as a National Intelligence Estimate .
“ What ’s to say they could n’t start another covert nuclear weapons program ? ”
WCSD legal fees for Davis lawsuit exceed $ 100,000
WCSD nears the end of its battle with ousted Superintendent Traci Davis but it 's still not over as legal bills continue to grow
Former Major League Baseball player
Jim Leyritz was arrested Friday on charges of driving under the
influence and killing another driver after his vehicle crashed into
hers .
Leyritz , who turned 44 on Thursday , faces charges of DUI
manslaughter and DUI property damage , said Detective Kathy Collins ,
Fort Lauderdale police spokeswoman .
Police believe alcohol was involved in the crash , though
investigators are awaiting results of blood alcohol tests , Collins
said .
Leyritz posted the $ 11,000 bond and was released from the Broward
County jail at 2:35 p.m. on Friday , according to Keyla Concepcion , a public information officer for the Broward Sheriff 's Office .
Fort Lauderdale authorities got a call at 3:20 a.m. that a crash
had occurred in the city 's entertainment district , Collins said .
She said Leyritz was driving a 2006 Ford Expedition when he collided at
an intersection with 30 - year - old Fredia Ann Veitch of Plantation ,
who was driving a 2000 Mitsubishi Montero .
Veitch was ejected from the car , police said .
She died at
Broward General Medical Center , Collins said .
Witnesses told police Leyritz had a red light .
Officers on the
scene observed Leyritz to have red , watery eyes , a flushed face and
an odor of alcohol , police said .
Leyritz was told Veitch had died and he was asked to submit to a
blood test , police said .
" After he refused , Leyritz was informed that blood would be
taken above his refusal , " the police statement said .
On Sunday , Leyritz 's attorney , Jeffrey M. Ostrow , released the following statement .
" Due to the tragic and unfortunate events of December 28 , 2007 , Mr. Leyritz and his family wish to express their deepest sympathies and condolences to the Veitch and O'Keefe families . "
Veitch , who left a husband and two children , was a bartender at a Fort Lauderdale steakhouse .
She was working her last week on the late shift and planned to scale back her hours to spend more time with her family , the Miami Herald reported .
" She was definitely family - oriented and a hard worker , " Jeff Brown , her manager at the steakhouse , told the Herald .
" When she was off , she would go to the beach with her little boy and then bring him in here for lunch . "
She was not wearing a seat belt , police said , according to the Sun-Sentinel .
Leyritz bounced from team to team over his career , which ended in 2000 with the Los Angeles Dodgers .
But he built a reputation as a clutch postseason hitter .
With the New York Yankees trailing the Atlanta Braves 2 - 1 in the 1996 World Series , Leyritz hit a three - run homer in the eighth inning to tie Game 4 at Atlanta .
New York won the game and the series , starting a run of four championships in five seasons .
He played an even bigger role for the San Diego Padres in their run to the 1998 World Series , hitting four homers and driving in nine runs in series wins over the Houston Astros in the NLDS and the Braves in the NLCS .
During the 2007 season , Leyritz traveled with the Yankees as a beat reporter for 1050 ESPN New York .
Leyritz , who signed with the Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1985 , played 11 seasons in the major leagues for six teams including the Yankees , Angels , Rangers , Red Sox , Padres and Dodgers .
He was a career .264 hitter with 90 home runs and 387 RBIs in 903 career games , primarily as a catcher and infielder .

This pill can add years to your life
September 11 , 2007 14:54 IST
Vitamin D is definitely good for health , doctors have said for years , but a new study has revealed that taking a pill of the organic compound everyday could help you live longer .
Scientists in Europe came to the conclusion after they recently carried out a study on 57,000 people , the results of which have been published in Archives of Internal Medicine journal on Tuesday .
' The intake of ordinary doses of Vitamin D supplements seems to be associated with decreases in total mortality rates .
Interventions effectively strengthening
Vit D status should result in reduced total mortality , ' they reported .
In their research , the scientists analysed the results of Vit D supplements taken by 57,000 people during 18 separate trials and found that those who took pills regularly were less likely to die over the six - year period .
Most of the participants in the trial were ' frail ' elders with low blood levels of Vitamin D , the scientists -- Philippe Autier from International Agency of Research on Cancer in Lyon ( France [ Images ] ) and Sara Gandini from the European Institute of Oncology in Milan ( Italy [ Images ] ) wrote .
Vitamin D is a fat - soluble compound which acts like a hormone , regulating the formation of bone and absorption of calcium and phosphorous from the intestine .
It also helps to control the movement of calcium between bone and blood and vice - versa .
The vitamin is produced naturally in the body through exposure to sunlight and is also found in salmon , tuna and other oily fish , and routinely added to milk .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in a U.S. television interview on Sunday that Iran did not need nuclear weapons and his country was not heading for war with the United States .
Ahmadinejad was speaking before traveling to New York for the U.N. General Assembly .
Plans for him to speak at New York ’s Columbia University have drawn protests from some who say the university should not give a platform to a Holocaust denier accused by Washington of supporting terrorism .
Asked whether Iran ’s goal was to obtain a nuclear bomb , Ahmadinejad told the CBS program “ 60 Minutes ” that the answer was a “ firm no . ”
“ You have to appreciate we do n’t need a nuclear bomb .
We do n’t need that .
What need do we have for a bomb ? ” he said in the interview , recorded on Thursday in Tehran .
The United States accuses Iran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of its civil nuclear program .
Iran denies both allegations .
Asked whether Iran and the United States were heading toward conflict over Tehran ’s nuclear ambitions , he said : “ It ’s wrong to think that Iran and the U.S. are walking toward war .
Who says so ?
Why should we go to war ?
There is no war in the offing . ”
In an interview with Al Jazeera television the head of U.S. Central Command , Adm. William Fallon , also seemed keen to tone down the rhetoric .
Asked if a war was on the cards , Fallon said : “ No . I certainly hope not ...
This constant drumbeat of conflict strikes me as not helpful and not useful . ”

Fallon ’s remarks to Al Jazeera were dubbed into Arabic .
Officials of the five permanent U.N. Security Council members and Germany met on Friday for what they called “ serious and constructive ” talks about new Security Council sanctions aimed at trying to force Iran to halt its uranium enrichment activities .
Ahmadinejad , who arrived in New York on Sunday for the U.N. General Assembly , reiterated Iran ’s position that its nuclear program is purely peaceful .
“ Our plan and program is very transparent .
In political relations right now , the nuclear bomb is of no use .
If it was useful , it would have prevented the downfall of the Soviet Union .
If it was useful , it would have resolved the problem the Americans have in Iraq .
“ The time of the bomb is passed , ” he told “ 60 Minutes . ”
Ahmadinejad also took issue with U.S. charges that Iran supports militants in Iraq , providing weapons and training , saying : “ We do n’t need to do that . ”
Asked whether he was denying that Iran supplied weapons to militants in Iraq , he avoided a clear answer .
“ It ’s very clear the situation .
The insecurity in Iraq is detrimental to our interests , ” he said .
Ahmadinejad , who has called for Israel to be wiped off the map , was denied a request to visit the World Trade Center site of the September 11 attacks .
He said in the CBS interview he would try to visit Ground Zero “ if we have the time and the conditions are conducive . ”
But he said he would not insist if conditions were not right .
In 2002 , Bush labeled Iran as part of an “ axis of evil ” that also included Iraq and North Korea and has accused it of backing international terrorist groups .

A rightwing Dutch MP said yesterday that he was making a film to highlight what he calls " fascist " passages in the Qur'an , in his latest high - profile criticism of Islam .
The interior and justice ministers expressed concern but said they had no authority to stop Geert Wilders screening his film .
Wilders plans to depict parts of the Qur'an he says are used as inspiration " by bad people to do bad things " .
Less than 10 minutes long , the film is expected to be shown in late January .
It will show " the intolerant and fascist character of the Qur'an " , said Wilders , whose anti-Islam campaign helped his Freedom party win nine seats in parliament in last year 's election .
In the past , Wilders has compared the Qur'an to Adolf Hitler 's book Mein Kampf .
He has claimed the Netherlands is being swamped by a " tsunami " of Islamic immigrants .
In 2004 a film director , Theo van Gogh , had his throat slit by an Islamist after his film Submission portrayed abused Muslim women with Qur'anic texts written on their near - naked flesh .
Ayaan Hirsi Ali , who wrote the screenplay , was threatened in a note left on Van Gogh 's body .
A justice ministry spokesman , Wim van der Weegen , said the government was " taking measures " before the broadcast .
Wilders said he was not afraid of reprisals .
" I have lived with 24 - hour protection for three years , " he said .
" I will make the film and see what reaction it creates . "

Wounded soldiers asked to return signing bonuses
When Jordan Fox was serving in Iraq , his mother helped organize Operation Pittsburgh Pride , which sends thousands of care packages to U.S. troops from his hometown , which prompted a personal “ thank you ” from the White House .
When Fox was seriously injured in Iraq , the president sent what appeared to be personal note , expressing his concerns to the Fox family .
But more recently , Fox received a different piece of correspondence from the Bush administration .
The U.S. Military is demanding that thousands of wounded service personnel give back signing bonuses because they are unable to serve out their commitments .
To get people to sign up , the military gives enlistment bonuses up to $ 30,000 in some cases .
Now men and women who have lost arms , legs , eyesight , hearing and can no longer serve are being ordered to pay some of that money back .
I watched the report from the CBS affiliate in Pittsburgh , and I kept thinking , “ This ca n’t be right . ”
Apparently , it is .
In Jordan Fox ’s case , he was seriously injured when a roadside bomb blew up his vehicle , causing back injuries and blindness in his right eye .
He was sent home , unable to complete the final three months of his military commitment .
Last week , the Pentagon sent him a bill :
Fox owed the government nearly $ 3,000 of his signing bonus .
“ I tried to do my best and serve my country .
I was unfortunately hurt in the process .
Now they ’re telling me they want their money back , ” Fox said .
Look , if a soldier signed a contract , collected a signing bonus , and then quit , I can understand the military asking for the signing bonus back .
But we ’re talking about troops who volunteered , served , and were seriously injured .
It ’s not their fault they got hurt .
How on earth is the Pentagon justified in asking for a refund ?
In Jordan Fox ’s case , he does n’t have $ 3,000 lying around to give the government , and his injuries are such that he had to give up on his goal of becoming a police officer .
For what it ’s worth , Fox ’s congressman , Democrat Jason Altmire , has introduced a bill to prohibit the Bush administration from asking the troops for refunds .
Mr. Altmire , D - McCandless , held a news conference yesterday at the Ross municipal building with Spc. Kaminski and other veterans to tout legislation he has authored to aid wounded soldiers .
At the forefront was a bill introduced last week and sent to committee that targets a Defense Department policy preventing eligible soldiers from receiving their full bonuses if discharged early because of combat - related injuries .
“ Hard as it may be to believe , the Department of Defense has been denying injured servicemen and women the bonuses that they qualified for , ” Mr. Altmire said .
He said he drafted the legislation after hearing “ outrageous ” examples of bonuses being denied ….
Mr. Altmire ’s legislation , the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act , would require the Defense Department to pay bonuses in full within 30 days to veterans discharged because of combat - related wounds .
Seems like a no - brainer .
Partner : Glad to see you !
It 's been a crazy day .
Can I leave you a couple of patients ?
Great !
In bed 5 is a lady from some nursing home who has COPD .
She just got here by ambulance , and I started on her , but the nurses pulled me to 10 for the cardiac arrest .
I 'll finish the paperwork because we could n't get him back .
No family , not that we 've seen yet .
He was on the golf course when it happened , and his driver 's license is out - of - state .
Oh , bed 5 , well , she may have pneumonia , but I 'm not sure yet because X - ray has n't done her film yet .
And she was in the hospital last week with C. diff .
She 's vomiting now but no chest pain .
Her family says her internist is out of town , so if you admit her she 'll go to the hospitalist .
Anyway , bed 19 is psychotic , or hyponatremic , but she 's 88 years old and hallucinating and weak .
Labs are n't back yet .
Cool ?
Great , I 'll finish the death certificate on 5 .
I mean 10 .
Five is n't dead yet , I hope !
By the way , I have n't been to 18 yet .
He has cellulitis , the nurses tell me .
Could n't get in there and finish up everything else .
Nurse 1 : Doc , listen , the kid in 12 just got here , and he 's 18 months and puking , and seems a little short of breath to me .
He was in the hospital last week with something ; vomiting and diarrhea , I guess .
His pediatrician called , and probably he 'll be admitted , but he wanted you to check the kid out first .
He 's pretty dry .
Mind if I slip a line in and order a nebulizer ?
Nurse 2 : Hey , bed 5 is more short of breath , and needs another neb .
And her sodium is 110 .
Fine , I 'll give her a small saline bolus .
You 're coming now , right ?
Nurse 1 : You need to see the kid , do n't forget , but I 'll get the line in and start the fluid .
Charge nurse : Help !
We 're pretty full , and we can't get the supervisor to assign beds .
Will you talk to her ?
And there 's a lady on the phone who was here last night , and she 's mad about the antibiotic she got because it costs too much .
And she says you or somebody was rude to her .
I tried , but she wants to talk to you !
Oh , she 's allergic to almost everything , but takes about 12 meds every day .
Nurse 3 : I know you 're busy , but in 15 there 's a guy with a kidney stone .
He 's allergic to morphine , but he can take Demerol .
Can I give him something till you get there ?
I know him .
He was here a few days ago with a stone .
Or maybe with pyelo , I can't remember .
But it was real .
Thanks !
I 'll tell him you 're on the way .
Partner : All done .
I 'm out of here .
I guess the coroner will contact that guy 's family .
Thanks !
Medic , on radio : Doc , this is a 16 - year - old girl with abdominal pain and a missed period .
She 's a little shocky , so I started some fluid .
She has n't had any pain meds , so we 're coming lights and sirens .
If her pressure gets up , can I give her some morphine ?
She 's allergic to Demerol .
Great .
Medic 3 clear .
Registration clerk :
The wife of the cardiac arrest patient is here .
She thinks he's had a heart attack , and wants to see him .
The supervisor said to put her in the conference room .
Can you talk to her ?
Nurse 1 : Hey , there 's a lady looking around for her husband , and I think he 's the arrest .
You need to talk to her now .
Nurse 2 : Listen , that sodium was n't on bed 5 ; it was on bed 19 .
Bed 5 got more short of breath after the fluid you ordered .
Yeah , I know you got the wrong labs .
Sorry .
I 'm afraid she 's getting wet .
You want to check her ?
Nurse 3 : I 'm covering the sick child .
His dad is really mad that you have n't seen him yet .
Can you come for a minute ?
Medic , rolling through door : Doc , I need you here right now .
This girl with the belly ?
She crashed at the door .
Pale , diaphoretic , unconscious .
I need you !
Looks like she 's having some vaginal bleeding !
Nurse 3 , in resuscitation room : Boss , chest pain just hit the door in 11 !
Looks pretty real .
I know you 're tied up , but as soon as you can get here , I need you .
Wow !
This one looks sick .
You need surgery or something ?
Nurse 2 : That baby is sicker .
He 's struggling .
We called his doc because you 're busy , but he says for you to see him because he 's got office still , and is n't actually on call .
Nurse 4 : The lady in 18 with the cellulitis !
She 's seizing !
Oh , yeah , the lady in 19 is seizing .
You want her to have some saline ?
I guess it 's because her sodium is 110 .
The guy with the cellulitis wants to sign out ; he says he 's waited too long .
I 'll tell him you 're otherwise engaged , OK ?
Well , sure , I 'll try to stall him till you get here .
Charge nurse :
You need to go to 5 .
She needs to be intubated .
But she may have a DNR .
Nobody knows for sure .
I have a phone number for her son in Phoenix .
Want to talk to him ?
We need you to talk to him if she 's a true no code .
And there 's a new patient from a minor MVC in room 8 .
But I think he has a bad ankle .
We ordered an x-ray .
Can I give some pain medicine ?
He 's allergic to morphine and Demerol but not Dilaudid .
Unit secretary :
You want an EKG in 11 ?
The tech is here , but needs you to give a verbal .
She wo n't believe me , and the guy is n't in the computer .
Fine !
You do n't have to yell !
Sure , I 'll get gyn for you .
Nurse 2 : Hey , the wife of bed 10 just walked in and saw her dead husband .
Did you ever talk to her ?
She passed out on the floor .
She 's pretty cool and clammy .
I 'm starting a line .
Her daughter is on the phone and is really upset .
Nurse 4 : Kidney stone in 15 is having hives all over after the Demerol .
He says maybe it was Dilaudid he was allergic to .
His pain is still a 10 .
How about some Benadryl ?
Nurse 3 : About your chest pain in 11 , I know you 're busy , but you need to come in here .
He has tombstones all over his EKG .
“ No sir , I do n't mean you need a tombstone .
It 's just an expression about your … just a minute ! ”
Go see him , chop , chop !
Secretary : Gyn is tied up in surgery .
They want to know about the pregnancy test .
You put it in , but it 's not back .
They say to call general surgery if you need someone right now .
What ?
Cardiology ?
I 'll get them now .
Nurse 2 : Stool is heme negative in 5 .
Also , incidentally in 12 , the dad seems better now that you went in .
I 'll get a bed for him on peds if you want .
He still looks pukey .
Turns out he had Rotavirus recently , but was a really early preemie .
Oh , his sodium is 155 , and his CO 2 is 12 .
Another bolus ?
Sure .
Nurse 3 : I 'll get the TNK after you do the rectal .
No , I did n't check stool .
That was another patient that was heme negative , I guess .
By the way , can this guy have some Stadol while we start the nitroglycerine ?
He 's allergic to morphine , Demerol , and Dilaudid .
Oh , and he's on Coumadin ; you knew that , right ?
Altogether ( it seems ) :
He has chest pain , she has vomiting , she 's seizing , he 's struggling , she 's dying , he 's dead , they do n't want anything done , they want everything done !
Everyone 's white count is 15 .
More abdominal pain , more syncope .
Angry lady on the phone .
Angry consultant on the phone .
No beds , no time , no history , no information .
Hurry to the next one , hurry to the last one .
No one else can help , no one else is available .
Surgeon is in surgery , family is in conference room , wrong allergy list , wrong medicine ordered on computer , pharmacist says he filled 200 Lortab yesterday !
Daughter on the phone , son on the phone , wife on the phone … your wife , I mean !
Kidney stone still hurts , hospitalist says do n't get a bed yet , he may send her home .
Child looks terrible , may need to be intubated .
Dead man 's wife needs to talk .
Depressed man needs psychiatric help .
MI has v-fib , so hurry !
Doctor to room 10 stat , doctor to room 9 stat , doctor to phone stat , doctor to EMS radio stat .
Multi-trauma to room 13 , fall from height to room 7 , ortho wants you to check on a patient , family doc wants you to pronounce one dead , urgent care sending you an asthma , student health sending you what may be malaria , wife still holding on the phone .

Weighing the evidence for and dating of Solanum virus outbreaks in early Egypt
Hierakonpolis is a site famous for its many " firsts , " so many , in fact , it is not easy to keep track of them all .
So we are grateful ( ? ) to Max Brooks for bringing to our attention that the site can also claim the title to the earliest recorded zombie attack in history .
In his magisterial tome , The Zombie Survival Guide ( 2003 ) , he informs us that in 1892 , a British dig at Hierakonpolis unearthed a nondescript tomb containing a partially decomposed body , whose brain had been infected with the virus ( Solanum ) that turns people into zombies .
In addition , thousands of scratch marks adorned every surface of the tomb , as if the corpse had tried to claw its way out !
[ Editor 's note : click here for an interview with Max Brooks and a timeline of archaeologically documented zombie outbreaks . ]
With the records available to us ( Mr. Brooks obviously has access to others ) , the British dig can be identified as that conducted by Mssr. Somers Clarke and J.J.
Tylor , during which they cleared the decorated tombs of Ny - ankh - pepy ( Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom ) and Horemkhawef ( Second Intermediate Period ) on Old Kingdom hill .
The notes of Tylor are lost to us , but Clarke 's are preserved in the Griffith Institute , Oxford .
Unusually cryptic in his discussion , he makes no mention of such a momentous discovery .
Thus we can only infer that the tomb in question is one of those in the adjoining courtyard , and just a short distance from the underground chamber we examined in 2006 ( see Hierakonpolis 2006 : Adventures Underground ) .
The tomb in question may indeed be the one we use a cozy and sheltered spot to take our lunch while working on the Fort , as its plastered , but unpainted walls are indeed covered with innumerable scratch marks that defy photography .
If is the case , we might quibble -- purely for the sake of scientific accuracy -- that the 3000 B.C. date ascribed for the attack should be revised downward to the Old Kingdom , but its premier historical position remains unaffected .
[ Editor 's note : this proposed re-dating , if accepted , necessitates a revision of Brooks 's zombie - attack timeline . ]

On the other hand , in support of the earlier date , some have claimed that the famous Palette of Narmer ( ca. 3000 B.C. ) , also from Hierakonpolis , far from recording a victory in the war of unification of Upper and Lower Egypt , is instead a celebration of the successful repulse of a zombie attack .
Although we tend to focus on the verso where the king is shown smiting a kneeling enemy , it is the other side that is actually the front .
It is the side with the depression for mixing the cosmetics for adorning the cult statue , and so it would seem that the scene of the king marching in procession to view a pile of decapitated bodies is the really important message .
Nevertheless , while this scene may be evidence for zombie activity , reliance solely on pictorial records for such claims is scientifically questionable at best .
There may be more to this in that Narmer 's name means catfish - chisel , which sounds strange , and a catfish and chisel appear on the palette .
But this could make sense if the palette refers to a victory over zombie forces .
Perhaps Narmer wielded a large Nile catfish , Clarias ? , grasping the tail and using it as a sort of black jack to stun the zombies , then removed their heads with a chisel .
While it is an attractive idea , no serious archaeologist would hang their fedora on it without further evidence .
Recent work at Hierakonpolis has , however , revealed compelling evidence that zombies may have been problematic already in Predynastic Egypt ( ca. 3500 B.C. ) .
Because this work has been undertaken with the most modern techniques , there is also the potential to uncover the hard scientific facts to illuminate the matter fully .
From the very beginning of Predynastic research , Sir W.M. Flinders Petrie reported several headless , but seemingly intact , burials during his famous excavations at Naqada in 1895 .
Further excavations at Gerzeh and other sites revealed more of these curious burials , but no satisfactory explanation could be proposed at the time .
More recently , excavations in the non-elite cemetery at Hierakonpolis ( HK43 ) , undertaken from 1996 to 2004 , have uncovered more of these strange headless burials in addition to 21 individuals whose cervical vertebrae bear cut marks indicative of complete decapitation .
The individuals include men and women ranging in age from 16 to 65 .
The number and the standard position of the cut marks ( usually on the second - fourth cervical vertebrae ; always from the front ) indicate an effort far greater than that needed simply to cause the death of a normal ( uninfected ) person .
The standard position also indicates these are not injuries sustained during normal warfare .
Overall , those with cut marks represent less than 4 % of the cemetery 's population .
Thus , one might suggest that the threat of zombification was relatively low , and those manifesting the disease were dealt with swiftly ( though in some cemeteries evidence for cannibalism has also been found suggesting that one or two got a good meal first ) .
Of course , if left unchecked , the virus could rage fiercely and it may have been the need for decisive and brave action that was the impetus that led to the development of early kingship in Egypt and at Hierakonpolis in the first place .
( Perhaps a careful review of excavation records and skeletal remains from early Mesopotamian city - states is in order . )
While currently this might seem a speculative theory for state formation , the fine preservation of the brains rattling around in the skulls of some of the cut folks does provide the potential for scientific verification .
We are currently seeking funding for a major research project to determine if remnants of the virus can be distilled from the preserved brain matter and , of course , more importantly , whether this virus is still viable .
If so , it may allow for a vaccination to be developed so that this scourge , which seems to have threatened mankind for even longer than we previously imagined , can finally be put to rest .
Little is known about how long the virus can lay dormant , thus it is possible that another outbreak could occur at any time -- given its history , especially at Hierakonpolis .
With this potential in mind , we asked Tom Flanigan , zombie eradication expert for the U.S. Forestry Service , to draw up a contingency plan for us -- see his report below .
However , we stress that nothing amiss has been observed during any of our recent excavations ( though the number of missing heads is a bit curious ) .

The threat will most likely come from local population centers , most probably those working on the excavation .
The physical anthropologists are obviously the most exposed to the potential of infection .

Solanum Outbreak Contingency Plan
by Tom Flanigan
A contingency plan for a Solanum outbreak at Hierakonpolis
When we think of zombies , our thoughts turn to the ghouls from Hollywood movies .
Some of us with a background in anthropology may first think of Wade Davis ' groundbreaking work in Haiti .
Davis purported to discover that zombies were indeed real , and were the work of " Bokor " Voodoo sorcerers using a powder derived from fish toxins called poud zombie ( Davis 1988 : 1715 ) .
Davis ' zombies were not truly reanimated dead bodies , but people put into a death - like coma .
When the person regained consciousness they were made to be slaves in remote villages .
However here we are concerned with real zombies , reanimated bodies of the recent dead who are driven by an urge to consume living people , in turn , creating more zombies .
The idea that zombies are supernatural beings needs to be discarded .
They are not the Spawn of Hell , although , they certainly look the part .
They are , or were , people who were infected by the Solanum virus .
The virus creates a zombie by eating away the frontal lobe of the brain for replication , thus destroying it .
The virus mutates the brain and allows the brain to remain alive but dormant and without the need for oxygen .
Once the mutation is complete , approximately 23 hours from infection to fully functioning zombie , the ghoul will be on the unending search for living human flesh , thus spreading the infection ( Brooks 2003 : 2 ) .
What to do in the event of an outbreak
While the history of the Hierakonpolis outbreak ( or outbreaks ) is certainly educational , it provides us with enough information to know that the potential exists for another one .
Great care must be taken during any tomb excavation and when dealing with human remains .
A little mummy dust in an open wound or scratch could have you driving the Devil 's Cadillac in the fast lane all the way to Zombie - town .
Assuming the virus is unleashed , your first thought might be that you will be dealing with throngs of the ancient Egyptians .
This is not the problem .
Remember , that Solanum does not reanimate the already dead , it kills living beings and reanimates them into flesh eaters .
The threat will therefore come from local population centers , and most likely the Hierakonpolis team itself .
There are two ways to stop a zombie .
The first is simply to wait out the outbreak for a number of years until the living dead have decomposed to a level that they no longer present a threat .
The second is the head shot .
You have to disconnect what is left of the brain from the body .
Given the tools on hand at Hierakonpolis this will likely be done with trowels ( Marshalltown recommended ) , but shovels have also been shown to be effective .
Almost certainly the first sign of infection will come from the Hierakonpolis team .
I would surmise that the most likely hosts will be physical anthropologists working in the lab environment due to their continued exposure to human remains and that good old fashioned " mummy dust " we are all familiar with .
The unfortunate side effect of the infection starting within this specialized group of researchers is that they are generally the least squeamish about decapitation duty .
I know for a fact that Sean Dougherty , a physical anthropologist with extensive experience at the site , would n't hesitate to lop off the head of any member of the team at any time , and for any reason .
As morbid and disturbing as it sounds , guys like Sean can be a real asset in this type of situation .
However , should these experts be unavailable , or have already succumbed , it might be time to consider barricades .
The Hoffman House has a number of rooms that could easily be secured against zombie intrusion .
Just make sure the room is ghoul - free prior to barricading yourself in it .
Treat the outbreak as you would any other natural disaster .
Have a contingency plan for food , water , and other necessities , and be prepared to be self sufficient .
The fact that the Hoffman House has an existing wall around it with a locking metal gate , a water system , solar power , fruit - bearing trees , and a vegetable garden , puts you in a great position to survive .
In fact , the house is situated so well , tactically speaking , it is hard to imagine that the original architect was unaware of the potential of the house as a defensive position in the event that the dead would rise again .
This may seem absurd , but you wo n't think its funny when you are feasting on the corpses of your friends and fellow researchers , in fact , you wo n't be thinking at all .

This has to be the coolest piece of machinery I ’ve seen all month .
Straight out of a sci - fi movie :
The WD - 2 robot is a mechanized face that can morph its shape to fit nearly any facial structure ( Video included ) .
Paired with a facial projector , this robot can look like almost
Created by researchers at the Takanishi Lab ( Tokyo University ) , WD - 2 has 27 control points for movement ( see illustration on their site ) .
The face itself is made from a material called Septom , that contains added steel - wool for extra strength .
Truly amazing to watch it transform .
Their idea is then to project a face onto the mask ( second video ) which they pull off excellently .
It ’s funny for me because that ’s exactly how my concept design was for CADIA ’s Superhumanoid :
A virtual humanoid with a blank face , his actual expressions projected onto his face via an attached projector ( follow the link to the lab to see an image ) .
In any case , I give Takanishi Labs a hat tip , because they pulled that concept off really well .

PARIS , Dec. 4  The International Atomic Energy Agency on Tuesday publicly embraced the new American intelligence assessment stating that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons effort , but in truth the agency is taking a more cautious approach in drawing conclusions about Iran ’s nuclear program .
“ To be frank , we are more skeptical , ” a senior official close to the agency said .
“ We do n’t buy the American analysis 100 percent .
We are not that generous with Iran . ”
The official called the American assertion that Iran had “ halted ” its weapons program in 2003 “ somewhat surprising . ”
That the nuclear watchdog agency based in Vienna is sounding a somewhat tougher line than the Bush administration is surprising , given that the administration has long criticized it for not pressuring Iran hard enough to curb its nuclear program .
Display of Statistical Data
There are three kinds of lies : lies , damned lies and statistics .
- Twain attributed this to B. Disraeli
- It has long recognized by public men of all kinds ... that statistics come under the head of lying , and that no lie is so false or inconclusive as that which is based on statistics .
- H. Belloc
- Figures do n't lie , but liars figure .
- Samuel Clemens ( alias Mark Twain )
- If your experiment needs statistics , you ought to have done a better experiment - Ernest Rutherford
This is the best of times and the worst of times : both the power and corruption of statistics are daily on display .
This is not new : Darrell Huff 's book How to Lie with Statistics ( Norton , 1954 ) attempted to expose the tricks of the statistical spin-doctors for the " self - defense " of " honest men " .
In 1883 ( Life on the Mississippi p.120 ) , with tongue firmly in check , Mark Twain wrote :
There is something fascinating about science .
One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact
Since the eye is a " fat pipe " to the mind , that is , since a great deal of ( mis ) information can be quickly communicated visually , the ( im ) proper display of statistics offers a fast track to selling ideas , and potentially to lying with statistics .
Thus I see the greatest abuse of statistics when I see them graphically displayed .
( Nevertheless the majority of the book How to Lie with Statistics deals with non-visual distortions of statistical data . )
These pages assume that your aim is simple and accurate display of statistical information mostly for yourself ( as part of doing experiments ) , but perhaps also for your scientific peers .
Illustrators working in public relations or for a general readership publication like USA Today often have different aims and audiences in mind .
My bias for display is plain and simple , which conveniently matches what is easy to make , what is part of the standard scientific visual vocabulary , and what journals are willing to publish .
Do not be mislead : Simplificy is not a foolproof tonic against distortion ( in fact many striking optical illusions are quite simple ) , and " standard practice " has hidden many important phenomenon .
For a much more complete discussion of visual display see the works of Edward R. Tufte or , for example , Elements of Graph Design by S. Kosslyn .
Everything should be made as simple as possible , but not simpler
Albert Einstein
Statistics Display : Simple and Accurate Please !
With production of nice drawing programs like Adobe Illustrator , we can all make diagrams similar to those in chapter 6 of How to Lie with Statistics :
Presumably this graph shows that there were a bit more than 10 frogs in May and something like 40 frogs in September .
However , because the frog picture is not regular ( and lacks clear and distinct start and stop points ) it is impossible to read precise values from the chart .
( My best measurement on this chart finds 11.6 frogs in May and 38.2 frogs in September . )
At face value the chart suggests that frogs were simply bigger in September than in May ...
The title may correct that false impression , but still leave the impression of a much bigger change .
The frog on the right is about 3 × longer and 3 × wider than the frog on the left and hence takes up 32=9 times more area ( and presumably the eye judges 33= 27 times more mass and volume ) .
Thus this sort of diagram leaves the viewer with a distorted view of the actual data : a change much larger than a factor of 3 .
We can be a bit more accurate with a " stacked - frog " plot :
Now it is clear that there were something like 3 times more frogs in September than in May .
Of course , it is unlikely to have been exactly 3 times more frogs ... a confusing fractional frog will generally be required .
If your aim is accuracy rather than art , your proper display choice here is an old fashion bar chart :
The purpose of a bar is to put the raw numbers into perspective .
This purpose is thwarted if a truncated scale is used :
Truncated scales are the topic of chapter 5 in How to Lie with Statistics .
I believe it is never fair to use truncated scales on bar graphs .
On the other hand , sometimes you will feel that a small change is significant and that accurate display of the statistic requires clearly displaying the change .
( Examples : A small increase -- say 5 % -- in the volume of the oceans would mean an almost total loss of important coastal regions .
A small decrease in species -- say 5 % in a decade -- extrapolates to a major extinction event over a century . )
If you feel you must use a truncated scale , consider using a line graph , where truncated scales are more expected .
However , any use of truncated scales leaves you open to the charge of trying to Lie with Statistics .
Huff cites with approval
Time magazine 's use of both types of graphs in ambiguous cases .
I have no idea how the frog populations were determined .
It is possible that this was done by complete enumeration , for example , by draining the pond and counting each and every frog .
In this case the values are precise .
However , it is also possible that the frog populations were estimated for example by re-capture ratios .
Estimated populations have standard uncertainties ( a.k.a. errors ) which should be displayed with an error bar .
Note that there really is n't a standard meaning for the size of an error bar .
Common choices are : 1 ( the range would include about 68 % of normal data ) , 2 which is basically the same as 95 % limits , and 0.674 × which would include 50 % of normal data .
The above may be a population standard deviation or a standard deviation of the mean .
Because of this lack of standard practice it is critical for the text or figure caption to report the meaning of the error bar .
Dilbert invented 3D bar graphs as a joke .
Unfortunately his boss liked them and now we 're stuck with them .
3D bars simply make the data harder to precisely evaluate and easier to distort .
Do n't ever use them ( unless you have a boss as dumb as Dilbert's ) .
Tables of data , while not as immediately comprehensible as graphs , are a precise form statistics display .
Here are a couple of examples of tables from scientific papers :
Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society ( 1999 ) 129 187-205
Ecology ( 1996 ) 77 2302-2311
One of the first things you need to decide in making a table is the number of significant digits to display .
If a value has a known " error " ( e.g. , standard deviation , standard error ) , it is inappropriate to display digits that are well within that error .
For example , the first table reports natural - pollinated seed viability as 76.08±25.39 .
This should have been reported as 76±25 ; the .08 is totally irrelevant if the range of variation is 25 .
( It is almost never useful to report more than 2 significant digits of an " error " . )
If the base number lacks a statistical error , the number of digits reported is often determined by the accuracy of the measurement .
Thus masses measured with an analytical balance might be displayed with more digits than masses measured with a triple beam balance .
Only rarely is it useful to record more than 4 significant digits .
( An astronomical exception : stellar locations are often measured and recorded with extreme precision , say 10 significant digits , because of the importance of unambiguous identification of one object among billions .
I 'm sure each discipline has such exceptional cases . )
One must , of course , report the units of the number .
The second table has a tricky case , generally mean squares ( " MS " ) have units , however because of the magic of the logarithm , the units used in this log - transformed MS actually will not effect the value of the mean square , and it is properly reported without units .
( F , d.f. , and P are all unitless . )
It is rarely useful to report more than 2 significant digits of P values or values less than .0001 ( probabilities that small are certainly dominated by other effects like human blunders in recording data or an assumption of approximate normalcy ) .
The second table often displays more than two significant digits of P as it is trying to follow another rule of table construction : line up the decimal point in vertical columns of related numbers .
The display would have been more effective if the insignificant digits had just been left as blanks .
The first table shows that " ns " ( not significant ) results are still worth reporting .
Note , however , that terms like " not significant " do not have a precise mathematical meaning -- different people and disciplines have adopted different standards .
Be sure to define in the text or table caption what you have adopted as a definition for significant .
Some miscellaneous formatting details :
Note that the table lacks vertical lines , typically is placed at the top or bottom of a page ( it does not interrupt the text ) , has a label ( " Table 1 . " in these cases ) and a caption .
Feel free to include each table and figure on a separate sheet of paper attached to the end of your paper .
Similarly on the web , popping up a separate browser window that just contains tables and figures is a nice option .
Note that readers of scientific papers often look first ( and perhaps only ) at the figures and tables : the information density is usually highest there .
If the tables and figures prove interesting the rest of the text may be browsed for additional nuggets of information .
The upshot of this for you is that many ( most ? ) of your " readers " will judge the value of your paper solely from the tables and figures : you should concentrate your efforts on making these particularly informative and , if possible , understandable with out reading the text .

Dumka , Jharkhand
Mr Rajak has been bringing out the paper for 21 years ( Photos : Prashant Ravi )
Gaurishankar Rajak is a poor , " untouchable " washerman , who barely went to school .
But the sixty - something Dalit from Dumka in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand has published a newspaper every week without fail for the past 21 years , highlighting discrimination against the poor and local corruption .
Mr Rajak 's four - page , handwritten Hindi-news Din Dalit is photocopied 100 times and sold to subscribers or pasted onto Dumka 's main traffic lights , bus stands and roads .
Din Dalit is not just another small town news sheet - the newspaper is registered with India 's Registrar of Newspapers , thanks to the efforts of India 's first Dalit President , KR Narayanan , after Mr Rajak wrote to him .
Since its first edition in October 1986 , Din Dalit has made a difference to the lives of local people , even helping a resident to secure social security from the authorities after his plight was reported in the paper .
' I was hurt '
Mr Rajak says he decided to bring out the newspaper after he was humiliated by local authorities when he took some people to meet them to help enlist them in a government social security scheme .
" I was very hurt .
I approached the local media to highlight the incident but they did not show any interest .
So I decided to go ahead and bring out my own newspaper , " he says .
Over the years , Din Dalit has run stories on diverse subjects like a local scam in the distribution of specially - made cycles for disabled people , and bungling in a government housing scheme and kerosene oil distribution for the poor .
After washing clothes through the week for a living , Mr Rajak concentrates on bringing out the paper by selecting the news , deciding on the editorial page content and headlining the articles on Sundays .
I do n't have money to print the paper
Gaurishankar Rajak
On Monday morning , the editor and his intrepid reporter publish 100 copies of Din Dalit - 50 are bought by regular readers , and some are pasted on the walls .
Some 25 copies go to government departments .
Mr Rajak says he spends 300 to 350 rupees ( about $ 8 ) producing the paper .
His wife is less than impressed with his efforts .
" He just wastes his time and money every week .
I have no idea what he gets by bringing out the paper , " says Lakshmi Devi .
But others in Dumka think highly of Mr Rajak 's paper .
Ashok Khatri , a disabled man , says he received a 2,000 rupee social security grant from the government , only after Din Dalit wrote about him .
' War against corruption '
Rickshaw puller Dhrub Rai says Din Dalit serves a critical social purpose .
" Rajak has simply waged a war against corruption and social evils here , " he says .
Mr Rajak 's four sons also support their father 's unstinting efforts .
" We feel proud when we see people reading and discussing the issues raised in the paper , " says eldest son , Raj Shanker Rajak .
Local people read his paper off the walls in Dumka town
" It has its own dedicated readership who wait for it every week , " he says .
Din Dalit has also begun commenting on larger national issues .
A recent piece by Mr Rajak stressed the need to turn the Line of Control - the de facto border separating the disputed region of Kashmir - into a " line of peace " .
He has also written a drama on the Kashmir problem and sent it to a state - run television channel to make a serial out of it .
He is still waiting for a response .
Mr Rajak 's achievement is considerable when you consider the fact that India 's 180 million Dalits still remain largely neglected by the authorities .
Officially , caste discrimination was outlawed when India gained independence in 1947 .
But Dalits are still often expected to do the most menial jobs .
In many villages , they are also prevented from drinking water from wells used by high - caste Hindus .

The police want to get at encrypted files
The request for the keys is being made under the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) .
Police analysing machines seized during raids on activists ' homes carried out in May have asked for the keys .
The activists could face jail if they do not comply and snub a further formal request to hand over the keys .
Case law
In early November about 30 animal rights activists are understood to have received letters from the Crown Prosecution Service in Hampshire inviting them to provide passwords that will decrypt material held on seized computers .
The letter is the first stage of a process set out under RIPA which governs how the authorities handle requests to examine encrypted material .
Once a request has been issued the authorities can then issue what is known as a Section 49 notice demanding that a person turn the data into an " intelligible " form or , under Section 51 hand over keys .
Although much of RIPA came into force many years ago , the part governing the handing over of keys only passed in to law on 1 October 2007 .
This is why the CPS is only now asking for access to files on the seized machines .
Alongside a S49 notice , the authorities can also issue a Section 54 notice that prevents a person revealing that they are subject to this part of RIPA .
The PCs were seized in raids carried out in May 2007
The activist , who wished to remain anonymous , said that even if others disagreed with animal rights activists the use of the law had grave implications for personal privacy .
" Even if they hate our guts my personal view is that this is a matter where there 's great issues of public interest that should be being talked about , " they said .
The CPS declined to comment on the issuing of the letters and a spokesman said it could not comment on ongoing cases .
If those receiving the letters do not comply with the request or a formal S49 notice they can be imprisoned for up to two years .
Legal row
The section of RIPA that deals with decryption requests was controversial when it was drawn up and debated .
Peers , academics and cryptographers called the proposals " flawed " when invited to comment on them by the Home Office .
Commentators pointed out that sSection III , which is aimed at serious criminals , such as paedophiles and terrorists , is flawed because those involved would much rather serve a few years for refusing to hand over keys than provide them and potentially incriminate themselves .
Others were simply likely to say that they had forgotten the complicated passphrase they used when encrypting material .
Under certain circumstances RIPA allows this to be a plausible defence .
It is very likely , said David Harris , a barrister and technology lawyer , that activists will devise systems that legally circumvented the law .
Mr Harris foresees a time when activist groups prepared encrypted files that people could download to let them plausibly deny they have a key to unlock such data if it is found on their PC .
" These may become prevalent as a result of this case , " he said .
Mr Harris said many people know of products readily available on the web , such as Truecrypt , that hid data and supplied a key to some of it while leaving the rest undetectable to the police .
In the event that there was doubt that a suspect did not possess a key , he said , it was up to the prosecution to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that they could know the passphrase .
" They have quite a hurdle to overcome , " he added

WITNESS : Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar .
ATTORNEY : But could the patient have still been alive , nevertheless ?
WITNESS : Yes , it is possible that he could have been alive and practicing law .
“ You are kidding arent you ? ”
Some really clever windows user , made a funny but sad post on ZDNET ’s forum saying that Linux ca n’t run on any computer without Windows underneath it .
You can read what he says HERE at the forum .
Or you can just read below :
“ Are you saying that this linux can run on a computer without windows underneath it , at all ?
As in , without a boot disk , without any drivers , and without any services ?
That sounds preposterous to me .
If it were true ( and I doubt it ) , then companies would be selling computers without a windows .
This clearly is not happening , so there must be some error in your calculations .
I hope you realise that windows is more than just Office ?
Its a whole system that runs the computer from start to finish , and that is a very difficult thing to acheive .
A lot of people dont realise this .
Microsoft just spent $ 9 billion and many years to create Vista , so it does not sound reasonable that some new alternative could just snap into existence overnight like that .
It would take billions of dollars and a massive effort to achieve .
IBM tried , and spent a huge amount of money developing OS / 2 but could never keep up with Windows .
Apple tried to create their own system for years , but finally gave up recently and moved to Intel and Microsoft .
Its just not possible that a freeware like the Linux could be extended to the point where it runs the entire computer fron start to finish , without using some of the more critical parts of windows .
Not possible .
I think you need to re-examine your assumptions . ”
This is one of the funniest things I ’ve read in some time !
What better way to celebrate the end of the year 's biggest shopping weekend than with 10 things you mercifully did not buy ?
The following gadgets and gimmicks , featured in the Holiday 2007 SkyMall catalog , prove without a doubt that the human race is going straight to Hell :

10 . Chilled Shot Machine - $ 150
When it comes Jäger , I consider myself something of an aficionado , a snob really .
I do n't mind spending a little money to ensure that when I sit down to do shots , each and every one will be chilled to the ideal temperature .
That way I know whether I 'm on my first or my 12th , the experience will be rich and memorable .

9 . Hot Dog Grill and Bun Warmer - $ 50 I understand some specialty kitchen appliances , like ice - cream makers , deep fryers and thin - slicing mandolines .
But do we really need a $ 50 product that simultaneously mimics the microwave and the toaster to prepare a meal that has utterly zero gastronomical value ?
I mean , I want one , but do we really NEED this ?
8. E - Z Chord Kit - $ 42
As a guitarist I 'm offended by this one : instead of sitting down and learning G , C and D , you attach a $ 42 apparatus to your guitar that plays the chords for you .
Even if it is ridiculously easy , how many chicks do you think you 'll score with a handicapable guitar that tells the world you 're not smart enough to do what Toby Keith somehow figured out ?

7. Basho the Sumo Wrestler Table - $ 225 Basho is n't a gadget per se , but a coffee table in the shape of a large , mostly naked Japanese man spread - eagled on the floor kinda screamed Gizmodo to me .
You will be happy to hear that he was crafted of " quality designer resin for display in home or garden . "
That 'll scare away the chipmunks .

6. Freddie Mercury Action Figure - $ 45 I could n't decide whether to laugh or cry when I saw this .
Poor dead Fred , here with ball - jointed neck and articulated shoulders for your bending pleasure .
A motion sensor ( hidden God knows where ) triggers a medley of classic Queen songs .
And I hate to have to tell you , but there 's also a Kurt Cobain figure .
COURTNEY , YOU WHORE !!!

5. Trailer Hitch Stand and Chairs - $ 200 This has to be the funniest photo SkyMall has ever printed .
There 's no way to fake the glee on those tailgaters ' faces .
Mind you , this is not for all sportsfans : each seat has a weight limit of 250 pounds , and seats only come in green or blue .
I feel like red should be mandatory , at least when shipped to Boston or St. Louis .

4. Animated Hitch Critters - $ 25 The only reason not to buy those hitch - stand chairs is that they would keep you from installing a motorized , light - up Hitch Critter .
Is n't it cute how the deer waves " Do n't shoot !
Do n't shoot ! " as he sports an ironic target on his chest ?
Do n't miss the dying fish or the " Duck ! " duck , also with cheery red target .
Man , I just love when my comedy and my killing go hand in hand .

3. 5.0 Digital Binocular Camera - $ 250
There 's nothing terribly wrong with these silly digital - camera binoculars .
In fact , I kinda like the idea of them .
No , what I thought was frightening about this product was SkyMall 's # 1 sales bullet point : " BANNED IN SOME SPORTS ARENAS ! "
Super sweet !
It 'll make you the envy of all your friends , until it 's wrested away from you at the entry gate .

2. Pre-Decorated Christmas Tree - $ 200
So it 's come to this , has it ?
Our lazy society wants to revel in the Christmas spirit , as long as it does n't involve such formerly festive activities as tree trimming ?
I never really thought of " getting into the spirit " as a hassle .
I stand corrected .
And one more thing : if it 's going to come pre-decorated , should n't it at least be pre-decorated by someone with taste ?

1. Alive Elvis Animatronic Robot - $ 300 Devoted Gizmodo readers know that we both worship and fear the animatronic Elvis , though it is without a doubt evidence of a society gone bad .
We only have one final , haunting question : why does the robot King look so much like Rob Schneider ?
Of course , the best way to view this one - way ticket to damnation is all at once , in a big scary SkyMall shopping cart :

Supreme Court expected to rule against Gitmo detainees David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Wednesday December 5 , 2007

The US Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear arguments about whether foreign prisoners held at the US military base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , have a right to challenge their detentions before American judges -- but the high court does n't appear likely to rule in favor of the detainees .
So - called enemy combatants currently in US custody are allowed only military tribunals , trials set forth under the 2006 Military Commissions
Act which prohibit many of rights afforded American citizens in criminal court .
According to CNN Pentagon correspondent Jamie McIntyre , however , the Supreme Court will probably not find the process unconstitutional .
" This case also has an interesting wrinkle , " McIntyre reported .
" Originally the justices said they would n't hear it , then they changed their minds and they are hearing it .
A lot of legal experts think that means they 're unlikely to overturn the Military Commissions
Act that sets out the rules for those prisoners . "
Charles Swift , a former military defense attorney who previously represented an alleged associate of Osama bin Laden , told CNN that detainees wanted to the right to confront their accusers .
" They want to look their accusers in the face , " said Swift .
" They want to be able to say , ' this is what I did . '
They want to have an opportunity to exonerate themselves . "
Military tribunals do not permit the prisoners to have a lawyer present at their trials or guarantee them right to know the evidence against them .
But defenders of the military tribunals say that US - held foreign detainees are n't being deprived of any legal rights .
As reported in the Washington Post , Bush administration lawyers are expected to argue " that the tribunals have afforded suspected enemies all the rights to which they are entitled .
The administration maintains that detainees need not know all of the evidence against them . "
Lawyers representing detainees " plan to argue that the panels violate the U.S. Constitution and international law , " according to the paper .
" They say that the proceedings have not provided Guantanamo Bay detainees with a fair and impartial hearing . "

He argues that detainees can not be held for years without being charged .

Federal officials Monday disclosed a variety of lapses at the San Onofre nuclear power plant near San Clemente , including a worker who falsified records for more than five years to show that operators made hourly fire patrols when they had not .
As a result , the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission ordered Southern California Edison to develop a training program for employees , including ethics courses for managers and contractors as well as classes for plant staff to prevent deliberate misconduct .
Some of the corrective actions must be taken by the end of the month .
The commission , which regulates the nation ’s nuclear power industry , found five violations of federal regulations at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station during the last year .
San Onofre ’s two reactors produce electricity for about 2.75 million households .
The plant is jointly owned by Edison , San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and the city of Riverside .
Edison owns 75 % of the station .

In addition to falsified records , officials uncovered two security lapses , but would not elaborate on them .
The other violations involved a radiation worker who did not comply with the conditions of a work permit , and a company failure to properly supervise an unqualified technician , whose work led to the temporary shutdown of a safety system .
“ The order contains a comprehensive set of actions designed to improve performance at San Onofre by emphasizing a strong nuclear safety culture , ” said Elmo E. Collins , a regional administrator for agency .
“ The NRC depends on a good - faith effort by power plant workers to follow regulations .
Willful violations by workers cannot be tolerated . ”
In a prepared statement , Edison acknowledged the NRC ’s order and stated that the company was complying with the agency ’s requirements .
Though the actions of plant workers were deliberate , NRC and Edison officials said the five incidents did not represent a significant threat to the safety of San Onofre .
Victor Dricks , an NRC spokesman , said the lapses were what the agency calls “ Level 4 " violations , or the least serious .
Advertisement
“ But I do n’t want to diminish their importance , ” Dricks said .
“ They involve willful misconduct . ”
Nuclear policy experts from Committee to Bridge the Gap and the Union of Concerned Scientists said the persistent fire patrol problems compromised safety at San Onofre and reflected a lack of resolve by the NRC to enforce regulations that protect the public from catastrophic nuclear plant accidents .
They said a hefty fine would have been more appropriate .
The NRC “ always claims there is n’t a high safety risk , ” said Edwin Lyman , a senior staff scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists .
“ But these fabrications went unnoticed by supervisors and managers for 5 1 / 2 years .
This says something about the inadequacy of the NRC ’s inspection process . ”
Commission officials said that a fire protection specialist on the midnight shift from April 2001 to December 2006 falsified records about hourly patrols around the plant to check for fires .
Advertisement
After a year of investigation , the NRC concluded that the specialist had recorded the patrols in plant logs even though they never occurred .
Agency officials said they also were concerned about lapses in supervision during the plant ’s midnight shift .
NRC officials contend , however , that the fabricated records and lack of patrols had little effect on safety because of other fire - protection measures , including water sprinklers , chemical retardants , alarms , a fire department and safety doors that close automatically in an emergency .
But Dan Hirsch , founder of Committee to Bridge the Gap , a nuclear policy group based in Santa Cruz , disputed the NRC ’s contention that the problems were not that important to the plant ’s safety .
“ A major fire at a nuclear reactor could release a thousand times the long - lived radiation of the Hiroshima bomb , ” Hirsch said .
“ Fire protection data is the last thing one should tolerate being fabricated at a nuclear power plant . ”

Hirsch noted that the current violations were the latest of a number of problems at San Onofre .
Earlier this month , NRC inspectors discovered the failure of an emergency generator during three tests in late December .
The diesel generator is one of two that provide electricity to safety systems in the event of a power outage .
Edison officials said the generator failed because of a faulty speed sensor , which was replaced .
Dricks said the agency began investigating the fire patrol fabrications in January 2007 .
The NRC then uncovered the other four violations .
Complete descriptions of those violations were unavailable Monday .
Dricks said the investigation into possible violations at San Onofre was continuing , but he declined to elaborate .
Despite repeated requests , Edison officials declined to comment further on the violations .

NRC officials said that in addition to training for employees , Edison must hire an independent contractor to assess and monitor the effectiveness of the company ’s corrective measures .
Edison is required to have all the corrective measures in place by Sept. 30 .

We all make mistakes and , if you believe medical scholar John Ioannidis , scientists make more than their fair share .
By his calculations , most published research findings are wrong .
Dr. Ioannidis is an epidemiologist who studies research methods at the University of Ioannina School of Medicine in Greece and Tufts University in Medford , Mass .
In a series of influential analytical reports , he has documented how , in thousands of peer - reviewed research papers published every year , there may be so much less than meets the eye .

“ How you doing ? ” Mr. Huckabee said , smiling a toothy grin already labeled so Jim Nabors - like that their names appear in about 600 Google matches .
The child of a farming region where success is built more on regularity and repetition , Mr. Crawford seemed startled by Mr. Huckabee , the embodiment of Big Momentum .
“ Just want to say you got my vote , ” Mr. Crawford said before moving off .
He told a reporter later he was surprised at how “ normal and regular ” Mr. Huckabee seemed .
“ Funny , too . ”
On the campaign trail , Mr. Huckabee is a polished performer who can be funny , endearingly self - deprecating and acute enough to move his audience to tears when he wants .
With a voice that toggles between Tom Bodett ’s comforting sound and Paul Harvey ’s friendly authority , Mr. Huckabee speaks without notes and is never at a loss for a memorable phrase .
( “ We should put wingtips on the ground before we put the boots on the ground , ” he says , describing how he would wage foreign policy .
“ We should be able to tell the Saudis we no more need their oil than we need their sand , ” he says , describing his energy policy . )
But he does not light up a room the way some charismatic politicians , like a Barack Obama , might .
He warms it up .
“ I would say he ’s more personable and congenial than anything else , ” said Howard Taylor , 52 , a community college instructor in West Des Moines .
“ He ’s the candidate who believes certain things the way I do , and for the same reasons I do .
He does n’t have to be electrifying . ”
Somehow , the very lack of magnetism and fieriness has become one of the hallmarks of Mr. Huckabee ’s campaign persona .
He is the social conservative who is “ not mad at anybody , ” the Christian who does not rail against “ happy holiday ” cards issuing from the White House , but just puts on a red sweater and makes a campaign advertisement with “ Silent Night ” playing in the background .
In many ways , Thanksgiving is an un-American holiday .
Consumption seldom goes beyond an excess of turkey and pumpkin pie , and garish displays are limited to a few stupid parades and some of the most mediocre football of the year .
Good old all - American chaos is down — but not entirely out .
Thanksgiving Day Massacre , Reno , 1980
Priscilla Ford had a long history of psychiatric problems and bizarre behavior , marked by such quixotic acts as suing the Mormon Church and attempting to speak at the 1972 Republican Convention .
The capper came on the Thanksgiving afternoon when she got even with the City of Reno .
In front of the downtown casinos , she steered her black 1974 Lincoln onto a crowded sidewalk and mowed down the crowds of holiday gamblers and gambolers .
She left six dead and 23 injured in her wake .
Pulled over a few blocks later , she told police , " Sometimes I am called Jesus Christ . "
She later expressed a fervent hope that she 'd nailed 75 people , and explained the voice of Joan ( Mrs. Edward ) Kennedy had told her to do it .
Nonetheless , she was found legally sane and duly convicted of murder .
Founding of the Ku Klux Klan , Atlanta , 1915
At 35 , failed preacher William Simmons had found his true calling as a fraternal lodge leader .
In addition to commanding five regiments of the Woodmen , he was a heavy in several Masonic orders and a Knight Templar .
But his dream was to have his own personal fraternal organization .
And he wanted more than funny hats and secret handshakes — he wanted to revive the Ku Klux Klan .
His dream came to fruition Thanksgiving Eve when 40 handpicked men gathered to re-launch the Klan .
A group of 15 stalwarts recessed to the top of nearby Stone Mountain for an early morning cross-burning .
Simmons tied his first recruitment drive in with D.W. Griffith 's famous film The Birth of a Nation , which opened in Atlanta the following week .
And the rest , as they say , is history .
The Great Football Fry , San Francisco , 1900
Back in the good old days of Thanksgiving Day football , the hearts and minds of Bay Area football fans were not on dinner , but the day 's " Big Game " between the University of California and Stanford .
The 1900 edition of this classic was , of course , sold out .
The roofs of the buildings surrounding the stadium were crowded with budget - minded fans craning for a glimpse of the action .
Twenty minutes into the game , the roof of one building collapsed .
Unfortunately , the building housed a glass factory , complete with a red - hot furnace filled with molten glass .
Turkeys were n't the only things getting roasted in San Francisco that day .
Twenty - two people were killed and over 80 injured in what remains the worst — and most bizarre — disaster ever to befall American sports fans .
Missionary Massacre , Zimbabwe 1987
Early on Thanksgiving morning , Marxist Zimbabwean rebels descended on two farms run by white Pentecostal missionaries .
What they lacked in Thanksgiving spirit they made up for in their revolutionary zeal .
First they tied up the 16 white missionaries — men , women , and children , including two Americans .
Then , as they gleefully sang revolutionary songs , they hacked their captives to death .
Officials could only describe the resulting carnage as " barbaric . "
Executive Assassination , Cordoba , Argentina , 1973
At the height of the Argentinean urban terrorist fad , a band of 15 young men waylaid John Swint , the general manager of a local Ford subsidiary , on Thanksgiving Day .
The Peronist gunmen , upset with the way President Juan Peron had turned on them , later claimed they 'd only wanted to kidnap the American executive .
But according to witnesses , it was a turkey - shoot from the get - go .
The gunmen immediately started blasting away with shotguns and assault rifles , killing Swint 's bodyguard and chauffeur and critically injuring another bodyguard .
One blond gunner unloaded a quick machine gun blast into Swint 's body at close range — just to be sure .

WASHINGTON — The great 401 ( k ) bonanza may well turn out to be a bust for most workers .
This is not news to millions who know their account balances , or to low - income workers whose employers rarely offer them the chance to open an account .
In the 1980s and , especially , the go - go 1990s , the 401( k ) was the wondrous new invention that was supposed to make assembly - line workers capable of becoming rich , in retirement , through their own industriousness and , lest we forget , the magic of the stock market .
The myth began to fade amid Wall Street ’s uncertainty during the past decade .
It should be buried — deeply — with the latest Government Accountability Office report on the savings plans that have become the primary form of pensions available to that half of the private work force that has any pension at all .
Projecting retirement savings based on those currently participating in 401 ( k ) - style plans , the GAO found that the youngest workers — those who ’ve been told from the start that their jobs would provide no traditional , fixed - benefit pensions of the sort that their grandparents or parents might rely on — face the prospect of paltry incomes in old age .
More than a third of those born in 1990 could be predicted to have no savings at all in retirement , the GAO found .
Among the lowest - income workers , 63 percent would have no savings in their plans when they retire .
What about more diligent savers ?
Overall , the GAO found that as a group these retirees would have an average income of about $ 18,784 a year , or just over $ 1,500 a month .
Among the highest - income workers , a fund balance that is used exclusively for monthly income — not for extravagant extras — would be $ 50,098 a year .
“ Some will have very little , some will have almost nothing , and some will have nothing when they retire , ” says Rep. Robert Andrews , D - N.J. , who chairs the House subcommittee on health , employment , labor and pensions .
Flaws in the very structure of 401 ( k ) plans are at the root of why they do n’t work well .
No employer is required to offer a 401 ( k ) , let alone provide one for every worker .
The GAO found that only a quarter of the lowest - income workers were offered any type of retirement plan .
Among low - wage workers who could save through a 401 ( k ) , only 8 percent chose to participate .
Making enrollment automatic , rather than optional , would particularly help those working for low wages , the report suggested .
Ending workers ’ ability to cash out a 401 ( k ) upon leaving a job , as about half now do , would also help .
The failure of even higher - income people to roll over their retirement savings into another retirement account — “ leakage , ” as the report calls it — is one of the reasons account balances are relatively low at retirement age , even if a worker has earned a solid income .
“ Taking money out of these accounts , or failing to roll them over , is very expensive , ” says Rep. George Miller , D - Calif. , chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor .
Of course , using 401 ( k ) accounts as sort of a tax - preferred slush fund was part of their initial appeal .
Rules allowing workers to cash out a retirement savings plan or to borrow from it were written into the program when it began .
But that was when the savings plans were envisioned as supplements to traditional pensions that guaranteed monthly income in retirement , and not a substitute for them .
“ These are hangovers from another system , ” Miller says .
The blinding headache has not yet settled upon us .
That will come when millions of people — and not just baby boomers — retire to find that their promised pot of gold is close to empty .
If current trends continue , even Social Security will be stretched and strained by a generation of retirees with no other means of support .
This is one reason why the repetitive and misleading political rhetoric on Social Security , the strongest and best - funded part of the nation ’s retirement system , is so unprincipled .
Traditional employer - provided pensions are an endangered species .
The evolution to a self - funded retirement through 401 ( k ) accounts has produced a mutant that does n’t function well .
Democrats , including the party ’s leading presidential candidates , have been arguing for years that the 401 ( k ) must be remade if it is to be a pension , not a piggy bank .
At the moment , they debate only among themselves .
After decades of dropping just a few pennies into the slot , Americans deserve more than to be told to dig deeper for a few more coins .

The Ministry of Justice and two prominent judges have harshly criticized the woman , suggesting that she was engaged in immoral behavior at the time of the attack .
The Justice Ministry published two statements on its Web site in recent days , saying that the woman had confessed to engaging in illicit acts and was undressed in a car before the rape .
Mr. Lahem , her lawyer , denied these accusations and said neither she or her male friend had confessed to any such acts .
The lawyer is now suing the Ministry of Information and Culture for having distributed the Justice Ministry ’s statements to the news media through the state - run Saudi Press Agency .
Human Rights
Watch issued a statement this week insisting that the Justice Ministry “ stop publishing statements aimed at damaging the reputation of a young Saudi rape victim who spoke out publicly about her ordeal and her efforts to find justice . ”
The ministry stopped short of accusing the rape victim of adultery , or zina in Arabic , which could carry the death penalty , for being alone with the man whom she met in his car on the night of the rape in 2006 .
Mr. Lahem has complained that the judges seem to have based their conclusions about the events on the night of the rape on testimony of the seven rapists , who have been sentenced to five to seven years in jail .
Under Islamic law , two people can be accused of adultery only if caught in the act by four male witnesses of good character .
Ibrahim bin Salih al - Khudairi , a judge on the Riyadh Appeals Court , said in an interview in the newspaper Okaz on Nov. 27 that if he had been a judge in the Qatif court , he would have sentenced the woman , her male companion and the seven rapists to death , and that they were lucky not to get the death penalty .
The woman met with an Associated Press reporter in November , before the court ordered her and her lawyer to stop talking to reporters .
Describing the sentence as a “ big shock , ” she said that she had trouble sleeping and that her hands were trembling , The A.P. reported .

At a press conference in the European Parliament yesterday evening foreign journalists openly doubted the statement by Philip Claeys and Koen Dillen , two members of the European Parliament for the Vlaams Belang party ( VB ) , that the Brussels police had told the VB that they would tolerate yesterday ’s anti-Islamization demonstration if it was a peaceful “ static ” protest at Schuman Plaza .
Despite this agreement , the police beat up the peaceful demonstrators in front of the European Commission building .
“ You can tell us whatever you want , but we need proof , ” one of the foreign journalists told Claeys and Dillen .
The proof was given yesterday on Flemish television when reporter Goedele Devroy told a colleague [ video here , in Dutch ] that she was amazed by the brutality of the police against the peaceful demonstrators “ who just stood there . ”
She added : “ This is strange because , when I rang the police this morning , they said that they would tolerate the demonstration if the demonstrators would not use violence and if they just remained put and would not try to march . ”
It looks like a deliberate trap was set up for the demonstrators , who were gathered at Schuman Plaza .
Riot police units from Liege in Wallonia , the French - speaking part of Belgium , maltreated the demonstrators , many of them from Flanders , the Dutch - speaking part of Belgium , in an excessively violent way , picking out the VB leaders for the worst treatment .
This picture shows how Frank Vanhecke , the VB party leader and a member of the European Parliament , was held tight by police officers while one of them pinches him in the balls .
As they did so they shouted abuse such as “ Sale Flamingant ” ( Dirty Flemish - secessionist ) .
Vanhecke ’s hands were tied behind his back , as our video shootage shows , and he was shoved into a police bus .
There the beatings continued .
Yesterday evening , after releasing the VB leader , the Brussels authorities announced that they will press charges against Vanhecke for assaulting the driver of the police bus .
Filip Dewinter , the group leader of the VB in the Flemish Regional Parliament , was also beaten up .
The police dragged him away as he was talking to journalists , a few yards from the demonstration .
Last Monday , Dewinter , a member of the Flemish Parliament , called upon that institution to declare the independence of Flanders from Wallonia .
Also beaten up , probably for the same reason , was Luk Van Nieuwenhuysen , another VB politician and a Deputy Speaker of the Flemish Parliament .
Mr Van Nieuwenhuysen escaped from the beatings in the police bus by pulling open the emergency exit and fleeing .
The Walloon officers also maltreated Mario Borghezio , an Italian member of the European Parliament .
The Italian government has formally complained to the Belgian government about his arrest , protesting against the violation of his parliamentary immunity by the Belgians .
Franco Frattini , the ( Italian ) European Commissioner for Justice , Freedom and Security , is angry , too .
He told the Belgian authorities demonstrations should only be banned when they are violent or glorify Nazism .
Yesterday , the Neo Nazis , which the Brussels authorities had said were coming to Brussels to join the anti-Islamization demonstration , were nowhere to be seen .
This is hardly surprising .
For Neo Nazis the Jews , not the Muslims , are the enemy .
Arthur Jones , a wild - animal enthusiast , filmmaker and entrepreneur whose Nautilus fitness machines helped to transform the fitness industry and the way ordinary people exercise , died on Tuesday at his home in Ocala , Fla .
He was 80 .
Mr. Jones died of natural causes , his son William Edgar Jones said .
Mr. Jones was a rough - and - tumble character who had six wives , a nearly lifelong smoking habit and an affection for exotic animals like rattlesnakes and crocodiles , which he kept at his farm , the younger Mr. Jones said .
He tinkered with exercise equipment for more than 20 years before creating his first Nautilus machine , called the Blue Monster , in the late 1960s .
Mr. Jones presented the equipment at a Mr. America contest in California and started Arthur Jones Productions to sell the equipment .
The company ’s name was later changed to Nautilus , because the cam , or gear , that was crucial to the machine ’s success resembled a nautilus .
Mr. Jones ’ invention led to the “ machine environment ” that is prevalent today in health clubs .
The company grew rapidly , and the machines helped to transform dank gyms filled with free weights and hulking men into fashionable fitness clubs popular with recreational athletes .
Let 's assume for a second that anyone reading this article owns a copy of Crysis or has at least played the game .
Then you should all know how potentially good the game is and how impressive its visuals can be with the proper hardware .
Then again , since its release last November it 's been a minority of players that have been able to play the game from beginning to end in all its visual glory .
Most gamers using high - end rigs have been forced to use a combination of medium and high quality settings , which until this game arrived was quite uncommon .
Going by forum postings and sound offs around the community , there is a large group of PC gamers that immediately planned on upgrades just because Crysis ' graphics could well deserve the extra cost - not to mention newer GeForce and Radeon models brought high - end performance to the mainstream price range .
And while we agree the game looks incredible , the hardware requirements to play it are not only extreme , but somewhat unavailable at this point in time .
Even those fat cats amongst us running SLI GeForce 8800 Ultras cannot escape the jittery gameplay that Crysis can become .
In fact , what has happened is that SLI and Crossfire configurations can actually be slower than using a single graphics card .
Just last week Crytek released a highly awaited first patch for Crysis which weighed in at 139MB and carried a number of rather large promises .
While it was claimed that SLI / Crossfire performance would improve with this patch as well as the overall rendering performance for all graphics cards in DX9 and DX10 , they never stated by how much , so they did dodge a bullet there .
Although most of you will have finished the single - player campaign by now , there is a large number of gamers enjoying Crysis multiplayer action .
So for these gamers the thought of improved rendering performance is very appealing , I am sure .
Furthermore those that have dished out the big bucks for Crossfire and SLI configurations would be mighty keen by now to test them out in Crysis .
So now without keeping you in suspense any longer let ’s see what this 1.1 patch has brought to the table ...

I would like to sincerely thank David Rockefeller , chairman of every internationalist organization you can think of , for coming out and admiting that there is a global conspiracy to unite the world under a one world government .
It gets annoying , you know , constantly explaining this to people , only to receive blank stares or mockery in response .
I ’ve long wished the Establishment ( or “ Illuminati ” if you prefer ) would just come out and admit it .
It ’s not like we ’re in a position to do anything about it anyway .
Well David Rockefeller ( or D - Rock , as his friends in the international finanace ‘ hood call him ) has finally cleared the air :
“ For more than a century , ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well - publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions .
Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States , characterizing my family and me as ‘ internationalists ’ and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure – one world , if you will .
If that is the charge , I stand guilty , and I am proud of it . ” – From Rockefeller ’s “ Memoirs ” , ( p.405 ) .
Uh , yes , that is the charge , Rockie , and what ’s more we charge you with using any and every means at your disposal to accomplish this , including bribery , murder , lying , fraud , coups , mind - control , and , ironically , belligerent nationalism .
He continues with an even more revealing passage :
“ The anti-Rockefeller focus of these otherwise incompatible political positions owes much to Populism .
‘ Populists ’ believe in conspiracies , and one of the most enduring is that a secret group of international bankers and capitalists , and their minions , control the world ’s economy .
Because of my name and prominence as the head of the Chase for many years , I have earned the distinction of ‘ conspirator in chief ’ from some of these people .
“ Populists and isolationists ignore the tangible benefits that have resulted from our active international role during the past half - century .
Not only was the very real threat posed by Soviet Communism overcome , but there have been fundamental improvements in societies around the world , particularly in the United States , as a result of global trade , improved communications , and the heightened interaction of people from different cultures .
Populists rarely mention these positive consequences , nor can they cogently explain how they would have sustained American economic growth and the expansion of our political power without them . ”
You will notice that he does not deny it .
If anything he has confirmed that their is a “ secret group of international bankers and capitalists , and their minions , [ who ] control the world ’s economy ” .
What more is there to say ?
Just this :
Certainly we all appreciate the many benefits of modern capitalism and the technological goodies we ’ve gotten our hands on .
But at what cost ?
Politically , economically and ecologically it ’s a loser for those of us who are n’t moguls .
Who is going to control the one - world government he so fervently desires ?
If past performance is any indication of future performance , we can expect these internationalists to keep all the power to themselves .
Democracy is simply “ incompatible ” with his smooth , orderly , one - world utopia .
The scary thing here is the idea , now realized before our eyes , that not all people who want to conquer the world are madmen .
Some of them , clearly , know exactly what they ’re doing ; they plan decades ahead , carefully lay the groundwork and , with considerable patience , skill and cunning , achieve their goals through whatever methods required .
The whole affair is amazingly complex , but then again , so is collecting stamps , memorizing Tolkein or learning to program in C ++.
I suppose when you ’re the billionaire son of a billionaire you need to have a hobby to keep occupied .
ARM is a British company best known for designing chips for cellphones and licensing them to semiconductor companies .
The company ’s technology is the most widely used in cellphones , though any company implementing the technology modifies it however it deems best .
But now a new effort is under way to exploit this chip technology by creating a standard layer of software .
The collaboration was announced at the fourth annual ARM Developers ’
Conference being held this week in Santa Clara , California .
The idea is to address the rise in consumer demand for Internet access and advanced applications on cellphones .
The seven companies are ARM , Samsung , Texas Instruments , Mozilla , Marvell , MontaVista , and Movial .
The new standard chosen : a Linux - based open source platform to be designed for next - generation mobile applications .
By releasing the new platform into the open source community , the hope is that the collaboration will allow for a faster release of products and technologies with enhanced capabilities for video , graphics , and Internet .
The Wall Street Journal ( subscription required ) picked up the story and explained that the plans “ … will make it easier to develop cellphones and other mobile devices with iPhone - like sophistication . ”
Unfortunately , such a comparison does n’t do any favors for this otherwise new technology .
ARM and its partners plan to release the full platform in early 2008 and bring devices to the market in early 2009 while the iPhone ?
It ’s already here , no need to wait two years .
But open source has a way of making waves even if often late to the party ( think : browsers , email , operating systems , etc. ) .
Here ’s what Mike Inglis , an executive VP at ARM has to say about the collaboration :
“ Today ’s consumers are very knowledgeable about technology , want to be connected to the Internet and access multimedia content and applications anywhere , at anytime , yet they do not want to be restricted by short battery life and inadequate features that will limit their experiences …
By stepping up the collaboration among key stakeholders in the mobile market , we will be able to jointly deliver the devices and applications with the cutting - edge innovation consumers have come to expect . ”
A Downers Grove man believes he is being prosecuted for his political views - and an area attorney has taken his case pro bono .
Jeff Zurawski , 39 , of Downers Grove and Sarah M. Hartfield , 45 , of Naperville were initially charged with disorderly conduct for displaying a banner that read " Impeach Bush and Cheney - LIARS " on May 6 on the Great Western Trail above Interstate 355 .
But more charges were brought against the two war protesters last week in DuPage County Circuit Court in Wheaton : reckless conduct and unauthorized display of a sign in viewing of a highway , both misdemeanors .
The new charges each carry a penalty of up to one year imprisonment , while the original charge was up to a three - month sentence in the county jail .
" This is political prosecution , " said environmental rights attorney Shawn Collins , who has taken on Zurawski and Hartfield 's case pro bono .
Paul Darrah , a spokesman for the state 's attorney 's office , said the charges are not for the content of Zurawski and Hartfield 's banner but for the location .
" If you 're driving along the highway at 55 mph , you need to pay attention to what 's going on on the road , not necessarily above the road , " Darrah said .
Alongside the banner hung an upside - down American flag , " to signal to our neighbors that we are in trouble because our leaders have lied to us , " Zurawski said .
" They have betrayed us . "
Zurawski and Hartfield said they were leading a peaceful protest and were respectful when an Illinois State Trooper asked the two to take down the banner because it posed as a potential distraction .
Opposing ideologies
The trouble allegedly began when three DuPage County sheriff 's deputies arrived on the scene as Zurawski and Hartfield were packing up their signs .
One of the deputies said a call was received that items were being thrown from the bridge , which both Zurawski and Hartfield deny .
" That would be senseless endangerment and destruction of innocent lives , " Hartfield said .
" I 'm a peace activist , and anyone who knows me knows I would never throw anything over the overpass , endangering someone 's life . "
During their conversation with the deputies , one deputy allegedly took personal offense at the protest , citing his war veteran status and that of his son , who is serving in Afghanistan .
After providing their personal information to the deputies , Zurawski and Hartfield left without a citation .
It was three weeks later that arrest warrants were issued for each on the charge of disorderly conduct .
Now , a month later , the charges have been upgraded .
Collins has asked for a jury trial for his clients .
" The people of DuPage County will see this for what it is , " he said .
" Even if they disagree with what Jeff and Sarah believe , they want this to be a county and a country where Jeff and Sarah are free to express their beliefs . "
Zurawski and Hartfield are due in court July 30 , when a trial date is expected to be set .
If you live in the United States , you ’re probably aware that CNN and YouTube are co-sponsoring a Republican presidential debate tomorrow evening .
The debate format features questions posed to the presidential candidates by US voters , which are submitted via YouTube .
The event ’s executive producer and Washington bureau chief David Bohrman spoke with a bunch of reporters Monday , including one from Wired News .
( For more , see Wired News ’ story : " CNN - YouTube Debate Producer Doubts The Wisdom of the Crowd … and for more on how one CNN reporter views questions submitted via YouTube , see this transcript , provided by the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters . )
A consistent theme that Bohrman sounded in the interviews was that CNN would be weeding out " Democratic grenades and gotchas , because that ’s not appropriate for what this is . "
While a few , like this one about abortions , and this sarcastic foray into Second Amendment rights seem like questions that would have been submitted by Democrats , there are lots of other pointed questions that might have come from Republicans .
( In fact , there are quite a few video questions from Republican voters who are fed up with their party . )
For example , the libertarian wing of the Republican party is very concerned about the state of constitutional rights in this country .
So are several high school students and others across the political spectrum :
To be sure , there were many other straightforward questions from members of groups such as The Young Republican National Federation .
Its leader Jessica Colon and field organizer Rachel Hoff rallied its members , and managed to get them to submit at least 13 videos .
Aside from the these questions , US voters submitted plenty of sharp and difficult queries that make for a fascinating few minutes spent online simply because of the questions ’ wide ranging subject matter .
Then there ’s this request , which seems to address Bohrman ’s point directly , even if inadvertently .
The questioner says : " Hi — I have a favor to ask all of the GOP candidates on stage .
Tonight can you please stop the Hillary bashing ?
It seems that every Republican debate I ’ve watched turned into a bash Hillary - fest .
And the viewers , including myself , learn nothing about your true thoughts and opinions .
I already know the opinions and positions of Senator Hillary Clinton .
I want to know yours , and what you would do as president .
So tonight , stop mentioning Hillary Clinton , and mention what you ’re going to do as president . "
CNN ’s producers received almost 5,000 video submissions .
It would be impossible for them to do all of the submissions justice — there are so many great questions , some of them posed so simply , yet so effectively .
It would be refreshing to see some of the more unusual ones get picked so that voters can really see the personalities of the candidates shine through as they respond to the unusual and unexpected .
The ugly are one of the few groups against whom it is still legal to discriminate .
Unfortunately for them , there are good reasons why beauty and success go hand in hand
IMAGINE you have two candidates for a job .
They are both of the same sex — and that sex is the one your own proclivities incline you to find attractive .
Their CVs are equally good , and they both give good interview .
You cannot help noticing , though , that one is pug-ugly and the other is handsome .
Are you swayed by their appearance ?
Perhaps not .
But lesser , less - moral mortals might be .
If appearance did not count , why would people dress up for such interviews — even if the job they are hoping to get is dressed down ?
And job interviews are turning points in life .
If beauty sways interviewers , the beautiful will , by and large , have more successful careers than the ugly — even in careers for which beauty is not a necessary qualification .
If you were swayed by someone 's looks , however , would that be wrong ?
In a society that eschews prejudice , favouring the beautiful seems about as shallow as you can get .
But it was not always thus .
In the past , people often equated beauty with virtue and ugliness with vice .
Even now , the expression “ as ugly as sin ” has not quite passed from the language .
There is , of course , the equally famous expression “ beauty is in the eye of the beholder ” , to counter it .
But the subtext of that old saw , that beauty is arbitrary , is wrong .
Most beholders agree what is beautiful — and modern biology suggests there is a good reason for that agreement .
Biology also suggests that beauty may , indeed , be a good rule of thumb for assessing someone of either sex .
Not an infallible one , and certainly no substitute for an in - depth investigation .
But , nevertheless , an instinctive one , and one that is bound to redound to the advantage of the physically well endowed .
Fearful symmetry
The godfather of scientific study of beauty is Randy Thornhill , of the University of New Mexico .
It was Dr Thornhill who , a little over a decade ago , took an observation he originally made about insects and dared to apply it to people .
The insects in question were scorpion flies , and the observation was that those flies whose wings were most symmetrical were the ones that did best in the mating stakes .
Dr Thornhill thought this preference for symmetry might turn out to be universal in the animal kingdom ( and it does indeed seem to be ) .
In particular , he showed it is true of people .
He started with faces , manipulating pictures to make them more and less symmetrical , and having volunteers of the opposite sex rank them for attractiveness .
But he has gone on to show that all aspects of bodily symmetry contribute , down to the lengths of corresponding fingers , and that the assessment applies to those of the same sex , as well .
The reason seems to be that perfect symmetry is hard for a developing embryo to maintain .
The embryo that can maintain it obviously has good genes ( and also a certain amount of luck ) .
It is , therefore , more than just coincidence that the words “ health and beauty ” trip so easily off the tongue as a single phrase .
Other aspects of beauty , too , are indicators of health .
Skin and hair condition , in particular , are sensitive to illness , malnutrition and so on ( or , perhaps it would be better to say that people 's perceptions are exquisitely tuned to detect perfection and flaws in such things ) .
And more recent work has demonstrated another association .
Contrary to the old jokes about dumb blondes , beautiful people seem to be cleverer , too .
One of the most detailed studies on the link between beauty and intelligence was done by Mark Prokosch , Ronald Yeo and Geoffrey Miller , who also work at the University of New Mexico .
These three researchers correlated people 's bodily symmetry with their performance on intelligence tests .
Such tests come in many varieties , of course , and have a controversial background .
But most workers in the field agree that there is a quality , normally referred to as “ general intelligence ” , or “ g ” , that such tests can measure objectively along with specific abilities in such areas as spatial awareness and language .
Dr Miller and his colleagues found that the more a test was designed to measure g , the more the results were correlated with bodily symmetry — particularly in the bottom half of the beauty - ugliness spectrum .
Faces , too , seem to carry information on intelligence .
A few years ago , two of the world 's face experts , Leslie Zebrowitz , of Brandeis University in Massachusetts , and Gillian Rhodes , of the University of Western Australia , got together to review the literature and conduct some fresh experiments .
They found nine past studies ( seven of them conducted before the second world war , an indication of how old interest in this subject is ) , and subjected them to what is known as a meta - analysis .
The studies in question had all used more or less the same methodology , namely photograph people and ask them to do IQ tests , then show the photographs to other people and ask the second lot to rank the intelligence of the first lot .
The results suggested that people get such judgments right — by no means all the time , but often enough to be significant .
The two researchers and their colleagues then carried out their own experiment , with the added twist of dividing their subjects up by age .
Bright blondes
The results of that were rather surprising .
They found that the faces of children and adults of middling years did seem to give away intelligence , while those of teenagers and the elderly did not .
That is surprising because face - reading of this sort must surely be important in mate selection , and the teenage years are the time when such selection is likely to be at its most intense — though , conversely , they are also the time when evolution will be working hardest to cover up any deficiencies , and the hormone - driven changes taking place during puberty might provide the material needed to do that .
Nevertheless , the accumulating evidence suggests that physical characteristics do give clues about intelligence , that such clues are picked up by other people , and that these clues are also associated with beauty .
And other work also suggests that this really does matter .
One of the leading students of beauty and success is Daniel Hamermesh of the University of Texas .
Dr Hamermesh is an economist rather than a biologist , and thus brings a somewhat different perspective to the field .
He has collected evidence from more than one continent that beauty really is associated with success — at least , with financial success .
He has also shown that , if all else is equal , it might be a perfectly legitimate business strategy to hire the more beautiful candidate .
Just over a decade ago Dr Hamermesh presided over a series of surveys in the United States and Canada which showed that when all other things are taken into account , ugly people earn less than average incomes , while beautiful people earn more than the average .
The ugliness “ penalty ” for men was - 9 % while the beauty premium was +5 % .
For women , perhaps surprisingly considering popular prejudices about the sexes , the effect was less : the ugliness penalty was - 6 % while the beauty premium was +4 % .
Since then , he has gone on to measure these effects in other places .
In China , ugliness is penalised more in women , but beauty is more rewarded .
The figures for men in Shanghai are – 25 % and +3 % ; for women they are – 31 % and +10 % .
In Britain , ugly men do worse than ugly women ( - 18 % as against - 11 % ) but the beauty premium is the same for both ( and only +1 % ) .
The difference also applies within professions .
Dr Hamermesh looked at the careers of members of a particular ( though discreetly anonymous ) American law school .
He found that those rated attractive on the basis of their graduation photographs went on to earn higher salaries than their less well - favoured colleagues .
Moreover , lawyers in private practice tended to be better looking than those working in government departments .
Illustration by Brett Ryder
Even more unfairly , Dr Hamermesh found evidence that beautiful people may bring more revenue to their employers than the less - favoured do .
His study of Dutch advertising firms showed that those with the most beautiful executives had the largest size - adjusted revenues — a difference that exceeded the salary differentials of the firms in question .
Finally , to add insult to injury , he found that even in his own cerebral and , one might have thought , beauty - blind profession , attractive candidates were more successful in elections for office in the American Economic Association .
That last distinction also applies to elections to public office , as was neatly demonstrated by Niclas Berggren , of the Ratio Institute in Stockholm , and his colleagues .
Dr Berggren 's team looked at almost 2,000 candidates in Finnish elections .
They asked foreigners ( mainly Americans and Swedes ) to examine the candidates ' campaign photographs and rank them for beauty .
They then compared those rankings with the actual election results .
They were able to eliminate the effects of party preference because Finland has a system of proportional representation that pits candidates of the same party against one another .
Lo and behold , the more beautiful candidates , as ranked by people who knew nothing of Finland 's internal politics , tended to have been the more successful — though in this case , unlike Dr Hamermesh 's economic results , the effect was larger for women than for men .
If looks could kill
What these results suggest is a two - fold process , sadly reminiscent of the biblical quotation to which the title of this article refers .
There is a feedback loop between biology and the social environment that gives to those who have , and takes from those who have not .
That happens because beauty is a real marker for other , underlying characteristics such as health , good genes and intelligence .
It is what biologists call an unfakeable signal , like the deep roar of a big , rutting stag that smaller adolescents are physically incapable of producing .
It therefore makes biological sense for people to prefer beautiful friends and lovers , since the first will make good allies , and the second , good mates .
That brings the beautiful opportunities denied to the ugly , which allows them to learn things and make connections that increase their value still further .
If they are judged on that experience as well as their biological fitness , it makes them even more attractive .
Even a small initial difference can thus be amplified into something that just ain 't — viewed from the bottom — fair .
Given all this , it is hardly surprising that the cosmetics industry has global sales of $ 280 billion .
But can you really fake the unfakeable signal ?
Dr Hamermesh 's research suggests that you can but , sadly , that it is not cost - effective — at least , not if your purpose is career advancement .
Working in Shanghai , where the difference between the ugliness penalty and the beauty bonus was greatest , he looked at how women 's spending on their cosmetics and clothes affected their income .
The answer was that it did , but not enough to pay for itself in a strictly financial sense .
He estimates that the beauty premium generated by such primping is worth only 15 % of the money expended .
Of course , beauty pays off in spheres of life other than the workplace .
But that , best beloved , would be the subject of a rather different article .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Starting your own company is a big challenge , but staying positive could be an even bigger struggle .
No matter what kind of business you have , if you are not committed to a " failure is not an option " mindset , you are setting yourself up for failure , says Neil Anderson , president of The Courage Group , a consulting firm for entrepreneurs .
Indeed , only two - thirds of new small businesses survive at least two years , and just 44 percent survive at least four years , according to a study by the U.S. Small Business Association .
To avoid becoming another start - up casualty , the right mental state is crucial .
So when the bills begin to pile up , and clients or customers are few and far between , do n't be tempted to throw in the towel .
Instead , keep your mind and mission on track .
Anderson offers these tips to help stay out of the failure trap :
Go mental .
One of the most important elements to starting a successful business is being mentally prepared .
Of course , skills , actions and good old - fashioned luck are also important factors , but it all begins with the right frame of mind .
To that end , stay away from people who are negative and may try to bring you down .
Anderson admits that he fired his own girlfriend in the early stages of building his business , because of her pessimistic attitude ( the relationship did n't work out either ) .
She would say things like " you used to make so much more money working for someone else , " Anderson explained .
People can be negative simply because they are jealous that you had the courage to follow your own dream , not just talk about it , Anderson asserts .
Virtual reality .
Although there will be many ups and downs , a light does exist at the end of the tunnel , and it is bright .
By visualizing success , your actions will become more confident .
And increased confidence breeds success .
Anderson advises entrepreneurs to think about why they started a business in the first place .
Perhaps going back to work for someone else is not an option .
In that case , just reminding yourself of the alternatives : being at the mercy of others controlling your life , playing corporate politics or reporting to incompetent bosses should be sufficient motivation to keep your mind right .
It 's all about sacrifice .
A big component of the " failure is not an option " mindset is knowing that certain personal or financial sacrifices will need to be made along the way in order to achieve your dream .
Entrepreneurs who have made sacrifices and prospered did so because they realized early on that starting and building a great company comes with a price .
Risk is not a four - letter word .
Keep in mind that success comes to those who recognize risk , are unafraid of it , and will execute on their ideas .
If you are risk - averse , your chances of business survival will probably be slim .
" I cashed in all my chips , my 401 ( k ) , whatever I could ...
I was willing to bet it all , " Anderson said of his consultancy firm , which he got off the ground in 2001 .
A hungry dog hunts better .
" My father said that to me at the outset , " Anderson said .
When clients or customers are few and far between and money is tight or nonexistent , successful past and future entrepreneurs will always find a way to drum up another sale .
When times get tough financially , you really have only two choices : decrease your expenses or increase your revenues .
A roadmap will lead you to success .
A business plan , which is a written description of what you are going to do and how you are going to do it , is the entrepreneur 's roadmap .
It forces you to think about the entire operation and come to terms with the businesses strengths and weaknesses .
Entrepreneurs who do their homework increase their chances for business success .
" Do n't look at it as a hassle or burden , look at it as an opportunity to survive , " Anderson said .
Long hours , no vacations - you 're not alone
Finance your fantasy startup
European wireless provider Vodafone on Monday obtained a Court order that requires rival T - Mobile Germany to sell Apple Inc. 's iPhone handset to Germans without a service plan .
The temporary injunction was handed down by a Hamburg court and requests a response from T - Mobile 's parent company , Deutsche Telekom , within two weeks .
Deutsche Telekom has confirmed ( translation ) the ruling , which can be overturned as part of an appeals processes .
For its part , Vodafone — which at one time was in the running for its own exclusive contract to sell iPhone to parts of Europe — claims that it took the matter to court out of fears that other handset makers may follow Apple 's example and begin tying their handsets to specific providers , further shredding the German wireless market .
Vodafone Germany chief executive Friedrich Joussen in a statement said his firm 's goal is not to prevent sales of the device but rather allow for consumers to purchase iPhones without binding themselves to long - term agreements with any one carrier .
" We want it to be available to buyers without a mandatory calling plan , " he said .
" If I had wanted to halt sales , I could have , but I did n't . "
A definitive ruling on the matter is expected within two weeks .
Science is n’t something that necessarily needs to be done in the closed quarters of a lab .
Many of the most brilliant experiments can be done in your own home and literally cost you almost nothing to make !
So , just by using a bit of household equipment and items you would likely have anyway spend some time impressing your friends with a few of these !
Here are ten of the most impressive !
10 . The Homemade Volcano
Everyone at one time or another has constructed one of the most tried and true home science experiments : The Volcano .
This is a simple and really impressive use of household acids and bases that can be made again and again .
What you ’ll need :
A small empty plastic pop bottle ( 500 mL )
A funnel
Two measuring cups
1 cup of baking soda
1 cup of vinegar
1 tsp of Sunlight liquid dish detergent
Food coloring ( optional )
Glitter ( optional )
What to do :
1 . Place the pop bottle in the bottom of your kitchen sink .
2. Insert the funnel into the pop bottle .
3 . Pour the baking soda into the bottle using the funnel .
4 . Add the dish detergent and the food coloring to the vinegar in the measuring cup .
5 . Sprinkle some glitter on top of the baking soda .
6 . Pour the vinegar mixture into the bottle and watch as your volcano erupts .
9. Rock Candy
Who does n’t love sucking on a nice piece of hard candy ?
Well , why not make your very own at home !
It only requires a few simple ingredients and just a little time and patience .
Here is how to do it :
You will need
15 cm piece of string
A pencil
A paper clip ( or large plastic bead )
1 cup of water
2 cups of sugar
A glass jar
What to do
Tie the 15 - cm piece of string to the middle of the pencil .
Tie the paper clip ( or bead ) onto the end of the string .
Put the pencil across the top of a jar so that the string hangs down the middle of the jar .
If it hangs down too far , roll the string around the pencil until the string is not touching the sides or bottom of the jar .
The string will act as a seed for the crystal .
Any type of jar will do , but canning jars are best since they can endure the hot temperatures .
Tall skinny olive jars are also nice because they do n’t use up so much of the liquid .
Now that the string and pencil are ready remove them from the jar and put them aside .
Pour the water into a pan and bring it to boil .
Pour about 1 /4 cup of sugar into the boiling water , stirring until it dissolves .
Keep adding more and more sugar , each time stirring it until it dissolves , until no more will dissolve .
This will take time and patience and it will take longer for the sugar to dissolve each time .
Be sure you do n’t give up too soon .
Carefully pour the hot sugar solution into the jars to the top .
Then submerge the paper clip and string into the sugar solution .
Be sure the string hangs down in the middle of the jar .
Allow the jar to cool and put it someplace where it will not be disturbed .
In a week or so you will have large crystals to enjoy !
8. Miniature Hovercraft
So you want your very own hovercraft ?
Of course it ’s only big enough to hold a mouse or two , but it ’s still pretty neat .
Well , here ’s what you are going to need for this experiment :
Cardboard
Pencil
Glue
Paper
Thread Spool
Balloon
Mouse ( optional )
Cut a 4 - inch square out of the cardboard .
Punch a hole in the cardboard .
Make sure you punch the hole in the center of the cardboard .
The hole should be the same size as the hole in the spool .
Glue the spool to the cardboard on top of the hole .
Make sure you glue it really well and the holes line up .
Make sure you use enough glue to seal it so that no air can escape between the spool and the piece of cardboard .
Cover the top of the spool with a circle of paper – glue it to the spool and wait until the glue is dry .
Punch a hole in the middle of the paper cover where the hole of the spool is .
Now your hole should run through the paper , spool , and cardboard without any obstructions .
Blow up the balloon and twist the end to keep the air from escaping .
Stretch the balloon over the top of the spool .
Make sure your mouse is well protected ( optional step ) .
Set the hovercraft on a level table .
Let go of the balloon .
7. Homemade Silver Polish
If you have any objects made from silver or plated with silver , you know that the bright , shiny surface of silver gradually darkens and becomes dull and unappealing .
This happens because silver undergoes a chemical reaction with sulfur particles in the air .
You can use chemistry to reverse the tarnishing reaction , and make the silver shiny again !
For this experiment you will need :
a tarnished piece of silver
a pan or dish large enough to completely immerse the silver in
aluminum foil to cover the bottom of the pan
enough water to fill the pan
a vessel in which to heat the water
hot pads or kitchen mitts with which to handle the heated water vessel
baking soda , about 1 cup per gallon of water
Line the bottom of the pan with aluminum foil .
Set the silver object on top of the aluminum foil .
Make sure the silver comes in full contact with the aluminum .
Heat the water to boiling .
To the hot water , add about one cup of baking soda for each gallon of water .
( If you need only half a gallon of water , use half a cup of baking soda . )
The mixture will froth a bit , no worries .
Pour the hot baking soda and water mixture into the pan , and completely cover the silver .
Almost immediately , the tarnish will begin to disappear .
If the silver is only lightly tarnished , all of the tarnish will disappear within several minutes .
If the silver is badly tarnished , you may need to reheat the baking soda and water mixture , and give the silver several treatments to remove all of the tarnish .
6. Homemade Electromagnet
Making an electromagnet at home is fun and easy .
Most magnets , like the ones on many refrigerators , cannot be turned off ; they are called permanent magnets .
This one can be and is therefor called an electromagnet .
They run on electricity and are only magnetic when the electricity is flowing .
The electricity flowing through the wire arranges the molecules in the nail so that they are attracted to certain metals .
You will need :
A large iron nail ( about 3 inches )
About 3 feet of THIN COATED copper wire
A fresh D size battery
Some paper clips
What to do :
1. Leave about 8 inches of wire loose at one end and wrap most of the rest of the wire around the nail .
Try not to overlap the wires .
2 . Cut the wire ( if needed ) so that there is about another 8 inches loose at the other end .
3 . Now remove about an inch of the plastic coating from both ends of the wire and attach the one wire to one end of a battery and the other wire to the other end of the battery .
( It is best to tape the wires to the battery – be careful though , the wire could get very hot ! )
Now you can experiment by picking up paper clips and small non-aluminum objects .
5. Soda and Mentos Geyser
Watching a jet of foamy soda erupt from a bottle is not only fun , but also hysterical and will impress everyone around you … while hopefully not getting them ( and yourself ) too messy in the process .
This also happens to be a really inexpensive home experiment , but you might want to invest in several bottles of soda and a bunch of rolls of mints just in case .
Step one :
Open the 2 - liter pop bottle ( note : diet soda seems to work better and is less sticky come clean - up time )
Step two : Unroll the package of Mentos and prepare to dump the entire pack in at once .
Fashioning a tube out of an empty toilet paper roll to just fit into the bottle mouth is very helpful .
Step three :
Drop the mints in and back up a few paces … quickly !
Step four :
The geyser is quite impressive and the current measured record is 21 feet !
4. Homemade Plastic
Plastics are all around us .
There are many different kinds , with a wide range of properties .
Some are hard , others are soft .
Some are transparent , others are opaque .
Most plastics are made in factories , but here ’s one you can make at home !
For this experiment you will need :
1 teaspoon ( 5 cm3 ) laundry borax
1 tablespoon ( 15 mL ) white glue ( e.g. , Elmer ’s Glue - All )
food coloring ( optional )
two cups
spoon
water
Here ’s what to do :
In one of the cups , dissolve 1 teaspoon of laundry borax in 5 tablespoons ( 75 mL ) of water .
You will need to stir this for a while to get it to dissolve .
( If a tiny bit does not dissolve , that is fine , though . )
In the other cup , combine 1 tablespoon of water and 1 tablespoon of white glue .
If you wish , you may color the mixture with a couple drops of food coloring .
With a clean spoon , stir the mixture thoroughly until it is uniform .
Put 2 teaspoons of the borax solution from the first cup into the glue mixture in the second cup .
Stir the mixture .
As you stir the mixture , it will stiffen into a soft lump .
After the lump has formed , take it from the cup and knead it in your hand for a couple minutes .
3. Potato Clock
Everyone can get ahold of a few potatoes , and what better way to use them ( aside from consumption , that is ) than to make them into an operating clock ?
It ’s easy and only requires the use of a few things many people have handy , or , if you need to go to the electronics store to purchase an LED clock anyway , you can get the alligator clips and electrodes there , as well .
To run it on two potatoes , you ’ll need :
1 . Two copper electrodes .
A 10 - cm length of thick ( 0.64 cm ) copper ground wire
works well .
You ’ll find it at hardware and home supply stores .
2 . Two zinc electrodes .
Use large galvanized nails , also available from a hardware or home supply store .
3 . Three alligator - clip wires
4 . Two potatoes .
Now make a potato clock .
Open the battery compartment of the clock and remove the button battery .
In the compartment , notice that there are two connections
for the battery marked plus (+ ) and minus ( - ) .
You ’ll connect the potato battery to these two places .
Let ’s call the potatoes A and B. Connect A and B to the clock like this :
1. Insert a copper electrode and a zinc electrode into each potato , fairly far apart .
2 . Use an alligator - clip wire to connect the copper electrode of potato A to the plus (+ ) connection in the clock .
3 . Use an alligator - clip wire to connect the zinc electrode of potato B to the negative ( -) connection in the clock .
4 . Use an alligator - clip wire to connect the zinc electrode of potato A to the copper electrode of potato B .
Viola !
This clock will last for months especially if the potatoes are very fresh .
2. Kitchen - Grown Avocado Tree
Avocados are delicious and highly nutritious fruits and can be used in myriad ways , but what to do with the pit ?
Well , you could supply yourself with even more of the green delights by growing your own tree right in your kitchen !
Step One : Open the avocado and remove the pit from the center .
Step Two :
Wash the avocado pit under cool running water and towel - dry .
Step Three : Carefully push three toothpicks into the thickest width of avocado , you want to push the toothpicks into the pit about a 1 / 2 ″ deep .
The toothpicks will help suspend the avocado pit in water and keep the top part of the pit in fresh air and the fat base of the pit under the surface of the water .
Step Four : Suspend the pit over a glass filled with water .
The toothpicks will rest on the rim of the glass and hold the pit in place so it does n’t sink to the bottom .
Always check the water level in the glass and see that the water is covering the fat base of the pit by about an inch depth .
If the water is below that level you ’ll need to add some more .
Step Five : Place the glass in a bright windowsill .
In about three to six weeks the top of the avocado pit will begin to split and a stem sprout will emerge from the top and roots will begin to grow at the base .
When the stem grows to about five or six inches pinch out the top set of leaves .
In another two or three weeks new leaves will sprout and there will be more roots .
It ’s now time to plant the young avocado tree .

House members subpoenaed by man charged in bribery case
Thirteen
House members have received subpoenas from the lawyer to Brent Wilkes , a defense contractor facing charges relating to the bribery conviction of now - incarcerated congressman " Duke " Cunningham ( R - CA ) .
According to Congressional Quarterly , the 13 are teaming up to fight the subpoenas , saying the requests are " overly broad . "
 They intend to fight the subpoenas , " a source told the news service .
 As we understand it , Wilkes lawyer is also trying to subpoena other government officials .
The subpoenas say very little about what they are after . 
The 13 lawmakers have joined forces behind the scenes to try to fight the wave of subpoenas they have received in recent days from an attorney for Wilkes .
Wilkes lawyer , Mark Geragos , has asked for information relating to his client 's trial .
Five lawmakers received subpoenas for documents and testimony , according to CQ .
Those are : House Armed Services Chairman Ike Skelton ( D - MO ) , House Intelligence Chairman Silvestre Reyes ( D - TX ) ; Rep. Duncan Hunter ( R - CA ) ; House Defense Appropriations Chairman John Murtha ( D - PA ) ; and ranking House Appropriations Republican Jerry Lewis ( R - CA ) .
Joe Kasper , a spokesman for for Rep. Duncan Hunter , told RAW STORY by email that Hunter had been advised by House General Counsel that the subpoena was " inconsistent with the precedents and privileges of the House . "
Hunter is the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee and a candidate for president .
" Congressman Hunter intends to continue consulting with House Counsel on this matter and will proceed according to their judgment , " Kasper said .
A spokeswoman for Rep. Skelton confirmed the Congressman had received a subpoena , but said Skelton was not prepared to comment on an ongoing criminal investigation .
Other members were served subpoenas requesting only testimony .
Among them were : House Minority Whip Roy Blunt ( R - MO ) , erstwhile House Speaker Dennis Hastert ( R- IL ) , Rep. Joe Knollenberg ( R - MI ) , Rep. Peter Hoekstra ( R - MI ) ; Rep. Darrell Issa ( R- CA ) , Rep John Doolittle ( R - CA ) , Rep. Jerry Weller ( R - IL ) , and Rep. Norm Dicks ( D - WA ) .
Cunningham was sentenced to eight years in federal prison after pleading guilty to accepting more than $ 2 m in bribes .

The CEO of United Utilities has apologized to customers in the West Midlands area for the inconvenience caused during the two hour period last night when gravity had to be switched of due to essential maintenance work .
‘ Rates of obesity in Britain are putting increased demands on gravity , which in some areas is struggling to cope with current demands ’ said Benjamin Small .
Much of the country ’s outdated Victorian gravitational infrastructure was originally intended for fewer and lighter people and is only now being upgraded to meet 21st Century requirements .
‘ But this may result in some minor disruption to the service during this time ’ conceded Mr Small .
A number of complaints were received in Wolverhampton and West Bromich area where pensioners woke up to find themselves floating up by the ceiling .
‘ My father was convinced he had finally died and was going up to heaven ’ said one distressed Birmingham woman .
‘ He could n’t work out what I was doing there too . ’
A Warwickshire farmer lost a herd of dairy cattle after they drifted up towards the clouds until a gentle breeze finally deposited them on the roof of a Coventry office block .
A number of husbands blamed the interuption to gravity for the fact that the toilet seat was in the upright position the following morning .
The new ‘ Digital Gravity Plus ’ is supposed to be cleaner and sharper than the old analogue service that will finally be switched off in 2012 .
Households that have not subscribed to the digital gravity by then are being warned that they will have to manage without the Earth ’s pull .
In the meantime United Utilities have refused to rule out further interuptions in the Gravity service .
‘ Unfortunately our next scheduled close down is at the end of the month , a few hours after the New Year ’s Eve festivities .
However we anticipate that the few clubbers who are still out at that time will be sky high anyway , and wo n’t notice anything unusual . ’

I bought a retail copy of Office 2007 today ( I ’m loading up the new laptop I got for the world tour , which is a Thinkpad X61s ) , and I must be a complete spaz , but I simply could not figure out how to open the bizarre new packaging .
It ’s a hard plastic case , sealed in two different places by plastic stickies .
It represents a complete failure of industrial design ; an utter F in the school of Donald Norman ’s Design of Everyday Things .
To be technical about it , it has no true affordances and actually has some false affordances : visual clues as to how to open it that turn out to be wrong .
This is the same box that Vista comes in .
Nick
White over at Microsoft seems proud of the novel design , but from the comments on the web it seems I ’m not the only one who could n’t figure out how to open it .
It seems like even rudimentary usability testing would have revealed the problem .
A box that many people can’t figure out how to open without a Google search is an unusually pathetic failure of design .
As the line goes from Billy Madison : “ I award you no points , and may God have mercy on your soul . ”
Wasting five minutes trying to get the goddamned box open is just the first of many ways that Office 2007 and Vista ’s gratuitous redesign of things that worked perfectly well shows utter disregard for all the time you spent learning the previous versions .
I ’ve tested Office 2007 extensively , and find it a tolerable replacement for the previous version , although it ’s extremely frustrating every time I have to spend several minutes finding something that I knew exactly how to find in the previous version .
Even though there ’s no reason to upgrade to Office 2007 , if you ’re setting up a new system , it ’s just as good as the previous version , even a little better in some places .
But Vista is another story .
I ’ve been using Vista on my home laptop since it shipped , and can say with some conviction that nobody should be using it as their primary operating system — it simply has no redeeming merits to overcome the compatibility headaches it causes .
Whenever anyone asks , my advice is to stay with Windows XP ( and to purchase new systems with XP preinstalled ) .

( CNN ) -- Sen. Larry Craig said he " overreacted and made a poor decision " in pleading guilty to disorderly conduct after his June arrest following an incident in a Minneapolis , Minnesota , airport bathroom .
A police mug shot of Sen. Larry Craig after he was arrested at the Minneapolis - St. Paul airport in June .
Tuesday , in his first public statement on the arrest , the Idaho Republican said he did nothing " inappropriate . "
" Let me be clear : I am not gay and never have been , " said Craig , who has aligned himself with conservative groups who oppose gay rights .
With his wife by his side , Craig said he is the victim of a " witch hunt " conducted by the Idaho Statesman newspaper .
" In pleading guilty , I overreacted in Minneapolis , because of the stress of the Idaho Statesman 's investigation and the rumors it has fueled around Idaho , " he said .
" Again , that overreaction was a mistake , and I apologize for my misjudgment . "
Watch Craig say he did nothing wrong »
He added : " I should not have kept this arrest to myself , and should have told my family and friends about it .
I was n't eager to share this failure , but I should have done so anyway . "
A police officer who arrested him June 11 said Craig peered through a crack in a restroom stall door for two minutes and made gestures suggesting to the officer he wanted to engage in " lewd conduct . "
Craig 's blue eyes were clearly visible through the crack in the door , Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport police Sgt. Dave Karsnia wrote in the report he filed .
" Craig would look down at his hands , ' fidget ' with his fingers , and then look through the crack into my stall again , " Karsnia wrote in documents accompanying the arrest report .
Craig said the officer misinterpreted his actions .
After he was taken for questioning , the police report says , Craig pulled out a Senate business card and asked the officer : " What do you think of that ? "
Before the senator spoke in Boise , Idaho , Tuesday , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , a Republican from Kentucky , informed Craig the leaders of his own party were calling for an ethics investigation into what they termed a " serious matter , " a Senate Republican leadership aide told CNN .
The aide said senators , who discussed the matter by phone , were especially concerned about the business card allegation .
The GOP leadership consists of McConnell , Assistant Minority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi , Conference Chairman Jon Kyl of Arizona , Policy Committee Chair Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas , and Senatorial Committee Chair John Ensign of Nevada .
" Due to the reported and disputed circumstances , and the legal resolution of this serious case , we will recommend that Senator Craig 's incident be reported to the Senate Ethics Committee for its review , " the group said in a statement .
" In the meantime , Leadership is examining other aspects of the case to determine if additional action is required , " the statement said .
Craig , 62 , pleaded guilty August 8 to a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge in the incident , according to Minnesota criminal records .
The senator said he " chose to plead guilty to a lesser charge in the hope of making it go away .
I did not seek any counsel , either from an attorney , staff , friends , or family .
That was a mistake , and I deeply regret it . "
On Tuesday , Craig announced that he has retained an attorney .
The officer wrote he was on a plainclothes detail in the restroom because of citizen complaints and arrests for sexual activity there .
Karsnia wrote that when the person occupying the stall beside him left , Craig entered it and blocked the door with his rolling suitcase .
" My experience has shown that individuals engaging in lewd conduct use their bags to block the view from the front of their stall , " the officer said in his report .
The senator then tapped his right foot , " a signal used by persons wishing to engage in lewd conduct , " Karsnia wrote , and Craig ran his left hand several times underneath the partition dividing the stalls .
" The presence of others did not seem to deter Craig as he moved his right foot so that it touched the side of my left foot , which was within my stall area , " the officer 's report said .
When the police interviewed him later , the senator said that " he has a wide stance when going to the bathroom " and that was why his foot may have touched the officer 's , the report said .
Craig also told police that he had reached down to the floor to pick up a piece of paper , the officer wrote .
" It should be noted that there was not a piece of paper on the bathroom floor , nor did Craig pick up a piece of paper , " Karsnia wrote .
" During the interview , Craig either disagreed with me or ' did n't recall ' the events as they happened . "
After Craig ran his hand underneath the partition wall three times , Karsnia held his police identification down by the floor so the senator could see it , the report said .
" With my left hand near the floor , I pointed towards the exit .
Craig responded , ' No ! '
" I again pointed towards the exit .
Craig exited the stall with his roller bags without flushing the toilet , " Karsnia wrote .
The senator initially resisted the officer 's request to go to the police operations center , he said , but finally did .
There , he was read his Miranda rights , interviewed , photographed , fingerprinted and released , the report said .
The Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call first reported the arrest Monday .
In a statement released Monday evening , Craig denied inappropriate conduct and said he regrets his guilty plea , which he entered without having an attorney present .
" At the time of this incident , I complained to the police that they were misconstruing my actions .
I was not involved in any inappropriate conduct , " he said .
" I should have had the advice of counsel in resolving this matter .
In hindsight , I should not have pled guilty .
I was trying to handle this matter myself quickly and expeditiously . "
Craig paid a $ 500 fine when he entered his guilty plea in Hennepin County Municipal Court in Bloomington , Minnesota , according to state criminal records .
In his petition to enter a guilty plea , Craig acknowledged that he " engaged in ( physical ) conduct which I knew or should have known tended to arouse alarm or resentment . "
He also was required to stipulate in the statement that he would " make no claim that I am innocent of the charge to which I am entering a plea of guilty , " the document said .
On Tuesday , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee , asking that the senator 's conduct be investigated .
The group , which largely targets Republicans , asked the committee to probe whether Craig " violated the Senate Rules of Conduct by engaging in disorderly conduct , " a statement said .
" If pleading guilty to charges stemming from an attempt to solicit an undercover officer in a public restroom is not conduct that reflects poorly upon the Senate , what is ? " asked Melanie Sloan , the group 's executive director , in a statement .
Sloan is a former U.S. attorney in the Clinton administration 's Justice Department .
Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - California , chairwoman of the Ethics Committee , declined to comment on whether an investigation would be conducted .
Her office noted the committee 's work is generally confidential .
A Senate aide familiar with Ethics Committee practices said ethics rules do not specifically require a member to disclose pleading guilty to a misdemeanor .
But the rules require the panel to look into a matter and determine whether an investigation is appropriate once a formal complaint is lodged .
Craig resigned Monday night as a Senate liaison for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney 's presidential campaign .
Romney 's son Josh canceled a trip to Idaho on Tuesday .
Craig , Idaho 's senior senator , is married with three grown children and nine grandchildren .
A former rancher , he was first elected to the Senate in 1990 after serving a decade in the House of Representatives .
His seat is up for re-election in 2008 .
Last fall , Craig 's office publicly denied assertions by Internet blogger Mike Rogers that the senator is gay .
Craig 's office dismissed speculation about the senator 's sexuality as " completely ridiculous . "
In 1982 , Craig denied rumors he was under investigation as part of a federal probe into allegations that lawmakers on Capitol Hill had sexual relationships with congressional pages , saying the " false allegations " made him " mad as hell . "
He was never implicated in that investigation , which led to ethics charges against two other congressmen .
In recent years , Craig 's voting record has earned him top ratings from social conservative groups such as the American Family Association , Concerned Women for America and the Family Research Council .
He has supported a federal constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage , telling his colleagues that it was " important for us to stand up now and protect traditional marriage , which is under attack by a few unelected judges and litigious activists . "
In 1996 , Craig also voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act , which denies federal recognition to same - sex marriages and prevents states from being forced to recognize the marriages of gay and lesbian couples legally performed in other states .
Craig also has opposed expanding the federal hate crimes law to cover offenses motivated by anti-gay bias and , in 1996 , voted against a bill that would have outlawed employment discrimination based on sexual orientation , which failed by a single vote in the Senate .

The House today held a hearing on the new PRO - IP Act that beefs up intellectual property enforcement .
Rick Cotton , a top NBC lawyer and representative for the Coalition Against Counterfeiting and Piracy ( CACP ) , called counterfeiting and piracy " a global pandemic " and " a dagger into the heart of America 's future economic security . "
What the US needs , he said , is a " declaration of war . "
But not even the Department of Justice is convinced that PRO - IP , in its current form , is that sort of declaration .
Counterfeit goods are certainly a problem , and no one at the hearing stands opposed to crafting good intellectual property law to protect creative work and new products ( even Public Knowledge 's Gigi Sohn proclaimed her support for IP law and enforcement ) .
Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - CA ) , who made money in the car alarm business and was the voice of the " Viper " system , used his opening statement to tell his fellow representatives about how other companies ripped off his products , including his voice , and sold them in the US market .
Defective products would arrive at Issa 's company that he had not even manufactured , though in the minds of customers , his company was to blame .
Will PRO - IP help to fix such problems ?
Concerns from Justice
The PRO - IP
Act seeks to stem the " tsunami " ( as one representative put it ) of counterfeiting and piracy by making a pair of changes to the structure of the federal government .
First , a new executive branch office devoted to intellectual property enforcement would be created in the White House , and it would be modeled on the office of the US Trade Representative .
The Department of Justice would also get a new IP enforcement division that would consolidate work currently done in several other divisions .
Sigal Mandelker , a Deputy Assistant Attorney General at the DOJ , told the subcommittee that this plan raised some concerns at Justice .
For one thing , having a White House office that can direct the priorities and investigations at Justice could undermine the independence of the department , she said .
In addition , the current arrangement at Justice is " actually quite effective . "
Public Knowledge weighs in
Gigi Sohn
Other concerns came from Gigi Sohn , president of Public Knowledge , who attacked the PRO - IP
Act 's increase to the statutory damages that can be leveled for copyright infringement .
Referencing the Jammie Thomas case in Minnesota , Sohn noted that statutory damages are already " disproportionate penalties for infringement , " and called on Congress to move them in the other direction .
Despite several significant criticisms of the bill , Sohn said that she was pleased with how subcommittee chair Howard Berman ( D - CA ) listened to many different stakeholders and had already removed the most egregious provisions from the bill .
" Unslakable lust for more "
Google 's senior copyright counsel , William Patry , was n't at the hearing , but he had a far less charitable take on the legislation .
Calling it the most " outrageously gluttonous IP bill ever introduced in the US , " Patry made clear that he was appalled by the " unslakable lust for more and more rights , longer terms of protection , draconian criminal provisions , and civil damages that bear no resemblance to the damages suffered . "
One might expect that coming from a Google lawyer ( the blog is written in his private capacity ) , since the company is a voracious consumer of copyrighted work , but Patry has himself served in the Copyright Office and has written perhaps the definitive seven - volume tome on the subject of US copyright law .
Instead , he says , he is " pro-IP in this most important of senses .
But an excessive amount of something that is beneficial in measured doses can become fatal in overdoses , and copyright is already at fatal strength . "
The PRO - IP Act , with its attempt to increase statutory damages and increase forfeiture penalties for equipment used for copyright infringement , clearly moves in a way that Patry dislikes .
Fortunately , when it comes to criminal matters , Justice remains steadfastly unconcerned with prosecuting minor infringement cases , as Mandelker again made clear in response to a question .
Still , with even harsher laws on the books , there 's always a chance that the penalties wo n't hit only those who import ripped - off car alarms , but a huge array of ordinary Americans .
Where penalties are needed , they should fit the crime .
Ruining someone 's financial life over the equivalent of a box of CDs or DVDs hardly seems to meet that standard .
Abid Aslam / Inter - Press Service | April 8 , 2008
WASHINGTON – U.S. lawmakers have a financial interest in military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , a review of their accounts has revealed .
Members of Congress invested nearly 196 million dollars of their own money in companies that receive hundreds of millions of dollars a day from Pentagon contracts to provide goods and services to U.S. armed forces , say nonpartisan watchdog groups .
David Petraeus , the top U.S. general in Iraq , is to brief the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees on Tuesday and Wednesday .
The latest findings are unlikely to have a significant impact on this week ’s proceedings but could stoke anti-incumbent sentiment in this year of presidential and legislative elections .
Lawmakers charged with overseeing Pentagon contractors hold stock in those very firms , as do vocal critics of the war in Iraq , says the Centre for Responsive Politics ( CRP ) .
Senator John Kerry , the Democrat from Massachusetts who staked his 2004 presidential bid in part on his opposition to the war , tops the list of investors .
His holdings in firms with Pentagon contracts of at least five million dollars stood at between 28.9 million dollars and 38.2 million dollars as of Dec. 31 , 2006 .
Kerry sits on the Senate foreign relations panel .
Members of Congress are required to report their personal finances every year but only need to state their assets in broad ranges .
Other top investors include Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen , a New Jersey Republican with holdings of 12.1 million – 49.1 million dollars ; Rep. Robin Hayes , a North Carolina Republican ( 9.2 million – 37.1 million dollars ) ; Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin ( 5.2 million – 7.6 million dollars ) ; and Rep. Jane Harman , a California Democrat ( 2.7 million – 6.3 million dollars ) .
Sen . Jay Rockefeller , the Democrat and former governor of West Virginia who chairs the Senate Select Intelligence Committee , invested some 2.0 million dollars in Pentagon contractors , CRP says .
Other panel chiefs who invested in defence firms include Sen. Joseph Lieberman , the Connecticut Independent who presides over the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , and Rep. Howard Berman , the California Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee .
In all , 151 current members of Congress — more than one - fourth of the total — have invested between 78.7 million dollars and 195.5 million dollars in companies that received defence contracts of at least 5.0 million dollars , according to CRP .
These companies received more than 275.6 billion dollars from the government in 2006 , or 755 million dollars per day , says budget watchdog group OMB Watch .
The investments yielded lawmakers 15.8 million – 62 million dollars in dividend income , capital gains , royalties , and interest from 2004 through 2006 , says CRP .
Not all the firms deal in arms or military equipment .
Some make soft drinks or medical supplies and military contracts represent a small fraction of their revenues .
Many are leaders in their industries and , as such , feature in the investment portfolios of millions of ordinary people who invest at least a portion of their savings in mutual funds , which in turn hold stocks in up to hundreds of companies .
“ Giant corporations outside of the defence sector , such as Pepsico , IBM , Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson , have received defence contracts and are all popular investments for both members of Congress and the general public , ” says CRP .
“ So common are these companies , both as personal investments and as defence contractors , it would appear difficult to build a diverse blue - chip stock portfolio without at least some of them , ” the group acknowledges .
If some of the stocks appear innocent , aides say legislators also are .
Some did not buy the stocks in question but inherited them .
Many hold them in blind trusts , so called because the investments are handled by independent entities , at least theoretically without the politicians ’ knowledge of how their assets are being managed .
Even so , according to CRP , owning stock in companies under contract with the Pentagon could prove “ problematic for members of Congress who sit on committees that oversee defence policy and budgeting . ”
Members of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees held 3.0 million – 5.1 million dollars in companies specialising in weapons and other exclusively military goods and services , it added .
Critics have assailed President George W. Bush and Vice President Richard Cheney for their ties to companies seen as benefiting from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars .
Bush was characterised as pushing conflict in the interest of the oil fraternity whence he hailed .
Before becoming vice president , Cheney headed Halliburton , a major player in the oil services industry and the object of controversies involving political connections , government contracts , and business ethics .
Halliburton ’s subsidiary , Kellogg Brown & Root , was given multi-billion - dollar contracts to provide construction , hospitality , and other services to the U.S. military following the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
The contracts drew fire because of Cheney ’s history and then - ongoing financial relationship with the firm , and because the company did not have to compete for the Pentagon ’s business .
The firm was renamed KBR Inc. after Halliburton spun it off last year .

New Hampshire voters are an inscrutable lot .
In northern New England , we admire the virtues of the strong silent type , like Calvin Coolidge , born in Vermont and sworn in there as the 30th President of the United States .
Coolidge was called " Silent Cal " and he oft expressed an affinity for keeping his thoughts to himself .
" I have noticed that nothing that I never said ever did me any harm , " he said .
And that holds true in New Hampshire as well .
The famous rock profile , the Old Man of the Mountain , sat atop Cannon Mountain for centuries without once expressing an opinion about anything .
So what were New Hampshire Republicans and independents who voted in the New Hampshire Republican presidential primary saying in voting for John McCain ?
Were they saying they are ignorant of McCain ’s profound indifference at best , or his contempt at worst , for the First Amendment ?
Or were they saying they share that indifference or contempt ?
I would guess probably not the latter .
New Hampshire voters , like those in the rest of the nation , have an uneasy feeling about the influence of money on the political process .
But if you put the Bi-Partisan Campaign Reform
Act of 2002 , with its undeniable abridgements of the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech , on the ballot in a referendum and had a reasonable campaign about it , it would probably lose .
No doubt a lot of money would be spent to defeat it , but a lot would be spent in support of it as well .
And I believe it would lose .
Yet it is the most well - known legislative achievement of U.S. Sen .
John McCain , R - Arizona , who is , after all a legislator and not Secretary of State or Secretary of the Defense .
People may like his approach to foreign policy or national defense , but his primary job over the past quarter century has been to make laws for the United States .
And if " McCain - Feingold " is his legislative showpiece , you may wonder what the losers were like .
For those who may have forgotten the import of McCain - Feingold , it imposed restrictions on political spending that were supposed to reduce the corrupting influence of money on political campaigns .
It placed limits on " soft " money that parties could contribute to individual candidates , along with restrictions on spending by unions and corporations , though " corporations " is a very broad term .
A political action committee is a corporation , usually registered as such with the state in which it operates .
The Wisconsin Right to Life Committee , Inc. is such a corporation .
In the fall of 2006 , Wisconsin Right to Life sought to run political advertisements calling on the state ’s two U.S. senators , Herb Kohl and Russell Feingold , to oppose filibusters and other procedural delays of votes on President Bush ’s judicial nominees .
The ads were ruled a violation of the McCain - Feingold law by the Federal Elections Commission because it mentioned both senators by name within 30 days of a primary and 60 days of a general election in which one of them ( Feingold ) was a candidate for election .
Ironic , is n’t it , that the law , which many denounced as an incumbent protection act , would so soon be applied to specifically protect one of the bill ’s sponsors , who was a candidate for reelection in ’06 .
It is also worth noting that the application of the law in this manner gives the lie to the argument commonly made in defense of campaign finance reform , that " money is not speech . "
Two points need to be made clear concerning that bogus argument .
First of all , the argument itself is misleading .
Money is not privacy , either .
But if , in violation of the Fourth Amendment guarantee of freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures , the state were to seize your money without a warrant , it would still be a violation of the Fourth Amendment .
And when the government prohibits you from spending your money to broadcast your message , that is a violation of the First Amendment ’s guarantee that Congress shall make no law " abridging the freedom of speech . "
Secondly , the provision that prohibits mention of a candidate ’s name is a control over the content , not the cost , of the ad .
I am not privy to the rates and conditions placed on commercials run on Wisconsin television stations , but I would hazard a guess that a 30 - second or 60 - second issue ad would cost the same , whether or not it mentions a candidate ’s name .
By prohibiting such mention , the law certainly controls the content of speech in a way that has nothing to do with obscenity , incitement to riot , slander or falsely crying " Fire ! " in a theater .
Anyone see a constitutional red flag here ?
But when Wisconsin Right to Life challenged the FEC ruling all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court , Sen . John McCain did not say , " Wait a minute !
This kind of prohibition is not at all what we meant when we wrote and passed McCain - Feingold . "
On the contrary , he filed an amicus curiae argument in support of the FEC position .
And the Supreme Court , in a hair - splitting , hand - wringing decision issued last year , said the ads were ( or would have been ) legal because all things considered , they really were n’t intended to influence the outcome of the election campaign in which Feingold was a candidate .
Oh .
So now it ’s legal for us to exercise the freedom of speech over the commercial airwaves as long as we are not trying to influence the outcome of an election .
Yet it is precisely for such a purpose , among others , that the right to exercise the freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Constitution .
Yet McCain apparently believes that in campaign finance reform there is a higher law than the Constitution — there is the McCain standard of purity .
" Obviously , from what we ’ve been seeing lately , we did n’t complete the job , " McCain said about campaign financing when interviewed on radio by Don Imus in the spring of 2006 .
" But I would rather have a clean government than one where quote First Amendment rights are being respected that has become corrupt .
If I had my choice , I ’d rather have the clean government . ”
McCain is entitled to his own personal " rathers , " but as a United States Senator his oath of office requires him to uphold the Constitution of the United States , not his righteous concept of cleanliness .
His attitude toward the First Amendment is nothing if not arrogant .
And more arrogance in disregard of the requirements written into the Bill of Rights is not what we need in the White House at any time , but especially after eight years of the Bush - Cheney regime .
We do n’t need John McCain in the Oval Office , attempting to " complete the job " of emasculating the First Amendment
No doubt some New Hampshire voters who chose McCain support the controversial law that bears his name .
Many others did so either having forgotten or having never informed themselves about McCain - Feingold .
Others knew of it , but preferred McCain for other reasons .
They are not " single - issue voters . "
But the Constitution of the United States is not a " single issue . "
It should not be an issue at all .
It is the " supreme law of the land , " higher even than Sen.
McCain ’s exalted sense of honor or his standard of cleanliness .
To overlook that is to overlook quite a lot .
As some wag said , " Other than that Mrs. Lincoln , how did you enjoy the play ? "
Other than that , New Hampshire , how do you like the Bill of Rights ?

( CNN ) -- Tensions were rising in Bolivia on Saturday as members of the country 's four highest natural gas - producing regions declared autonomy from the central government .
Ruben Costas , center , governor of Santa Cruz , celebrates as the Bolivian region declares autonomy Saturday .
Thousands waved the Santa Cruz region 's green - and - white flags in the streets as council members of the Santa Cruz , Tarija , Beni and Pando districts made the public announcement .
The officials displayed a green - bound document containing a set of statutes paving the way to a permanent separation from the Bolivian government .
Council representatives vowed to legitimize the so - called autonomy statutes through a referendum that would legally separate the natural - gas rich districts from President Evo Morales ' government .
The move also aims to separate the states from Bolivia 's new constitution , which calls for , among other things , a heavier taxation on the four regions to help finance more social programs .
" The statutes will be ratified , " said Oscar Ortiz , Santa Cruz senator .
" With a public referendum , the people of our region will legitimize their will . "
About 35 percent of Bolivia 's 9.5 million people live in the four states , according to The Associated Press .
Do n't Miss South America launches own bank
In the meantime , Bolivian network ATV showed what appeared to be armed , pro-government protesters creating blockades around the town of Yapacani , on the outskirts of Santa Cruz .
Some indigenous pro-Morales groups claim Bolivia 's richer , white - ruled Eastern regions want to control the country 's natural resources .
Bolivia has South America 's second - largest natural gas reserves , behind Venezuela .
Most of it is produced in the Eastern regions .
Watch Bolivian leader speak out »
In the capital city La Paz on Saturday , Morales addressed thousands of flag - waving supporters in the Plaza Murillo , defending the new constitution and lashing out against what he called the racist policies of Bolivia 's elite .
" They must give back the money they took from us , " he told a cheering crowd , which included members of the Quechua and Aymara tribes .
" We will retroactively investigate all the big fortunes , and the corrupt are now trembling with fear . "
Morales also cautioned those who he said want a " a division , a coup d'etat , " the AP reported .
" We wo n't permit Bolivia to be divided , " he warned .
Morales -- who belongs to the Aymara indigenous group -- nationalized the country 's oil and natural gas reserves when he took power in 2006 , creating what became known as the " gas wars . "
Running on a platform of redistribution of wealth among Bolivia 's poor , Morales has defied countries such as Brazil and the United States for the exploration of Bolivia 's natural reserves .
He has also protested the country 's racial divide .
" Bolivia is a nation among nations , " he said Saturday , referring to the diversity of Indian nations whose traditions date back centuries .
" We are not a country of blue - eyed , green - eyed folks only .
It 's a plurinational country made of dark - skinned and white - skinned .
This new constitution will unite us . "

Damn Small Linux / DSL was originally developed as an experiment to see how many usable desktop applications can fit inside a 50 MB live CD .
It was at first just a personal tool / toy .
But over time Damn Small Linux grew into a community project with hundreds of development hours put into refinements including a fully automated remote and local application installation system and a very versatile backup and restore system which may be used with any writable media including a hard drive , a floppy drive , or a USB device .
With Damn Small Linux you can :
Boot from a business card CD as a live linux distribution ( LiveCD )
Boot from a USB pen drive
Boot from within a host operating system ( that 's right , it can run * inside * Windows )
Run very nicely from an IDE Compact Flash drive via a method we call " frugal install "
Transform into a Debian OS with a traditional hard drive install
Run light enough to power a 486DX with 16MB of Ram
Run fully in RAM with as little as 128MB ( you will be amazed at how fast your computer can be ! )
Modularly grow -- DSL is highly extendable without the need to customize

This series of four still images were taken from an animation of Comet Encke flying through the solar storm as witnessed by the STEREO satellite .
Note Encke 's tail being torn off by the coronal mass ejection in the third still above .
A stormfrom the sun ripped a tail off a comet , and a NASA satellite captured the wholeevent .
Thespectacular cosmic crash occurred on April 20 when the sun cast out a coronalmass ejection ( CME ) , or large cloud of magnetized gas .
The tempest wasthrust directly in the path of Comet Encke , which was traveling around the sun , within the orbit of Mercury .
As the gasswept over the comet , its tail brightened and then was separated completelyfrom its parent icy rock and carried away .
NASA 's pairof Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory ( STEREO ) satellites captured thewhole incident in newly released imagesand video .
" Wewere awestruck when we saw these images , " said Angelos Vourlidas of the Naval Research Laboratory .
" This is the first time we 've witnessed acollision between a coronal mass ejection and a comet , and the surprise ofseeing the disconnection of the tail was the icing on the cake . "
Comets areicy leftovers from the solar system 's formation billions of years ago .
Theyoccasionally detour from their home in the cold , distant regions of the solarsystem , after a gravitational tug from a planet or another comet sends theminto the inner solar system .
The sun 'sheat vaporizes gas and dust from the ice core of the comet , forming its tail .
CMEs areviolent eruptions on the sun , with masses upwards of a few billion tonstraveling anywhere from 62 to 1,864 miles per second ( 100 to 3,000 kilometersper second ) .
They can cause geomagneticstorms in the Earth 's atmosphere , which can disrupt satellite and radiocommunications and sometimes disable satellites .
Whilescientists were aware that a comet 's tail would occasionally completelydisconnect and suspected CMEs were the culprit , this is the first observationof the violent event .
The NASAobservations are detailed in the Oct. 10 issue of Atmospheric JournalLetters .
Anotherstudy announced today showed comets can sometimes slowthe solar wind down , too .
Schumacher and wife Corinna
Schumacher , 38 , asked to take the wheel as he was running late for a flight .
" I found myself a passenger , which was strange enough , but having ' Schumi ' behind the wheel was incredible , " said taxi driver Tuncer Yilmaz .
" He drove at full throttle around the corners and overtook in some unbelievable places . "
606 : DEBATE
Schumacher had flown into the Bavarian town of Coburg to pick up an Australian Shepherd dog called Ed .
He was accompanied by his wife and children to pick up the puppy and the family were late getting back to the local aerodrome for their return flight .
After giving the cabbie an unforgettable experience , Schumacher also gave him a 100 Euro tip .
The dog will be the latest addition to the Schumacher family menagerie , which includes one dog that he brought home from Brazil when his wife Corinna fell for it as it wandered around as a stray while they were at the Grand Prix in Sao Paulo .
We 've all been taught that our bodies , the Earth , and in fact all matter in the universe is composed of tiny building blocks called atoms .
Now imagine if this were n't the case .
This mind - bending concept is at the core of the scientific research that one Florida State University professor -- and hundreds of his colleagues all over the world -- are pursuing .
" Recent scientific breakthroughs have shown that most of the matter in the universe -- about four - fifths -- is not made up of atoms , but of something else , called ' dark matter , ' " said Howard Baer , FSU's J.D. Kimel Professor of Physics .
" The evidence for dark matter is now overwhelming , and the required amount of dark matter is becoming precisely known . "
Baer explained that dark matter is believed to exist in the form of tiny particles that do not interact with light .
Because they do n't emit or reflect electromagnetic radiation the way atomic , or baryonic , matter does , these dark matter particles have n't been directly observed .
However , scientists have long theorized their existence based on their gravitational effects on visible matter throughout the universe .
" For example , the gravitational effect of dark matter makes galaxies spin faster than one would otherwise expect , " Baer said .
" Also , dark matter 's gravitational field distorts the light of objects behind it -- creating the so - called ' lensing effect . '
By measuring these sorts of phenomena , we can tell that the universe is full of some sort of ' stuff ' that we just can't see . "
Despite this progress , the exact identity of dark matter remains a mystery .
" Current constraints on dark matter properties show that the bulk of dark matter cannot be any of the known particles , " Baer said .
" The existence of dark matter is at present one of the strongest pieces of evidence that the current theory of fundamental particles and forces , summarized in the Standard Model of particle physics , is incomplete .
At the same time , because dark matter is the dominant form of matter in the universe , an understanding of its properties is essential to determine how galaxies formed and how the universe evolved .
Therefore , the discovery of dark matter is among the most important goals in science today . "
A theoretical physicist , Baer employs mathematical models and calculations , as opposed to experimental methods , in an attempt to understand the basic properties of dark matter .
To that end , he travels frequently to CERN , the world 's largest particle physics laboratory , located on the border between France and Switzerland .
At CERN , teams of physicists from all over the world are preparing for the start - up of what will be the world 's most powerful particle accelerator , the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , in 2008 .
With the LHC , they will conduct experiments that seek to solve some of the fundamental mysteries of science , including the identity of dark matter .
In addition to searches at the LHC , the hunt for dark matter is progressing at experiments deep underground in Minnesota , under thick Antarctic ice , and even in outer space .
Do n't expect any conclusive data right away , Baer said .
" The identification of dark matter will most likely not be immediate , but will rather unfold gradually , " he said .

Meet the alternative browsers — an unofficial term for all browsers other than the Big Five .
These browsers , in most cases , follow the lead of Opera , which is based on the open - source Chromium project ( as is Google Chrome ) .
Anyone can take the Chromium code and build their own browser from it , adding and removing whatever functionality they wish .
A similar case is Firefox , which is also an open - source project .
Keep in mind how often the Chromium engine is updated .
Chromium , like any other software , has bugs .
The developers behind it strive to eliminate those bugs , introduce performance fixes and minimize security threats .
This is why Google Chrome has a six - week update cycle .
It ’s also why other Chromium - based browsers should follow suit .
Most browsers try to keep up with Chromium releases , but some fall behind by six or seven versions , which is damaging to the user ’s online security and browser stability .
So , since alternative browsers are basically tweaked copies of bigger browsers , does that mean they are bad tools for productive web browsing ?
Absolutely not !
Alternative browsers aim to deliver improved performance and extra features to enhance the user ’s online experience .
They are a quick way to get a tool with all of the functionality a user needs right after installation .
Below are 15 desktop browsers that are worth considering if you ’re tired of the browser war champions .
This list is n’t comprehensive — several hundred browsers are available online — but these are the ones that regularly receive updates and provide a new web surfing experience .
We wo n’t delve into the development aspects behind each browser .
Instead , you ’ll find a quick overview of the most interesting features and of functionality that is n’t available in the popular browsers by default or even with add - ons .
We ’ll also mention the rendering engine used in each browser to give you an idea of how you will experience the web in them : Blink ( on which Chrome is based ) , Trident ( Internet Explorer ) , Gecko ( Firefox ) and WebKit ( Safari ) .
Let ’s start with those that have the most features and move towards more single - purpose browsers .
The Browsers
UC Browser
Operating system(s ) : Windows , Linux , Android , iOS , Windows Phone , Symbian , Java
Rendering engine(s ) : Blink
Key feature(s ) : most cross-platform , distinctive UI
UC Browser is one of the most cross-platform browsers — you can even make it work on an old Symbian device .
This is n’t the only reason to check it out .
The well - rounded design and smooth animation of all elements make UC Browser feel fresh and modern .
An up - to - date Chromium engine contributes to browser ’s security .
To begin , you choose how a new tab will look : a bubble - like speed - dial UI or a more traditional layout .
UC Browser offers a cloud account for all of your settings , bookmarks and extensions from the Chrome Web Store , a decent alternative to the whole Google ecosystem .
Downloading files is another notable aspect of UC Browser .
The downloads manager is n’t advanced ( you ca n’t download torrents or online video ) , but it ’s rather unique .
It is the only browser that sorts downloads by category , helping you navigate gigabytes of files .
The browser can even download files to the dedicated UC Cloud Storage .
Although its capacity is small , 2 GB , this is a useful feature for mobile devices because you do n’t have to wait for downloads to finish .
UC Browser does n’t focus only on security , file downloads and social networks .
This browser aims to appeal to a wide audience , without dictating how it is to be used .
Most Chromium browsers can be considered an improved version of Chrome somewhat , whereas UC Browser is more of a new Chrome .
Maxthon
Operating system(s ) : Windows , Mac OS X , Linux , Android , iOS , Windows Phone
Rendering engine(s ) : Trident , Blink
Key feature(s ) : cross-platform , own ecosystem
Maxthon is a popular Chinese browser available for desktop and mobile platforms .
It incorporates two rendering engines and packs an abundance of features , including split - screen view , a built - in proxy manager , ad - blocking and moderate acceleration of downloads .
By logging in with Maxthon Passport ( analogous to a Google Account ) , all of your settings , tabs , extensions and passwords are synced across multiple devices .
Maxthon ’s UI is a mixed bag .
On the one hand , it ’s a fresh interface for managing tabs , extensions and all of the added functionality .
However , most of the extra features are available via yet another sidebar , which might be an annoyance for some users .
The RSS reader , downloads manager , note - taking app and games are not the most necessary extensions , but they can be uninstalled .
Maxthon has its own extensions service , but you ’re not likely to find a lot of your favorite Chrome or Firefox plugins .
Despite all of the rough edges , Maxthon is a powerful yet resource - light browser .
You can monitor resource consumption in a customizable toolbar at the bottom of the window , which is a nice touch .
For cross - platform use , Maxthon is certainly a great option .
It ’s smooth and fast , but filled with features and extensions that not everyone might want .
This leads us to an interesting alternative .
MxNitro
Operating system(s ) : Windows
Rendering engine(s ) : Blink
Key feature(s ) : minimalist , fast
MxNitro is a different take on Maxthon .
With speed the focus , this browser is like a stripped - down version of Maxthon , with almost nothing except basic functionality .
MxNitro is minimalist , lightweight and speedy .
It ’s fast to install and ready for browsing immediately — no need to tinker with the settings because none are available .
There are no extensions , no cloud syncing and no downloads manager .
The sole purpose of MxNitro is to enable you to browse the web with no clutter , distraction or resource drain .
It ’s not perfect yet .
The developers are improving the browser , promising to make it available on other platforms and to integrate ad - blocking .
The biggest problem with MxNitro is the absence of a convenient bookmarks manager or speed dial .
There is a quick launch menu with some predefined websites , but users ca n’t customize it .
MxNitro might be the perfect solution for people on old PCs or with low demands .
Torch
Operating system(s ) : Windows
Rendering engine(s ) : Blink
Key feature : multimedia - oriented
Torch aims to be a powerful media - consumption center , rather than a straightforward browser .
It is Chromium - based , heavily restyled , with some added functionality .
The new tab page boasts a customizable , minimalist yet stylish design , while the toolbar sports shortcuts to all media features available in the browser .
The Torch Music app is a shortcut to the web app of the same name , a music - streaming service with many popular artists and albums .
However , all of the music comes from YouTube ; hence , the rather low sound quality .
Torch Games is a Flash games collection that helps you kill time at work .
The Facelift tool ( a Facebook theme changer ) and the share button make it a convenient tool for social - networking fans .
Torch ’s downloads manager delivers files somewhat faster than Chrome , but it often has bugs and crashes .
Torch can also download torrents and magnet links , which are handled not in the downloads manager but in a separate tab .
The feature to play videos in the browser while they are being downloaded , while not yet completed , is an interesting alternative to watching videos online .
Videos can be downloaded from streaming services such as YouTube , Vimeo , Daily Motion , etc .
Torch has several mild annoyances , though .
It tends to display popups to explain features , and it asks you to spread the word about it in social networks .
If you do n’t need some of the features , there ’s no easy way to remove them , and the developers do n’t seem to hurry to update the Chromium engine , which can result in security vulnerabilities .
Despite all this , Torch is a great experience for movie , music and social - network lovers .
Citrio
Operating system(s ) : Windows , Mac
Rendering engine(s ) : Blink
Key feature (s ) : fast downloads , timely updates
At the time of writing , Citrio does the best job of making timely Chromium updates , helping with security , bug fixes and implementation of new features .
The browser is a lot like Chrome , but it looks simpler and performs better .
Citrio is a simple yet powerful browser for file downloads and media consumption .
The downloads manager is used for normal downloads , torrents and magnet links alike , without particularly differentiating between them , and it is comfortable to use .
The speed boost and the ability to resume downloads in case of a failed connection make Citrio a great tool for downloading large files .
In addition to its useful downloads manager , Citrio comes with a bunch of extensions .
While the YouTube downloader and the video player for downloads in progress will be well received by some users , the news reader and social sharer are very basic .
There are better alternatives in the Chrome Web Store .
And if you do n’t like a particular extension , it can be easily removed .
Overall , Citrio is a nice downloads - oriented Chrome alternative that wo n’t confuse new users .
Baidu Browser
Operating system(s ) : Windows , Android , Windows Phone
Rendering engine(s ) : Blink
Key feature(s ) : video downloader , social media integration
Baidu browser is a Chinese offering oriented around social media and downloads .
It supports Chrome extensions , and Facebook and WhatsApp extensions are preinstalled ( but can be deleted ) .
Baidu is based on Chromium but has separate URL and search boxes , reminiscent of Firefox .
Browser skins can be swapped , and the speed - dial panel with preinstalled bookmarks can be customized .
Baidu has an integrated BitTorrent client , with an option to limit the downloads thread so that it does n’t interfere with other downloads or the buffering of online videos .
There is also a capture tool and an online video downloader , which is the most convenient function of Baidu .
This is a rare example of a browser that lets you choose the quality of video to download and has a separate button for downloading MP3 audio .
Online video can also be given a separate window , allowing users watch it without having to keep a tab open for YouTube .
Unlike UC Browser , Baidu is n’t much different from Chrome , although it tries to be .
Its fast startup time , advanced YouTube functionality and downloading tricks make it useful for media consumption .
Sleipnir
Operating system(s ) : Windows , Mac OS X , Android , iOS , Windows Phone
Rendering engine(s ) : Blink
Key feature(s ) : pleasant fonts , tab grouping
Sleipnir is a Japanese web browser based on the Blink engine ; hence , Chrome users will find it familiar .
The browser strongly resembles Safari , bringing not only the Mac OS X design , but also standard Mac fonts .
Sleipnir renders fonts similarly to the Mac , appearing rounder and thicker .
The merit of the effect is highly subjective , but reading text in Sleipnir is a pleasant experience that is difficult to ignore .
However , fonts are n’t all Sleipnir has to offer .
Instead of providing favicons and tab names , Sleipnir displays thumbnails of opened pages , making navigation somewhat easier .
The thumbnails are a nice touch when five or six tabs are opened , but more can get cumbersome .
This is where Sleipnir ’s groups kick in : Tabs can be sorted by topic for easier navigation ; for example , keeping personal websites separate from work - related ones .
Because Sleipnir is available on multiple platforms , you can use Fenrir Pass ( analogous to a Google Account ) to sync tabs , groups and passwords and to send pages to your smartphone .
The browser supports mouse and touchpad gestures , as well as Chrome extensions .
Performance and speed are good , but Sleipnir has a steep learning curve because of its unusual design and workflow .
If you ’re willing to try it out , the experience may be very rewarding .
Epic
Operating system(s ) : Windows , Mac OS X
Rendering engine(s ) : Blink
Key feature : security and privacy
Epic is the only privacy - oriented browser on this list .
That ’s mainly due to the more regular updates of the Chromium engine compared to other popular browsers in this field ( for example , WhiteHat Aviator and Comodo Dragon ) .
It ’s usually several versions behind Chrome , but that ’s better than the alternatives .
Epic is designed for a secure browsing experience out of the box .
You could argue that users can add a bunch of extensions to Chrome and get the same effect , but not every user knows how to do that or knows what exactly needs to be blocked .
Epic is basically Chrome with no strings attached to Google :
No data gets sent or collected , trackers are blocked , AdBlock comes preinstalled , and a convenient one - click proxy switcher will hide your IP address .
Users also have a measure of control over what to block .
When you click the umbrella icon , Epic visualizes what services are tracking you and shows toggles for add - ons , data encryption , ad - blocking and notifications .
Lunascape
Operating system(s ) : Windows , Android , iOS
Rendering engine(s ) : Trident , Gecko , WebKit
Key feature : multiple rendering engines
Lunascape is a simple cross-platform web browser that takes advantage of its three rendering engines .
This feature is backed up by a cascading view of web pages .
With it , you can display one or several websites in the browser without having to open a separate window .
The highlighted search lets you search a selected term from multiple sources .
Lunascape also has a ticker that displays new headlines from selected sources in the toolbar .
This functionality can be expanded with a number of Internet Explorer and Firefox add - ons , as well as by some Lunascape exclusives .
While the browser does n’t look modern , performance and resource consumption are good .
Lunascape ’s trump card — the ability to open a website with any rendering engine — will be useful for compatibility .
GreenBrowser
Operating system(s ) : Windows
Rendering engine(s ) : Trident
Key feature : enhanced Internet Explorer experience
GreenBrowser is based on Internet Explorer .
There ’s nothing fancy about it :
The experience is pretty basic , the design reminiscent of Internet Explorer 8 , and there is almost no advance functionality or plugins to compete with Chrome’s .
However , GreenBrowser still gets updates , performance is good , pages load quickly , and the user has everything they need for simple web browsing .
Nevertheless , GreenBrowser integrates many useful features : ad - blocking , speed - dial , drag - and - drop options , mouse gestures and a “ boss ” button to quickly hide the browser .
A nice touch is the clock in the browser ’s bottom taskbar , which makes full - screen mode a little more convenient .
This is how Internet Explorer should have looked and functioned years ago .
If MxNitro is a little raw for you , try GreenBrowser .
SlimBrowser
Operating system(s ) : Windows
Rendering engine(s ) : Trident
Key feature(s ) : lightweight , fast
SlimBrowser is an improved version of Internet Explorer .
The lightweight installer delivers a full - featured and fast browser with a customizable taskbar .
Built in is a YouTube downloader , a weather forecast widget , ad - blocking , Facebook support , a form filler , a popup blocker and a lot of other nice details .
SlimBrowser has a downloads manager , although not as powerful as the ones in Chromium - based alternatives .
It might be not much , but for the fans of Internet Explorer , SlimBrowser probably works better than it .
And , as advertised , it launches and loads pages much faster .
PirateBrowser
Operating system(s ) : Windows
Rendering engine(s ) : Gecko
Key feature : integrated Tor client
PirateBrowser is a project developed by the Pirate Bay team and whose main purpose is to overcome governmental restrictions on certain websites .
It basically consists of Firefox , Portable Edition + Vidalia + the FoxyProxy add - on .
Vidalia is a user - friendly GUI for the Tor anonymity network , which reroutes your Internet traffic .
Once you launch PirateBrowser ( which does n’t require installation ) , Vidalia automatically connects you to the Tor network , launching Firefox thereafter .
FoxyProxy switches the user ’s Internet connection across multiple URL proxy servers .
PirateBrowser wo n’t give you absolute anonymity on the Internet , but it ’s a great starter kit for circumventing online censorship .
Tungsten
Operating system(s ) : Windows
Rendering engine(s ) : Blink , Trident
Key feature : built - in file manager
At a first glance , Tungsten seems like nothing special .
It ’s a minimalist Blink and Trident browser with typical performance .
It supports Chrome extensions , and its design is similar to Internet Explorer 10’s .
The interesting part is that Tungsten is not only for the web , but also a browser for your local files and apps .
Software such as Clover creates a tabbed browsing experience for Windows Explorer .
Tungsten turns this idea upside down .
The browser opens Windows Explorer inside a tab , so you can navigate your folders , open files and launch programs .
While not revolutionary , it ’s nice to find a feature that comes close to the ChromeOS concept of doing everything in the browser .
In Development
Vivaldi
Operating system(s ) : Windows , Mac OS X , Linux
Rendering engine(s ) : Blink
Key feature (s ) : highly customizable , tab stacking
Developed by a team of ex-Opera developers , Vivaldi is being created to repeat the initial success of Opera and satisfy fans of the original browser .
So far , we ’ve gotten four technical previews of the browser but not a full release .
It ’s too early to judge , but Vivaldi already shows some interesting features .
The design is flat and minimalist and stands out from the crowd .
The color palette changes according to the current website ’s predominant colors .
Speed - dial is most certainly present , so there ’s no need for that add - on .
Page action is new :
You can control a page ’s colors and fonts , apply filters and distort it as much as you like .
It ’s more of a gimmick , but the feature could find useful applications .
Just like in Opera , you can stack tabs into groups .
Because of this , tab previews make a lot more sense than in other browsers .
Notes can be left on any page , and future versions promise a Vivaldi mail service .
Once Vivaldi leaves beta ( or the technical preview stage ) , we can expect a powerful competitor in the browsers war .
Project Maelstrom
Operating system(s ) : Windows
Rendering engine(s ) : Blink
Key feature : P2P web browsing
Project Maelstrom is “ the world ’s first torrent - based browser . ”
Maelstrom receives web content from peer networks instead of the servers that host the website .
This is done for the purpose of distributing web content and making it independent of the hosting servers .
In case a server goes down ( whether because of malfunction or government restriction ) , the content will still be available because many people have it and are willing to share .
Maelstrom is Chromium - based and is Chrome in every other respect — functionality , navigation , extensions , etc .
You ’re not limited to P2P - distributed websites ; you also get access via HTTP and HTTPS .
The problem with Maelstrom is that few websites support this technology .
When you first access a P2P website ( a list is available on the browser ’s home page ) , you ’ll download its pages using a magnet link .
Hence , the process takes more time than usual .
Maelstrom is an interesting idea and , because it ’s still in beta , needs more time to get polished and popularized .
Conclusion
The combination of new features and familiar workflow makes alternative browsers a convenient way to transform your web - surfing experience .
Most people will be well off choosing an alternative browser based on their current favorite .
That way , they ’ll be able to get the most out of new features without having to adapt to a new environment .
The best part is that you do n’t need to make a full switch .
You can select a browser that boosts performance or introduces functionality that your main browser lacks and use it for that purpose only .
Eventually , you might even forget that you ’re not using Chrome , Firefox or Internet Explorer .
Also , not everyone needs the full power of Chrome or the customization of Firefox .
Less is more , and sometimes all you need is a fast and reliable way to access a search engine .
This is what alternative browsers give users who are willing to try something new : the possibility to bend the Internet to their needs and preferences .

This elegant model by Garrett Lisi may at last reveal the link between gravity and the other fundamental forces of nature
GARRETT LISI is an unlikely individual to be staking a claim for a theory of everything .
He has no university affiliation and spends most of the year surfing in Hawaii .
In winter , he heads to the mountains near Lake Tahoe , California , to teach snowboarding .
Until recently , physics was not much more than a hobby .
That has n’t stopped some leading physicists sitting up and taking notice after Lisi made his theory public on the physics pre-print archive this week ( www.arxiv.org/abs/0711.0770).
By analysing the most elegant and intricate pattern known to mathematics , Lisi has uncovered a relationship underlying all the universe ’s particles and forces , including gravity – or so he hopes .
Lee Smolin at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics ( PI ) in Waterloo , Ontario , Canada , describes Lisi ’s work as “ fabulous ” .
“ It is one of the most compelling unification models I ’ve seen in many , many years , ” he says .
That ’s some achievement , as physicists have been trying to find a uniform framework for the fundamental forces and particles ever since they developed the standard model more than 30 years ago .
The standard model successfully weaves together three of the four fundamental forces of nature : the electromagnetic force ; the strong force , which binds quarks together in atomic nuclei ; and the weak force , which controls radioactive decay .
The problem has been that gravity has so far refused to join the party .

 For decades , physicists have been trying to find a uniform framework for the fundamental forces and particles 
Most attempts to bring gravity into the picture have been based on string theory , which proposes that particles are ultimately composed of minuscule strings .
Lisi has never been a fan of string theory and says that it ’s because of pressure to step into line that he abandoned academia after his PhD .
“ I ’ve never been much of a follower , so I walked off to search for my own theory , ” he says .
Last year , he won a research grant from the charitably funded Foundational Questions Institute to pursue his ideas .
He had been tinkering with “ weird ” equations for years and getting nowhere , but six months ago he stumbled on a research paper analysing E8 – a complex , eight - dimensional mathematical pattern with 248 points .
He noticed that some of the equations describing its structure matched his own .
“ The moment this happened my brain exploded with the implications and the beauty of the thing , ” says Lisi .
“ I thought : ‘ Holy crap , that ’s it ! ' ”
 The moment this happened my brain exploded with the implications .
I thought : ‘ Holy crap , that ’s it !’
What Lisi had realised was that if he could find a way to place the various elementary particles and forces on E8 ’s 248 points , it might explain , for example , how the forces make particles decay , as seen in particle accelerators .
Lisi is not the first person to associate particles with the points of symmetric patterns .
In the 1950s , Murray Gell - Mann and colleagues correctly predicted the existence of the “ omega - minus ” particle after mapping known particles onto the points of a symmetrical mathematical structure called SU ( 3 ) .
This exposed a blank slot , where the new particle fitted .
Before tackling the daunting E8 , Lisi examined a smaller cousin , a hexagonal pattern called G2 , to see if it would explain how the strong nuclear force works .
According to the standard model , forces are carried by particles : for example , the strong force is carried by gluons .
Every quark has a quantum property called its “ colour charge ” – red , green or blue – which denotes how the quarks are affected by gluons .
Lisi labelled points on G2 with quarks and anti-quarks of each colour , and with various gluons , and found that he could reproduce the way that quarks are known to change colour when they interact with gluons , using nothing more than high - school geometry ( see Graphic ) .
Turning to the geometry of the next simplest pattern in the family , Lisi found he was able to explain the interactions between neutrinos and electrons by using the star - like F4 .
The standard model already successfully describes the electroweak force , uniting the electromagnetic and the weak forces .
Lisi added gravity into the mix by including two force - carrying particles called “ e- phi ” and “ omega ” , to the F4 diagram – creating a “ gravi-electroweak ” force .
Finally , he filled in most of the 248 points of the E8 pattern , using various “ identities ” of the 40 known particles and forces .
For example , some particles can have quantum spin values that are either up or down , and each of these identities would sit on a different point .
He filled the remaining 20 gaps with notional particles , for example those that some physicists predict to be associated with gravity .
With the points on the E8 pattern occupied , he could rotate it using computer simulations and so project it down in various ways to two dimensions .
By rotating it a certain way , he found that he could recreate the earlier basic patterns describing the quark - gluon relationship and his gravi-electroweak force .
As he rotated the shape further , he found even more intriguing patterns .
For example , in one configuration , you can see the gravi-electroweak interaction pattern surrounded by quarks and anti-quarks congregated into their individually “ coloured ” groups ( visit www.newscientist.com/article/dn12891 to watch an animation of the pattern ’s rotation ) .
What ’s more , these quarks cluster into families of three , with almost identical properties but different masses .
Physicists have long puzzled over why elementary particles appear to belong to such families , but this arises naturally from the geometry of E8 , he says .
So far , all the interactions predicted by the complex geometrical relationships inside E8 match with observations in the real world .
“ As far as I have been able to tell , it ’s a perfect match of tens of thousands of interactions , ” says Lisi .
“ How cool is that ? ”
Lisi is specially pleased that his model is “ without strings , extra space - time dimensions or other weird inventions that there ’s no evidence for ” , which bedevil string theory .
The maths is simpler , too , which he says makes it even more compelling .
Compared with string theory , “ this uses baby mathematics , ” he says .
Other physicists are impressed .
“ Some incredibly beautiful stuff falls out of Lisi ’s theory , ” says David Ritz Finkelstein at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta .
“ I think that this must be more than coincidence and he really is touching on something profound . ”
The question of why our universe should be controlled by the E8 structure is not one that Lisi tackles .
“ I think the universe is pure geometry – basically , a beautiful shape twisting around and dancing over space - time , ” says Lisi .
“ Since E8 is perhaps the most beautiful structure in mathematics , it is very satisfying that nature appears to have chosen this geometry . ”
Finkelstein , however , plans to investigate whether space - time could be described as a quilt woven together from E8 patches .
Sabine Hossenfelder , also at PI , argues that Lisi ’s idea could be complementary to string theory , rather than a radical alternative .
She points out that string theorists already use E8 to describe a pattern of extra-dimensional space called the Calabi - Yau manifold , which they propose exists alongside the three dimensions that we see .
“ Is this a coincidence ? ” she asks .
The crucial test of Lisi ’s work will come only when he has made testable predictions .
Lisi himself accepts this , saying that although his theory is beautiful to him , “ nature may disagree ” .
To fill E8 entirely will require more than 20 new particles not envisaged by the standard model .
Lisi is now calculating the masses that these particles should have , in the hope that they may be spotted when the Large Hadron Collider – being built at CERN , near Geneva in Switzerland – starts up next year .
“ This is an all - or - nothing kind of theory – it ’s either going to be exactly right , or spectacularly wrong , ” says Lisi .
“ I ’m the first to admit this is a long shot .
But it ai n’t over till the LHC sings . ”
 This is an all - or - nothing kind of theory – it ’s either going to be exactly right , or spectacularly wrong 
WASHINGTON , Oct. 11 — The director of the Central Intelligence Agency , Gen. Michael V. Hayden , has ordered an unusual internal inquiry into the work of the agency ’s inspector general , whose aggressive investigations of the C.I.A. ’s detention and interrogation programs and other matters have created resentment among agency operatives .
A small team working for General Hayden is looking into the conduct of the agency ’s watchdog office , which is led by Inspector General John L. Helgerson .
Current and former government officials said the review had caused anxiety and anger in Mr. Helgerson ’s office and aroused concern on Capitol Hill that it posed a conflict of interest .
The review is particularly focused on complaints that Mr. Helgerson ’s office has not acted as a fair and impartial judge of agency operations but instead has begun a crusade against those who have participated in controversial detention programs .
Any move by the agency ’s director to examine the work of the inspector general would be unusual , if not unprecedented , and would threaten to undermine the independence of the office , some current and former officials say .
What Are " Otherkin " ?
The premise is simple ... it's the same for vampires as it is faeries , were , angels , demons , etc ...
Non-human souls being born into human bodies / families .
This can also get fringe meaning by said non -human soul having children , who while human , posses an ingrained level of magick / power similar in nature to that of a full otherkin .
That 's the hereditary side of things .
Mostly seems to happen with fae and is generally referred to with terms like " Fae gifts " ( the natural in - born magick of the fae , but not actually possessing a fae soul ) , or " bloodkin " ( children / family of those who are otherkin that have either gifts themselves or have just learned the realities of it all because of the existence of otherkin in their lives )
The thing is , it 's an overused term just as much as vampire is .
Everyone flocks to the term because everyone has some reason or another to think they are not - quite - human .
By the strictest definition though , unless you actually for a fact , have a non -human soul , you can't really call yourself " otherkin . "
Now ... what is speculated is this .
There are multiple realms / dimensions / realities / etc. in which there are other races .
Somehow - for unknown reasons - the souls of those races can cross to THIS realm / dimension / reality / etc. and be born as humans .
But , they are really not human .
Most posses magickal gifts , talent , powers , needs , and memories that move WAY past that of " normal " humans .
Most have a deep longing to go " home " but do n't know what or where it is they are longing for .
Most feel very out of touch or place with modern life , finding themselves different from a very early age and possibly even stating things as young children that adults pass off as " fantasy . "
Many otherkin grow up and grow out of these memories and magicks because they are EXPECTED TO .
Sometimes , they will come to a point much later in life where they re-awaken that part of themselves .
Most however , who fall " asleep " ( meaning , they completely forget their true nature and burry their magick and memories somewhere they do n't even know how to find them anymore ) do n't ever wake up .
At one point in time , I believe that the veils / barriers / mists / etc. between the worlds ( realms / dimensions / whatever you want to call them ) were illusionary and otherkin could walk along the earth without having to first assume human bodies .
I believe that at one point , what we now consider " fairy tales " were really just otherkin in their natural form .
But , as humanity grew , changed , learned science over belief , the barriers grew and the possibility faded .
Now , you can't have an dragon be in this world in their true form for example , because no one could handle the existence of one .
It 's hard on the net to find things that are real .
Most people simply like faeries and dragons and such but have no real knowledge or fact .
They are not otherkin , nor do they truly know what it means to BE otherkin .
I do n't think there is any particular " test " other then most know as children what they are and they simply have to survive with that knowledge in tact in a world that tells them to dismiss it .
Some people claim they can see the difference in an otherkin 's aura , but I 've never pursued this in person .
Some have strong astral ability and take their natural form there .
Common Traits / Talents
Very Energy and more often Nature Aware .
-- Ability to " talk " to the wind , water , trees , etc .
-- Ability to " hear " them reply
-- A deeper , different , and more intense connection to the earth
-- A deeper , different , and more intense connection to the magickal / astral / dream / etc .
-- A strong connection with the stars , sun , moon , or celestial is common
Most otherkin DO tend to have higher then average IQ's * see footnote
-- Mostly believed to be an extension of using more of one 's mind and potential .
-- Strong abilities in one field , poor in others ( generally more liberal and arts minded )
-- A strong sense of knowledge and need to learn ( probably on ones own time and in their own way though )
Being overly sensitive to the " normal " senses
-- Hearing light , seeing smells .
Sounds weird , but seems oddly universal .
-- Loving or hating sunlight - finding it either charging or draining .
-- Whines from electronics easily heard , perfumes easily smelled , etc .
-- Strong loves and hates of food and flavors
-- The ability to " get lost in " or " drown " in pleasing colors
-- To be emotionally moved by a site of Beauty
Empathy and / or mild Telepathy .
-- This can sometimes gets to be a literal headache .
-- May show up in childhood and be repressed for awhile or kept secret though school years .
-- Just " knowing " when someone lies or tells the truth
-- Getting a " feeling " about the nature of a person and their intentions
-- Ability to convey a thought / emotion / need to another unspoken
-- It seems like a natural extension of oneself .
( I know I 'm blind when I can't read someone or if I 'm in such a large crowd that I get overloaded .
Separation and Feeling Out of Touch
-- Sometimes even a very " protective " feeling towards others ?
-- The counter of this is feeling very " dominant " towards others
-- Feeling " one step behind " of the crowd
-- Having a speeding or slowing of Time ** Footnotes :
Is it possible to be " partially " otherkin ?
No , you are or you are not .
But , keep in mind that not only otherkin are able to do these things .
And that the things in this list are only a generalization of commonly seen traits - not a mandatory check list .
Are these traits / talents limited to otherkin or can " normal " humans have them as well ?
Normal non -kin humans DO have the capability for magicks and such and there are some who are just much more Aware and in touch with their psychic abilities and such .
In short , you can be a human psychic displaying symptoms listed or you can be otherkin displaying symptoms listed ( or not ) .
Can you tell me if I 'm otherkin ?
Unfortunately , over the net , it 's hard to say one way or another so I do n't .
It 's just something you need to discover for yourself .
What is an " average " IQ ?
" A normal intelligence quotient ( IQ ) ranges from 85 to 115 ( According to the Stanford - Binet scale ) .
Only approximately 1 % of the people in the world have an IQ of 135 or over . "
I think it 's " cool " to be otherkin ; or , I like something weird , does that make me otherkin ?
" It saddens me that already being Kin has become a very trendy thing , particularly among the high - school and college crowds as another way of being unique and different .
Feeling a separation from your peers does not make you kin .
Feeling an attraction to something different does not make you kin . " ( quote from EM Poster , Halyn )
Votes cast yesterday on e-voting machines made by Election Systems & Software went to the wrong candidates , according to officials in Lawrence County , Ohio .
Although a tally printed from the machines at the end of the day and posted on the door of a county precinct got the numbers correct – 374 votes for Bill Robinson in the Hamilton Township trustee position and 170 votes for Allan Blankenship – a tabulation machine at the county 's headquarters flipped the numbers and gave 374 to Blankenship and 170 to Robinson .
Officials noticed the problem when they compared the two tallies .
Lawrence County Election Director Catherine Overbeck told me that officials have called in technicians from ES&S to investigate the problem .
She did n't say how they determined that the report from the voting machines was correct and the one from the tabulation machine incorrect .
The votes on the tabulation machine are tallied from memory cartridges retrieved from the voting machines .
Overbeck said this was the only race affected in this way on a ballot that included more than 100 races .
Voting activists say that this is one reason why all voting districts that use electronic voting machines should be required to post a tally from each machine on the door of precincts at the end of the day – so that voters and candidates can independently compare those tallies to the county 's final results and catch problems like this .
I 'll update if I get more information .

A couple of years ago I was talking to a couple of friends of mine who were doing some work at eBay .
It 's always interesting to hear about the techniques people use on high volume sites , but perhaps one of the most interesting tidbits was that eBay mostly hardly ever uses database transactions .
For most people , coming into a transactionless environment is quite a shock .
Using transactions is a very accepted part of working with databases .
A lot of people , including myself , see transactions as one of the key benefits that databases give you .
The rationale for not using transactions was that they harm performance at the sort of scale that eBay deals with .
This effect is exacerbated by the fact that eBay heavily partitions its data into many , many physical databases .
As a result using transactions would mean using distributed transactions , which is a common thing to be wary of .
This heavy partitioning , and the database 's central role in performance issues , means that eBay does n't use many other database facilities .
Referential integrity and sorting are done in application code .
There 's hardly any triggers or stored procedures .
My immediate follow - up to the news of transactionless was to ask what the consequences were for the application programmer , in particular the overall feeling about transactionlessness .
The reply was that it was odd at first , but ended up not being a big deal - much less of a problem than you might think .
You have to pay attention to the order of your commits , getting the more important ones in first .
At each commit you have to check that it succeeded and decide what to do if it fails .
This style of programming intrigued me , but since I was told about it quietly , I would n't talk about it more widely .
I can now because Dan Pritchett gave a fascinating talk at QCon this week about eBay 's architecture , including this aspect .
( He also talked about this in an interview and there 's a useful pdf info - deck . )
I 'd like to see more about the details of programming without transactions in this kind of manner .
Apart from the fact that it 's always worth thinking about alternatives , it 's also the case that transactionlessness is more common than many people think .
It 's common to have multi-step business processes with multiple resources that either would need long - running distributed transactions , or resources that have no support for transactions .
We should n't read too much into this .
Nobody is arguing that we should tear transactions out of our toolkit .
I do n't know enough details about eBay to judge whether avoiding transactions is the right approach even for them .
But eBay 's example suggests that living without transactions is far less impossible than many people think .
When half of a media outlet ’s editorial staff decides to jump ship , chances are it will be reported first on the media gossip blog Gawker — even , it turns out , when those departures are from Gawker itself .
In a posting Friday afternoon , Emily Gould , a Gawker editor , dropped the bomb : both she and Choire Sicha , the site ’s top editor , were quitting .
A third editor , Joshua David Stein , confirmed on Saturday that he was leaving , too .
Gawker ’s three remaining staff members were all hired within the last three months .
“ Most of my frustration with the job is of my own making , ” Mr. Sicha said by telephone on Saturday .
“ I ’ve completely lost my taste for management , and the thing I realized is that the talent has all the fun . ”
This will mark the second departure from Gawker for Mr. Sicha ( whose name is pronounced Corey See- ka ) ; he left in 2004 after a year and returned in February after a stint at The New York Observer .
He said he did not have a new job lined up .

Now that the NYPD has handled the murder problem in New York City ( 2007 is on pace to have the lowest rate on record ) , they are turning to other issues .
The New York Times reports of a new police sting operation :
At first , an epidemic of absent - mindedness seemed to have broken out .
One purse was found just sitting on a display shelf in the shoe department at Macy’s .
Another one turned up downstairs , in Macy ’s Cellar .
Yet another rested on a chair in a Midtown McDonald ’s , left by a woman who had stepped into the restroom .
In fact , all three items had been planted by police officers in plainclothes during the previous six weeks .
And the three people who picked them up were arrested , and now face indictment on charges that could land them in state prison .
Nine months ago , a similar police decoy program called Operation Lucky Bag was effectively shut down by prosecutors and judges who were concerned that it was sweeping up the civic - minded alongside those bent on larceny .
Shopping bags , backpacks and purses were left around the subway system , then stealthily watched by undercover officers .
They arrested anyone who took the items and walked past a police officer in uniform without reporting the discovery .
Now , a new version of the operation has started to catch people in public places outside the subways , and at much higher stakes , Criminal Court records show .
Unlike the initial program , in which the props were worth at most a few hundred dollars , the bags are now salted with real American Express cards , issued under pseudonyms to the Police Department .
Because the theft of a credit card is grand larceny , a Class E felony , those convicted could face sentences of up to four years .
The charges in the first round of Operation Lucky Bag were nearly all petty larceny , a misdemeanor , with a maximum penalty of one year in jail .

When radiation oncologist Michael Tomblyn recently saw a 21 - year - old patient whose eye was protruding from its socket , he turned to his fellow physicians for help .
Dozens of doctors offered suggestions , including fungal infection , HIV - associated lymphoma or a cocaine - associated sinus problem , eventually steering him toward the correct answer : rhabdomyosarcoma , a fast - growing cancer most often observed in young children .
The diagnosis did n't take place in a doctor 's lounge .
It happened on Sermo.com , a social - networking site for licensed physicians , which Dr. Tomblyn and 25,000 doctors like him visit regularly to consult with colleagues specializing in areas from dermatology to psychiatry .
" It is a way for us to commiserate and know we are still talking to others like us , " says 36 - year - old Dr. Tomblyn , who works for the University of Minnesota Medical Center .
Social networking , popularized by teens sharing information with their friends online on Web sites such as Facebook Inc. , is now blooming in the business world , thanks to new social networks that enable professionals and executives in industries such as advertising and finance to rub virtual elbows with colleagues .
Millions of professionals already turn to broad - based networking sites like LinkedIn to swap job details and contact information , often for recruiting purposes .

The nanotechnology experts at the Technion institute in Haifa say the text measures less than 0.5 square millimeter ( 0.01 square inch ) surface .
They chose the Jewish Bible to highlight how vast quantities of information can be stored in minimum amounts of space .
" It took us about an hour to etch the 300,000 words of the Bible onto a tiny silicon surface , " Ohad Zohar , the university 's scientific adviser for educational programs , told the Associated Press .
The Technion 's microscopic bible was created by blasting tiny particles called gallium ions at an object that then rebounded , causing an etching affect .
" When a particle beam is directed toward a point on the surface , the gold atoms bounce off and expose the silicon layer underneath just like a hammer and chisel , " Zohar said .
Zohar said the technology will in the future be used as a way to store vast amounts of data on bio-molecules and DNA .
The tiny Bible appears to be the world 's smallest .
The previous smallest known copy of the Bible measured 2.8 x 3.4 x 1 centimeters ( 1.1 x 1.3 x 0.4 inches ) , weighing 11.75 grams ( 0.4 ounces ) and containing 1,514 pages , according to Guinness World Records spokeswoman Amarilis Espinoza .
The tiny text , obtained by an Indian professor in November 2001 , is believed to have originated in Australia .

05 Oct 07 , LOS ANGELES , CA , USNA -- Political action committee Strippers for Ron Paul debuted actress Vanessa Anne Hudgens as their new official spokesmodel at a press - flesh conference yesterday .
Hudgens spoke passionately but eloquently about Constitutional issues such as letters of marque and reprisal , taxation without regard to census or enumeration , and soft porn .
Quotes from her speech :
" Stripping is a Constitutional right .
The right to life includes the right to make love , and that includes the right to strip .
And the right to strip for others -- wholesomely and responsibly -- comes under freedom of assembly . "
" I can't promise anything , but when Ron Paul is elected , naked women will literally dance in the streets . "
" Ron Paul will deregulate the industry .
Just imagine your typical stripper , having to clutch two reams of regulatory paperwork to her bosom , and then being permitted to drop it all . "
" Dr. Paul uniquely understands strippers -- he has seen thousands more vaginas than all other candidates combined .
He is the epitome of responsible voyeurism . "
" So remember , Dr. Paul is the only candidate who will protect your right to freedom from clothing ! "
Hudgens faced tough questions when she completed her prepared text .
When asked whether her involvement with Strippers for Ron Paul was just another publicity stunt to earn points for the use of her name , she said , " Maybe , but yes . "
When asked whether her employer , the Disney Company ( a Council on Foreign Relations member ) , was simply trying to discredit Dr. Paul by linking him to a side - dressing issue , she denied that dressing was involved at all .
Dr. Paul 's campaign was thankful for yet another unofficial grassroots support movement making news and spreading his message .
Communications director Jesse Benton pointed out that stripping to protest government overreaching goes back to the prophet Ezekiel , a noted ecdysiast .
A campaign staffer who preferred anonymity commented , " For 30 years , Dr. Paul has affirmed that preventing women from disrobing has never been an enumerated Constitutional power of Congress .
He knows that whenever any woman goes on a stage with no clothes , the federal government has its hands in both her pockets . "
Hudgens closed by reminding her audience that " Ron Paul girls " are busting out all over .
Due to the Strippers for Ron Paul coordinated ad campaign , it is now commonplace to see advertisements consisting of nothing more than a photo of one of their hotties and the simple four - word message : " GO OGLE RON PAUL " .
Mr. Bartlett purchased the Jaguar at a 1998 Christie ’s auction , virtually untouched from new  a time capsule  and the only one of the 16 XKSS ’s that had never been restored .
The car , which was displayed at the 1957 Chicago Motor Show , had been all but given up for lost .
In fact , it was hiding in plain sight , still in a garage , still in Chicago and in the hands of the second owner who had bought it in 1960 .
Sloppy handwriting had resulted in the misreading of the owner ’s last name and sent searchers on wild goose chases over the years .
A dealer of rare cars , contacted by the second owner , took charge of the XKSS and consigned it to the Christie ’s auction in London .
Externally , the car is exactly as it appeared in Chicago in 1957 .
The paint , the interior and even the tires , convertible top and top cover are original .
Naturally , the car has a patina but it is utterly authentic and remarkably well preserved .
Mr. Bartlett had the mechanical systems inspected and reconditioned as needed with original parts .
As a comparatively new pursuit , car collecting has yet to adopt the guidelines typically followed by collectors of other historic objects .
Europeans have been a bit ahead of the curve on this ; the mandate of the Fédération Internationale des Véhicules Anciens , founded in 1966 in France , is to identify and classify vintage vehicles of all types and to assist in sorting out the differences among vehicles that are original , reproductions or fakes .
No equivalent organization exists in the United States .
Tom Cotter , co-director of the Amelia Island Concours d’Élégance , a major show held in Florida each March , said he thought the psychology of car collectors was somewhat different from that of other collectors .
Cars are an expression of one ’s personality , and “ car collectors are often perfectionists who simply cannot resist putting their thumbprint on a car , ” he said .
Many oil investors are also worried about a potential political reaction in the United States similar to the furor of last year when Dubai tried to acquire a company that operates American ports .
European leaders , at the same time , worry that Russia is using its oil revenues to snatch up pipelines and other energy infrastructure in their region .
Such concerns seem to be driving investments to other parts of the world , many analysts say .
“ The investments are diversifying outside the United States , though the U.S. still has the bulk of it , ” said Diana Farrell , director of the McKinsey Global Institute , a research arm of the McKinsey consulting firm , which calculated in October that petrodollar investments reached $ 3.4 trillion to $ 3.8 trillion at the end of 2006 .
“ Europe is a prime target , ” she added , “ but at least 25 percent of foreign investments from the Persian Gulf are in Asia , the Middle East and North Africa . ”
Though oil - producing countries have been looking at investments in the West since the 1970s , their strategies back then were largely confined to safe assets with a low return , like United States Treasury debt .
By 2001 , with the collapse in oil prices , many of the oil exporters had depleted their dollar reserves , economists say .
But the boom in oil prices in the last five years has changed all that .
It has persuaded oil producers to set up or expand “ sovereign wealth funds ” as vehicles to invest far more aggressively in the West , in their own economies and in emerging markets .
Other petrodollar investments are made through government - owned corporations , corporations and individuals like Prince Walid , who owns stakes not only in Citigroup but also News Corporation , Procter & Gamble , Hewlett - Packard , PepsiCo , Time Warner and Walt Disney .
CBS probes if the Christian right is turning left David Edwards and Muriel Kane

Print This Email This Evangelical pastor : The Church has to ' repent ' on the AIDS issue Evangelical Christians have for years been strongly associated with the Republican Party .
According to CBS , white evangelicals make up about 25 % of the electorate , and 78 % of them voted Republican in 2004 .
However , now certain evangelicals are showing a willingness to listen to the Democratic Party 's message of compassion for the poor and sick .
Pastor Rick Warren , author of The Purpose - Driven Life , was recently criticized by some on the religious right when he invited Hillary Clinton to speak at his church about the AIDS epidemic .
" The greatest criticism that Jesus got , he got not from political people or from secular people , " Warren told CBS .
" He got it from religious people .
And it 's amazing to me that sometimes the people who understand grace are the least gracious people on the planet . "
Warren 's most striking and heartfelt comments came when he told CBS about his own awakening to the necessity of an evangelical response to the AIDS epidemic .
" I have to admit , the church was late to the table on this AIDS issue , " Warren stated .
" And we had to repent on it .
I just personally had to repent .
I did n't get it for years . "
" I was raised in a tradition where we cared about the soul and undervalued the importance of the body , " Warren went on .
" Jesus cared about the spiritual and the physical .
He healed them physically and he healed them spiritually .
...
The Bible says that he went into every village preaching , teaching , and healing .
...
Christianity is a teaching and healing faith . "
Rick Warren has emerged over the last few years as a leading figure in pulling evangelical Christianity away from the grip of the extreme religious right .
The Boston Globe wrote of him two years ago that " what Warren has started is a seismic shakeup of the American evangelical movement .
...
Warren , 51 , has managed to marry a simple message -- ' It 's not about you ' -- with an integrated mesh of mass media that is growing his audience exponentially .
As American political life has shifted toward the right , Warren has assumed a place in the center of the movement , one of a new generation of leaders who have eclipsed and distanced themselves from controversy - dogged televangelists such as Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell . "
When Warren sponsored a Global Summit on AIDS and the Church in 2006 , he explained that he and his wife see the church as an important part of the solution to the global AIDS epidemic .
" Beginning in 2002 , a series of circumstances convinced us that God intended for us to use whatever influence we might have to help those infected and affected by HIV / AIDS .
At first , our hope was simply to add another voice in speaking up for those who are being ignored .
But as we studied the pandemic and the related problems such as the lack of a grassroots global distribution network for medicine and nutrition and the need to mobilize millions of volunteers , we realized that the missing part of the solution was right in front of our eyes !
The answer is local congregations . "
Warren welcomed both Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) and the extremely conservative Sen. Sam Brownback ( R - KS ) to that conference , saying , " Weve got to work together where we can work together .
...
Right wing , left wing .
Im for the whole bird .
...
You have to have two wings to fly . "
However , Phyllis Schlafly and other religious conservatives issued a press release denouncing Warren 's decision to invite the pro-choice Obama and asserting , " If Senator Obama cannot defend the most helpless citizens in our country , he has nothing to say to the AIDS crisis .
You can not fight one evil while justifying another .
...
Accordingly , we call on Pastor Rick Warren to rescind his invitation to Senator Obama immediately .
...
The name of the seminar at which Senator Obama will be appearing is entitled , ' We Must Work Together . '
No , Mr. Warren , Mr. Obama , we will never work with those can support the murder of babies in the womb . "

A new study out from the Project for Excellence in Journalism and the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press , Politics and Public Policy shows what readers of political blogs in either half of Blogistan already know painfully well : traditional media 's coverage of our political contests is dissatisfying and generally uninformative .
The study , entitled " The Invisible Primary — Invisible No Longer : A First Look at Coverage of the 2008 Presidential Campaign , " also paints a clear picture of what 's wrong , laying out how the media focuses obsessively on the " horse race " aspects of political campaigns — tactics , strategy , positioning , and polling , while almost completely ignoring critical issues like the candidates ' actual records and the likely impact of the candidates ' policy positions on citizens ' lives .
Take a look at the following thumbnail sketch of American campaign coverage that I 've put together based on the report 's results and see if it looks at all familiar :
A small handful of contenders on each side are selected at the outset and then followed as they make their way through the season .
The study shows that only five candidates have received the overwhelming majority of the primary coverage , and that the public seriously want to know more about other options .
.
The study shows that only five candidates have received the overwhelming majority of the primary coverage , and that the public seriously want to know more about other options .
Narrative frames are assigned early on , so that each contestant fits a certain archetype .
The two front - runners , Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani , have received consistently negative coverage .
But the most negative coverage has gone to McCain ( who early on went from the Hardened Gunslinger to the Big Disappointment ) .
Obama , in contrast , has gotten far and away the biggest share of positive press , due to his role as the Hopeful Contender .

" In all , 63 % of the campaign stories focused on political and tactical aspects of the campaign , " states a report summary .
" Just 12 % of stories examined were presented in a way that explained how citizens might be affected by the election , while nearly nine out of ten stories ( 86 % ) focused on matters that largely impacted only the parties and the candidates . "

Though the report does n't mention it , the coverage now ends with the ever - more - popular polling night collection of " expert " talking heads , giving a play - by - play analysis of the contest as the returns come in .
That 's right : this is sports coverage .
Indeed , smaller press outlets , opinion magazines , and blogs have put out a growing body of critical commentary — most of which started out as satire but which is rapidly morphing into desperate pleading — that 's dedicated to pointing out the ( often unintentionally hilarious ) ways in which political coverage and sports coverage are converging along every conceivable axis .
McControversy sells
There are at least two reasons why modern political coverage is the way that it is — obsessively campaign - focused , with almost no attention to the either the past or the future impact of a candidate 's policies on citizens ' lives .
First , to actually point out the beneficial or negative effects of a candidate 's past policies on a particular group of citizens would require journalists to make an honest - to - god evaluation , i.e. , " This is good , and that is bad . "
Likewise with covering the probable future impact of a candidate 's positions on the issues .
But such critical evaluations open up journalists to charges of " bias , " so they simply avoid making them .
It 's easy to be " neutral " if you 're just dishing positive and negative dirt on players , teams , and contests , so sports coverage is what we get from journalists who fear accusations of ideological bias .
The second issue is related to the market and what the market likes .
By " market , " I do n't just mean the citizen consumers of political news .
A news outlet 's " market " is also the advertisers who pay bills and bonuses , and that market loves sensational , " He said , she said ! " and " Who 's up , who 's down ? " controversy just as much as the general public .
As for the kind of issues - based , big - picture , fundamental , " Who are we as a people , and what kind of country do we really want to live in ? " controversy ...
Well , that stuff is kind of like broccoli—it 's not terribly popular , it takes work to digest , and it has the potential to bring about unpredictable , deeply felt , possibly ill - timed and highly inconvenient shifts in the nether regions of the electorate .
If you 're an agency that 's entrusted with the care and guidance of an established , family - friendly American brand , is this really where you want to spend ad dollars if you can reach the exact same audience via other , safer options ... options like sports or fashion ?
It 's not that advertisers are part of some sinister conspiracy to actively suppress reporting that digs too deeply , it 's that the market seems to favor content that contains just enough McControversy to attract viewers but that does n't truly alienate anyone on a fundamental level .
It 's no coincidence that television news coverage ( to single out the biggest offender ) began taking this superficial , sports - centric turn in conjunction with its shift in the 90s from a loss leader for the networks into an actual profit center .
Of course , the Pew study does n't provide any direct support for the " follow the ad money " hypothesis that I 've outlined here , so your mileage may vary .
At least now they 're experts at something
The study also suggests that the daily paper is the last bastion of citizen - oriented political reporting , something that makes total sense to me — but that scares me nonetheless .
While the dailies may be more anchored in their local communities and therefore more in tune with how politicians ' decisions affect the folks around them , newspaper beat reporters are also the least - informed members of the media ecosystem on just about any topic .
It 's the newspaper reporter who hews most closely to the traditional image of the journalist as the disinterested , omnipresent outsider with notepad in hand , digging up the facts and talking to the experts and insiders in order to get the " real scoop . "
These folks are committed generalists , who by design lack a deep knowledge of any one topic .
Seen against the foil of the clueless beat reporter , the rest of the press 's move towards an " inside baseball " model of reporting might seem like a tiny step in the right direction .
At least sports reporters have to know something about sports , so we can expect some level of tactical and strategic expertise from the talking heads .
But do n't squint at it too hard , or this thin silver lining might disappear in a haze of conflicts of interest .
Postscript : A Tale of Two Conferences
What follows is a short story in two acts , after the style of Tom Friedman .
Act I : Yearly Kos 2007 , Chicago , IL
She was obviously confused .
A short woman in her late 20s or early 30s , she scurried from one side of the parking garage to the other , growing more frustrated by the second .
Then she spotted me watching her and moved in closer to get a look at the conference credentials hanging around my neck on an orange band .
Clearly , I had been here before and knew my way around .
So she piped up : " Excuse me .
Which way to the Yearly Kos ? "
We chatted for a bit as I showed her to the parking garage exit , then across the connecting bridge and into the main conference hall .
It turned out that she was a reporter for a large daily paper that shall go unnamed , a paper whose technology coverage I happened to have followed at one point in my life .
The paper 's tech coverage was awful and written by people who did n't really know that much about technology .
So I told her as much .
Of course , I laid out my case against the paper with my biggest , winningest smile , and she took it pretty well in stride .
After all , technology was n't her beat .
" I was an education reporter , " she said , " but I 've just now been assigned to the politics beat .
I 'm not really up on politics , so I 'm trying to learn as much as I can right now about Hillary Clinton 's campaign . "
Act II : Federated Media 's 2007 Conversational Marketing Conference , San Francisco , CA
" That guy totally looks like Markos Moulitsas from Daily Kos , " I told Ken , pointing to someone stationed near the oyster bar the other side of the reception hall .
" What would he be doing here at the FM conference ?
I thought he was on the Blogads network . "
My curiosity eventually got the better of me , so I walked up to him and introduced myself .
He was indeed the famous " Kos " — darling of the Left , villain of the Right .
After chatting with him about Yearly Kos for a minute , I asked him why he was at the FM conference .
" I 'm branching out , " he replied , " and starting a network of sports blogs . "
Just in case you needed more evidence that yes , there are robots from Earth roving around on Mars , check out this photograph .
Okay , so it ’s a little blurry , and you would n’t actually know what you were looking at unless I told you .
That ’s NASA ’s Spirit rover , photographed by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
The blue diamond - shaped feature in the image is “ Home Plate ” ; a puzzling region located inside the massive Gusev Crater on Mars .
Spirit is a tiny dark grey speck inside Home Plate ?
See it ?
No , ah well , we ’ll just have to trust the imaging folks over at NASA and the University of Arizona .
This colour image of Spirit was captured on September 27th by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment on board NASA ’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
During this period it was flying about 270 km ( 168 miles ) above the surface of the planet .
Although you really can’t see too much of Spirit , the image helps planetary geologists put data sent back by Spirit into context .
Spirit is now driving itself to a safe , north - facing slope on the north side of Home Plate .
This will position its solar panels towards the Sun , so that it can soak up as much of the Sun ’s light as possible during the long Martian winter .
This will let the rover continue its science operations .

Paying the Poor to Do the Right Thing ?
Mike Bloomberg wants to give his city 's poor incentives to improve their lives .
Sept. 11 , 2007  --
Getting a library card . . . $ 50 .
Going to the dentist . . . $ 100 .
Passing a statewide subject exam . . . $ 600 .
Taking responsibility and ownership over your life . . . priceless .
No , that 's not the latest ad from MasterCard .
It 's the idea behind Mike Bloomberg 's new effort to fight poverty .
" My perspective is this , " New York 's billionaire mayor said last month , " why should n't we experiment with a program built around the one strategy that has proven time and again to work wonders . . . capitalism ? "
Bloomberg 's Opportunity NYC initiative , which is modeled on efforts that have been tried in Latin America , will be officially launched Wednesday at a news conference in Brooklyn .
The program consists of three separate pilot programs aimed at improving the education , health and work - force outcomes for adults and children living in poverty .
The education incentives are designed to promote school attendance , parental engagement and improved performance on standardized tests .
Health incentives will be offered for maintaining adequate health coverage as well for making timely medical and dental visits .
Work - force incentives will be offered for those who sustain full - time employment and upgrade their job skills .
Families that complete the noted activities will receive their cash payments every two months .
Click here to see the schedule of payments :
The $ 50 million program is being privately funded by the Rockefeller Foundation , the Broad Foundation , the Starr Foundation , the Robin Hood Foundation , the Open Society Institute , the American International Group and Bloomberg .
The launch comes less than a week after Bloomberg , who says he is not running for the White House , posted a statement on MikeBloomberg.com saying , " It 's time for something real " in the 2008 race .
Bloomberg dropped his Republican affiliation in July and finds himself to the left of the GOP -- and even some Democrats -- on issues ranging from immigration to gun control to same - sex marriage .
But his anti-poverty initiative was praised by a Republican icon weighing his own presidential bid .
" The beset way to help the poor is to help them help themselves , " said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich .
" Providing incentives to the poor so they acquire the same habits that get successful people ahead is a great idea . "

The BristleBot is a simple and tiny robot with an agenda .
The ingredients ?
One toothbrush , a battery , and a pager motor .
The result ?
Serious fun .
( You Tube video here . )
The BristleBot is our take on the popular vibrobot , a simple category of robot that is controlled by a single vibrating ( eccentric ) motor .
Some neat varieties include the mint - tin version as seen in Make Magazine ( check the video ) , and the kid ’s art bot : a vibrobot with pens for feet .
The starting point is of course the toothbrush .
We need one that has more - or - less uniformly angled bristles .
( While it may be possible to take one with straight bristles and bend them to suit , I have n’t tried . )
If the bristle length is nonuniform ( as it is here ) , it may take scissors to make the bristles all the same .
Cut off the handle of the toothbrush , leaving only a neat little robotics platform .
Next , we need a vibrating pager motor or other tiny motor with an unbalanced output shaft .
If you should happen to find a small enough motor you can always add the weight yourself , but usually motors this size are made for pagers anyway .
I got mine on eBay for a few bucks ; you can also get them here , for example .
The kind that I got are happy to run on almost any common voltage– probably a range of 1 - 9 V .
As a power source , you can use an alkaline or lithium coin cell or watch battery , either 1.5 V or 3 V .
To hook the motor to the battery I soldered short copper wire leads to the motor terminals .
The last substantial ingredient is some foam tape .
Apply a small piece to the top of the toothbrush robotic platform , which will be used to hold the motor in place .
Attach the motor to the foam tape .
The tape provides a spacer so that the rotating weight does not hit the toothbrush head .
It also provides a strong , flexible connection to the base that is able to handle the severe vibration that this robot experiences .
A first approach to hooking up the battery might be to stand it on end .
However , the battery itself is not held in place very well this way and will fall out shortly .
A better method is to bend one of the leads down flush with the foam tape , so that you can * stick * the battery to the foam tape as well and still make an electrical connection .
The other lead contacts the other side of the battery , and the motor can run .
The completed BristleBot , running and ready for action .
When you set one down , you may notice that it tends to steer left or right .
We have found that battery and motor placement , bristle shape ( one stray long bristle can interfere with the motion , and motor rotation direction all influence the behavior - so be sure to try flipping the battery upside down if you have trouble getting yours to go straight .
Now and for the record , this is one of many different kinds of vibrobots – there are a lot of other designs out there if you go and look .
We have heard of and seen many other vibrating robots , and we know that even using a brush with angled bristles for propulsion has been done before .
However , this particular miniature implementation may be unique , and is certainly fun .
Very few robots that you can build so easily are so rewarding .
With the right parts , you can make one in a few minutes .
It might be great fun to make a bunch of them to race them competitively .
Senator Mike Gravel ( D - AK ) , Democratic Party candidate for President in 2008 , and VotingOnTheInternet.com have jointly released today a Petition on the Internet that will require the Bush administration to bring all US Troops home from Iraq by Xmas .
By : votingontheinternet.com
End
-- Santa Cruz California , July 21 , 2007 12:00 PMSenator Mike Gravel one of the 8 democratic candidates for President and http://www.VotingOnTheInternet.com have jointly authorized the launch of the first Online Petition that would force our " Rubber Stamp Congress " , the " Best Congress that money can buy " to bring the Troops home by Christmas of this year as well as take away funding for the war .
The Gravel candidacy , based mainly on the platform of giving the power of democracy to the people by Voting On The Internet , has inspired the signature gathering process that is guaranteed under the 1st Amendment of the United States Constitution , in that ' The people have the right to Petition the Government for a redress of Grievances ' .
Senator Gravel was instrumental in stopping the Viet Nam War and therefore has entered the Presidential race primarily to lend his own ideas into the ongoing debate this election year .
" This historic Petition will accomplish several things at once , " Senator Gravel has stated .
" First of all , this new Online Petition Process will help to increase participation in democracy .
Second , it will give the American people a new tool in using the power of government to gain better government , more honest government and more representative laws and regulations that serve the majority of citizens and not just the fortunate few .
Thirdly , this particular Petition will rescind Congresses Resolution of 2002 which gave President Bush the power to invade Iraq and to pass new legislation that requires all troops to be removed from Iraq by Christmas of this year , to cease all federal spending to support the war and provides strict penalties for failure to comply or enter into any conspiracy to curtail this law .
That 's asking a great deal of this one little Internet web site , but it can and must happen .
"
Once again , Senator Gravel is attempting to change history .
No other Democratic candidate has Senator Gravel 's track record or experience for opposing unnecessary , fraudulent and unpopular wars .
During the Viet Nam War , Senator Gravel filibustered for 125 days in the Senate and this brave and courageous action helped end the Draft of American youth to fight President Nixon 's senseless , ill - advised invasion of a country also in the throes of a civil war that had nothing to do with us .
Senator Gravel 's actions were key in helping to end end the War in Viet Nam , an illegal and unprovoked war that eventually claimed more than 50,000 US lives and the wounding and maiming of several thousand more veterans , not to mention the slaying and wounding of hundreds of thousands of innocent men , women and children in Southeast Asia .
Senator Gravel is working hard to prevent this same thing from happening in Iraq .
He is asking for the support and the participation of every thinking American citizen to prevail in this valiant and historic effort .
" If we had the Internet , during the Viet Nam War , do n't you think that the American people would have put a stop to it ? "
Senator Gravel has said .
" President Bush intends to keep US Troops in Iraq for the duration of his Presidency and even beyond by building permanent military bases and embassies in Iraq that cost the American People hundreds of billions of dollars and the cost continues to skyrocket .
We must take the reigns of government from the corrupt dictators in Washington D.C. and give it to the people . "
Senator Gravel has stated .
The First National Petition for Removing our Troops from Iraq and making it illegal to defy the will of the People is available now at the web site : http://www.votingontheinternet.com .
History awaits .
While President Bush has repeatedly stated publicly that " The majority of Americans agree with me . " and , " I'm the Decider . " , we feel that it 's time that the President is taught a major civics lesson in that the PEOPLE are the deciders in a real democracy
Let 's let the people decide this important issue , and soon after , flexing the muscles of our new Direct Democracy and Voting On The Internet , other lessons will follow .
" We appeal to each and every American to sign and help us circulate this Petition . "
Senator Gravel said today .
" Each generation has a right to choose for itself the form of government it believes most promotive of its happiness .

The Internet is a concept that is talked about in many areas of society today .
We felt the time has come to actually start voting on the Internet .
Therefore , we have teamed up with Senator Mike Gravel to educate and familiarize the American people with the tools they need to finally achieve real democracy in America .
The Internet was invented ironically enough by the Defense Department and it's in defense of Democracy that it will now be USED .

Asian Americans make up 3.6 % of the US population
The report is based on a multilingual exit poll conducted among 4,700 Asian American voters in 25 US cities .
It documents alleged violations of the Voting Rights Act and Help America Vote Act and cases of " anti-Asian attitude " .
According to a 2000 census , the US has more than 10 million Asian Americans , comprising 3.6 % of its population .
' Rude behaviour '
The report by the Asian American Legal Defence and Education Fund ( AALDEF ) , a 34 - year - old civil rights organisation , comes as presidential primaries are in full swing in the United States .
They must learn English if they want to realise their American dream
Saghir Tahir ,
New Hampshire legislator
The group alleges that poll workers were hostile towards Asian American voters , particularly those not fluent in English , during voting in 2006 .
Many voters complained of " rude or hostile behaviour " and an " unhelpful attitude about election procedures " , the report said .
It said 59 Asian American voters had complained .
In New York , 83 % of voters who were asked to show identification were not legally required to do so , the report says .
It says English - speaking voters were not asked for ID .
The discrimination was " racially motivated and at the same time also demonstrated a bureaucratic approach " , AALDEF lawyer Glenn D Magpantay told the BBC .
The survey found 40 % of Pakistani - origin , 38 % of Bangladeshi- origin and 17 % of Indian origin- voters could not speak English well .
One - third of Urdu speakers and the same number of Bengali speakers said they needed the assistance of interpreters in order to vote .
The report says some poll workers made disparaging remarks about such assistance .
" One poll worker in New York said she thought it was a waste of the taxpayers ' money to pay for so many interpreters .
" Another poll worker commented that she did not think they should be required to provide multilingual material and voters should learn English , " the report says .
It also said Chinese American voters had been given Spanish - language ballots in New York .
No response
Many Asian Americans ' names were missing or misspelt in voter lists at polling stations , the report found .
Copies of the report and letters of complaint have been sent to the US Department of Justice for investigation , the AALDEF says .
The BBC contacted the voting section of the department , both by phone and e-mail .
There was no immediate response to the allegations .
However , a Republican state representative of South Asian origin , Saghir " Saggy " Tahir , said he was not aware of such discrimination in his community .
" I am in my fourth term in the state legislature but I have never heard of any such complaint , " says Mr Tahir , who was the first Asian American Muslim elected to this level in the Republican Party .
He says the easiest thing for people is to blame others for their inconvenience .
" I can only advise that they must learn English if they want to realise their American dream , " says the New Hampshire legislator , who arrived in the US in 1972 from Lahore .
Prime Minister John Howard has moved to hose down Defence Minister Brendan Nelson 's earlier revelation that Australian troops are remaining in Iraq partially because of concerns over global oil supplies .
Speaking this morning , Dr Nelson said oil was among the reasons to keep troops in Iraq .
" Energy security is extremely important to all nations throughout the world , and of course , in protecting and securing Australia 's interests , " he said .
" The Middle East itself , not only Iraq , but the entire region is an important supplier of energy oil , in particular , to the rest of the world . "
But Mr Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello disagree .
Prime Minister John Howard told radio 2 GB Iraq is not about oil .
" We are not there because of oil , " he said .
" We did n't go there because of oil and we do n't remain there because of oil . "
" We 're fighting for something much more important here than oil , this is about democracy , " Mr Costello said .
The Greens say it is a damning admission that the war was about oil , not weapons of mass destruction , and the Australian Democrats say after years of denials the Government 's conceded that the war was about oil .
Labor has asked why the Government cites oil now , when it has previously denied any link .
Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd earlier accused Mr Howard of " making it up as he goes along " on Iraq .
He says the statement is a clear backflip on what the Howard Government said when the Iraq war started .
" Mr Howard was asked back in 2003 whether this war had anything to do with oil .
Mr Howard said in no way did this have anything to do with oil .
This government simply makes it up as it goes along , " he said .
Global threats
Meanwhile , the new defence update warns that ignoring trouble spots like the Middle East risks bringing threats closer to Australia .
It says terrorism will probably remain a global threat for more than a generation .
It also highlights fragile island states in the South Pacific as a key concern .
Mr Howard launched the report and warned security threats have to be tackled before they reach Australia .
" Our security can be deeply affected by distant events as a result of globalisation , " he said .
" However , the range and number of events affecting Australia 's strategic circumstances and potentially requiring military responses will continue to grow . "
Out went the cover showing Saddam Hussein firing a rifle in the air .
In came a photograph of a graveyard packed with the victims of sectarian suicide bombings and festooned with flags and posters showing the bearded and turbaned features of some of the country 's new movers and shakers - who were virtually unknown in 2002 , the cut off point for the last edition .
Tripp , an Arabist and professor of politics at London University 's School of Oriental and African Studies ( Soas ) , is in the vanguard of western scholars of Iraq .
He first visited in the 1980s during the war with Khomeini's Iran .
To his regret he has not been back since the US - led invasion - neither wanting to worry his family , get stuck and out of touch in Baghdad 's Green Zone or be a " hideous liability " to his Iraqi friends .
But he has followed events closely - and , crucially , unlike so many of those involved in the war and occupation - against the indispensable background of what came before .
" There was this nonsensical idea that Saddam and everything he created was a kind of freak and that once you eradicated him the whole thing would fall apart and the potential for a liberal , democratic and a civil society would emerge as if somehow he was the only problem , " he says .
" But Saddam was a recognisable part of Iraqi history .
Many Iraqis feel now that they 've been delivered into the hands of many lesser dictators .
As one of my friends said : ' Thanks very much : you got rid of one Saddam and you left us with 50 . ' "
Tripp is scholarly and quietly - spoken but there is no ivory - tower reticence about his analysis .
The US had " up to date , unprejudiced and non-ideological " experts in the CIA , state department and the academic world , but politicians who listened to out - of - touch Iraqi exiles pushing their own agenda cut them out of the loop .
Post - war planning , such as it was , was taken over by the Pentagon .
Part of the problem , he argues , was profound ignorance about what went on beneath the surface of Saddam 's dictatorship , what he calls a " shadow state " that ran on cooption , collaboration and patronage as well as repression and fear .
That led to the disastrous decision to outlaw the Ba'ath party .
" Lack of understanding on that score was unbelievable .
By purging it you alienated tens of thousands of people who would otherwise have very happily served the next regime .
They were n't going to work for the restoration of Saddam Hussein .
They only joined the Ba'ath because that was what they had to do .
When you decapitate that shadow state you do n't get rid of the old networks .
They just look for a new patron : hence the resistance . "
The same " blindness " , as Tripp calls it , was at work when the order came to dissolve the Iraqi army and the entire security apparatus of the old regime , giving a huge boost to what was to become a fully - fledged Sunni insurgency .
Tripp and handful of other UK academics had their own taste of the uneasy relationship between knowledge and power at a meeting in Downing Street as the war drums beat louder in November 2002 .
He had the impression that Jack Straw , the foreign secretary , wanted to inject a little informed scepticism into Tony Blair 's thinking .
But the prime minister , he recalls , seemed detached except to seek confirmation that Saddam was " uniquely evil " .
There was little interest in the " hideous complications " - such as religious nationalists and Islamists who might not take kindly to foreign occupation - that might follow .
" We were arguing that removing dictatorship and opening the space for populist politics might produce something that you would find very , very difficult to deal with .
I would n't say that we predicted civil war and sectarianism of the kind that has emerged , but we were trying to say that there was a complex society in Iraq which should n't be reduced to the caricature of Saddam Hussein sitting upon the oppressed masses .
The oppressed masses have their own agenda - and sometimes they 're very nasty indeed . "
The result has been the spread of local centres of power , whether in Basra , Kurdistan or Anbar province , where Sunni tribal sheikhs have mobilised to fight al - Qaida - part of what General David Petraeus , the US commander in Iraq , this week called " Iraqi solutions to Iraqi problems " .
These developments , suggests Tripp , were an inevitable retreat from the ambitions of US neocons that bore no relation to Iraqi reality .
" If you can't read a society like that , you 're doomed , " he insists .
" You 'll get it wholly wrong .
If the security conditions are so bad you can't create the material inducements for people to come on board , then you have to deal with those who can guarantee a minimum of order and deal with you without trying to attack you . "
Iraq 's post - war elections and the " formal trappings of constitutional and democratic government , " Tripp writes , were " little connected to the life - and - death struggles that formed the texture of a much more local , violent and communal politics . "
And against the background of the country 's new brutalities , he gloomily predicts : " There is a strong possibility that newly - won privileges will be entrenched and Iraqis will have good reason to fear subjection once more to a regime that equates power with force and dissent with treason . "

How Tridge reverse engineered BitKeeper
Andrew Tridgell delivered the first linux.conf.au keynote on Thursday morning .
The bulk of the talk covered software engineering techniques and how the free software community is taking a leading role in adopting those techniques .
It was a good talk , and your editor will attempt to write it up later on .
At the end , however , Tridge touched on his role in the separation of the kernel project and BitKeeper .
He could n't talk about much , and he did not announce the release of his BitKeeper client .
But he noted that there has been quite a bit of confusion and misinformation regarding what he actually did .
It was not , he says , an act of wizardly reverse engineering .
Getting a handle on the BitKeeper network protocol turned out to be rather easier than that .
He started by noting that a BitKeeper repository has an identifier like bk://thunk.org:5000 / .
So , he asked , what happens if you connect to the BitKeeper server port using telnet ?
A quick demonstration sufficed :
telnet thunk.org 5000 Trying 69.25.196.29 ...
Connected to thunk.org .
Escape character is ' ^ ] ' .
Once connected , why not type a command at it ?
help ?
- print this help abort - abort resolve check - check repository clone - clone the current repository help - print this help httpget - http get command [...]
Tridge noted that this sort of output made the " reverse engineering " process rather easier .
What , he wondered , was the help command there for ?
Did the BitKeeper client occasionally get confused and have to ask for guidance ?
Anyway , given that output , Tridge concluded that perhaps the clone command could be utilized to obtain a clone of a repository .
Sure enough , it returned a large volume of output .
Even better , that output was a simple series of SCCS files .
At that point , the " reverse engineering " task is essentially complete .
There was not a whole lot to it .
Now we know about the work which brought about an end to the BitKeeper era .

I was transformed by my years at Harvard , the friendships I made , and the ideas I worked on .
But taking a serious look back … I do have one big regret .
Photograph by Stu Rosner
I left Harvard with no real awareness of the awful inequities in the world — the appalling disparities of health , and wealth , and opportunity that condemn millions of people to lives of despair .
I learned a lot here at Harvard about new ideas in economics and politics .
I got great exposure to the advances being made in the sciences .
But humanity ’s greatest advances are not in its discoveries — but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity .
Whether through democracy , strong public education , quality healthcare , or broad economic opportunity — reducing inequity is the highest human achievement .
I left campus knowing little about the millions of young people cheated out of educational opportunities here in this country .
And I knew nothing about the millions of people living in unspeakable poverty and disease in developing countries .
It took me decades to find out .…
See also : Full text
Imagine , just for the sake of discussion , that you had a few hours a week and a few dollars a month to donate to a cause — and you wanted to spend that time and money where it would have the greatest impact in saving and improving lives .
Where would you spend it ?…
During our discussions on this question , Melinda and I read an article about the millions of children who were dying every year in poor countries from diseases that we had long ago made harmless in this country .
Measles , malaria , pneumonia , hepatitis B , yellow fever .
One disease that I had never heard of , rotavirus , was killing half a million children each year — none of them in the United States .
We were shocked .
We had assumed that if millions of children were dying and they could be saved , the world would make it a priority to discover and deliver the medicines to save them .
But it did not .
For under a dollar , there were interventions that could save lives that just were n’t being delivered .
If you believe that every life has equal value , it ’s revolting to learn that some lives are seen as worth saving and others are not .
We said to ourselves : “ This ca n’t be true .
But if it is true , it deserves to be the priority of our giving . ” …
We asked : “ How could the world let these children die ? ”
The answer is simple , and harsh .
The market did not reward saving the lives of these children , and governments did not subsidize it .
So the children died because their mothers and fathers had no power in the market and no voice in the system .
But you and I have both .
We can make market forces work better for the poor if we can develop a more creative capitalism … .
If we can find approaches that meet the needs of the poor in ways that generate profits for business and votes for politicians , we will have found a sustainable way to reduce inequity in the world .
This task is open - ended .
It can never be finished .
But a conscious effort to answer this challenge can change the world .
I am optimistic that we can do this , but I talk to skeptics who claim there is no hope .
They say : “ Inequity has been with us since the beginning , and will be with us until the end — because people just … don ’t … care . ”
I completely disagree .
I believe we have more caring than we know what to do with .…
The barrier to change is not too little caring ; it is too much complexity .
To turn caring into action , we need to see a problem , see a solution , and see the impact .
But complexity blocks all three steps .…
The AIDS epidemic offers an example .
The broad goal , of course , is to end the disease .
The highest - leverage approach is prevention .
The ideal technology would be a vaccine that gives life - long immunity with a single dose .
So governments , drug companies , and foundations are funding vaccine research .
But their work is likely to take more than a decade , so in the meantime , we have to work with what we have in hand — and the best prevention approach we have now is getting people to avoid risky behavior . …
The final step — after seeing the problem and finding an approach — is to measure the impact of the work and to share that success or failure so that others learn from your efforts .
You have to have the statistics , of course .
You have to be able to show , for example , that a program is vaccinating millions more children .
You have to be able to show , for example , a decline in the number of children dying from the diseases .
This is essential not just to improve the program , but also to help draw more investment from business and government .
But if you want to inspire people to participate , you have to show more than numbers ; you have to convey the human impact of the work — so people can feel what saving a life means to the families affected .…
Still , I ’m optimistic .
Yes , inequity has been with us forever , but the new tools we have to cut through complexity have not been with us forever .
They are new — they can help us make the most of our caring — and that ’s why the future can be different from the past .
The defining and ongoing innovations of this age — biotechnology , the personal computer , and the Internet — give us a chance we ’ve never had before to end extreme poverty and end death from preventable disease .
Sixty years ago , George Marshall came to this commencement and he announced a plan to assist the nations of postwar Europe .
He said : “ I think one difficulty is that the problem is one of such enormous complexity that the very mass of facts presented to the public by press and radio make it exceedingly difficult for the man in the street to reach a clear appraisement of the situation .
It is virtually impossible at this distance to grasp at all the real significance of the situation . ”
Thirty years after Marshall made his address , as my class graduated without me , technology was emerging that would make the world smaller , more open , more visible , less distant .
The emergence of low - cost personal computers gave rise to a powerful network that has transformed opportunities for learning and communicating .
The magical thing about this network is not just that it collapses distance and makes everyone your neighbor .
It also dramatically increases the number of brilliant minds we can bring in to work together on the same problem — and it scales up the rate of innovation to a staggering degree . …
Members of the Harvard Family : Here in the Yard is one of the great collections of intellectual talent in the world .
For what purpose ?
There is no question that the faculty , the alumni , the students , and the benefactors of Harvard have used their power to improve the lives of people here and around the world .
But can we do more ?
Can Harvard dedicate its intellect to improving the lives of people who will never even hear its name ?
Let me make a request of the deans and the professors — the intellectual leaders here at Harvard :
As you hire new faculty , award tenure , review curriculum , and determine degree requirements , please ask yourselves :
Should our best minds be more dedicated to solving our biggest problems ?
Should Harvard encourage its faculty to take on the world ’s worst inequities ?
Should Harvard students know about the depth of global poverty … the prevalence of world hunger … the scarcity of clean water … the girls kept out of school … the children who die from diseases we can cure ?
Should the world ’s most privileged learn about the lives of the world ’s least privileged ?
These are not rhetorical questions — you will answer with your policies . …
When you consider what those of us here in this Yard have been given — in talent , privilege , and opportunity — there is almost no limit to what the world has a right to expect from us .…
Do n’t let complexity stop you .
Be activists .
Take on big inequities .
I feel sure it will be one of the great experiences of your lives .…
You have more than we had ; you must start sooner , and carry on longer .
And I hope you will come back here to Harvard 30 years from now and reflect on what you have done with your talent and your energy .
I hope you will judge yourselves not on your professional accomplishments alone , but also on how well you have addressed the world ’s deepest inequities …on how well you treated people a world away who have nothing in common with you but their humanity .
Good luck .
This affects every one of you in the 49 states that are " not Iowa " because what happens in Iowa will play a major role in which presidential candidates you get to vote for .
Please distribute this to every single person you know in Iowa .
Black Box Voting does not have many Iowa members , and needs your help to get this information where it needs to go .
PROBLEMS AND ISSUES WITH THE IOWA CAUCUSES - AND WHAT EVERY IOWAN CAN DO
Black Box Voting needs live IOWA CITIZEN REPORTS on Jan .
3 . Note that the Iowa caucuses must allow observers and must allow both video and photography , as long as you do not disrupt the proceedings .
You do not need to be a member of the party to observe or videotape ( but you must be registered for that party if you want to participate in the caucus ) .
In some locations , there will be a Republican caucus AND a Democratic caucus in the same building , giving observers the opportunity to capture evidence in both parties ' caucuses .
Below is an update on election integrity problems with both Republican and Democratic caucuses , in addition to info on how to find your local caucuses .
REPUBLICAN CAUCUS PROBLEMS AND ISSUES :
1 ) Black Box Voting has received unofficial reports that political operatives have urged citizens NOT to ask too many questions and NOT to take photos or video of precinct caucus results , warning them that only " conspiracy theorists " would want to independently confirm the announced results .
It is your DUTY as a citizen to oversee your governmental processes .
Because Iowa caucus procedures lack basic checks and balances , such as posting the precinct caucus results at the precinct caucus location for the public to examine , it is actually very important for members of the public to take video and photographs and share them .
WHAT TO DO :
If you see or hear anyone ridiculing , name calling , or implying that citizen oversight actions will cause " blowback " on their candidate , please REPORT THIS to Black Box Voting , via e-mail or online , live - time forum reports in the IOWA FORUMS section at Black Box Voting .
2 ) The Iowa Republicans have NOT publicly agreed to promptly release precinct results for the Jan. 3 caucus .
Instead , we are seeing bait and switch tactics , as they emphasize to caucus participants that the counting will be done in public at the precinct .
While they keep your eye focused on the front end , a switch can take place at the back end .
When they release a total result to the media without releasing the individual precinct results at the same time , there is no way at all for citizens to confirm that their precinct results added up to the announced total .
Please CONTACT both the Iowa Republican Party and the Iowa Secretary of State to tell them you expect to see those precinct results published at the SAME time they announce the statewide total .
Iowa Republican Party : ( 515 ) 282-8105 Iowa Secretary of State : 515-281-0145 515-281-7142 ( Fax ) sos@sos.state.ia.us
( But are n't caucuses " owned " by the parties and not the Secretary of State ?
It 's like this :
If Iowa wants to position itself as the first in the nation for caucuses , perhaps the ONLY possible influx of mass tourist dollars in January in Iowa , they need to run transparent caucuses with proper checks and balances .
If they do n't citizens nationwide should recommend dropping the Iowa First in the Nation concept ) .
3 ) One thing the Republican Party of Iowa has done RIGHT is making caucus locations transparent .
All you have to do is go to http://www.iowagop.org and click the map to find every Republican caucus location in a county .
Not so for the Democrats , who are making it harder to get a complete listing !
4 ) We have received conflicting reports as to the procedures at the Republican caucus .
A spokesman for the Republican Party of Iowa told Black Box Voting that the votes would be written on paper and counted in front of candidate representatives and observers , then signed off on by precinct captains or whoever they 've got in charge .
WHAT TO DO :
If that 's the case , get a photo of the signed results and e-mail it to Black Box Voting - or upload it directly to the IOWA FORUM section of this Web site .

People who drive Hummers apparently like them because they look like engines of destruction .
New research out by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety shows that it ’s not just an image thing .
Hummers really do leave a trail of destruction in their wake .
According to the Institute data , Hummer owners wiped out two and a half times as many parking lot pilings and smaller cars than the average car driver .
The H2 pickup was especially bad , topping the list with the worst property - damage claim record of any car on the road .
The reason is fairly obvious : Hummers are enormous .
With bumpers far too high off the ground , these pricey toys turn the run -of - the - mill shopping mall fender - bender into a major catastrophe .
“ The Hummer is a classic example of a big mismatch with just about anything out there on the road , ” says Kim Hazelbaker , senior vice president of the Highway Loss Data Institute , a nonprofit research arm of the auto insurance industry .
The new data suggest that those seeking relief from a midlife crisis should abandon giant SUVs and return to the classy sports car .
The car generating the lowest number of property - damage claims ?

At The Daily Show , I ’m paid to sit around in an office with a bunch of other entertaining nerds and make fun of the news .
Except now we ’re on strike , which means that I ’m not being paid at all , and I ’m duty - bound to march on a picket line for four hours each day .
What changes when you go from writer to striker ?
You care more about the weather , for one thing .
Turns out picketing in 60 - degree sun is very different from picketing in a damp 49 .
I wo n’t lie :
Time off has some advantages — as fun as it is making The Daily Show , it ’s also relentless .
But that ’s easily canceled out by certain frustrations .
Not drawing a paycheck is one thing .
Not being able to write jokes about Pat Robertson endorsing Rudy Giuliani ?
That hurts .
None of the 2,500 or so New York film and TV writers wanted to walk out .
The depth of our , er , disagreement with the studios and networks — the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers , as they ’re called , or just “ the producers ” — made the walkout unavoidable .
We writers think we should get paid when our work is used online , as more and more of it is ; the producers do n’t .
That they ’re being such hard - liners about it only convinces us more that new media must be a gold mine .
Which makes it worth fighting for .
We know it can seem a bit unbecoming : people with creative , rewarding jobs striking to get paid even more .
But just because we ’re privileged does n’t mean we ca n’t also be taken advantage of .
Worse is that a lot of nonunion producers and editors and assistants get caught in the cross fire .
When we ’re on strike , their shows are off the air .
Which makes us feel guilty .
At least on the last day prestrike , the Daily Show staff seemed to understand that this deadlock is the intransigent moguls ’ fault at least as much as it ’s ours .
Nervous though our colleagues were , they were pulling for us .
Here ’s hoping they ’ll stick with us if the thing drags on and truly jeopardizes their jobs .
We wonder if this is part of the producers ’ gamble :
What if they ’re counting on us feeling bad about our nonunion colleagues and caving ?
That notion just pisses us off more .
Fat - cat motherfuckers are n’t going to push us around !
So we stay on the barricades .
The phenomenon of picketing writers is a peculiar one , and there ’s something anachronistic about actually marching around with signs about fair pay .
You know , “ Clifford Odets called ; he wants his earnestness back . ”
But it ’s also fun hanging out with the New York WGA crowd .
Last Monday at Rockefeller Center drew not only dozens of my late - night colleagues but also Law & Order writers and 30 Rockers and local screenwriting legends .
I ran into friends I had n’t seen for years , novelists and actors and playwrights , all of us earning our livings off the demon tube .
Warren Leight — a playwright who ’s now show - runner on Law & Order : Criminal Intent — was there , and he offered a protest chant : “ What do we want ?
For the girls in high school who rejected us for the jocks to finally see how wrong they were !
When do we want it ?
Then ! ”
It did n’t quite catch on , but only because it does n’t rhyme .

During today 's White House press briefing , Dana Perino was asked about the recent Gulf of Tonkin incident in the Strait of Hormuz between Iranian boats and U.S. naval warships :
Q ... does the President still believe that the incident was as serious as he described it on Monday when he -- MS .
PERINO : Absolutely .
Q
He 's not -- because the reports seemed to suggest that maybe it was not as serious as the White House and others had indicated .
MS .
PERINO : Whose reports ?
The Iranians ' reports ?
I mean , I 've heard nothing different from what we have said ...
Q
Well , the fact that the video now is not clear that the statement that " we 're coming after you " was referring to these five boats ; that 's a new fact that 's different than -- MS .
PERINO : I have not heard that .
Really ?
The White House has n't heard that ?
Even though on the same day that George Bush was talking about the , " dangerous and provacative , " act , it was reported that :
U.S. military officials , including Cosgriff [ Vice Admiral 5th Fleet ] , cautioned , however , that they have not been able to connect definitively the radio call with one of the Revolutionary Guards boats .
Of course acknowledging that might have made Bush 's comments the following day :
Iran is a threat to world peace .
There was a recent intelligence report that came out that I think sent the signal to some that said perhaps the United States does not view an Iran with a nuclear weapon as serious -- as a serious problem ..
I said then that Iran was a threat , Iran is a threat , and Iran will be a threat if the international community does not come together and prevent that nation from the development of the know - how to build a nuclear weapon . " ... all options are on the table to protect our assets .
... seem like desperate saber - rattling from a president who was forced to go from warnings of World War III and mushroom clouds , to the development of know - how .
DIGG THIS
 When the President does it , that means that it is not illegal .  ~ Richard Nixon
Since 9/11 , George W. Bush has been trampling all over the Constitution .
Unfazed by public opinion , the law or Congress , Bush seems to think he can get away with anything .
His most recent attempt ( that we know of , at least ) to expand his powers beyond all legal justification came in July 2007 .
Falling conveniently under the rubric of national security , Bush issued an executive order which authorizes the government to freeze the financial assets of anyone who directly or indirectly aids someone who has committed or poses a significant risk of committing  violent acts threatening the peace or stability of Iraq . 
Yet as Walter Pincus pointed out in the Washington Post , the text of the order , entitled  Blocking Property of Certain Persons Who Threaten Stabilization Efforts in Iraq ,  if interpreted broadly , could cast a far bigger net to include not just those who commit violent acts or pose the risk of doing so in Iraq but also third parties  such as U.S. citizens in this country  who knowingly or unknowingly aid or encourage such people . 
In fact , the language is so broad that ordinary Americans who oppose the Iraq war could find their names on the list of persons who are perceived to be undermining efforts to promote economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq .
With public support for the war in Iraq plummeting , this could mean almost anyone .
This executive order is just the latest example of Bushs surreptitious attempts through various presidential directives , executive orders and stealth provisions to lay claim to a host of unprecedented powers .
For example , last fall , the Bush Administration engineered into a mammoth defense budget bill the insertion of two stealth provisions that authorize the president to use the military as a domestic police force in response to a natural disaster , disease outbreak , terrorist attack or any other condition . 
And another presidential directive issued in May 2007 allows Bush to assume control of the federal government following a catastrophic event such as an earthquake , hurricane or another 9/11 .
Undaunted by plummeting approval ratings , George Bush just keeps moving forward .
And our paper tiger Congress is nt helping matters much , either .
As Jonathan Alter noted in Newsweek , right before leaving for their summer recess , Congress sold out the Constitution to cover their political rears while keeping the rest of us mostly in the dark . 
Giving in to pressure from the White House , Congress passed the Protect America Act of 2007 ( the title alone should be a warning that illicit motives are at work ) , which authorizes open - ended surveillance of Americans  overseas phone calls and e-mails without the need for a warrant or security justification .
It is , as Aziz Huq writes in The Nation , power without responsibility . 
We are long past the point of concerning ourselves about the potential for abuse .
This is out and out abuse  of a federal office , of governmental powers , of the oath made to the American people to preserve , protect and defend the Constitution .
President Bush is clearly not listening to the American people , and the law means next to nothing to him  unless he can bend it to his own purposes .
Which leaves us where , exactly ?
The groundwork has been laid , the documents signed and the powers transferred .
For all intents and purposes , the Bill of Rights is as good as dead .
All we await is the fall of the axe to signal that what has been plotted on paper is now a reality : the Bill of Rights will soon cease to afford us any protection from an imperial president .
And still President Bush continues to add to his list of extraordinary orders and directives , granting himself near dictatorial powers .
Congress , with little spine , less integrity and too busy running for re-election , offers little attempt at oversight , enabling the president to ride roughshod over the Constitution .
And the media  the perfect accomplice in this stealthy , bloodless coup  content to inundate us with the latest celebrity scandal , says virtually nothing about Bushs burgeoning powers .
All the while , most Americans continue to operate in blissful near - ignorance , unaware or uncaring that the republic is about to fall .
Yet , in the end , we the people   not the president or the politicians  are the ones who will suffer the consequences .
They may justify violating our freedoms in the name of national security and the war against terrorism , but we will always be the ones to pay the price .
Let us not forget that presidents dont give up power .
Furthermore , what George Bush is currently doing is preparing a toolbox of power for the next president , whomever that might be .
And the Constitution be damned .

The Best of John W. Whitehead
DVD sales are lagging and game sales are up .
Something 's gotta give , as they say .
Retail shelf space is a finite thing in the world of brick and mortar , so each inch has to be maximized with product that is going to sell .
As video games continue their rise , we 're likely to see less and less shelf space given to DVDs , and more to video games and related merchandise .
NPD analyst Anita Frazier weighed in on the record game sales last month when talking about October 's sales numbers .
" This year sales have already achieved the annual sales number for 2005 — and the two biggest months are yet to come .
I think we 'll see not only record - breaking revenues but record - breaking year - over - year growth when the final numbers are tallied , " she said .
The month before , Frazier made another hopeful comment about the industry : " Although we 've been confident for many months now that the industry was poised to realize it 's best year ever in terms of revenue , the results in recent months makes me even more bullish . "
In other words , the sales keep getting better and better , with titles like Guitar Hero 3 and Halo 3 leading the charge .
In contrast , DVD sales have been sluggish for quite some time , with the major studios taking note .
Halo 3 sold more copies than the big - name DVD release Shrek the 3rd , even at a much higher retail price ; the largest Halo 3 package cost an astounding $ 130 .
With the blockbuster video games going toe - to - toe with Hollywood 's biggest franchises and winning , the writing is on the wall for retail space .
" Intuitively , you think that consumers have a finite amount of money to spend , " Bob Geistman , senior VP of sales and marketing at Ingram Entertainment told Video Business .
" One has to hurt the other .
Studios are becoming cognizant of the fact that they need to plan their DVD releases around games . "
What is fueling this change ?
While it has been building for some time , games are finally going mainstream in a big way .
Penny Arcade recently ran a poignant comic strip showing a grandmother 's pink DS on a doily , her reading glasses perched on top .
This kind of sight is proving common , as families and older consumers begin to pick up Nintendo Wiis and DSes in large numbers .
Nintendo is n't the only force moving this trend forward , however , as many high - school and college - age gamers would much rather stay home and pretend to be a rock star with Guitar Hero and Rock Band games ... a very social activity that draws groups of people to one house instead of going to a bar or the movie theater .
In reaction , many bars are actually cashing in on the rhythm game phenomena by hosting parties with the game 's hardware and offering prize while selling many drinks in the process .
At the same time , newer gamers are discovering that many developers and publishers are making titles aimed at them , and are subsequently moving their leisure dollars to those games instead of DVDs .
Add to that the high - definition format war which is turning people off from upgrading to new players and repurchasing their content , and you have the perfect opportunity for gaming to become one of the most popular ways for people to spend their time .
Retailers do n't have any loyalty to the DVD market ; if they can make more money by stocking their shelves with video games and hardware , they will .
With even 7 - 11 locations beginning to stock games for big launches , games could become the dominant product on the shelves of historically music - and movie - focused stores .
Google 's going to bid .
The search giant has just announced its plans to enter the 700MHz spectrum auction in January , potentially paving the way for a transformation of the US wireless space .
In a statement , a Google spokesperson told Ars , " Our goal is to make sure that American consumers have more choices in an open and competitive wireless world .
FCC rules require us to reveal our plans by December 3 , and we fully intend to do so .
In the meantime , we are making all the necessary preparations to become an applicant to bid in the auction . "
Coupled with the company 's recent launch of Android and formation of the Open Handset Alliance , the announcement is certain to ignite a new round of frenzied speculation about just what , exactly , the Big G would do with a nationwide swath of 700M Hz spectrum .
Conventional wisdom has had it that Google has no interest in actually becoming a network provider , what with all the hassles from those grubby customers who can't make feature X work on Y handset .
And then there 's billing and engineering and marketing and local storefronts and all the rest of it that makes up a modern wireless carrier 's operations .
But if Google is truly serious about the four open access provisions it pushed at the FCC earlier this year , that may not be the company 's plan at all .
One of those provisions would have forced any winning bidder on the spectrum to lease network access at wholesale rates to others , thus paving the way for a host of innovative wireless providers who could not afford to build a national infrastructure themselves .
The FCC rejected that provision , but there 's nothing keeping Google from supporting the idea itself .
The company may well may be planning to drop $ 10 billion on the physical infrastructure and network engineering , but leave customer - facing services and applications up to others who lease bandwidth from the network .
This could pave the way for a wireless broadband boom ( which would be good for Google ) , but it could also ensure that the company has a network not at the mercy of the wireless carriers .
With that sort of competition , the traditional wireless companies may be forced to ( partially ) release the stranglehold they have on other applications and devices on their own networks .
In the Open Handset Alliance , Google already has the support of numerous handset makers , all of whom have pledged to produce phones running some version of Android .
Imagine the developer 's playground this ecosystem could turn out to be : open - source phone OS , support from handset vendors whose feature sets can no longer be dictated by wireless operators , and an open network that will allow any application from any device .
Can you say , " Disruptive ? "
Whether this will be the route Google goes remains unclear .
Certainly , the company wants to get its search tools and apps available on as many cell phones as possible , and to do that in the short term , it will certainly need the help of existing carriers .
Throwing up direct competition to those carriers is probably not a great way to accomplish that goal , though Apple has shown that when tech behemoths say " jump ! , " telcos can be made to ask " how high ? "

ANOTHER debate to do with Iraq and Afghanistan is building in America , one that could have important consequences for the West .
This debate is being conducted in the Pentagon — and it has to do with the future shape of America 's armed forces .
With its far - flung alliances and commitments , the superpower rightly wants a “ full spectrum ” of military capabilities to deal with everything from an all - out war to a small policing action .
But precisely what the mix should be is increasingly contentious — and could prove expensive .
If the biggest threat comes from rising powers , such as a belligerent Russia or a pushy China , America and its allies will need to invest in aircraft , ships and advanced weapons to cope .
If the greatest challenge is the fight against militants and insurgents around the world — seen by some as a new and different “ fourth generation ” of warfare ( see article ) — then they will need more boots on the ground and , crucially , different sorts of soldiers wearing them .
Sadly for taxpayers everywhere , the emerging answer from America is that a modern power needs to prepare for both challenges .
But there has been a clear swing towards manpower from technology .
The troops , they are a changin '
The change has been striking .
The “ transformation ” advocated by Donald Rumsfeld , George Bush 's first defence secretary , envisaged that the armed forces would be slimmed down and money invested in “ smart ” weapons , reconnaissance systems and data links .
Speed , stealth , accuracy and networks would substitute for massed forces .
The army 's idea of its “ future warrior ” was a kind of cyborg , helmet stuffed with electronic wizardry and a computer display on his visor , all wirelessly linked to sensors , weapons and comrades .
New clothing would have in - built heating and cooling .
Information on the soldier 's physical condition would be beamed to medics , and an artificial “ exoskeleton ” ( a sort of personal brace ) would strengthen his limbs .
The initial success in toppling first the Taliban in Afghanistan and then Saddam Hussein in Iraq seemed to vindicate such concepts .
But the murderous chaos in Iraq , and the growing violence in southern Afghanistan , have shown that America is good at destroying targets , and bad at rebuilding states .
Firepower is of little use , and often counter - productive , when the enemy deliberately mingles among civilians .
Robert Gates , Mr Rumsfeld 's successor , is thus presiding over something of a counter - revolution .
Technological tricks are not being abandoned .
But the army is to get a bigger share of the defence budget and has been told to recruit more soldiers with it .
Precisely because America is so powerful against conventional armies , Mr Gates expects its enemies to rely on asymmetric warfare .
In other words , America must expect to fight protracted , enervating counter - insurgency wars that offer no clear - cut victories and risk the prospect of humiliation .
A new manual on counter - insurgency co-authored by the man now in charge of the war in Iraq , General David Petraeus , overturns the notion that America does n't “ do nation - building ” .
Counter - insurgency , it says , is “ armed social work ” .
It requires more brain than brawn , more patience than aggression .
The model soldier should be less science - fiction Terminator and more intellectual for “ the graduate level of war ” , preferably a linguist , with a sense of history and anthropology .
The indirect approach
In general , the shift from technology to manpower is welcome .
Some sceptics will argue that America 's first future priority should be to avoid smallish wars of choice altogether .
Even if that were sensible , history suggests it is unlikely to happen : American troops have kept on getting involved in foreign conflicts .
The military planners ' job is to cope with the likely , not to restrict democratically elected politicians ' options .
From that perspective , two doubts come to the fore .
The first is whether the Pentagon is right to focus so heavily on creating more combat brigades .
With American units serving 15 months in the field and a year at home at best , the army understandably wants more front - line soldiers to ease the strain .
But large armies have often found it extremely hard to fight guerrillas in far - away places — ask the French in Algeria , the Russians in Afghanistan and , not least , the Americans themselves in Vietnam .
With the possible exception of the British in Malaya , it is hard to think of many insurgencies in modern times that have been crushed by a Western occupying power .
Post - colonial politics , stronger concerns for human rights , the rapid dispersal of news : all these ( good ) things make today 's conflicts even harder to win for occupiers .
So it may well be better to step back and work through local allies .
Few insurgencies have unseated existing governments .
In the “ war on terror ” most of the important al - Qaeda suspects have been rounded up for America by local allies .
Strengthening local forces is the best way of salvaging Iraq and Afghanistan , and may help avoid the need for future interventions .
To be fair , the Pentagon talks about building “ partner capacity ” , but it may need more radical steps — in particular creating new specialist units to train allies , embed Western soldiers in local forces to improve their performance and be able to call in airstrikes , and help organise civil reconstruction .
Generals complain about splitting the army , but they already oversee a myriad of specialist units .
It is at least worth trying .
The other lingering concern with the shift in focus from destruction to construction has to do with skimping on conventional weaponry .
At the margin , it is certainly worth putting more money into manpower at the expense of some futuristic projects .
The prospect of an all - out war with Russia or China is distant for now ; the risk of losing in Iraq and Afghanistan is acute .
But raiding other defence programmes can only go so far .
At 4 % of GDP , America 's defence spending is low by historical standards : it was 9 % during the Vietnam war and 14 % during the Korean war .
The problem is worse in Europe : many of America 's allies spend less than the 2 % minimum target set by NATO .
If the West wants to build a smarter army of the future , it will have to pay for it .

And I 'm married , too . "

ATLANTA ( AP ) 
A man enjoyed freedom Tuesday after a DNA test proved he did not commit a 1979 rape .
John Jerome White , 48 , left Macon State Prison on Monday evening .
" I 'm just thankful that this is behind me , " White said at a news conference Tuesday morning with the Georgia Innocence Project , which had worked to free him .
" When I first started out , I wondered why this happened to me , " he said , breaking into tears .
" I just saw it as something that had to happen because I was n't living a moral life . "
White is the seventh Georgia convict to be cleared by DNA evidence , said Aimee Maxwell , director of the Atlanta - based Georgia Innocence Project .
In every case , the men were wrongly convicted on the basis of eyewitness accounts .
" This case does point out the fallibility of eyewitness identification , " Maxwell said .
White was convicted in 1980 of breaking into a 74 - year - old woman 's home and raping and robbing her .
The woman has since died .
He was sentenced to life in prison , then was paroled in 1990 .
White was sent back to prison for 2½ years on a drug violation in 1993 .
A 1997 robbery charge led to a conviction , a seven - year sentence and a requirement that he return to serving his life sentence for the rape conviction .
At the urging of the Innocence Project , authorities tested DNA from hairs found at the scene of the 1979 rape , using tests that were n't available at the time .
District Attorney Peter Skandalakis of the Coweta Judicial District said authorities found that the DNA matched DNA on file in the Georgia Bureau of Investigation database , leading to an investigation of a new suspect .
No arrests have been made yet , the GBI says .
Maxwell said her organization is working with state lawmakers and authorities to require all law enforcement agencies to develop and follow clearly written procedures for doing an eyewitness identification with a victim , Maxwell said .
The organization says 82 % of the 355 Georgia law enforcement agencies surveyed do not have any type of written eyewitness standards .
White was joined at the news conference by his wife , three sisters and his mother , Florence White .
" When they called to tell me that he was getting out , I did n't know whether to shout , cry or holler , " said his mother , who lives in Meriwether County .
" I 'm so glad to have him back home one more time before I leave this world . "

I ’m not a Comcast customer .
I happen to get service from Verizon , ATT and Time Warner at various locations where I pay for internet service .
If I was a Comcast customer , I would tell them , as I am now telling all the services I am a customer of :
BLOCK P2P TRAFFIC , PLEASE
As a consumer , I want my internet experience to be as fast as possible .
The last thing I want slowing my internet service down are P2P freeloaders .
Thats right , P2P content distributors are nothing more than freeloaders .
The only person / organization that benefits from P2P usage are those that are trying to distribute content and want to distribute it on someone else ’s bandwidth dime .
Does anyone really think its free ?
That all the bandwidth consumed with content being distributed by P2P is n’t being paid for by someone ?
That bandwidth is being paid for by consumers .
Consumers who pay for personal , not commercial applications .
When consumers provide their bandwidth to assist commercial applications , they are subsidizing those commercial applications which if it is n’t already , should be against an ISPs terms of service .
Thats not to say there isnt a place for P2P .
There is .
P2P is probably the least efficient means of distributing content in the last mile .
Comcast , Time Warner , etc should charge a premium to those users who want to act as a seed and relay for P2P traffic .
After all , that is why P2P is used , right ?
For content distributors to avoid significant bandwidth and hosting charges .
That makes it commercial traffic far more often than not .
So make them pay commercial rates .
That will stop P2P dead in its tracks .
P2P isnt so good that people will use it when they have to pay for all the bandwidth it consumes .
It will die a quick death .
That will speed up my internet connection .
thats a good thing .
So hang in there Comcast
Update : I wanted to offer the best alternative to P2P for audio and video …..
Google Video .
If you are trying to do distribution of audio or video , why in the world would you use P2P when Google Video will host and distribute it very efficiently and for free ?
To help those of you who cant understand how to distribute audio on Google Video , here is a hint :
Re encode it with a little video , a couple pictures , whatever .
Then it it wont be an audio file , it will be a video file ..
Ta da .
You get distribution by the best distribution network on the planet , for free .

Archaeology in Crisis Bulgaria Plagued by ' Grave Robbers '
From an archaeological point of view , Bulgaria has some of the richest digs around .
The problem is , plunderers are aware of the valuable treasure as well .
And they often get there first .

GOP Presidential candidate Ron Paul sat down with “ Recovering Republican ” and former Constitution Party presidential candidate John Lofton to talk about abortion , gays in the military , and other hot button issues on Lofton ’s radio show , The American View .
You can listen to the interview here ( head about 24:30 ) .
LOFTON : Do you believe it [ homosexuality ] is a sin ?
PAUL : I have not …I ’m not as judgmental about that probably because of my medical background , so I do n’t see it in those simplistic terms ; I think it ’s a complex issue to decide whether it ’s sin or other problems with the way people are born .
It ’s to me too complex to give an answer as simple as that .
LOFTON : Do you believe that God says it is a sin ?
PAUL : Well , I believe a lot of people understand it that way , but I think everybody ’s God ’s child too , so I have , you know , trouble with that .
LOFTON : Well , actually everyone ’s made in the image of God , but not everyone ’s a child of God .
Some of them are children of the devil …
Paul is then asked about Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell .
Lofton first goes into a fairly lengthy diatribe about how all sinners need to be booted from the military .
LOFTON : We ’ll try to stop anyone from getting in the military who is a homosexual , who is an adulterer , who is a fornicator , and then other categories that indicate a character flaw .
Why we should n’t try to do that ? ”
PAUL : Looking it in protecting the military if they are going to perform the services , and they are imperfect — because we ’re all imperfect and we all sin .
If a heterosexual or homosexual sins , that to me is the category of dealing with their own soul .
Since we cannot have only perfect people going in the military I want to separate the two because I do n’t want to know the heterosexual flaws , nor the homosexual flaws and that ’s why I got in some trouble with some of the civil libertarians because I do n’t have any problem with Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell .
Because I do n’t think that , for the practicality of running a military , I ’d just as soon not know every serious thing that any heterosexual or homosexual did , and those flaws have to do with all our flaws because each and everyone one of us has those imperfections .
This is ridiculous .
Again , heteronormativity blinds
Paul to the fact that gays do n’t want the repeal of DADT to have sex in the barracks — gays and lesbians simply do not want to hide their orientation .
Heterosexuals serving our country are able to speak openly about their lives — a partner back home , for instance , without fearing that they will be kicked out of the military .
Heterosexuality , and the culture that surrounds it , is everywhere , presumed and affirmed .
BTW , Lofton goes on to say that “ God will not bless an army or a military that is full of unrepentent , practicing homosexuals , and adulterers and fornicators . ”

Fox host : ' If they cared about us , ' CNN debate would have asked about Miss Puerto Rico David Edwards and Muriel Kane

If CNN had cared about catering to Fox News priorities during its presentation of the Republican YouTube debate , the network would have spent less time on immigration issues and more on Miss Puerto Rico , according to Fox and Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade .
During a discussion about a recent Los Angeles Times editorial , which accused CNN of focusing its debate on illegal immigration in order to boost the ratings of the network 's marquee anchor , Lou Dobbs , Kilmeade suggested that the personal interests of the Fox and Friends co-hosts had been ignored .
" If they really cared about us , they'd be asking Miss America stories , " said Kilmeade , possibly offering a tongue - in - cheek critique of Fox and Friends ' typically light programming fare .
" We love the Miss America stories , Miss Puerto Rico , and things like that , if they wanted to kiss up to us .
But no one really wants to do that . "
" Meaning the three of us ? " co-host Alisyn Camerota asked Kilmeade , referring to her and fellow host Steve Doocy .
" Yes , the three of us .
We seem to thrive on that , " Kilmeade responded .
Ingrid Marie Rivera , named Miss Puerto Rico Universe last month , recently made the apparently erroneous claim that her clothing and makeup were doused with pepper spray in a sabotage attempt during the title pageant .
Fox and Friends has routinely pounded CNN for its handling of the Republican debate , and continued the barbs on Tuesday .
" It was a stinker , " laughed Fox 's Steve Doocy in opening a segment headed " Debate Debacle . "
Early criticisms of last week 's debate were focused on the presence of a number of unidentified Democratic supporters among the questioners and had a clearly partisan Republican bias .
However , two newspaper columns over the weekend , both of which were cited by the Fox hosts , raised more serious concerns about CNN 's overall skewing of the debate topics .
St. Petersburg Times columnist Howard Troxler complained " CNN did a lousy , even offensive , job in Wednesday night 's debate in St. Petersburg .
I do n't just mean that they let in Democratic ringers .
I mean that CNN put on a parody of what it thought ought to be a Republican debate . "
Troxler objected that not only did many of the questioners seem like liberal stereotypes of right - wing extremists , but the questions themselves were skewed towards hot - button issues .
" Sure , there were some good questions , " he wrote .
" But notice that none was about the economy .
None was about Putin in Russia or Chavez in Venezuela .
Nobody asked what we should do about our mortgage disaster .
There was not a single question about health care , or overpaid U.S. executives , or our energy future , or the safety of our food supply . "
Los Angeles Times columnist Tim Rutten came down even harder on CNN , writing , " The United States is at war in the Middle East and Central Asia , the economy is writhing like a snake with a broken back , oil prices are relentlessly climbing toward $ 100 a barrel and an increasing number of Americans just can't afford to be sick with anything that wo n't be treated with aspirin and bed rest .
So , when CNN brought the Republican presidential candidates together this week for what is loosely termed a ' debate , ' what did the country get but a discussion of immigration , Biblical inerrancy and the propriety of flying the Confederate flag ? "
Rutten went on to suggest that " CNN chose to devote the first 35 minutes of this critical debate to a single issue -- immigration " only because " CNN 's most popular news - oriented personality , Lou Dobbs , has made opposition to illegal immigration and free trade the centerpiece of his neonativist / neopopulist platform .
In fact , Dobbs led into Wednesday 's debate with a good solid dose of immigrant bashing .
His network is in a desperate ratings battle with Fox News and , in a critical prime - time slot , with MSNBC's Keith Olbermann .
So , what 's good for Dobbs is good for CNN . "

With headlines constantly touting the adoption of social networking , blogging , and text messaging among US teenagers , it comes as no surprise that Internet use among that demographic is statistically still on the rise .
Teens are blogging , using social networks , posting photos , and sharing videos in record numbers .
Examining the details in a new Teens and Social Media report ( PDF ) from the Pew Internet & American Life Project , however , reveals that with all this online socializing , teens are actually more conscious than ever of how and with whom they share their content .
In summary , 93 percent of US teens use the Internet now in some way .
Many of the general numbers are up from Pew 's 2004 study : 39 percent of these teens share their own artistic creations like artwork , photos , stories , or videos ( up from 33 percent in 2004 ) , 28 percent have created their own online journal or blog ( up from 19 percent ) , and 26 percent remix content they find online for their own creations ( also up from 19 percent ) .
Altogether , that makes up for 64 percent of online teens , or 59 percent of all teens that are creating something on the web .
Contributing the most to these numbers are significant increases in blogging and video sharing .
Though numbers all around are up , girls dominate the teen blogging boom with 35 of online teen girls blogging versus 20 percent of boys .
Conversely , video sharing at sites like YouTube and Facebook is dominated nearly two to one by boys , with 19 percent of online teen boys posting videos and only 10 percent of online teen girls doing the same .
Pew 's numbers also note that teen girls far outrank boys in sharing pictures , though comparative numbers are not available .
As the growth of social sites and sharing tools exploded over the last half a decade , so too did a growing concern among parents and government officials over their potential dangers , even if studies show this concern to be overblown .
For some time now , educational campaigns directed at this demographic have more or less warned that sharing too much on the Web is like shouting your personal details out to the entire school body and the rest of the world .
While there is likely still a lot more work to do to raise teens ' consciousness of what and how much to share , Pew 's numbers reveal that notable progress is being made .
About two - thirds ( 66 percent ) of teens with some kind of online profile use the site 's privacy features to restrict access in some way .
Over half post false information , with just 11 percent sharing both a first and last name , and only 5 percent sharing a full name , photo , city , or state .
The numbers are also strong when restricting access to photos , but not nearly as much for videos .
While 39 percent of teens say they restrict access to photos " most of the time , " only 19 percent restrict their videos with the same frequency .
Teen girls , especially older ones aged 15 - 17 , are more likely to restrict access to their photos : 44 percent versus 33 percent of boys .
Pew 's study offers far more details as to which teens are doing what on ( and off ) the Web , but their increased awareness in an age where anything can be shared almost anywhere should offer some relief to those watching the industry .
" Java is slow , interpreted language . "
This statement was true at least in the very first years ( or months ) of Java .
Since JDK 1.3/1.4 the peformance is getting better and better .
The newest JVMs becomes even more efficient , than C .
The c-compiler is static , so once compiled code cannot be optimized any more .
The HotSpot is able to perform optimization on the fly , but the optimizations are based on statistics , which are not available at compile - time .
Now the conclusion : because HotSpot is written in C itself , it can not be so fast as Java :-) .
Beyond that C is not very good to maintain .
This is basically the idea of the research project maxwell ( actually a cool name ) .
James Gosling mentioned this project during the informal interview at the Sun Tech Days in Frankfurt , and said something like : " it begins to turnaround " .
It 's really an interesting idea - a short ( 21 pages ) description is available as well .
Researchers have designed a product that its inventors claim could easily produce between 15 and 20 times the total electricity the world uses today .
Not only that , it could also be used as a desalination device and may be able to reverse the effects of global warming .
Those are pretty big claims , but the researchers from the Technion - Israel Institute of Science seem confident that the " Energy Tower " could be a major solution to the world 's problems .
They 've been working on the concept since 1983 , and together have spent more than 150 man - years researching , designing , testing , and analyzing .
As project founder Professor Dan Zaslavsky explains , the Energy Tower works on the basic principle of convection : hot air rises and cold air falls .
The 3,000 - foot tall tower , with a diameter of 1200 feet , would take advantage of the heavy falling weight of cold air .
Any kind of water - from a sea or drainage ditch - would be added to the top of the tower .
The water would cool the hot air at the top , and the heavy cooled air would sink downwards , gathering speed as it falls , and would be used to power turbines at the tower 's base .
The turbines would be connected to a generator , which produces electricity .
Because it relies on the sun for hot air , the Energy Tower is considered a type of solar power .
Due to the original hot air required at the top , the concept would work best in hot , dry climates .
The team has identified regions in about 40 countries where towers could work , including in the Middle East , Australia , North Africa , California , and Mexico .
The researchers also predict that the project would be cheap - electricity generated from this method would cost just 2.5 cents per kilowatt - hour , which is less than a third of the cost of electricity in Israel today .
It 's also cheaper than solar , hydro- electric , and wind power .
Zaslavsky explains that the tower design could also be used for water desalination , producing fresh water at only half the cost of existing desalination technologies .
The water reserves might be used locally for a number of purposes , including desert irrigation , the production of bio-fuels such as sugar , or for fish farming - an energy - efficient form of agriculture .
Finally , the Energy Tower might help the Earth cool itself , and actually reverse global warming .
" Hadley Cell Circulation " is a natural process whereby the earth cools itself , but it mostly occurs only near the equator .
But by cooling air around it , often in desert regions , the Energy Tower could expand the effects of this global cooling process .
While the researchers are confident in their technology , they 're still waiting for investors to finance the project before taking the next steps , including building a prototype .
But in the end , they hope that the Energy Tower could be the key to providing cheap energy for large populations .

With threats of new sanctions against his country swirling , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad struck a typically defiant tone on Wednesday , calling his country 's nuclear progress " irreversible , " and emphasizing success at its Natanz underground nuclear site .
In a speech to loyalists , President Ahmedinejad asserted the country now has 3,000 centrifuges to enrich uranium , which could produce fuel for either nuclear reactors or a bomb , Reuters reports .
Western experts say 3,000 machines running smoothly for long periods at supersonic speed could make enough enriched uranium for an atomic bomb in about a year , if Iran wanted , and form the basis for " industrial - scale " nuclear fuel production .
" The Iranian nation has entered the phase of industrial scale of nuclear fuel [ production ] and the train of the Iranian nation 's progress is irreversible , " Ahmadinejad told a rally in South Khorasan province broadcast live on state television .
Iran now appears to have nearly 3,000 installed , divided into 18 cascades of 164 each , diplomats and analysts said , but there is still no evidence they are being run together , or that all are being fed with uranium for enrichment .
On Tuesday , US Defense Secretary Robert Gates traveled to China , partly in the hope of gaining more support for heightened sanctions against Iran .
Agence France - Presse reports that China appears unmoved from its position that anything beyond diplomacy is required .
The US defence secretary made no apparent headway on an appeal for Chinese support for sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme in his talks here Monday , when he was told China preferred diplomatic dialogue to economic pressure .
But a senior US defence official told reporters that in the meeting with Hu he would push for further discussions on Iran .
China has joined Russia , also a veto - wielding permanent member of the UN Security Council , in opposing a further round of UN economic sanctions to step up the pressure against Tehran , which has defied international demands that it halt its uranium enrichment programme .
While Russia and China , both powerful at the United Nations , appear opposed to heightened sanctions , the Bush administration is finding allies in its quest for tougher measures against Tehran .
The German government broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports that during his visit to Washington this week , French President Nikolas Sarkozy expressed differences on some international issues but appeared to largely share Washington 's concerns over Iran .
Sarkozy may not see eye - to - eye with Bush on policy in Iraq , but " that does n't influence our friendship , " said the French president , who also hailed US courage after the attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The two are in agreement , however , on the Iran nuclear standoff and Paris has repeatedly supported stronger sanctions .
" The hypothesis of a nuclear weapon in the hands of the current leaders of Iran is for France inacceptable ( sic ) , " said Sarkozy , adding that civilian nuclear energy is a right , also for Iran .
The Associated Press reports that Iran is also embroiled in a fight to keep five of its nationals off Interpol 's most wanted list .
US , Argentine and other international officials allege the five were involved in a 1994 bombing that killed 85 people at a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires .
Iranian envoys at [ an Interpol ] meeting in Morocco on Tuesday accused Israel and the United States of playing politics with the international police agency as it considers whether to put five Iranians and a Lebanese man on its most - wanted list .
Argentine prosecutors have alleged that Iranian officials orchestrated the bombing and entrusted the Lebanon - based militant group Hezbollah to carry it out .
In March , Interpol 's executive committee backed Argentina 's request to put out red notices for the six , including an Iranian former intelligence chief and former leader of the elite Revolutionary Guards .
Iranian delegates lobbied colleagues by handing out dossiers written in several languages and explaining their case .
Among their arguments : Argentina 's investigation was flawed , if not corrupt ; some witnesses cited in that probe were themselves wanted by Interpol ; Iran quickly condemned the bombings ; a bilateral resolution would be better .
Iran 's apparent nuclear progress is stirring alarm in Israel , the Middle East 's lone nuclear power and the country that feels most threatened by Iran 's program .
The right - leaning Jerusalem Post quotes Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shaul Mofaz as saying that the next year will prove decisive on the question of whether Iran 's nuclear progress can be halted .
" Iran 's nuclear program is proceeding like an express train .
The diplomatic efforts to thwart Iran are like a slow train .
If we cannot derail the Iranian train from the tracks , we are on the verge of a nuclear era that will totally alter the regional reality , " the former defense minister and IDF chief of General Staff told the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish organizations in New York .
Another warning that time is running out came on Tuesday from Brig. - Gen. Yossi Baidatz , head of Military Intelligence 's research bureau , who told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that if Iran 's nuclear program went unchecked , the Islamic Republic could have nuclear weapons by the end of 2009 .
" The Iranian regime is faced with internal issues , but there is no threat to its existence or stability .
Assuming it faces no difficulties , the worst case scenario is Iran obtaining nuclear arms by 2009 , " said Baidatz .
He added that the regime of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad remained popular throughout the region , despite criticism farther abroad .
Others are more skeptical about Iran 's nuclear progress .
In the November issue of Arms Control Today , a publication of the US - based Arms Control Association , physicist and former UN weapons inspector David Albright and former State Department official Jacqueline Shire argue that , while it appears Iran is seeking nuclear weapons , it also still seems to be having technical problems .
Predicting when Iran could have nuclear weapons is more art than science .
Setting aside the political decision that would precede Iran 's acquisition of a nuclear weapon , the country faces the hurdles of acquiring sufficient nuclear explosive material for its first nuclear weapon and weaponizing that material into a workable , deliverable design .
These hurdles are surmountable with time .
Nonetheless , Iran 's quest for nuclear weapons has gone more slowly than expected , given that Iran began its gas centrifuge program in 1985 , at the height of the bloody Iran - Iraq War .
Examined in its totality , with all the caveats and unknowns , Iran 's uranium - enrichment program still has a way to go .
It has achieved the appearance of success in some areas by manufacturing and installing 3,000 centrifuges …
Iran has not ( yet ) demonstrated competency at enriching uranium , though it is clearly on the road toward doing so .
Despite the unknowns , the day when Iran could have the capability to make significant quantities of ( highly enriched uranium ) is firmer and is approaching .
What to do about Iran will become a higher priority in 2008 and likely dominate the agenda of the next administration , perhaps as much as Iraq has .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. President George W. Bush " has no recollection " of videotapes of CIA interrogations of some al Qaeda suspects or of plans to destroy the tapes , a White House spokeswoman said .
CIA Director Michael Hayden says congressional leaders were told about the tapes .
Bush and Vice President Cheney learned about videotaped interrogations of some al Qaeda suspects on Thursday , when CIA Director Michael Hayden briefed them about the existence of the tapes and their subsequent destruction , administration officials said Friday .
The interrogations -- using newly approved " alternative " interrogation techniques -- of two al Qaeda suspects were recorded in 2002 , Hayden said Thursday in a letter to CIA employees .
They were destroyed three years later when the agency determined they had no intelligence value and could pose a security risk , he said .
" I spoke to the president this morning about this , " White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
" He has no recollection of being made aware of the tapes or their destruction before yesterday .
He was briefed by General Hayden yesterday morning . "
The vice president learned about the tapes and their destruction at the same time , another administration official told CNN .
Sen . Chris Dodd , D - Connecticut , said that was " stretching credulity . "
" There 's something going on here , " Dodd , a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination , said on CNN's " The Situation Room .
" We 're not getting the full story , hence the reason why there should be an investigation .
It goes to the heart of our national security , our protection , our safety , our isolation in the world .
That 's why this is so important . "
Later Friday , two senior administration officials told CNN that then - deputy White House counsel Harriet Miers was aware of the tapes and told the CIA not to destroy them .
The officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of potential investigations on the matter , said they believe this is " exculpatory " for the White House because it shows a top official had told the CIA not to destroy the tapes .
The officials also said the information about the tapes was not relayed to the president until this week .
Democrats reacted strongly to the news of the existence of the tapes and their subsequent destruction , particularly given the continuing controversy over use of harsh interrogation techniques -- believed to include waterboarding , a technique that involves restraining a suspect and pouring water on him to produce the sensation of drowning -- and whether they constitute torture .
" It is a startling disclosure , " Sen . Richard Durbin , D - Illinois , said Friday on the Senate floor .
" The United States of America -- a nation where the rule of law is venerated -- has now been in the business of destroying evidence .
Evidence of a very sensitive nature -- evidence which clearly should have been protected for legal and historic purposes . "
Durbin said he was sending a letter to Attorney General Michael Mukasey calling for an investigation into whether any laws were broken by " CIA officials who covered up the existence of these videotapes . "
The Justice Department later said it had received Durbin 's letter , but would not comment other than to say it had begun gathering facts .
Sen . Edward Kennedy , D - Massachusetts , joined Durbin 's call for an investigation .
Democrat disputes CIA chief 's account
In his letter to CIA employees , Hayden wrote that the leaders of the CIA 's congressional oversight committees were informed of the videos " years ago " along with the agency 's intent to destroy them .
But Rep. Jane Harman , D - California , -- who was the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee when the tapes were made and when they were destroyed -- told CNN that was " not true . "
Harman said she 'd attended a classified briefing in 2003 that " raised some concerns in my mind , " prompting her to send a classified letter to the CIA 's general counsel .
" Obviously they both remain classified , " she said , " but I have raised with the CIA my view that no videotape should be destroyed .
Let me just leave it there .
...
" Segue to two years later , we have now learned that the tapes have been destroyed , " she said .
" I was still the ranking member of the committee , ( and ) no one ever informed me that tapes were being destroyed . "
Former Rep. Porter Goss , R - Florida -- who was head of the CIA when the tapes were destroyed -- was told about the tapes when he served as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , a former intelligence official told CNN .
The official said that Goss agreed with Harman that the tapes should not be destroyed and , when he became director of the agency in 2004 , he let " the appropriate people " know his opinion .
The official said Goss was unhappy when he learned after the fact that the tapes were destroyed .
Goss resigned in May 2006 ; Hayden was his successor .
Rep . Pete Hoekstra of Michigan , currently the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee , was chairman of the committee after Goss joined the CIA until the Democrats won control of the House last year , covering the time when the tapes were destroyed .
He told CNN he was never briefed about the tapes ' existence or their destruction .
Other senators and representatives added their voices to the calls for investigations , including House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , D- Michigan ; Sen. Carl Levin , D - Michigan ; and presidential candidate Sen. Joe Biden , D - Delaware .
And Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - California , a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said that panel " will be doing their own investigation . "
Daniel Marcus , who was general counsel for the 9/11 commission investigating lapses in intelligence and security prior to the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , said the commission was not informed about the videotapes and that the decision to destroy them " reflected very bad judgment . "
Tapes were ' an internal check , ' chief says
Osama bin Laden lieutenant Abu Zubayda was one of two al Qaeda suspects whose interrogations were videotaped , according to a government official with knowledge of the tapes .
A government official with knowledge of the CIA 's interrogation practices described the detention and interrogation program as " very tightly held . "
This was a " highly compartmentalized program , " the official said .
" Relatively few " people had " knowledge of or access to " the tapes even within the agency .
Hayden , who was not CIA director at the time of either the interrogations or their destruction , said in his letter to CIA employees that the tapes were made as " an internal check " on the CIA 's use of harsh interrogation techniques , which , he said , became necessary after Zubayda 's " defiant and evasive " response to " normal questioning . "
John McLaughlin , who was deputy CIA director when the tapes were made , told CNN he and then - CIA Director George Tenet were told the interrogations were being taped after they had already begun .
He said the reasons for the taping were consistent with what Hayden said in his letter .
Neither McLaughlin , now a CNN analyst , nor Tenet were with the agency when the tapes were destroyed .
Hayden said the tapes were viewed in 2003 by the Office of the General Counsel and the Office of the Inspector General , both of which said the interrogation techniques used were lawful .
The agency made the decision to destroy the tapes " only after it was determined they were no longer of intelligence value and not relevant to any internal , legislative , or judicial inquiries , " Hayden said .
" Beyond their lack of intelligence value -- as the interrogation sessions had already been exhaustively detailed in written channels -- and the absence of any legal or internal reason to keep them , the tapes posed a serious security risk , " Hayden said .
" Were they ever to leak , they would permit identification of your CIA colleagues who had served in the program , exposing them and their families to retaliation from al Qaeda and its sympathizers . "
Levin called the security risk concern " a pathetic excuse . "
" They 'd have to burn every document at the CIA that has the identity of an agent on it under that theory , " he said .
Hayden , in his letter , said he was providing the background information to CIA employees because he expected possible " misinterpretations of the facts in the days ahead . "
Current and former government officials said that Jose Rodriguez , head of the CIA 's clandestine service at the time , authorized the tapes ' destruction .
Rodriguez , who resigned from the agency earlier this year , was not immediately available for comment .

News : Briefing
An underground coal fire has been snuffed out in China after decades of burning .
Nature News finds out what happened .
This Pennsylvanian coal - seam fire periodically burns to the surface , emitting smoke and noxious fumes .
US Office of Surface Mining
How can there be a fire underground ?
This fire was in the Terak coalfield of Urumqi , in the Xinjiang region of China .
It was the coal that was on fire — and had been for at least 50 years .
Such fires sound bizarre , but they are n't actually too unusual .
Similar underground fires hit coal regions around the world : there ’s a lot of fuel down there to burn .
The mining town of Centralia , in Pennsylvania , was almost entirely evacuated in 1984 because of a coal fire .
The fire started in 1962 , when a landfill site was set alight by town officials .
The landfill was in an old mine shaft , which subsequently burned and spread under the town .
There is also fossil evidence that coal fires raged in prehistoric times .
50 years seems like a long time to burn .
It is .
But there are fires that have been going much longer than that .
India has lots of them , some of which have been burning since 1916 .
In 2004 , another fire near Urumqi was finally extinguished after burning for 130 years .
Australia has the Burning Mountain , near Wingen in New South Wales , which is a coal seam that has been burning for an estimated 6,000 years .
How does a fire like this get started ?
To start , a fire needs heat , fuel and oxygen .
A coal seam provides an abundant fuel source .
It seems unlikely that coal deep underground would get any oxygen , but mining changes that .
“ As soon as mining takes place , then oxygen can circulate , ” says Paul Van Dijk at the International Institute for Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation , Enschede , the Netherlands .
Heat can be provided by sunlight , or , under certain conditions , by chemical reactions .
Other times it 's simply started by a match .
Most mine - related fires are started by humans , says Claudia Künzer at the Vienna University of Technology , Austria .
A miner might drop a cigarette or cook on an open fire .
How did they put this fire out ?
The fire covered some 923,500 square metres , fuelled by coal 100 metres below ground .
Such extensive underground fires are not easy to tame , and attempts to do so are often unsuccessful , says Van Dijk .
The report from the Chinese Coalfield Fire Fighting Project Office says that they drilled into the ground and poured down slurry and water to remove heat , then covered the surface to cut off the oxygen supply .
Even then , the area will be closely monitored until 2009 to check that it does n’t reignite .
The tiniest whiff of oxygen could set the whole thing going again .
“ It ’s possible to put them out , but it ’s difficult , ” says Künzer .
Are there other ways of taming these underground beasts ?
Other methods that have been tried include liquid nitrogen , which provides a double whammy by being both very cold and smothering the supply of oxygen .
Synthetic materials , such as foams , are also used .
Pouring on a blanket of mud can stop a fire , but because the coal is still hot , the mud can dry and cracks can form , allowing oxygen to seep back into the system .
How dangerous are these fires ?
They can make the ground unstable , so that holes suddenly appear underfoot .
But perhaps the main problem is economic : allowing the coal to burn uses up a local source of income .

And what about the environment ?
Six years after the terrorist attacks of 2001 , airport security remains a theater of the absurd .
The changes put in place following the September 11th catastrophe have been drastic , and largely of two kinds : those practical and effective , and those irrational , wasteful and pointless .
The first variety have taken place almost entirely behind the scenes .
Explosives scanning for checked luggage , for instance , was long overdue and is perhaps the most welcome addition .
Unfortunately , at concourse checkpoints all across America , the madness of passenger screening continues in plain view .
It began with pat - downs and the senseless confiscation of pointy objects .
Then came the mandatory shoe removal , followed in the summer of 2006 by the prohibition of liquids and gels .
We can only imagine what is next .
To understand what makes these measures so absurd , we first need to revisit the morning of September 11th , and grasp exactly what it was the 19 hijackers so easily took advantage of .
Conventional wisdom says the terrorists exploited a weakness in airport security by smuggling aboard box -cutters .
What they actually exploited was a weakness in our mindset — a set of presumptions based on the decades - long track record of hijackings .
In years past , a takeover meant hostage negotiations and standoffs ; crews were trained in the concept of “ passive resistance . ”
All of that changed forever the instant American Airlines Flight 11 collided with the north tower .
What weapons the 19 men possessed mattered little ; the success of their plan relied fundamentally on the element of surprise .
And in this respect , their scheme was all but guaranteed not to fail .
For several reasons — particularly the awareness of passengers and crew — just the opposite is true today .
Any hijacker would face a planeload of angry and frightened people ready to fight back .
Say what you want of terrorists , they cannot afford to waste time and resources on schemes with a high probability of failure .
And thus the September 11th template is all but useless to potential hijackers .
No matter that a deadly sharp can be fashioned from virtually anything found on a plane , be it a broken wine bottle or a snapped - off length of plastic , we are content wasting billions of taxpayer dollars and untold hours of labor in a delusional attempt to thwart an attack that has already happened , asked to queue for absurd lengths of time , subject to embarrassing pat - downs and loss of our belongings .
The folly is much the same with respect to the liquids and gels restrictions , introduced two summers ago following the breakup of a London - based cabal that was planning to blow up jetliners using liquid explosives .
Allegations surrounding the conspiracy were revealed to substantially embellished .
In an August , 2006 article in the New York Times , British officials admitted that public statements made following the arrests were overcooked , inaccurate and “ unfortunate . ”
The plot ’s leaders were still in the process of recruiting and radicalizing would - be bombers .
They lacked passports , airline tickets and , most critical of all , they had been unsuccessful in actually producing liquid explosives .
Investigators later described the widely parroted report that up to ten U.S airliners had been targeted as “ speculative ” and “ exaggerated . ”
Among first to express serious skepticism about the bombers ’ readiness was Thomas C. Greene , whose essay in The Register explored the extreme difficulty of mixing and deploying the types of binary explosives purportedly to be used .
Green conferred with Professor Jimmie C. Oxley , an explosives specialist who has closely studied the type of deadly cocktail coveted by the London plotters .
“ The notion that deadly explosives can be cooked up in an airplane lavatory is pure fiction , ” Greene told me during an interview .
“ A handy gimmick for action movies and shows like ’ 24 . ’
The reality proves disappointing : it ’s rather awkward to do chemistry in an airplane toilet .
Nevertheless , our official protectors and deciders respond to such notions instinctively , because they ’re familiar to us : we ’ve all seen scenarios on television and in the cinema .
This , incredibly , is why you can no longer carry a bottle of water onto a plane . ”
The threat of liquid explosives does exist , but it cannot be readily brewed from the kinds of liquids we have devoted most of our resources to keeping away from planes .
Certain benign liquids , when combined under highly specific conditions , are indeed dangerous .
However , creating those conditions poses enormous challenges for a saboteur .
“ I would not hesitate to allow that liquid explosives can pose a danger , ” Greene added , recalling Ramzi Yousef ’s 1994 detonation of a small nitroglycerine bomb aboard Philippine Airlines Flight 434 .
The explosion was a test run for the so - called “ Project Bojinka , ” an Al Qaeda scheme to simultaneously destroy a dozen widebody airliners over the Pacific Ocean .
“ But the idea that confiscating someone ’s toothpaste is going to keep us safe is too ridiculous to entertain . ”
Yet that ’s exactly what we ’ve been doing .
The three - ounce container rule is silly enough — after all , what ’s to stop somebody from carrying several small bottles each full of the same substance — but consider for a moment the hypocrisy of T.S.A. ’s confiscation policy .
At every concourse checkpoint you ’ll see a bin or barrel brimming with contraband containers taken from passengers for having exceeded the volume limit .
Now , the assumption has to be that the materials in those containers are potentially hazardous .
If not , why were they seized in the first place ?
But if so , why are they dumped unceremoniously into the trash ?
They are not quarantined or handed over to the bomb squad ; they are simply thrown away .
The agency seems to be saying that it knows these things are harmless .
But it ’s going to steal them anyway , and either you accept it or you do n’t fly .
But of all the contradictions and self - defeating measures T.S.A. has come up with , possibly none is more blatantly ludicrous than the policy decreeing that pilots and flight attendants undergo the same x-ray and metal detector screening as passengers .
What makes it ludicrous is that tens of thousands of other airport workers , from baggage loaders and fuelers to cabin cleaners and maintenance personnel , are subject only to occasional random screenings when they come to work .
These are individuals with full access to aircraft , inside and out .
Some are airline employees , though a high percentage are contract staff belonging to outside companies .
The fact that crew members , many of whom are former military fliers , and all of whom endured rigorous background checks prior to being hired , are required to take out their laptops and surrender their hobby knives , while a caterer or cabin cleaner sidesteps the entire process and walks onto a plane unimpeded , nullifies almost everything our T.S.A. minders have said and done since September 11th , 2001 .
If there is a more ringing let - me - get - this - straight scenario anywhere in the realm of airport security , I ’d like to hear it .
I ’m not suggesting that the rules be tightened for non-crew members so much as relaxed for all accredited workers .
Which perhaps urges us to reconsider the entire purpose of airport security :
The truth is , regardless of how many pointy tools and shampoo bottles we confiscate , there shall remain an unlimited number of ways to smuggle dangerous items onto a plane .
The precise shape , form and substance of those items is irrelevant .
We are not fighting materials , we are fighting the imagination and cleverness of the would - be saboteur .
Thus , what most people fail to grasp is that the nuts and bolts of keeping terrorists away from planes is not really the job of airport security at all .
Rather , it ’s the job of government agencies and law enforcement .
It ’s not very glamorous , but the grunt work of hunting down terrorists takes place far off stage , relying on the diligent work of cops , spies and intelligence officers .
Air crimes need to be stopped at the planning stages .
By the time a terrorist gets to the airport , chances are it ’s too late .
In the end , I ’m not sure which is more troubling , the inanity of the existing regulations , or the average American ’s acceptance of them and willingness to be humiliated .
These wasteful and tedious protocols have solidified into what appears to be indefinite policy , with little or no opposition .
There ought to be a tide of protest rising up against this mania .
Where is it ?
At its loudest , the voice of the traveling public is one of grumbled resignation .
The op - ed pages are silent , the pundits have nothing meaningful to say .
The airlines , for their part , are in something of a bind .
The willingness of our carriers to allow flying to become an increasingly unpleasant experience suggests a business sense of masochistic capitulation .
On the other hand , imagine the outrage among security zealots should airlines be caught lobbying for what is perceived to be a dangerous abrogation of security and responsibility — even if it ’s not .
Carriers caught plenty of flack , almost all of it unfair , in the aftermath of September 11th .
Understandably , they no longer want that liability .
As for Americans themselves , I suppose that it ’s less than realistic to expect street protests or airport sit-ins from citizen fliers , and maybe we should n’t expect too much from a press and media that have had no trouble letting countless other injustices slip to the wayside .
And rather than rethink our policies , the best we ’ve come up with is a way to skirt them — for a fee , naturally — via schemes like Registered Traveler .
Americans can now pay to have their personal information put on file just to avoid the hassle of airport security .
As cynical as George Orwell ever was , I doubt he imagined the idea of citizens offering up money for their own subjugation .
How we got to this point is an interesting study in reactionary politics , fear - mongering and a disconcerting willingness of the American public to accept almost anything in the name of “ security . ”
Conned and frightened , our nation demands not actual security , but security spectacle .
And although a reasonable percentage of passengers , along with most security experts , would concur such theater serves no useful purpose , there has been surprisingly little outrage .
In that regard , maybe we ’ve gotten exactly the system we deserve .
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
Three of Europe ’s top drugmakers have backed a new public - private scheme to use stem cells for safety testing of experimental medicines , signaling “ big pharma ’s ” growing interest in the controversial field .

Stem Cells for Safer Medicines Ltd , a non-profit British company launched on Wednesday , will focus initially on developing better ways of testing for liver toxicity -- the biggest single cause of drug failures and withdrawals .
GlaxoSmithKline , AstraZeneca and Roche have each paid 100,000 pounds ( $ 200,000 ) to help fund the first year ’s work , while the British government is contributing 750,000 pounds .
Other drug firms are expected to join soon , according Philip Wright , director of science and technology at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry , the firm ’s chief executive .
Stem cells are the body ’s master cell , acting as a source for the body ’s cells and tissues .
Embryonic stem cells are the most malleable , but their use in research is opposed by some people because it involves destruction of a human embryo .
Britain , however , has encouraged such research and science minister Ian Pearson said the new collaboration was an example of the government ’s commitment to the field .
By working across academic and industrial laboratories , the project aims to develop effective ways of using human embryonic stem cells to screen for potentially dangerous side effects of new drugs before they go into clinical trials .
It will not evaluate stem cells as potential treatments .
Ian Cotgreave , head of molecular toxicology at AstraZeneca , said there were still significant hurdles to overcome in differentiating liver cells from existing stem cell lines but the technology could dramatically improve R&D productivity .
“ The big problem is that , not knowing any better , we are today putting compounds into the regulatory ( approval ) system that then fall down in the clinic , ” he told reporters .
More than 90 percent of drugs entering clinical development fail to get to market , due to lack of effectiveness or adverse side effects that were not picked up in animal tests .
The liver is particularly vulnerable , since it acts as the body ’s garbage removal system .
High - profile drug failures due to liver problems include AstraZeneca ’s anti-thrombotic Exanta and Pfizer ’s diabetes drug Rezulin .
The next research area will be heart cells , where new tests could shed light on cardiovascular side effects like those that led to the withdrawal of Merck & Co ’s Vioxx in 2004 .
American Apparel placed an ad in the New York Times on Friday , getting all political on us : " At American Apparel , we agreed with the President 's call for immigration reform , so why has nothing been done for the last three years ?
.... It 's time to give a voice to the voiceless .
Businesses are afraid to speak to the media about immigration , frightened of reprisals by government agencies ....
At what point are we going to recognize that the status quo amounts to an apartheid system ?
At what point will America stop living in a state of denial ? "
Wild !
At what point will your billboards show some equal opportunity and start featuring fully - splayed half - naked men as well as women ?
It is long past time for American politicians to quit carrying water for the state of Israel and its powerful U.S. lobby .
Congress ’ craven obedience to the lobby is a disgrace .
America ’s strategic interests in the Middle East lie with the Arab countries .
Israel is a strategic and economic liability .
The U.S. government ’s slavish support of Israel brands us as a hypocrite and is responsible for most of the hostility toward the U.S .
Americans have been brainwashed into believing that it ’s the Arabs , and the Palestinians in particular , who do n’t want peace .
That is a big lie .
The Palestinians made an enormous concession when they agreed to settle for a state on 18 percent of Palestine .
Saudi Arabia proposed several years ago a peace plan in which all of the Arab countries would recognize Israel in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories .
The Israelis rejected it out of hand , just as they reject Arab efforts to have the Middle East a nuclear - free zone .
Israel ’s goal is and always has been to take all of Palestine and to get rid of the Palestinians .
The Israelis employed ethnic cleansing in 1948 and again in 1967 to make hundreds of thousands of Palestinians refugees .
For 40 years , the Israelis have refused to give back the Palestinian and Syrian lands they seized in war .
They have blatantly violated international law by building settlements on occupied land , and by violating the airspace of other sovereign countries .
Palestinians are the victims , not the villains , in this case .
The Israelis make their lives miserable in the hope they will give up and leave .
At the same time , the Israelis , in cahoots with the American government , maintain a charade of proposed peace talks .
They of course never come to fruition .
The Israeli government is not about to allow the Palestinians to have a viable state .
If they give the Palestinians anything , it will be a patchwork of enclaves completely surrounded and controlled by Israel .
Having created 700,000 Palestinian refugees , the Israelis have from the beginning refused to allow them to return to their homes , farms and businesses , all of which Israel confiscated on the specious grounds that they were " abandoned property . "
Without U.S. aid , which now is conservatively estimated to total $ 108 billion ( think of the infrastructure and schools that amount could build in the U.S. ) , and without the U.S. wielding its veto every time the United Nations tries to act , none of this would be possible .
It is not just the Muslim world that hates our pro-Israel foreign policy , for sound reasons that it is unjust and cruel .
Europeans and others around the world are contemptuous of America ’s slavelike obedience to a small foreign power .
It has gotten to the point that to be seen as an ally of the United States is viewed negatively .
The Arab and Muslim people , with the exception of al - Qaeda , do n’t hate America or Americans .
It is the pro-Israel foreign policy and , of course , our invasions of two Muslim countries that they hate .
Virtually all of the anti-Arab and anti-Muslim propaganda generated in this country has its source in the Israeli lobby and in Israel itself .
Thanks to the unconstitutional largess of the cowardly Congress , Israel is a rich country and one of the world ’s leading military powers .
It does n’t need American aid .
It is time to quit dancing to the tune of a lobby with dual loyalties and to pursue America ’s interests .
Americans are being betrayed by their own politicians , and it ’s time to treat those scoundrels with the contempt they deserve .

Great work .
By all accounts , this is still a developing story .
Saddly , we cannot trust our own law enforcement agencies .
That appears to be true at all levels of the goverment .
The truth in the end will come out .
This country was not founded on a lie but the truth .
I am positive that someone will speak up for Mr. Lemme so that his family can have closure .
I know that I would want that for myself .
God 's speed to you Brad .

great reporting , brad .
my only question is , where does it go from here ?
it seems like all the people who now need to start answering some tough questions can easily continue to stonewall , especially when the story is for most part being investigated by a blogger ( i.e. you ) .
maybe it 's time to get " 60 minutes " involved .
i know they are " mainstream media " and as such , can be pretty whimpy , but i also know they tend to love these kind of stories .
i realize the tendency of bloggers to want to go it alone and protect their turf --- do n't blame you there one bit .
still , it may be time to at least talk to some big media ( with big money ) , and see if they'd be willing to team up with you on this .
just my opinion .
the other option is to get a democratic senator involved .
somebody with some clout --- and money --- has got to start getting to the bottom of these unanswered questions .
that , to me , is the bottom line at this point .

Somebody has to explain how Lemme checked out of the motel at 6:54 a.m. on 6/30/03 , signed a " suicide " note at 8:10 a.m. ( no date given ) , then got back into the same motel in time to be found dead on 7/1/03 , without checking back in .
Did he occupy the same room the second time ?
The check - out clerk should be shown a photo of Lemme and asked , " Is this the man who checked out at 6:54 on 6/30 ? "
The signature on the slip does seem to match the note .
It sure looks as if Lemme 's second visit to the motel came after he was dead .
One possibility to explain the handwriting on the note is that he had been told , " Write this note or we 'll kill your wife and daughter , too . "
If Lemme had realized he was dealing with desperate men , that would have been a way to protect them , even in death .

I agree completely with # 3 , you need some help with money and a big name media to push through the sludge you are sure to encounter .
If you have that kind of help , perhaps the police will be more apt to really solve the case , even if they are pressured by outside influences , such as Feeney , Yang , etc .
You 're doing a super job Brad !

From what I have read on this site in the last several months , it seems to me that Brad has been trying to get big media interested in this case for a long time .
So there 's no need to be concerned about " a blogger trying to protect his turf . "
The thing to be concerned about , as far as I can tell , is that no big media source has enough courage to go where Brad is willing to go .
I would be surprised if any high - profile politician has enough courage either .
But then again , if we make enough noise , we might be able to embolden some of them .
It 's worked once or twice before .... for that reason , I think we should all work as hard as possible to attract some serious attention to this story .
Each in his or her own way , of course .
Got any pajamas ?
Got any beer ?
Ready , set , go !

It is my understanding that suicide is a selfish act by a severely depressed ( hopeless ) person and is often intended to hurt others .
It is also my understanding that self - mutilation is a form of blaming and punishing one 's self .
If true , and I cannot swear that it is , the suicide note does not seem to fit with the self - punishment style of death .

To start with , I 'd bring in a handwriting expert on the signature thing , and submit samples of Lemme 's handwriting to be compared with both the note and the signature .
Yes , he might have written the note under duress and to protect his family .
But , look at the way the word " family " is underlined - I can't say why , it just feels odd for some reason .
Besides the underline , does n't it seem he'd say something personal to his wife and daughter in the note ?
Just a hunch , and maybe I 'm out in left field , but ...
The problem is , if there are people in power keeping the case from being investigated , it would be hard to get anything done without hiring a private independent investigator , and they cost big bucks .
Unfortunately , that part of the Clint Curtis / Tom Feeney story may have to be investigated after the fact , meaning after all the other dominoes fall .
Going at it from the other end may be the only way to solve the crime once and for all .
With the photos on the 'net , at least it 'll be harder to destroy that particular evidence .
Too bad Soros does n't have a bone to pick with Feeney , that kinda financial backing could make a dent .
Still , Feeney is bound to have made some enemies over the time of his career , maybe some of them will come forward before all is said and done .
BTW , just out of curiosity , he 's up for election again in 2006 isen't he ?
Who 's running against him , any idea yet ?
Good job Brad .
Take care of yourself , you 're bound to be making some bad people nervous .

Yes , you 've done a great job , but you 're never going to get anyone in a position of power to touch this - the people behind it are more powerful and more rich and are very very interested in keeping the status quo .
You can't look at the past decade in this country and not see the increase in a blatant pattern of lies , deception and murder by those in power - and those with lesser power often do n't have the will to risk their own meal ticket - and those who do , the real truth seekers who still believe that we have a chance to change anything end up dead .
If any democratic politician cared about the truth , the election would have been contested and the burden of proof placed on the GOP - which , we all know , never came close to happening .

TO ALL INVESTIGATORS ,
CONSIDER CREATEING A SUICIDE PASSWORD TO GIVE TO YOUR LAWYER .
Example ,
I ������ �BEING OF SOUND MIND AND BODY ON THIS DAY ������ � PROMISED TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING �SUICIDE PASSWORD � IN ANY AND ALL �SUICIDE NOTES OR MESSAGES � LEFT BY ME IN THE EVENT OF A SELF - INFLICTED INJURY OR DEATH .
I FURTHER STATE THAT IN THE AVENT OF MY DEATH BY ANY MEANS , BE TREATED AS SUSPIOUS AND AN AUTOPSY SHOULD BY PROFORMED IF THE ABOVE �SUICIDE PASSWORD � ( OR PHRASE ) IS NOT INCLUDED IN ANY ALLEGED �SUICIDE NOTE � ACCREDITED TO ME ON MY DEMISE .
SIGNED �����..
WITNESSED ������ �
I 'm not a lawyer but surely something like this could let family and friends know that their loved one chose their course of action and their death was not the result of " external influence or pressure " .
P.S. Was the vehicle impounded as there may be evidence relating to the possible tranport of Mr. Lemme ( across a state line ) ?

The method used is highly unusual in males .
The most prevalent method is gunshot , with hanging coming in after that .
Slashing like that is quite rare .
And as the blood level got low would n't hallucination and self preservation mentality take over in a dream or semi-conscious or weakened mental state leading to movement from ... or within the bathtub in a primitive protective automatic system ... kinda like knee jerk .
He looked docile like no movement of any significance had taken place .
That is strange .
A Freedom of Information
Act request to the FDOT and the Valdosta Police might lead to the person in the FDOT who was talked to .
Also , the family should have credit card billing to show the dates the credit card company received the billing on checkin and checkout ...

It 's not uncommon for chain motels to run the check in tickets ( 1st receipt ) generally around " midnight ' the day you check in ... and that date appears on the ticket .
Its really odd they would run one at at 6:44 PM the night of check in ... thats very , very early ... unless they post arrival times ?????
Generally speaking , they could issue both receipts at check in ( arrival time ) if you pay at the " same time " .
Then both receipts would be time stamped within a couple of minutes .
However , 99 % of the motels I stayed at would n't do that .
Signing a master , Visia , AMX card receipt the morning of check out is standard practice .
What bothers me is the date and time differences .
I have stayed at hundreds of motels and believe me I 've tried on many occassions to have someone alter the day and / or time on those very same receipts without success .
Even while the clerk has a crisp , new $ 20 bill waving back and forth in front of their face .
With " chain " motels , I believe Knights Inn's is one , the dates are controlled by corporate hqtrs computer on the check in ticket and the bank on credit card receipts .
You can't change those dates or times and they are never wrong " .
Nana # 6 brought up a good point .... depressed people to not get up at 5:30 AM to check out of a motel .
Also , did he talk with his wife the night of check in ( 29th ) ???
Check when the motel runs the days " check in tickets " ( 1st. receipt ) .
That 6:44 PM time is very , very early .
Either he was DOA in a trunk at check in time .... or on a spur of the moment decision he met someone at the motel ?
Why was he there ?
The only thing you know for certain is ... someone shows up twice at the motel front desk ... and if it was Ray .... then someone was waiting for him in the motel room after he checks out on the 30th ???
Say , he was a military guy ... should n't the government have his fingerprints ???
Would the fingerprints show up on the motel copy of the ticket and / or bank copy of the receipt ??
What happened to his receipts ??
Do the police have them checked for fingerprints ??
I would think " 60 Minutes " would love this investigation .

Brad this is the first time I read about this and it is incredulous .
Clearly there are some stark inconsistancies that probably indicate foul play .
A ninth grade HS student could complete a better investigation than it appears the Valdosta Police Department are capable .
It saddens me to no end to see that local police men and woman will compromise themselves and succumb to political pressure and bury a probable murder case .
Could you post the names , addresses , emails and telephone numbers of any government officials and employees so I can contact them directly and encourage them to follow through on their investigation .
Thank you .

Was there a REASON it was laying on the bathroom counter and just " stopped " at 12:54 on the 30th ? )

First and foremost , I wish to extend my deepest sympaties to Mr. Lemme 's family and loved ones .
I cannot imagine how painful it must have been to experience such a tragic loss so suddenly and so unexpectedly --- no matter what the cause .
Then to have these pictures splattered across the internet , along with complete strangers dissecting the " facts " ... it just must be really unbearable .
I am so sorry .
Brad , I respect your caution and your inner-struggle regarding the link you have posted to the crime scene photos .
Because you waited to post the link , continued to investigate the " oddities " of the Valdosta police report ; as well as attempt to penetrate Capt .
Childress 's non-stonewalling stonewalling of past and recent events ; and because Mr. Lemmes untimely and unusual death DOES ultimately pertain to the Clint Curtis story ; I can only conclude that you have done the right thing .
This whole thing smacks of tabloid journalism .
Certainly not because of you , your work , or because of Clint Curtis , but because the whole convoluted mess reads like a B - grade movie .
Unfortunately , this is no movie .
It 's real .
And it 's really sad .
I guess the one question that keeps swirling in my mind is this :
If Mr. Lemme was purposefully targeted and killed , why then would the perpetrator (s ) stop there ?
It seems to me , they would want to ..um ... take care of , shall we say ?...
Mr. Curtis as well .
Keep up the good work , Brad .
You and Clint please stay safe .

In case Pale Rider missed it , Raymond Lemme was an Army Reservist .
He was also investigating the case as part of his * job * at the Florida State Inspector General 's office .
You might want to check a few more facts in the case before jumping to conclusions which will likely make only * you* look silly .
As well , Clint Curtis was a lifelong Republican up until very recently .
Just in case you missed that part as well .

Gee Brad , I have n't used a double - edged razor blade since I was a kid .
Is the blade consistent with the shaving gear he used ?
Did he have additional blades with him ?
I do n't think you can buy just one .
How did he carry it with out cutting something or himself .
And speaking of cuts .
He was righthanded , correct ?
and did his right hand have any cuts near the fingers that would have had to grip the blade ?
Not playing amatuer detective here , just curious and wonder why no one who investigated was .
And another thing .
Look at the organized way everything is laid out on the vanity top -- Hardly the sign of a " distraught " man . ( looks more like a valet did the job )
I question the following - the lack of any information that indicates a desire to die .
He had help and any real police investigater would have looked for the obvious things that I have pointed out , and probabley a lot more .
This is just another example of Southern hospitality in reverse Take care Brad

one question : What happened to Lemme 's body ?
Although there was clearly no autopsy , a number of people ( including mortuary / funeral parlor employees ) might remember if there was considerable bruising as there appears to be on Lemme 's neck .
( and , given his posture , this is not the kind of bruise that one would see as a result of post - mortem polling of blood at lower points of the body . )

Sorry to go back so long on string , but I just got a chance to read through these now .
In reference to # 28 , DJ Nelson talks about a possible conspiracy and even mentions his friendship with Paul Wellstone , and then , out of the blue , throws in this bit of anti-semetic drivel " The Zionist Jews now control everything in this country .
The entire media , the entire government , the banking system . "
For centuries , Jews have been blamed for everything wrong with the world and I resent having to read this same garbage on this site .
What Brad is doing is fantastic and to have such anti-semitic shit attached to this discussion is uncalled for - especially from someone who claims that Paul Wellstone , a Jew , was a friend of his .
I can actually stomach the trolls because I know where they are coming from .
But we are supposed to be the intelligent ones who rise above that - only to have one of our own insert such garbage .

Exactly right .
Stick to facts and leave the racial and ethnic crap to the other side .
Fact : Raymond Lemme said he was on the verge of breaking a major political scandal involving Feeney , Yang , and the Florida Department of Transportation .
Then he died by mysterious and unexplained means .
Fact :
He checked out of a motel a day before his body was found inside that same motel .
Fact : Lemme had no reason to be depressed .
On the contrary , he was energized by the success of his investigation .
He was also looking forward to his daughter 's wedding .
Fact : Investigators in Valdosta , Georgia are conspicuously avoiding discussing the evidence .
And , having reopened the investigation in December , 2004 , they suddenly closed it again after speaking to the Florida Department of Transportation , which might have been complicit in the very wrongdoing Lemme was investigating .
Fact :
There was no reason for Lemme to have been in Valdosta in the first place , except if he had been drawn there by someone who promised to help with his investigation .
However , there is strong reason for a murderer to have staged a fake suicide in Georgia ... unlike Florida , Georgia has no mandatory autopsy requirement .

Its my understanding that Clint Curtis did speak with several sena�ors / reps ... during the period after the so - called ' election ' when Conyers was holding hearings , etc .
I am shocked that nothing has exploded re Feeney .
I have such a strong feeling in my gut that he was involved in foul play with vote - rigging ... and ... more .
He made a very bad ( viscerally so ) impression on me during the stolen election fiasco of 2000 , when all eyes and much media was on Florida , including the legislature .
I took a very strong disliking to the man .
I wouldnt have given him a second thought , but once this story surfaced , after the election ... that memory snapped right back .
So , what did happen with the senators who spoke to Clint ?

But certainly he'd have had feelings of hopelessness - not " hey in 2 weeks we 'll have answers ... "
Putting a time of 8:10 am on the note - is precise .
Is that common ?
Cutting your wrists is ... long , drawn out , time to change one 's mind , imprecise .

To comment # 59 : Do n't look to Mueller , for God 's sake .
He is probably one of the most corrupt members of the Bush administration and probably knows where many of the Bush crime family 's bodies are buried , both literally and figuratively .
Is it any coincidence that Mueller took office just days before 9/11 ?
Mueller was head of the Justice Department 's Criminal Division during the reign of Bush I when DOJ failed to investigate and prosecute the extremely corrupt and murderous folks at BCCI , and did everything to stonewall and derail the investigation of the bank by New York DA Robert Morganthau who went beyond his normal jurisdiction to try to bring the bad guys to justice .

There was one major thing that really bothered me in seeing those photos .
By appearances , this man was meticulate .
He supposedly wrote the note - noting the time .
The bathroom sink was all arranged neatly - everything was placed just so .
And it indeed was a suicide and he planned on being in the tub , then why is there blood outside the tub near the toilet on that towel and the blood way up on the shower tub walls .
It seems that if he was being that careful with everything else , that he would have also been just as careful with the final act .
If everything was so planned , why would he be so sloppy in the actual act .
It just does n't make any sense .

It 's unfortunate that prejudice and society 's earnest attempts to overcome it sometimes create an even greater and more insidious bigotry : intolerance for any remark , whether innocently made or not , whether truthful or just speculative , that appears to be critical of the " protected " group - in this case Jews .
Zionist Jews .
P.C. bigotry leads to the wilful refusal to look at facts because facts might turn out not to be P.C.
It also leads to logical fallacies and confused thinking .
As when a hypothetical reporter speaking of a gang in L.A. as a " gang of black youth " is set upon for racial prejudice although , in fact , the gang in question IS comprised entirely of black youth .
I have no more racial or religious prejudice than a turnip .
I converted to Judaism when engaged to a Jewish man .
So when I say that Ariel Sharon is dangerous , I mean that he is dangerous , not that I do n't like Jews .
Just a ramble - I 'm tired and we have a major storm going on that keeps disconnecting me , so if my remarks appear disjointed , it 's probably because they are .

This is a very delicate subject and everyone is always very careful to avoid it because of fears of being accused of anti-Semitism .
I am not anti-Semite .
I have a whole bunch of Jewish friends .
But I 'm not at all sure about Zionist Jews .
I 'm not even comfortable typing that .
I agree with Winter Patriot in that I 'd like to see evidence on both sides .
I have been carefully following events of the past few years and Zionist Jews keep popping up in the equation .
I have been very careful to not jump to conclusions , mostly because of my sympathy towards Jewish people , but there appears to be more and more evidence that the Zionists seem to be involved in a lot of odd situations .
Is it anti-Semitic (? ) to question ?
I do n't think so .
Non-accountability based on race or religious belief is wrong .
We should be able to discuss how we feel without being accused of being racist or * anti* anything .

More questions .
Even if autopsies are not automatically performed in Georgia , one still could have been requested and performed , in Georgie or Florida .
Once Mrs. Lemme has had time to consider , would n't she want her husband 's murdered caught and brought to justice ?
I agree , that the " suicide note " indicates to me that Mr. Lemme was told to cooperate or that his " family " would be in jeopardy .
Maybe Mrs. Lemme or daughter has actually been threatened , and that 's why they are remaining silent .
Finally , there are many interesting questions raised above , including the " rasor " used , and Mr. Lemme 's journal .
That woman Shannon Floyd sounds like an incompetent so - and - so , and will only be interested in her reputation and covering her butt .
I hope someone will go and ask her a lot of questions which she wo n't answer , even if it 's just to annoy her .
It 's minor compared to her inability to properly report on the death of Mr. Lemme .

He checked in , then he left his home and started for work ( in another state ) , then he checked out , then he snuck back in , wrote a suicide note , filled the bathtub , climbed in and committed suicide , and then he stopped his watch .
Or at least this is what we are supposed to believe .
I am entirely convinced that Paul Wellstone and his family were murdered .
I 've been doing some research on this very recently , and planning to write a piece on it for my blog .
Unfortunately it is n't ready yet .

In both cases , no suicide notes .
They both also felt trapped in a situation they felt they could n't escape .
People do n't plan their suicides .
It happens in a flurry of hopelessness .
The suicide note should have been the first tip that this may have been murder .
Suicide notes usually only happens in the movies .
And they do n't drive for miles to do it .
Gives them time to think .
With a murder , there 's always a motive .
That 's true in a suicide too .
What specifically did Lemme feel depressed about ?
People leaving this world are n't concerned with how they 'll be perceived .
They just want to leave .
Why is a guy leaving this world worried about spilling blood on the bathroom floor ?

Demand an answer , demand a special prosecutor and do it quickly .
If someone traced it to the top , we can do the same .
We 're not just conspiracy theorists , and we need to stop being dismissed as such .
Align yourself with allies in government and get them working on this .

Thanks for that , Horkus .
I 'll get personal for a moment too .
A friend of our family committed suicide and he did leave a note .
Not really a note , but a long anguished letter , pages and pages and pages , in which he tried very hard to explain why he felt driven to do it .
We 're all different .
There 's no situation that would cause everybody to react the same way .
The presence of a note does not eliminate the possibility that it was genuine suicide .
But there many other details that make me think it was a murder .
The discrepancies between the physical evidence and the police report make me very suspicious .
And then there 's a question of motive .
Why would Ray Lemme want to die ?
Who else would want him dead ?

Regarding the motel receipt dates , Brad reports that Childress said " We were told the management of the hotel made a mistake . "
I 've read the entire police report .
This is mentioned NO WHERE in the report .
And " we were told " , by who ?
During Brad 's second conversation with Childress , Childress says " the media has blown this out of proportion . "
Uh , Hello ?
WHAT media ?
This has gone virtually unmentioned by " the media " .
Agree with Brad : WHO at the FDOT convinced them to re-close the case ?
Finally , as Robert Lockwood Mills says in Comment # 4 , somebody has some explaining to do about the timeline .
I 'll lay it out in another post .

SUICIDE NOTE GENUINE ?
Bear in mind , a person can be FORCED to write something down .
Like a suicide note .
It might be his real handwriting , because he might have really been forced to write it .
The omission of his beloved daughter by name seems suspcious to me .
Maybe it 's something that his murderers did n't know about , and he intentionally left it out as a red flag .
Hmm ?
Think about what the crime scene would 've looked like WITHOUT a suicide note .
Murder , right ?
Right .

# 95 Winter , thanks for the reply .
But a note and pages of letters are two different things .
I 'm not saying that a person who commits suicide wo n't write a note , it 's just unusual .
It does n't happen in most cases .
This could be one be one of those extraordinary rare cases where a person commiting suicide wrote a note , but unliklely in my mind as it pertains to the case .
Suicide is a truly selfish act .
The ones commiting the act do n't think about the people they 'll hurt .
That is often why you wo n't find a suicide note .
That alone should have made Lemme 's death suspect .

Brad , I just read through all the posts and found my earlier post ( # 40 ) sounded quite different than I had intended .
When I wrote it , I was caught up in the imaginings of what Mr. Lemme 's family must be feeling .
On the one hand , it must be like reliving the nightmare , but on the other , they must want answers as well .
Anyway , I 'd like to clarify my thoughts better .
This is amazing work on your part .
When I said it sounded like " tabloid journalism " or reads like " a B - grade movie " , I meant the whole shebang : Mild mannered Clint Curtis caught in a world of international espionage , political powerplays and murder .
I do n't doubt any of this , it 's just so very , very bizarre .
I believe Clint 's story .
I think in all likelyhood Mr. Lemme was murdered .
Particularly when one looks at the timeline of events .
Peterpont in post # 45 certainly makes some good observations as well .
Finally , I just want to say that I think you are doing a bang - up job .
Please be careful .
These are dangerous people you are probably upsetting .
That 's all .

Not at all .
Same to you .
" But a note and pages of letters are two different things . "
Absolutely true .
Another friend - of - a- friend committed suicide without even leaving a body .
All kinds of people do all kinds of things .
But in this case ... I would have a lot easier time believing that Ray Lemme 's death was a suicide if his note had said anything about why he was " depressed " or why he was " in pain " .
Or if his wife had confirmed that he was " depressed " or " in pain " .
As I recall , she said he was " under stress " .
That 's a lot different .
It also would have looked more genuine if he had mentioned his daughter by name .
Or if he did n't write the time of day at the top of it .
Or if his check - out receipt did n't indicate that he had already left the motel .
So ... to cut to the chase : I agree with you that this ' suicide note ' looks suspicious .
But I do n't buy into any blanket generalizations .
Sometimes the ones committing the act think very much about the people they will hurt .
Everybody 's different .
But the note is only part of the puzzle .
And I think we agree that this looks like a murder .
It also seems like the police were looking to cover it up .
No photos ?
Photos !
No evidence of foul play ?
Big bruises !
No blood on the towel ?
Lots of red drops on the towel !
And so on .
Not stonewalling ?
But not answering any questions either !

Timeline that needs to be explained : Sun 06/29/03
========
18:44 Reservation receipt for motel room generated .
Mon 06/30/03
========
05:15 Lemme leaves for work .
06:15 Lemme makes call from pay phone at Hwy 19 and Interstate 10 ..
06:54 Motel credit card receipt with Lemme 's signature .
18:45 Lemme checked into hotel .
Tue 07/01/03
========
08:10 Time on suicide note .
11:00 Time Lemme was supposed to check out .
13:06 Lemme found dead .
Lemme could not have signed reciept at 6:54 am on 6/30/03 .
Why ?
We know that at 6:15 am he made a phone call from Hwy 19 and Interstate 10 .
According to Mapquest , this is aprox 1 hour and 15 minutes away from the Motel .
Investigators need to absolutely nail down those receipt dates .
If they are correct , something is fishy .

conspiracy theorists , whats " past tense " for that ?
One other thing about the " suicided note " is the underlining of first , the word " family " and then at end the double underlining , of " I love you " .
This seems odd to me .
Also in another crime scene picture ( http://www.insider-magazine.com/unrestricted_warfare.htm) which show the diary in which the " suicided note " was written , ( you must assume these picture were taken before the crime scene was corrupted by the investigators and coroners staff etc . )
I notice that the pen used to write the " suicided note " is placed in a position that normally only a left - handed person would do ( I�m left - handed ) .
Not a smoking gun but interesting just the same , try it , write a note and put the pen down �� .. well ?

Those were details I did n't report in the story today , so it 's clear she 's working from some of the same police info that I was .

Brad ,
There are some facts about this case I am unclear about , besides , " When EXACTLY was the time of death established to be ? " ...
1 ) Did his wife ever get the cell phone bill showing what phone numbers he had calls with that day , June 30 ?
Surely the Police asked for that !?
Would his wife be kind enough to provide that for " background " ?
2 ) In the photo at the hotel , the bed looks made , untouched .
So he could n't have slept there that night , checked out , and then returned to a cleaned room .
Or was it a two bed room ?
3 ) Did he sneak back into the room after checking out ?
How could he have , THE LOCK ON THE DOOR is a card reader .
Did he request 2 key cards ?
Or did he check - in again ?
If so , where is the second check - in slip .
Surely the police have that ?
4 ) His shirt is hanging in the closet .
All his accesories , including his tie , are neatly set on the counter top .
Everything is in it 's right place , exept for his shoes .
Why would n't he put them near the closet ?
Seems an odd place for someone who is being so ritualistic .
5 ) The red " to go " coffee cup is next to the TV .
Which means he set it down before laying on the bed or sitting at the desk .
If he was done with the cup why did n't he throw it away ?
5 ) The bottled water is also next to the TV .
The bottle seems to be half full .
He brings 2 beverages into a hotel room and leaves them there ?
Why ?
Was he double fisting ?
Did he bring the drinks into the room at two separte times ?
If he was done with it , again , would n't he have thrown it away , afterall , he seems to be a very neat person ?
6 ) Does n't the fact that he was investigating a major scandal naturally turn the case into a murder investigation ?
What are the standard protocols ?
7 ) Surely the investigators asked to see the video surveillance tapes of his check in , and check out , and copy them ?
That would help establish his times / dates of entry / departure , since there was such an obviously flawed date on the receipts ?
8 ) So in June 30 ( Monday ) , 2003 , the price of a room for one occupant of Raymond Lemme go for $ 49.00 / night .
Why are the prices now $ 33.00 / night in 2005 ?
Am I missing something there ?

American Woman , I believe ( assume ) that the " reservation receipt " date came from the same computer date as did the bankcard check out receipt .
The Police theory goes that BOTH the June 29 date and June 30 date SHOULD REALLY READ June 30 and July 1 .
But unless the Police confirm that , officially , WITH EVIDENCE , then they are dismissing a MAJOR piece of evidence on those receipts .
What we need are 2 timelines .
One which is backed up by EVIDENCE ( which you showed ) , and one that is the POLICE theory .
Too tired to do that now ...

But what difference does it make whether the motel 's machine was a day behind or not ?
The fact is , the last entry for Raymond Lemme at the motel is for his CHECKING OUT .
If he had committed suicide in that motel room , regardless of the date or time , the last entry would have been for his CHECKING IN .
Unless my facts are wrong , for Lemme to have committed suicide there it means that he snuck back into a motel he had already checked out of for the purpose of killing himself .
To believe that one must be a real conspiracy theorist .

Has any evidence surfaced to indicate a reason for Ray Lemme to have gone to Valdosta on his own ?
If I were investigating the case , that would be my starting point .
Lemme was working on a matter involving the Florida Department of Transportation , and people in the state government in Tallahassee .
According to Clint Curtis ' affidavit , he told Curtis he was close to breaking the case open .
He told his wife he was working on a big case , which confirms the affidavit .
So why go to Valdosta ?
If there was someone there who could have helped him , that would be a reason .
But who ?
Nobody has come forward , and surely someone who sincerely wanted to help Lemme would have done so by now , recognizing that the " suicide " was a fraud .
The greater likelihood is 1 ) Somebody lured him to Valdosta with a promise to help with key information , then murdered him and set it up to look like a suicide , or 2 ) He was murdered in Florida and his body taken to Valdosta to escape the autopsy requirement .
But # 2 could be ruled out if it could be established that it was Ray Lemme who checked in at the motel and signed the credit card slip .
That 's why testimony from the check - in clerk is needed .
Lemme 's family says the handwriting is his , and it does match the " suicide note . "
So # 1 looks like the most logical guess .
In any event , the physical evidence seems to rule out a suicide .

One thing - although it seems odd that someone would write a time on a suicide note , that detail may or may not be significant .
Anyone who has ever worked government contracts knows you bill for time spent on a contract up to the 1/10th of an hour , and after a few years it becomes habit to time and date - stamp everything for your records - even personal notes .
It took years for me to get out of the habit of grabbing a pen and paper to take notes whenever the phone rang .
Although it seems odd in context , as someone else pointed out , he seems to have been a man who paid meticulous attention to detail .
With that in mind ..
Was he in the habit of time - stamping his personal notes ?
Could it have been a way of flagging attention in hopes of investigation ?
Or could it have been an intentionally misleading piece of evidence put there by someone who was already practiced at immitating his handwriting ?
***
Also , as far as checking out of the hotel ... when I travel with someone , it 's not uncommon for one of us to go check out and grab some coffee while the other finishes packing - that way there is someone in the room to open the door even though the keys have been returned , and we 're still gone before checkout time .
It 's possible the person he was supposed to meet was already in the room that morning , and gave him instructions to go check out and then come back to the room .
That would also explain the presence of two beverages .
All I 'm saying is that there are scenarios where he may indeed have checked out and then returned to the room , in which case the reciepts wo n't be that helpful .

Lemme must 've had hardcopy evidence of his case .
Someone must find this .
The fact that his portfolio of evidence is gone , means he did n't commit suicide .
If his evidence portfolio was there in the room , I would definitely believe it was suicide .
Where is it ?
And I 'm sure Lemme shared some , if not all , of his investigation with someone else ... I have a feeling someone 's going to come forward sooner or later who spoke with Lemme about his investigation .
We must find his notes from his investigation , and anyone who spoke with him at all about the investigation .

Fred , ( #110 , question
The room rates in Valdosta may very well be seasonal .
The quotes you are getting right now may not be the same as they are in the summer ( June 30 ) .
I know Georgia pretty well , born and bred there .
South Georgia is a pretty quiet place .
Travellers on their way to Florida for summer vacation pass right through Valdosta .
Room rates would certainly go up in the summer .
That could be the explanation .

Some thoughts on the note .
The suicide note was photographed " skewed " to resemble the downward slant that a deeply depressed and suicidal persons writing exhibits .
When the note is rotated in photoshop to adjust the lined paper to its proper position the writing does not indicate depression .

You might be right about the checkout process , Kestrel .
Under your scenario , does the following
become the only logical sequence of events ?
1 ) Lemme spends the night at the motel with a guy who promises to help him on the case in the morning ( of July 1 ) .
Or possibly he meets the guy for breakfast , and the guy follows him back to the motel to continue the conversation .
This could have been somebody from the Florida D.O.T. ( or hired by them ) who tells Lemme on the phone , " It 's too dangerous to talk about this in Tallahassee . "
So Lemme goes to Valdosta , where it's " safer " to talk .
2 ) After he checks out and returns to the room , his " friend " ( and maybe others ) double - cross him and force him to sign the suicide note under threat of killing his wife and daughter .
They strangle him ( discoloration of neck ) and slash his wrists with his own razor blade ( wearing gloves , of course , so only his own prints are found on the blade ) .
They then leave the motel quietly and disappear .
All we need now is Lt. Columbo .
I can imagine him speaking to Feeney about the case outside the Capitol , being satisfied that Feeney is telling the truth , then stopping on the Capitol steps , going back up and saying , " Uh , Congressman ... there 's just one more thing that bothers me here . "

I could see where Lemme 's omission of mention of his daughter might have been a way of protecting her .
The very first thing I noticed ( but ignored ) when looking at the scene was that while everything was sooo neat and tidy , the shirt was not .
If he was obsessively neat and tidy he would have buttoned the shirt at the collar when he hung it up .
( I had a boyfriend like that once . )
What kind of watch is it , how old , waterproof , damaged in any way ?
The watch stopping is so cliche .
I defintely need autopsy notes .
Toxicology , water in lungs , coffee in stomach , etc .
I 'm guessing that since metabolism stops , these artifacts would still be present .

Regarding Ms. Floyd : I would suggest that moving from the Valdosta P.D. to a college professorship is a career upgrade in her eyes .
She 's undoubtedly smart , but scared at this point , and I would n't blame her .
When the Valdosta P.D. reopened the case in December , then quickly closed it again ( after talking to " someone " at the Florida D.O.T.! ) , that was a clue that something is rotten in Denmark , folks .
Suddenly the chief does n't want to talk any more , and the former investigator - turned - professor does n't want to talk , and why wo n't those liberals in the blue states let this go away ?
I e-mailed Bill Keller at the New York Times a thumbnail summary of the known facts to date and asked him to assign an investigative reporter to the case .
Anybody want to set the odds against the chance of a positive reply ?

# 15 : I totally agree .
The underlined " family " jumped off the page at me .
Could this be his way of signaling that his actions were under duress - emphasize family , yet not mention his beloved only daughter at all ?
Also I agree that this final note has a very unnatural detached sound to it and is incredibly brief as if it were a race against time .
The double - spaced lines also seem odd , but , who knows , that may have been his style of writing .

... some other thoughts ...
On the receipt , the " y " in Raymond has a huge loop in it ; all the " y " 's in the suicide note are different , with small loops .
Where do you get one of those old fashioned razors from ?
I could n't get one , if you offered me money .
If he was alone , he would 've placed the blade he cut himself with , in that place in the picture .
With all that blood caused by the razor cut , probably all over his hands , why is there no blood pools or drips around where the razor lies ?
Someone who just " cracked open a big case " would n't commit suicide .
It does n't make sense !
Obviously , the huge bruise on the side of his neck is not typical of a suicide .
And , the belt & towel appear to be placed there later , because the towel has not absorbed the blood dripping down the side of the tub !
Maybe , the bruises on his neck are from an assailant choking him with the belt .
Then the assailant placed down the towel and put the belt on top of it , afterwards .
Was the belt checked for fingerprints ?
Were there footprints under the towel ?
Was the room checked for bloody footprints ?
I 'm not an expert , but these are things I would 've checked or noticed in seconds ...

" #89 - " Ray Lemme , psychic investigator . "
Ha , ha , ha , ha , ..... oh , my sides are hurting ... ha , ha , ha , ha .
You lunatics are placing your faith in a " psychic investigator " ?

Big word , look it up .
Has nothing to do with the face eating aliens who anally probed you last night .
Your original post : " : rolleyes : Just another pathetic liberal who could n't deal with the fact that President Bush won the election fair and square . "
Is very funny considering Lemme 's death occurred over a year before the election .
So if he killed himself for that reason , he had to be a psychic .
You moron , go play with a loaded gun and point it at your head and put yourself out of your misery .
Lot 's of liberals can shoot a helluvalot better than you can read or think .
Yes , Jefferson and many others have made remarks about the duty of every citizen to take up arms against tyrants , and they were referring to any tyrants , even ones produced by their own governments .
Jefferson said that the tree of liberty should be watered in blood every 20 years .
Something to that effect .
Let 's hope it does n't come to that .

Lemme was probably drowned in the water in the bath tub .
They held him under until he suffocated , sucked water to his lungs , and died .
He was very dead but still very warm when the murders then immediately cut his arm so the blood would drain into the water .
This makes it look like lotsa blood drained .
If the Valdosta Police had not been incompetent or corrupt they would have seen the need for an autopsy to show the real cause of death .

I think he was strangled , but I doubt it was with that belt .
Why would a murderer leave the murder weapon around , when he could have folded it into his pocket ?
I 'm no forensic pathologist , but I suspect if the belt had been the murder weapon , from the murderer 's perspective it could have been compared to the marks on Lemme 's neck in such a way as to establish the fact .
Maybe not , but why would a hired murderer take such a risk ?

Just a point regarding Floyd .
College professorship is gilding the lily a bit .
Valdosta Tech ?
It 's a technical college .
I bet she does n't even have more than an AA degree herself , if even that .
Administration of Justice is what it used to be called here in CA .
If they are calling it Criminal Justice now , which would n't surprise me , they are again gilding the lily .
When I majored in CJ awhile ago ( it 's only been specific discipline since the 1970s ) it was part of the behaviorial and social sciences dept .
and only taught at 4 year universities .
But things have changed for the worse on most campuses .
Football and business .
Waste of time and money .
Having said that , and without looking into it too much , you do learn the job by doing it , however , Valdosta , GA is probably not the kind of place you would get OTJ like LA , NY , or Chicago .
In other words , calling her a detective may be gilding the lily a bit too .

Great work Brad .
My thoughts :
If the Georgia police closed the investigation and believe it was suicide , then there 's nothing to hide , and no reason for them not to tell you who it was in FDOT that helped them decide to close the investigation .
The more I think about this , the more I believe finding out who that person was at FDOT is very very VERY key to this investigation .
There 's 2 possibilities : either Lemme committed suicide , or he did n't .
Questions I 'd ask the FDOT person :
When and how did you find out the investigation was reopened ?
Why are you so concerned about the investigation of Lemme 's death ?
If you believe Lemme committed suicide , and Lemme was your friend , or at least not your enemy , and it 's POSSIBLE that he was murdered , why would you want the investigation closed ?
If Lemme POSSIBLY was murdered , would n't you want Lemme 's family to get justice ?
Would n't you want Lemme 's family to get closure ?
Why do you , as an employee of Florida , have any jurisdiction / authority / power to close an investigation in GEORGIA ?
Why did the Georgia police listen to you ?
Lets see here : Lemme might have been murdered for something that he discovered at FDOT and elsewhere that went " all the way to the top " .
If Lemme was murdered , there are 2 kinds of people at FDOT : innocent people and corrupt people .
The person at FDOT who called the Georgia police is one of those 2 kinds of people - innocent or corrupt .
Which kind of person would be most likely - the most motivated - to try to close the suicide / murder investigation ?
Innocent or corrupt ?
I think an innocent person at FDOT would be very unlikely to intervene in the murder case of Mr. Lemme .
This FDOT person OBVIOUSELY has something to hide or cover up .

he could have committed suicide , like Frank Pentangeles , because he was convinced it was in his best interests .

Near strip clubs ?

I agree it's vital to know who at the Florida D.O.T. killed the reopened investigation , because there is no benign explanation for his having done so ( such as protecting national security ) .
There must be a way to compel the Chief of Police in Valdosta to reveal who it was , and why he took orders from somebody in Florida .
Freedom of Information Act? Class - action suit ?
Congressional hearing ?
Since this involves the possibility that a dead body was carried across state lines , it should mean Congress can involve itself .
Are you there , John Conyers ?
Anybody from the Georgia delegation ?

Fucking rediculous !
Georgia police say the equivalent of : " We re-opened the suicide / murder investigation because people brought to our attention many unanswered questions , new information , many suspicious things , and showed us many mistakes in the original investigation .
If Mr. Lemme was murdered , it had something to do with people FDOT .
However , the MURDER SUSPECTS at FDOT assured us that THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE , so we promptly closed the investigation .

comment 133 : Yes , we do need Lt. Columbo .
I have been thinking that all along .
How we he investigate this case ?
Obviously , he would follow Feeney around for weeks under the guise of " just trying to tie up some loose ends . "
I do remember one thing Columbo said in an episode , I believe it was the one that starred John Casavetes .
He said , " It 's just me .
I do n't know , I guess I 've been doing this for too long . " ( or something to that effect ) .
" But whenever I hear about a suicide , I think murder . "
It is probably true that a good number of " suicides " are actually murders .
We know police generally do n't have the training to properly investigate these cases .
But what else would Columbo be doing on this case right now ?
Certainly , he 'd want to see all the receipts .
So he'd hang out at the motel a bit , examine the machines and how they worked .
Then he'd probably take a drive to the place where Lemme made a phone call from .
He 'd time the placing of the call and the drive to the motel , and compare it to the check - in time on the receipt .
He would certainly look at the photos and condition of the body .
He 'd talk to the family and co-workers .
Ask to see his work files .
But what would be the final , most important piece of evidence ?
Hmmm ...
If we figure that out , maybe we can crack this case ...

Maybe I 'm mistaken , but that 's his grey slacks .
No water in that tub .
Very odd .
Not everyone is aware of the old Roman practice of getting in a warm bath and bleeding out .
And men usually choose a gun or hanging .
Women are more likely to slash their wrists or take pills .
And if you know enough to bleed out in a warm bath , you usually know enough to slit lines longitudinally , up and down the armin the direction of the veins , not across them .
No autopsy , no tox screen ?
This was bungled from the get go .
Maybe because of the motel , a hooker flop , if that 's true .
These fools just decided what it was before they looked .

And strangling would be quite apparent to even a rookie .
If you are dead and someone cuts you open a trained investigator should be able to spot that .
No heartbeat , no blood being pumped , you do n't bleed out that quick and at a certain point gravity takes over , unless the cuts are on the lowest part of the body , blood will just sit there in the body .
This was one of those cases that got written up as what it looked like so they could all go out and have a beer .
Exhumation and Autopsy may provide answers .

There is an interesting discussion of suicide methods and what to look for when investigating them ( link here ) .
Notice how the slashing method is mentioned way down and is a rare method .
It also mentions hesitation marks most often observed in slashing suicide , which were not found in this case .
Also it mentions how difficult it is to do it that way .
In another place it mentions how some subconscious movements take place and the body can move a long way ... even after death .

Another interesting discussion of suicide indicates that " you should treat all apparent suicides as homicides at first " ( italics in original ) ( link here ) .
What is interesting about this link is that it is part of an educational process at a university .
It would seem that the police officer ( Ms. Floyd ) who did the initial investigation would have known of these investigative norms , and probably teaches these norms at her new job .
Why was the Lemme crime scene not treated like a murder investigation first as is normal ?
Furthermore , the article goes on to say about suicide notes : " With suicides , you may or may not find a note left behind for loved ones , but if you do , you should treat it as a questioned document " ( bold and italics added ) .
The document was assumed to be unquestionably factual in the Lemme case !
Bad technique .
Does n't the fact that non-normal techniques were used in the Lemme case support our suspicion ?

Good day .
Recently it seems that the Craigslist “ missed connections ” section has been a flurry of activity with requests for a meeting with a red headed librarian who works at the Himmel location .
On two occasions , this lovely lady has been mentioned in this section .
I have some bad news for you : she is taken , and she is also monogamous .
To some , this may be disheartening .
However , due to the high demand for her , and in the interest of fairness , I will issue a challenge .
A duel .
Yes , a duel .
You pick the weapons .
I pick the time .
Some things to consider : Hurdles on the path to her heart - 1 ) I am a fairly large individual with the ability to wrestle and defeat 14 - 17 eight year - olds at the same time .
2 ) I grew up on a farm and watched my stepfather shoot guns at cans and rabbits on many occasions .
I am confident I have his natural talent .
If you choose guns for the challenge , upon learning to operate one , I will be a feared marksman .
I also watched my stepfather brand many cattle .
That also may come into play .
3 ) I have watched many movies .
I am very familiar with the combat tactics used by everyone from Sigourney Weaver to Ivan Drago .
My heaviest influence , however , would have to be Will Smith in “ Independence Day ” ( ID4 ) .
Another heavy influence would be Owen Wilson in “ Black Hawk Down ” .
Please do n’t pick knives because I have an aversion to them because of “ Saving Private Ryan ” .
You remember that part where the guy asks the German guy to stop and the knife slowly plunges into his chest ?
Yeah , no thanks .
I have also been watching a lot of the television series “ Dexter ” .
As you can see , my abilities run the gamut .
I also like Freaks and Geeks .
These are just a few things to ponder if you seek the red headed librarian .
Conversely , here are the benefits to winning her heart - 1 ) Delicious meals prepared for you anywhere from 0 - 5 times a week .
2 ) A thoughtful , confident individual who knows more than you .
3 ) A mind - blowing experience in the bedroom .
4 ) A constantly cheery disposition .
5 ) Really fun to play hacky sack with .
That ’s not all .
There ’s plenty more to list .
Those are just my favorite .
I ’m sure you ’ll find some too if you defeat me .
Anyways , just let me know .
Some say we should drink at least eight glasses of water a day
Others believe we only use 10 % of our brains or that shaving legs causes hair to grow back thicker .
But a review of evidence by US researchers surrounding seven commonly - hold beliefs suggests they are actually " medical myths " .
Some are utterly untrue , while others have no evidential proof , the British Medical Journal reports .
Researchers from the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis hunted medical literature for evidence on each claim .
They found no evidence supporting the need to drink eight glasses of water a day .
Medical myths
In fact , studies suggest that adequate fluid intake is often met by drinking juice , milk , and even caffeine - rich tea and coffee .
Data also suggests drinking excessive amounts of water can be dangerous .
The belief that we only use 10 % of our brains appears to be completely untrue .
Studies of patients with brain damage suggest that damage to almost any area of the brain has specific and lasting effects on mental , vegetative and behavioural capabilities .
Absence of evidence does not necessarily mean absence of effect
Dr David Tovey
Editor of Clinical Evidence journal
Brain imaging studies also show that no area of the brain is completely silent or inactive .
And the belief that hair and fingernails continue to grow after death may be an optical illusion caused by retraction of the skin after death .
The actual growth of hair and nails requires a complex interplay of hormonal regulation not present after death .
Again , illusion may be to blame for the belief that shaving hair causes it to grow back faster , darker , and coarser , report author Rachel Vreeman told the BMJ .
The stubble resulting from shaving grows out without the finer taper seen at the ends of unshaven hair , giving the impression of thickness and coarseness .
Again , expert opinion is that reading in dim light does not damage your eyes .
And there is little evidence to support the banning mobile phones from hospitals on the basis of electromagnetic interference .
Finally , eating turkey - and the tryptophan amino acid it contains - does not make people especially drowsy .
Indeed , turkey , chicken and minced beef contain similar amounts of tryptophan .

We use only 10 % of our brains Hair and fingernails continue to grow after death Reading in dim light ruins your eyesight Shaving causes hair to grow back faster or coarser Mobile phones are dangerous in hospitals Eating turkey makes people especially drowsy
The researchers explained : " Any large meal can induce sleepiness because blood flow and oxygenation to the brain decrease , and meals rich in protein or carbohydrate may cause drowsiness .
Wine may also play a role . "
Dr David Tovey , editor of Clinical Evidence journal , said : " The difficulty is it is often hard to disprove a theory .
" On the flip - side , absence of evidence does not necessarily mean absence of effect .
" Where reliable evidence becomes really important is in helping people make serious decisions about harms and risks .
" Many of these ' myths ' are innocuous .
However , we are still finding evidence that runs contrary to current practice and what we expect . "

The Architecture of the Burroughs B5000 -
20 Years Later and Still Ahead of the Times ?
Copyright ( C ) 1982 , 1999 by Alastair J.W. Mayer
This paper first appeared in the ACM's Computer Architecture News in 1982 , while I was on staff at the Concordia University Computer Centre in Montreal , Quebec .
( As the original text file is on a 2400 ' 9 - track tape that I can no longer easily read , this copy was scanned and OCR'd .
There may yet be some minor OCR errors in the text .
Sorry .
All time references here ( e.g. " twenty years ago " ) should be taken as relative to when this was first published , i.e. 1982 . )
Abstract : The Burroughs B5000 was introduced over twenty years ago .
The architectural features it introduced , and refined when it was upgraded to the B5500 and B6500 , are only now appearing in new computer designs .
This paper briefly describes some of these features , as they relate to high - level language and operating system support , and as interesting features in their own right .
References are given for more detailed information .
Introduction
The basic premise of this paper is that the architecture of the Burroughs B5000 , as introduced twenty - one years ago and as refined some eighteen years ago , still stands as an example of a modern high - level language computer .
I will briefly describe some of the features , both in the overall design and in the instruction set , that make it so .
Readers in search of further architectural details are referred to [ Org731 for a general description and details of the high level language support , to [ Bur 72 ] for specific details of the instruction set and organization of the hardware , and to ( All8l ] for notes on the latest refinements of this system .
Where known , the existence of similar features in other machines is noted ( l ) .
There are some differences in design details between the original B5000 and later machines , as described below .
Documents available to me are unclear as to whether the B5500 , the next model introduced , is more like the B5000 or the later B6500 and subsequent models .
This paper will refer to the ' B5000 design ' for concepts appearing in this and subsequent machines , and ' B6000 ' for details known to be in the B6500 and later machines but not in the B5000 .
Other numbers used refer to specific models .
History
The Burroughs B5000 was introduced about twenty years ago , at the beginning of the nineteen - sixties ( 2 ) .
This system can be considered the first of the " third generation " of computer systems .
It had all of the features which , according to Denning [ Den7l ] , characterize a computer of the third generation .
The B5000 was designed with the support of high level languages ( ALGOL and COBOL ) in mind .
The most remarked - upon aspects are its use of a hardware - managed stack for calculation , and the extensive use of descriptors for data access .
It included virtual memory -- perhaps the first commercial computer to do so -- as well as support for multiprogramming and multiprocessing .
For additional security , code and data were distinguished in memory by the use of a " flag bit " , and the hardware would not execute data or alter code without first having explicitly changed the flag ( something reserved for privileged processes ) .
The essence of the B5000 design has changed little in the last twenty years , consisting of the hardware stack , the use of descriptors , and special bits to differentiate code and data .
It has been refined since then .
The most significant changes took place soon after the B5000 was introduced .
The next machine , known as the B5500 , appeared in 1964 , and an improved version appearing in 1966 became known as the B6500 .
The use of descriptors was extended , the flag bit was extended to a three - bit " tag field " and made external to the 48 - bit data word , and the instruction set altered to take advantage of these changes .
The instruction set introduced with this change has remained the same through successive models of the series .
This set is now known as " E- mode " [ All8l ] .
The next model series involved no real design changes , but the technology was improved .
These were known as the B5700 and B6700 .
A larger and faster model was also introduced about this time , the B7700 .
The principal differences in these series are in the number and arrangement of processors possible in a given configuration .
For example , a B6700 can have up to three central processors and up to three I/O processors , while a B7700 can have any combination of up to eight central and I/ O processors ( as long as there is at least one of each ) .
At some point in B6700 / B7700 production an option known as vector mode hardware became available .
This enhanced the ability of the processor to do repetitive arithmetic operations on arrays or vectors , improving the performance of typical FORTRAN and APL programs .
The next upgrade was announced in 1976 , with the introduction of the B6800 [ Sur76 ] .
Again , this was primarily a technology upgrade , but one new feature was Global ( 3 ) memory .
Despite the name , this feature allows each processor in a multiple processor configuration to have its own local memory as well as shared memory .
The real difference is in the degree of coupling of the processors .
In a tightly coupled mode , all memory is shared and only one copy of the MCP ( the operating system or Master Control Program ) exists .
This was the only multiple processor mode available up to this time .
Global memory permitted too ( or more ) logically discrete computer systems ( each with its own resources and own MCP ) to communicate directly through the shared Global memory [ Bur8O ] .
Other features of the B6800 and B7800 included the change to semiconductor memory ( the B6700 used thin - film ) , faster cycle time , lookahead , and the ability to configure more processors into a single system .
The 900 - level systems were introduced in late 1979 / early 1980 .
As opposed to earlier implementations using discrete logic , the B5900 ( and presumably the B6900 ) heavily exploit high density parts and bit - slice processor chips [ All8l ] .
Other features include a redesign of the I/O Data Communications Subsystem , making extensive use of specialized microprocessors .
An interesting sidelight in the development of this series is the development of the Attached Fortran Processor ( AFP ) and the Burroughs Scientific Processor ( BSP ) .
Since the original B5000 design was to support dynamic block structured languages such as ALGOL , it was not quite as efficient as conventional machines at executing FORTRAN programs .
The addition of vector hardware to the B6700 and B7700 helped alleviate this somewhat , but not entirely .
For really powerful number - crunching , the Burroughs Scientific Processor was developed , and announced in the spring of 1977 [ jen78 ] .
The BSP is a 16 processor , single instruction - multiple data stream design , and has several unique design features ( see [ jen78 ] for more on this ) .
Perhaps the BSP should not be considered in the same context as the B5000 / B6000 / B7000 machines , except that the BSP incorporates a B7700 or B7800 as a " system manager " and front - end .
Also during 1977 was the development of the Attached Fortran Processor , designed for users with scientific processing needs that did not require a BSP .
The AFP can connect to any of the B6000 or B7000 machines [ Bur78 , pg.15 ] .
High Level Language Support
The Burroughs B5000 was designed from the start to support high level languages ( HLLs ) , specifically ALGOL and COBOL .
The initial features supporting this were the hardware - managed stack , the descriptor , and segmentation .
A redesign of this system , the B6000 , extended the concept by moving the tag bits to their own field , external to the 48 - bit data word .
The instruction set was also revised and extended , and has remained essentially unchanged ever since .
HLLs are supported by hardware that allows virtual memory , multiprocessing , fast context switching and procedure invocation , memory protection , and code sharing .
Operating System Support
The B5000 was conceived as a system .
The hardware and operating software were designed in concert .
Since the operating system ( the core of which is the Master Control Program , or MCP ) is written in a HLL , ESPOL ( an ALGOL variant ) , those features designed for HLL support obviously assist in the execution of the MCP .
Other features specifically implemented for MCP use include special instructions , such as the LLLU ( linked - list lookup ) instruction to assist memory management , processor control instructions for multiprocessing , and unique interrupt handling mechanisms ( on interrupt , the hardware automatically saves the current execution context and does a procedure call ( supplying any necessary parameters ) to the appropriate routine ) .
Stack Architecture
All calculations performed on B5000 series machines ( 4 ) take place using the operand (s ) at the top of the stack .
To improve performance , the top two stack locations exist as the A and B registers ( each of which may be extended sideways by the X and Y registers for double - precision operands ) .
Pushing and popping the stack is done automatically by the hardware , depending upon the specific operations being done .
This makes for rapid expression evaluation , and greatly simplifies a compilers task of code generation , a fact recognized in other designs .
( English Electric KDF - 9 , Hewlett - Packard HP3000 , the Pascal P- machine ensiliconed as the Western Digital Pascal microEngine ) .
Since the operands are always implied ( the stack top ) , instructions do not need an operand field , reducing code size .
Tagged Words
In the original B5000 , the tag was a bit within the data word , called the flag .
It was moved outside and expanded to three bits with the B6000 , where it remains .
The tag serves to identify the meaning or type of the word .
As a memory protection feature , it differentiates data ( operands ) from code and control words .
Thus , it is physically impossible to execute data , or to use code as operands ( thus it is impossible for programs to be self modifying ( 5 ) ) .
The tags also differentiate between different types of data ( for example , single and double precision ) and different types of control words ( array descriptors , segment descriptors , stack control words , etc ) .
The use of tags , in combination with the stack , allows the instruction set to be very compact .
Multiple instructions with similar meanings are not needed : the single ADD instruction can determine from the tag what operation to perform .
An old argument against the use of tags was that the amount of additional memory hardware required ( about 6 % for the B6000 ) is not warranted by their usefulness .
This argument was dubious even in the days when memory was expensive : the four parity bits of a four - byte IBM 360 word amount to an extra 12.5 % , so one might as well argue against byte addressability .
Furthermore , this extra 6 % is not needed on secondary storage .
Here only the 48 data bits are used , the tag information existing in the disk segment descriptor [ Cam75 ] .
Descriptors
The descriptor was one of the most novel features of the B5000 when it was introduced twenty years ago .
Indeed , Burroughs published a description of the B5000 system and titled it " The Descriptor " , ( subtitled " a definition of the B5000 Information Processing System " ) .
The descriptor , used simply as an array access mechanism , allows bounds checking ( done automatically by the hardware ) as well as simplifying dynamic array allocation ( essential in an ALGOL machine ) .
It also allows for differentiating between word arrays and character strings , and can indicate the size ( in bits ) of the characters .
However , it is more powerful than this .
A single bit in the descriptor can be used to specify whether the array ( or other segment ) is actually in core or not ( the ' presence bit " ) .
Bingo !
Virtual memory .
Indeed , the B5000 was perhaps the first commercial computer to provide virtual memory .
( How many computers today still do n't ?
How many can't because of their architecture ? )
A variation of the descriptor , the " capability " , appeared in the design of the Plessey 250 [ Lis75 , pp.120-123 ] and more recent machines .
Perhaps the most modern of these is the Intel iAPX - 432 , which again uses the term " descriptor " [ Pol821 .
It is interesting to note that this machine too was designed ( or perhaps re-designed , see [ Pos8l ] ) with high level languages in mind , in this case languages like Ada , if not Ada specifically [ Rat8l ] , [ Pol82 ] .
The Instruction Set
The instruction set changed with the refinement of the B5000 design , but subtly .
To be sure , the instructions shrank from 12 bits to 8 bits , but the concept of the operation set was similar .
As mentioned above , this instruction set , consistent across the B5000 / B6000 / B7000 series , is now known as E- mode .
As the op - codes can be packed six to a word ( reducing fetch overhead ) , they are referred to in Burroughs terminology as syllables .
Some aspects of the instruction set have been discussed above ; some brief comments , by category , are given here .
Arithmetic Instructions .
The B6000 has few of these , since ' redundant ' instructions are not needed ( due to the tag bits and data word conventions ( 6 ) ) hence only one ADD instruction exists .
The B5000 had two ADD instructions , one each for single and double precision , since the flag bit could not distinguish the operands this way .
( Compare this with ten on the VAX - 11 , not counting the decimal - add and add - compare - and - branch instruction groups !
[ DEC79 , pp.140-1411 )
String Instructions .
The B5000 / B6000 , while being word address machines , provide for easy access to bits and bit fields within words .
Further , the descriptors used for array access include a field which indicates whether the array should be treated as an array of words or as a string of four - , six - , or eight - bit characters .
Operations on strings include the fairly conventional block move and scan instructions , as well as translate instructions and editing instructions .
the latter are generally used for formatting in conjunction with I/O .
Multitasking Support .
This series supports multitasking in its high level languages ( yes , the compilers are extended to allow concurrent ALGOL and COBOL ! )
One particularly useful instruction is the RDLK ( read - lock ) .
It is an indivisible operation which reads from and writes into a memory location ( a similar instruction was available on the Plessey 250 [ Lis75 , pg.37 ] ) .
This can be used for task synchronizing flags .
( Burroughs software provide appropriate high level language interfaces to these features , using the data type ' event ' and software interrupts ) .
Another instruction , useful on multiprocessor configurations , is the HEYU , which interrupts the other processors ) .
An instruction such as this would be extremely useful when designing multiple microprocessor systems .
Data Structure Support .
The only real hardware data structure on the B5000 / B6000 is the vector , described and pointed to by a descriptor .
But one can do many useful things with vectors : the code segments and operand stacks of the machine are vectors , and multidimensional arrays are implemented using vectors of descriptors ( dope vectors ) .
Since the hardware also provides easy access to different bit fields within the words ( via a unit known as the " mask - and - steering logic " ) , lists can be easily implemented and managed .
A standard format for the link words of a list ( breaking the word down into an address and a value field ) is used by the LLLU ( linked list lookup ) operator .
This operator follows the links until the value field matches or exceeds the operand of the LLLU , ( or until the end of the list is reached or a timeout interrupt occurs ) .
Those familiar with dynamic memory allocation techniques will recognize this as a hardware implementation of the ' first fit ' algorithm for segmented memory .
Since the MCP maintains the lists of free and allocated memory in precisely this form ( link words at the front of each segment , beginning at the bottom of memory ) , it is obvious that memory allocation is quite fast on this series of computers .
User Definable Instructions .
The definition of the B6000 instruction set leaves considerable room for future expansion , in that many possible op codes are undefined .
One unusual feature , however , is that sixteen opcodes are defined as " programmed operators " .
If these are encountered by the processor , a " Programmed Operator Interrupt " is generated , and the last four bits of the instruction ( these are sixteen - bit instructions ) is passed to the interrupt handler , which may be defined either within the MCP or the user program .
Thus , the operation set can be extended by a sort of threaded - code technique ( 7 ) .
This feature -- the programmed operator -- was used to implement the " do vectormode " instruction to support vector hardware .
The compilers could safely generate code to take advantage of it , and if the resulting code was then run on a machine lacking vector hardware , the equivalent function could be provided in software , without any need to recompile the original program .
Design Problems
If there were any faults with the original B5000 design , they were quickly corrected with the B6000 .
As Organick says [ Org73 , pg.92 ] , " there appear to be no blunders " in the system 's design .
Indeed , it is quite elegant .
The only real problem in the history of this system is that the design really was ahead of the time .
Since the hardware was required to perform many functions traditionally left to software , it was necessarily complex .
As the early models in this series were implemented using discrete logic and SSI and MSI chips , the parts count was bound to be high .
This could lead to reliability problems .
To the credit of the Burroughs designers , considerable redundancy and flexibility was built in ( hardware modules could be off - lined and on - lined ' on the fly ' ) .
The fault - tolerance of the design , and such innovations as the Maintenance Diagnostic Logic processor , meant that the service record was probably no worse than other , less complex systems of the same period .
Later models in the series -- the last of the 700s , and the 800 and 900s -- took advantage of the rapid improvements in semiconductor technology , and have proved the soundness of the original concept .
Conclusions
Twenty years later -- or some sixteen years after the B6500 -- time and technology may be finally catching up with the B5000 system .
I have attempted to show that the B5000 included many features still considered new , and which only now are appearing in other systems ,
The operator set level of the B5500 design has , of commercial necessity , remained essentially unchanged .
Yet the architecture of this system could be refined further .
Some of Organick 's suggestions [ Org73 , pp. 90-921 have been realized with the introduction of vector hardware .
others , such as extending the tag field still further , modifying the interrupt hardware , and implementing instruction set support for queue data structures would be useful , but incompatible with the existing systems .
( The VAX - 11 is one recent computer that provides support for queue data structures . )
Where will computer architecture go in the next twenty years ?
Anywhere ?
Machines worth keeping an eye on are the iAPX - 432 and the IBM System / 38 [ IBM78 ] .
Both of these contain unique features and either could be the B5000 of the eighties and nineties .
But the concepts of this design are not exhausted yet .
They were combined simply and elegantly , while the System / 38 and iAPX - 432 may be overly complex ( but no doubt the same was said of the B5000 in the 1960s ) .
Still ahead of the times ?
Perhaps not quite , but very nearly .
Whether this is taken as praise for the B5000's designers or criticism of a generation of computer architects is left to the reader .
Footnotes I would appreciate hearing of any other designs incorporating any of these features , especially any prior to 1961 .
I am also interested in hearing from anyone involved with the design of a computer in which features of the B5000 were consciously considered , either to be included or excluded .
The exact dates are not clear .
Documents describing the B5000 were available as early as February 1961 [ Bur6l ] , but Hayes ( Hay78 ] says that first delivery was in 1963 .
Unless otherwise specified , the dates given here are the earliest to which I can find published reference , which are probably the announcement dates .
' Global ' is a Burroughs trademark for this shared memory feature .
Except address calculations , which are performed by a separate address adder within the Memory Control Unit .
Of course , a suitably privileged process may explicitly alter the tag bits and so modify itself , but only the ESPOL compiler will emit such code , and the MCP will refuse to execute as a normal program anything identified as ESPOLCODE .
Such programs must be installed as part of the operating system .
For example , the only difference between a ' real ' and an ' integer ' is that an integer has an empty exponent part .
However , the 48 - bit word still leaves 39 - bit integer precision .
Integer subfields of words are extracted using the mask - and - steering logic to form an integer operand in the A register , and replaced in a similar manner .
This will require the cooperation of the site manager , as the compilers do not normally emit such code , nor can users modify code .
This is a security feature of the MCP ; only designated compilers can create executable code files , and only the MCP can designate a program as a compiler ( via a console command ) .

The FTC smacked down Q - Ray 's " ionized " bracelet to the tune of $ 87 m after the makers made deceptive advertising claims .
The $ 200 placebo trinkets are still on sale , however — the ad copy just makes vague intimations of " wellness " and the like instead of specific medical claims .
Whether " ionization " even does anything , however , is a moot point .
Tested by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation at an electron microscopy lab , it found that the thing was n't ionized at all .
Even for true believers , it 's a waste of wonga .

Danie Krugel 's DNA search device
Marshall McLuhan may have seen technology as an extension of the human body , but we 're not going to fall for this one : former South
African cop Danie Krugel 's " quantum " box , which he claims can locate anyone on Earth , when primed with a sample of their DNA .
Science - challenged bumpkins at Britain 's Observer and Telegraph newspapers fell for it hook , line and sinker .
After Krugel approached the parents of missing toddler Madeleine
McCann , then told them she 'd been buried on a beach , the Observer described this hogwash as " forensic DNA tests " by a " detective renowned for locating abducted children . "
Ben Goldacre of Bad Science called the reportage " contemptible . "
Krugel 's led more than one bereaved family up the garden path , it transpires : The Daily Mirror delivered a much - needed debunking .
The magical mystery box weds " complex and secret science techniques " with GPS to show exactly where the missing person is .
Krugel , however , wo n't let anyone examine it .
If anyone gets a chance , swap it out for one of Mother Mohiam 's when he's not looking , would you ?
That 'll teach him .

Described by Wired 's Katie Dean as " a watch powered by snake oil , " Teslar watches contains a chip ( uh oh ) that purports to emit a frequency that
" neutralizes the electromagnetic fields " output by cellular telephones , computers and radios .
Most scientists do n't think such fields are harmful anyway , but even if they were , a feeble wristwatch would n't protect you from the radio waves rattling around every human head on planet Earth .
" There is not a chance in the word that [ it ] will do anything but lighten your wallet , " says John Molder , a professor of radiation oncology at the Medical College of Wisconsin .
Here 's the blurb , straight from the company 's website : " When a Teslar watch is worn on the left wrist , the frequency goes into the triple warmer meridian on the left wrist , and then travels throughout the body , canceling out harmful static caused by electromagnetic fields
( ELF ) along the way . "

Harmonic Products 's EMP Power Modulator__
With so many crackpot devices out there with alleged wellness benefits , it 's hard to pick one out .
Ah , the agony of choice .
Harmonic Products 's EMP Power Modulator , however , is like the
Telsar Watch 's big daddy .
Plug it in , and it supposedly emits
" non-Hertzian frequencies " to remove " harmful " radio waves from the building and allow biological de-stressing .
It also purportedly makes electrical devices safer and more efficient .
Reports of success tend to be anecdotal rather than evidential , but do n't let that stop you buying this AU$ 300 toy .

Dowsing Rods
I can't let you go without mentioning the all - time classic scam - friendly gadget .
Be it two precision - engineered brass rods , dangling crystals or old hazelwood , divining is to the technology of magical thinking as the humble flintknap is to invention itself .
Usually associated with the search for water , dowsers search for pretty much everything : buried gold , gemstones , hydrocarbons and murder victims are just the beginning of a practice stretching back millenia .
Generous skeptics and even some dowsers maintain that the rods serve to amplify near - imperceptible twitches caused by the suppressed wisdom of the unconscious mind .
Unfortunately , such inspired ideomotoring vanishes under test conditions , like just so much Randi - fodder .
The Taliban seek victory using a strategy that combines virtue and vice , along with trying to deliver and avoid bombs .
Sounds complicated , and it is .
The Taliban base their authority on support for " traditional tribal values . "
That means strict ( some would say insane ) interpretation of Islamic law ( which , taken to that extreme , controls everything ) .
This degree of fanaticism justifies any tactic , no matter how depraved .
After all , God is calling the shots .
There are two main obstacles to establishing ( or re-establishing ) Taliban control of the country .
There 's the current government , which is basically a coalition of Pushtun and non-Pushtun tribes that disagrees with the few Pushtun tribes that supply most of the Taliban leadership and manpower .
This lot can be taken care of by forming an alliance with many of the drug gangs , who will supply money to hire irregular fighters .
These guys will be used to terrorize other tribes into going along with the Taliban .
This worked fifteen years ago , and should work again .
Except for one thing .
The foreign troops and their smart bombs .
NATO and U.S. air power have been a disaster for the Taliban .
It was a few dozen aircraft , dropping a few hundred smart bombs , that smashed the Taliban fighting force in late 2001 .
Since then , the Taliban have come up with some ways to limit the smart bomb damage , but have not been able to avoid the constant destruction these weapons deliver .
If the Russians had had smart bombs in the 1980s , the Russians would be running the place today ( and the Afghan population would be a lot smaller , that 's how the medieval Mongols , and other ruthless conquerors , have traditionally " subdued " the Afghans ) .
But the Taliban have a plan for getting rid of the smart bombs , and it depends a lot on foreign journalists .
These folks are always looking for an " exciting " story , and nothing is more exciting than " atrocities " committed by NATO or American troops .
Defeats by NATO or American troops also plays well with the foreign reporters .
So the Taliban endeavor to feed the foreign journalists as many suitable stories as possible .
The Taliban understand that the story does n't have to be true , just plausible .
The news cycle is short , and the media proceeds on the assumption that news consumers have no sense of history .
If the Taliban can get a story out there , they have succeeded , no matter how much the story is later discredited .
Recently , for example , Taliban propagandists got some journalists to run with the story that the Taliban actually controlled most of the country , and were ready to take over .
This was absurd , but too good to pass up for headline starved reporters .
Atrocity stories move well , as do rumors of NATO troops misbehaving with the locals .
The Taliban may be medieval in their social thinking and economics , but they are out in front when it comes to spinning the media .
The " we are doomed " ( or disgraced ) stories the Western media gobble up , are meant to convince Western government to pull their troops out .
To move that process along , the Taliban and their al Qaeda allies are making a major push to kill NATO troops .
Normally , this is very hard to do .
But suicide bombers have proven more effective , and are now used in larger and larger numbers .
This is dangerous for the Taliban , because these suicide bombers tend to kill more Afghan civilians than NATO troops .
Thus the importance of having lots of Taliban gunmen out there to keep the Afghan population from getting out of line in their outrage ( and reporting the presence of Islamic terrorists ) .
The Taliban believe that most Western nations can be convinced to withdraw their troops if enough negative media and dead troops can be generated .
That will mean fewer smart bombs to deal with .
The smart bombs and UAVs have proved to be a decisive weapon against the Taliban .
The UAVs and aircraft have heat sensors that can spot groups of Taliban trying to sneak into an area to terrorize the locals .
The sensors on the aircraft are often good enough to identify that the guys on the ground are Taliban , and deserving of a smart bomb .
Once the JDAM ( GPS guided bomb ) hits , the Taliban are out another group of enforcers .
There 's enough drug money to hire another bunch , but in the meantime , another few villages full of Afghans go un-terrorized by the Taliban .
Remember , the tribes do n't like taking orders from anyone , and in 2001 , the Taliban were toppled within two months partly because of the smart bombs , but mostly because the other tribes were tired of these sanctimonious bullies .
Alas , sanctimonious bullies have been part of the Afghan social fabric for centuries .
The latest contingent are media savvy and subsidized by Western drug addicts .
If the Taliban were n't so intent on carrying out terror attacks in the West , the West would try to ignore them .
But when someone is dedicated to blowing you up where you live , you pay attention , or else .
Some of the craziest conspiracy theories ever : from the “ faked ” moon landings to Israel selling aphrodisiac bubble - gum to palestinian schoolgirls .
1 Israel makes palestinian schoolgirls sexually promiscuous by selling them aphrodisiac bubble - gum
“ Palestinian authorities uncovered Israeli efforts to spread a special kind of gum that contains sexual hormone between Palestinians .
The authorities requested laboratory tests on the gum which were conducted in Cairo .
Those tests showed that the gum contains progesterone which is responsible for sexual arousal and also prevents pregnancies .
Palestinian authorities confiscated 200 tonnes of gum in the city of al - Khalil alone .
The Washington Post claimed in report that if it asked a chemistry professor in the Hebrew university to examine the gum .
His tests were negative , however the paper also reported that the majority of Palestinians believe the conspiracy .
It quoted one Palestinian saying that it was possible to send a space ship to Mars then it is possible to manufacture a ‘ sexual gum ’ it is after all a war . ”

2 Alien Reptiles are dominating the World
According to BBC Reporter David Icke , reptilian humanoids are the force behind a worldwide conspiracy directed at manipulation and control of humanity .
He contends that most of the world ’s leaders , from William Jefferson Clinton , Hillary Rodham Clinton , Barack Obama and George W. Bush to members of the British royal family , are in fact related to the 7 - foot ( 2.1 m ) tall , blood - drinking reptilians from the star system Alpha Draconis .
Conspiracies wo n’t stop there .
According to an interview with Icke , Christine Fitzgerald , a confidante of the late Diana , Princess of Wales , claims that Diana told her that the Royal Family were reptilian aliens , and that they could shapeshift .
David Icke and others have claimed that U.S. President George W. Bush and his family are part of this same bloodline .
Icke claims , based on his exploration of genealogical connections to European royalty , that many presidents of the United States have been and are reptilian humanoids .
In his view , United States foreign policy after September 11 is the product of a reptilian conspiracy to enslave humanity , with George W. Bush as a servant of the reptilians .
He also theorizes that the reptilians came to Earth from the constellation Draco .
3 Wingdings font has a secret message of approval to kill Jews
Wingdings is a font included in all versions of Microsoft Windows , with a history of controversy .
In 1992 , only days after the release of Windows 3.1 , it was discovered that the character sequence “ NYC ” in Wingdings was rendered as a skull and crossbones symbol , Star of David , and thumbs up gesture .
This could be interpreted as a message of approval of killing Jews , especially those from New York City .
Microsoft strongly denied this was intentional , and insisted that the final arrangement of the glyphs in the font was largely random .
( The character sequence “ NYC ” in the later - released Webdings font , in turn , is rendered as eye , heart , and city skyline , which could be interpreted as “ I Love New York City ” .
Microsoft has stated that this is intentional . )
An urban legend , one of the most widespread conspiracy theories ever , that spread after the September 11 , 2001 attacks was that if the sequence “ Q33NY ” is typed in Wingdings , the Q becomes an aircraft , the threes become lined documents ( which resemble skyscrapers ) , the N becomes a skull and crossbones , and the Y becomes the Star of David .
The resulting graphics look like an aircraft preparing to impact the World Trade Center , with a message of death for those of Jewish faith .
The “ NY ” stands for New York , and “ Q33 ” allegedly was the designation of one of the aircraft .
However , the theory that this has any valid non-accidental connection with the attacks falls apart under scrutiny : the terrorist attacks were not specifically directed at Jews , and none of the aircraft used on that day bore the designation of Q33 .
Another suggestion was that “ Q33 ” was a reference to a bus route , typically alleged to be at the World Trade Center itself , or to one of the airports involved .
In reality , bus route Q33 serves LaGuardia Airport , and none of the hijacked aircraft took off from or were heading there .
Various other combinations of Wingdings characters are alleged to have special significance by conspiracy theorists
4 Stephen King killed John Lennon
Steve Lightfoot ’s book “ Lennon Murder Expose ” suggest his theory with “ strong ” evidence from government codes in the bold print headlines of Time .
His website ‘s introduction reads : “ Contrary to all reports about a lone drifter named Mark David Chapman who allegedly shot John Lennon in the back December 8 , 1980 you ’ll find ample evidence in the back issues of Time , Newsweek , and US News and World Report magazines to suggest otherwise .
Namely , that John Lennon was , not only politically assassinated , but that Richard Nixon , Ronald Reagan and , you ’d better sit down , horror novelist Stephen King are the three people who can be proven guilty of the crime .
King being the real murderer and Chapman but a look - alike , paid actor misleading you with an absolute hoax , the media in tow . ”
“ The evidence , specifically , is government codes in the bold print headlines of Time , Newsweek , and U.S. News and World Report magazines that were printed shortly before , during , and after the night of December 8 , 1980 .
Hints in the headlines that you wo n’t find anywhere else that plug into John Lennon ’s assassination with up to 70 % frequency at times .
These government codes , which read like gallows humor ; « Thinking About John Lennon … Johnny Comes Marching Home … Kiss , Kiss , Bang , Bang , Ouch , Ouch … The Job Richard Nixon Really Wanted … Blasting the Opposition … America Needs A Poet Laureate … Maybe … Heeding Those Subtle Signs … Magazine Maze … All the Presidents Magazines… » .
These codes include the killer ’s face and true identity printed three and two months before the crime replete with headlines describing the then yet to come crime scene : « One Great Big Zippo Lighter … Perils of Pyrokinesis » .
Pyrokinesis means fire and movement , and a man at night with a gun ablaze , crouched in a raincoat looks like a great big cigarette lighter .
Subtle but dramatic codes . ”
5 The Early Middle Ages ( 614–911 AD ) never occurred .
Year 2007 is actually 1710
The Phantom time hypothesis is a theory developed by Heribert Illig ( born 1947 ) in 1991 , which suggests that the Early Middle Ages ( more precisely , the period 614–911 AD ) never occurred , meaning that all artifacts attributed to this period are from other times and that all historical figures from this period are outright fabrications .
The vast majority of historians believe this theory to be wrong .
The basis of Illig ’s claims is the paucity of archaeological evidence that can be reliably dated to this period ; perceived inadequacies of radiometric and dendrochronological methods of dating this period , and the over - reliance of medieval historians on written sources .
For Western Europe , Illig claims the presence of Romanesque architecture in the tenth century as evidence that less than half a millennium could have passed since the fall of the Roman Empire , and concludes that the entire Carolingian period , including the person of Charles the Great , is a forgery of medieval chroniclers , more precisely a conspiracy instigated by Otto III and Gerbert d’Aurillac .
The theory also stems from the belief that during the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in Europe ( 1582 AD ) , while compensating for a ten day discrepancy in the old Julian calendar , many dates were falsely ( or ineptly ) recalculated as the new system created a thirteen day discrepancy .
The original mathematical blemish was attributed to the Julian year being 1.3 minutes too long ( which is commonly agreed as factual ) .
6 Paul McCartney is dead .
The current is just a lookalike
The supposed death of Paul McCartney , a member of the Beatles , was the subject of a rumour that began circulating in October 1969 .
Proponents of the theory , which is commonly referred to as the Paul is dead hoax , claim that McCartney died in a car crash in late 1966 and was replaced by a lookalike before the recording of Sgt. Pepper ’s Lonely Hearts Club Band .
The supposed “ clues ” are given throughout the post - 1966 Beatles material in the form of peculiar album covers , possible symbolism in strange lyrics , and backmasking .
The rumour started when radio DJ Russ Gibb received a call from a listener who claimed that McCartney had died and the Beatles ( namely John Lennon ) had sprinkled clues throughout the Beatles ’ albums for fans to pick up on .
The rumour quickly died down in 1970 after McCartney revealed himself to be alive on the cover of Newsweek magazine .
However , some theorists still maintain that Paul is dead and the Paul McCartney who played with Wings and in the Super Bowl is the same lookalike who played with the Beatles after Revolver .
7 NASA Faked the Moon Landings
The Apollo Astronauts did not land on the Moon ;
NASA and possibly others intentionally deceived the public into believing the landing (s ) did occur by manufacturing , destroying , or tampering with evidence , including photos , telemetry tapes , transmissions , and rock samples ;
NASA and possibly others continue to actively participate in the conspiracy to this day .
Enthusiasts of this theory claim that :
The astronauts could not have survived the trip because of exposure to radiation
The photos were altered : the Crosshairs on some photos appear to be behind objects , rather than in front of them where they should be
The quality of the photographs is implausibly high .
There are no stars in any of the photos , and astronauts never report seeing any stars from the capsule windows .
Identical backgrounds in photos that are listed as taken miles apart .
The moon ’s surface during the daytime is so hot that camera film would have melted .
No blast crater appeared from the landing
The launch rocket produced no visible flame .
The flag placed on the surface by the astronauts flapped despite there being no wind on the Moon .
Many commentators have published detailed rebuttals to the hoax claims .
According to a 1999 poll conducted by the The Gallup Organization , what Gallup termed an “ overwhelming majority ” of the US public , some 89 percent , did not believe the landing was faked , while 6 percent did and 5 percent were undecided .

Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations are claims that some or all elements of the Apollo Moon landings were faked by NASA and possibly members of other involved organizations .
Some groups and individuals have advanced alternate historical narratives which tend , to varying degrees , to include the following common elements :
Last week I came across Godwin's Law .
Many of you may already be familiar with it .
For those of you who are n't , Godwin 's Law , according to wikipedia , states :
As an online discussion grows longer , the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one .
To test this law I wrote a little program to look at comments in the drupal database that contains the Linux Journal web content .
The script first gets all the distinct article ids ( nids in drupal speak ) from the comments table where the comment includes one of the key words .
Then it gets a count of the number of comments for each article , sorts the list , and outputs the count along with the article title .
Here 's the script :
#!/bin/bash source mysqlpwd.sh echo " < table border= \ " 1 \ " > " echo " < thead > " echo " < tr >< th ># Comments </ th>< th> Article Title</th></tr > " echo " </ thead > " echo " < tbody > " mysql -u $ MYSQL_USERNAME -p $ MYSQL_PASSWORD drupal_lj \ -e " SELECT DISTINCT nid FROM comments WHERE comment LIKE ' % hitler % ' OR comment LIKE ' % nazi % ' " | while read nid do if [ [ $ nid ! = ' nid ' ] ] ; then count = $ ( mysql -u $ MYSQL_USERNAME -p $ MYSQL_PASSWORD drupal_lj \ -e " SELECT COUNT (*)
AS cnt FROM comments WHERE nid = $ nid " ) count = $ ( echo ${ count / cnt / } ) printf " % d\t%d
" $ count $ nid fi done | sort -- numeric -- reverse | while read count nid do t = $ ( mysql -u $ MYSQL_USERNAME -p $ MYSQL_PASSWORD drupal_lj \ -e " select title from node where nid = $ nid " ) t = $ ( echo ${ t / title / } ) printf " < tr > < td > % d < / td>< td>< a href=\ " / node/%d\ " >
%s</a></td></tr>
" $ count $ nid " $t " done echo " < / tbody > " echo " < / table > "
Here 's the output :
For comparison we need to get a list of articles that contain a large number of comments but that do not contain the keywords .
Now we look at each article , then we check to see if it has any comments that contain the keywords .
If it does not then we count the number of comments and output the article if the associated discussion was long .
I arbitrarily chose 100 as the minimum number of comments needed for a discussion to be classified as long .
Here 's the script :
#!/bin/bash source mysqlpwd.sh echo " < table border= \ " 1 \ " > " echo " < thead > " echo " < tr >< th ># Comments </ th>< th> Article Title</th></tr > " echo " </ thead > " echo " < tbody > " mysql -u $ MYSQL_USERNAME -p $ MYSQL_PASSWORD drupal_lj \ -e " SELECT nid FROM node " | while read nid do if [ [ $ nid ! = ' nid ' ] ] ; then count = $ ( mysql -u $ MYSQL_USERNAME -p $ MYSQL_PASSWORD drupal_lj \ -e " SELECT COUNT (*) as cnt FROM comments WHERE nid = $ nid AND ( comment LIKE '% hitler % ' OR comment LIKE ' % nazi % ' ) " ) count = $ ( echo ${ count / cnt / } ) if [ [ $ count - eq 0 ] ] ; then count = $ ( mysql -u $ MYSQL_USERNAME -p $ MYSQL_PASSWORD drupal_lj \ -e " SELECT COUNT (*)
AS cnt FROM comments WHERE nid = $ nid " ) count = $ ( echo ${ count / cnt / } ) if [ [ $ count - gt 100 ] ] ; then printf " % d\t%d
" $ count $ nid fi fi fi done | sort -- numeric -- reverse | while read count nid do t = $ ( mysql -u $ MYSQL_USERNAME -p $ MYSQL_PASSWORD drupal_lj \ -e " select title from node where nid = $ nid " ) t = $ ( echo ${ t / title / } ) printf " < tr > < td > % d < / td>< td>< a href=\ " / node/%d\ " >
%s</a></td></tr>
" $ count $ nid " $t " done echo " < / tbody > " echo " < / table > "
Here 's the output :
Can we conclude anything about the validity of Godwin 's Law from this ?
Ahhh , I dunno .

Requirements
Perils and Pitfalls of Agile Adoption
By Matthew Heusser
Date : Feb 3 , 2006
Return to the article
Agile development sounds great ; what could go wrong ?
Matt Heusser examines some of the myths , mysteries , and classic mistakes in Agile development , including some things to consider before jumping into Agile with both feet .
" Any good idea can be implemented poorly . "
— Author and consultant Esther Derby
If your organization is trying to adopt ( or considering ) a more Agile approach to software development , you are probably hearing plenty of rah-rah stories of how great things will be .
A rational response to those stories is to ask , " What can go wrong ? "
To discuss some of the traps to avoid , let ’s consider what most companies are transitioning from : the waterfall model .
The waterfall model is the most common way for large organizations to write software today .
It takes the complex , chaotic development process and turns it into something simple and clean :
Figure out what needs to be done ( requirements ) .
Determine how to do it ( architecture and design ) .
Write the software ( coding ) .
Make sure that the software works ( testing ) .
Deploy the system .
The only problem is , it does n’t work .
I should probably clarify that statement a bit :
The waterfall model often does n’t work well .
Companies try to turn the waterfall into an assembly line , with requirements analysts , architects , coders , testers , and project managers who oversee the assembly .
Transferring information between these people is difficult , so they tend to rely on documentation , which is often vague and sometimes worthless .
Worse , when the customer changes his mind after a decision is made , costs go up vastly — therefore , waterfall advocates suggest limiting or controlling change .
So , when the software ships , it ’s late , buggy , and does n’t really meet the customer ’s need ; it meets what the customer thought his need was nine months ago ...
Enter the Agile consultants .
Instead of specialists , they suggest generalists , who do all the work , implementing features in slices , end - to - end , in very short timeframes .
The customer can prioritize her features , getting the most important features first , meeting after every release to plan the next release .
Productivity increases because problems are n’t falling through the cracks .
There are no inter - team arguments , such as architects versus coders versus testers ; everyone is on one team , focusing on delivering something of value .
Testing moves up front , changing from a verification activity to a specification activity .
Immediate Risks
Implemented well , Agile methods truly can deliver .
The customer sees working progress periodically , can change her mind after every release , and sees the most important features implemented first .
But in my experience , Agile methods have three major potential risks :
Agile methods are easy to misunderstand .
It ’s easy to think you ’re doing Agile right , and be wrong .
Agile methods make value visible .
Agile Methods Are Easy To Misunderstand
Agile philosophy includes heavy customer involvement , responding to change versus following a plan , releasing software early and often , and focusing on individuals and interactions over processes and tools .
Those Agile philosophies tie into Agile methods such as pair programming , the planning game , time - boxed iterations , test - driven development , and refactoring .
( XProgramming.com is a wonderful resource on Agile methods . )
The methods exist in order to enable the philosophy .
For example , test - driven development combined with refactoring can make software malleable so it can change more easily , allowing the plan to change .
Automated testing combined with continuous integration makes it possible to release often .
Without automated testing and continuous integration , frequent releases create a huge manual testing burden that ’s often unbearable .
Agile practices are like any other practices , though ; they ’re learned through example , application , and training .
If the practices are disconnected from the philosophy , the result just wo n’t work .
For example , a few years back I worked with a company that wanted to be more " agile , " yet they still wanted to know exactly when projects would start and stop , before the requirements were defined .
That ’s a fine idea — in fact , Agile development can support this plan .
Features are placed in a priority order ; the team works on the highest priority first , iterating until time runs out .
The problem was that the organization wanted an estimate for all the work to be done — before they knew all the requirements .
The example above is n’t Agile — it ’s psychic .
Agile development specifically gives up on the psychic approach , instead choosing an adaptive approach .
It ’s Easy To Think You ’re Doing Agile Right , and Be Wrong
It ’s really easy to throw out the big , thick methodology binder and the heavyweight requirements documents , but Agile development expects that something will replace them .
Many organizations move to iterative development without automated testing — with the result that the testing burden grows exponentially — or move to iterative development but keep the hard deadlines and the expectation of full delivery on a ship date .
Pair programming without communication and feedback is just someone breathing over your shoulder .
Without testing skills , a developer wo n’t be able to do automated testing ; worse , he wo n’t even realize this as he wastes hours writing so - called " tests . "
In other words , Agile techniques require depth : the ability to know the right techniques for the current project , and the ability to choose between them .
Without direction , a team told to throw away its waterfall method will simply devolve into " code and fix . "
That is n’t Agile : it ’s chaos .
Agile Methods Make Value Visible
Yes , believe it or not , this is a potential risk of agile adoption .
It ’s a political risk .
In most large organizations , it ’s possible to not work very hard , not contribute , and get by on political savvy and power .
I refer to these folks as " roaches " because they ’re essentially scavengers that hide from the light .
Agile methods make progress visible .
Unlike the complex , bureaucratic waterfall organization , which is opaque , if someone in an Agile shop is n’t contributing , the fact will become obvious — and fast .
Think about the consequences of this fact for a minute .
The roaches , often the most influential and politically savvy people in the group , are going to fight Agile methods tooth and nail .
The misinformation campaign that a roach leads can be surprisingly effective , because Agile methods are easy to misunderstand and hard to get right .
Two Cautionary Tales
A few years ago , I presented a seminar on test - driven development at a large testing conference .
Many of the participants were " doing Agile . "
One in particular was having a very hard time .
Her development group was rewriting a piece of core functionality from scratch in Java — a new language for them .
They hired a group of Java coders and created a schedule with four - week iterations .
Every four weeks , the developers were supposed to throw a chunk of code " over the wall " for the testers to test .
The software was supposed to be developed in six iterations of four weeks each , with a final QA phase at the end .
The first iteration was two weeks late , and buggy .
The second iteration was a week late ( making the project now three weeks late ) , and completely buggy .
The basic functionality did n’t even work , and it introduced a number of regression errors in the software , so the testers had to go rerun the original test plans for phase I .
It did n’t take a crystal ball to foresee what the next five iterations would be like , and they were n’t good .
Worse , the testing group was in trouble because they were the supposed bottleneck " holding up the Agile developers . "
In other words , the organization tried the following :
" Big bang " style software scheduling with a new staff in a brand - new language .
( But hey , they had iterations ! )
Iterative development without automated tests .
" Iterations " that delivered incomplete work products ( for instance , software that was n’t ready to release to the customer ) .
Agile development while keeping the developers and the testers in separate buildings , with testing as an afterthought , verification activity .
You can probably guess the results ; they were n’t pretty .
That sad part is that Agile was blamed for the failure of the project .
Here ’s the real truth : New people , new processes , and new technologies throw realistic scheduling out of whack .
By focusing on delivering working software early and comparing expected features completed to actual features delivered , Agile development provides feedback , which can allow a management team to make good decisions .
A second organization was having integration problems ; specifically , problems with different versions of the same libraries on different products .
When management heard the Agile pitch of " continuous integration , " they were immediately sold , buying all of the developers copies of a famous book on Agile development .
Management went to an iterative development standard , began daily standup meetings ... and that was about it .
Without substance , the so - called Agile development conversion devolved into " work harder on tighter timeframes , with standup meetings . "
The developers still lacked direct contact with the customers and had requirements that were even more light , vague , and unverifiable .
Twelve months later and the team is basically back to square one .
That ’s not Agile ; that ’s " code and fix . "
Avoiding the Pitfalls
Taking a careful look at some of the failures I ’ve described shows a few similarities :
Massive , world - shaking change without experimentation .
Expecting to have your cake and eat it too :
All features , on time , on budget , on schedule , regardless of how realistic that schedule is .
Implementation of Agile techniques without a belief in the core philosophies of responding to change and not planning everything up front .
When an organization implements Agile in a " big bang , " all - or - nothing way ... well , that is possible , but the results are unpredictable .
They ’re trying to develop in a new way on a project that ’s never been done before , and the technical term for that is an experiment .
Typically , you do n’t want to use an experiment on a bet - the - company project , which is what many Agile projects end up becoming .
There is an alternative to declaring exactly how all development will be run , from this day forward , without ever trying it : Experiment on your existing projects .
One place to start is with automated testing .
If your team is constantly modifying the same codebase , automated testing can pay for itself very quickly by lowering the overall testing burden .
With automated testing in place , the team has a safety net , which can enable true iterative development and quick releases .
Another way to be more Agile is to simply make decisions that conform more closely to the Agile manifesto — that is , decisions that value the following :
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
over processes and tools Working software over comprehensive documentation
over comprehensive documentation Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
over contract negotiation Responding to change over following a plan
Add small , incremental changes to the way you develop software ( your " methodology " ) that support these values .
Agility is not yes - or - no ; it ’s more - or - less — and do n’t let anyone tell you otherwise .
A Final Reminder
Agile methods wo n’t result in an ability to ship infinite code in zero time , they wo n’t create discipline without effort , and they are possible to perform badly .
Implemented poorly , Agile methods can leave an organization in worse shape than when it started , with all the same problems , less documentation , and worse architecture .
Implemented well , Agile methods provide working software quickly ; they give the customer the ability to change his mind routinely ; and , most importantly , by comparing actual to expected delivery , they provide insight into the actual progress of the project .
Knowing the progress of the project makes realistic schedules with realistic end dates actually possible .
Adjusting the schedule to reality , on the other hand , takes guts , integrity , courage , and self - discipline .

I ’m sure some irate Mac fans have already fired off angry emails , based upon the deck for this editorial alone , but hopefully the rest of you will at least get through this background stuff first .
In April of last year , I bought a Macbook Pro as my new notebook .
Note that this is hardly my first Apple computer .
I grew up on Apple IIs , back in the days when you had to add an 80 - column card to ’em !
I was one of the few holdouts using an Apple IIgs when the rest of the world had gone to DOS and Windows PCs .
Even after I got my first 286 PC , I frequently used the Macs my mother had in her home ( she was a teacher at an elementary school that was Apple - based ) .
So I ’m no Apple noob -— this was just the first one I had bought for myself , for frequent use , in a long time .
Recently , a reader named David e-mailed me , saying he found the article from my guide on how to replace the hard drive in a Macbook Pro .
He asked , simply , “ A year later , what do you think ? ”
Fundamentally , I stand by my initial impressions :
There are plenty of things OS X does very well , and better than any version of Windows .
There are also some really boneheaded things .
But honestly , the thing I hate most about using a Mac are the Apple fans .
The old song and dance about the Steve Jobs worshipping , sycophantic , “ thank you sir may I have another ” , na-ture of the Cult of Apple is true .
And while it certainly does not represent all Mac users , there are enough bad apples ( pardon the pun ) to spoil the bunch .

Napolitano with the Queen
Critics of the EU ’s secret plans to bring back the failed European constitution by stealth at this week ’s summit were blasted by the Italian President , Giorgio Napolitano .
The Italian head of state told a news conference in Siena last week that " those who are anti EU are terrorists " .
And he attacked eurosceptics who warn that the promised new EU treaty will go too far in eroding the powers of member states , saying : " It is psychological terrorism to suggest the spectre of a European superstate . "
His comments emerged as EU foreign ministers gather in Luxembourg today to negotiate the new treaty to replace the failed EU constitution , ahead of a summit of EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday .
Ahead of what will be his last major political event before he hands over to Gordon Brown , Mr Blair has been forced to deny widespread claims that he will seek to sign up to a new treaty which will revive the key planks of the constitution , which was doomed after it was rejected by French and Dutch voters in referendums in 2005 .
It is psychological terrorism for critics of the EU to suggest the spectre of a European superstate Giorgio Napolitano
Downing Street issued a list of Britain ’s " red line " issues where Mr Blair will refuse to hand over powers to Brussels , such as the veto on criminal justice and labour law and Britain ’s seat on the UN security council , but refused to offer British voters a referendum on the treaty .
But critics say Mr Blair is , like most other EU leaders , determined to bring the failed EU constitution in by the back door by simply renaming the document as an " amending treaty " and slimming down its original 500 pages .
Campaigners for national referendums on the proposed treaty were left outraged when President Napolitano spoke out last Monday alongside the German President , Horst Kohler , who nodded in agreement at his comments .
President Kohler also described the tactics of eurosceptics as " populistic , demagogic campaigning " .
The words of the two men were seen by many in their home countries as a thinly veiled attempt to link euroscepticism with the demagoguery and populism of the fascist regimes of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini .
Mr Blair ’s claim that the new treaty is not simply a re-hash of the rejected constitution were dismissed by eurosceptic campaigners , who pointed to the statements of other European politicians in recent weeks .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , in a letter to fellow leaders , revealed last wek that most countries want to keep the " substance " of the constitution .
And former French president Valéry Giscard d’Estaing , a key architect of the EU constitution , said last week : " I am strongly opposed to a mutilated treaty .
The European Council must establish a clear road map and a clear mandate to achieve the process for the ratification of the constitutional treaty . "
Meanwhile , German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier recently said " closed - door negotiations among the 27 EU governments were making progress in deciding on what to do with the constitution " , adding : " Everyone wants to push this forward . "
UKIP leader , Nigel Farage MEP , said : " This treaty is the constitution by another name .
The agenda has always been to sneak it in under another guise .
It is a deliberate and deceitful attempt to prevent free and fair referendums not just in Britain but all European countries .
You gotta love job postings .
Depending on the description provided , you can often times determine some underlying plans for a company .
And the only companies we care about in this regard would be the ones big enough to lend some interesting job postings and descriptions .
In this case , WebProNews was tipped off to a posting from Microsoft , and it looks like the giant is hoping to create a viable Flickr competitor .
According to the job posting :
" Heard of Flickr ? YouTube ?
How about .
Mac ?
This role will work across the new Windows Live division with teams like Spaces , SkyDrive , Messenger and Hotmail to construct a winning strategy for Microsoft in photo and video sharing .
This role involves leading the team to design the strategy then build and implement a winning solution that will be loved by millions of customers .
This feature team is building a next - generation photo and video sharing service that will compete with flickr , smugmug and other photo web solutions today .
This is a “ v1 ” opportunity . "
So of course we 're all wondering : what 's it really mean ?
After the first giant wave of web 2.0 we saw the rise of web - based media sharing tools like Flickr , Blogger and Writely , and we saw them get snatched up by Yahoo and Google .
With Yahoo and AOL striving to remain portals , and Google looking to beat Microsoft by busting down the back door , trying its hand at Microsoft 's tactics for web - based applications , it almost seemed like these companies had established just about all we needed to see from them .
I 'm wondering if it's too late for Microsoft to really get into this game ?
It 's got a lot of projects going on , most of which I imagine would be an integral part of a Flickr competitor 's reach .
From Live Spaces to its increasing mobile efforts , perhaps Microsoft was waiting for enough of these stars to align before rolling out a cool new photo - sharing tool .
It would have to have immediate mobile integration in order to be a worthwhile alternative , and in order to catch the amount of steam that Flickr has garnered , it would also need some cultural importance , and for Microsoft , that means a pretty hefty reliance on the Live Spaces initiative .
Perhaps we 'll also see some social browsing with its incorporation into Hotmail and Messenger ?
Either way , we 've got our eyes wide open to see what Microsoft comes up with .
jaaronfarr asked me why I switched from Planner to Org .
Both of them are popular personal information managers for Emacs , and both of them have practically all the features I need .
They both do a good job at helping people
manage tasks , schedule , and notes .
If you have a few
months to explore this , I suggest that you try both for at least a
month each .
On the other hand , if you want quick results , some time
thinking about how you plan can save you more time later .
I tried out Org because I was working on a chapter about schedule
management and it was n’t fair to just rely on the manual or the
mailing list .
In the beginning , I
felt frustrated by the lack of things I ’d gotten used to in Planner :
the freedom to edit anything on my day page , little conveniences like +2 tue to mean two Tuesdays from now ( which Carsten has just added ) , publishing my blog …
After two months of using Org almost every day , I ’m starting to
understand it .
I ’ve come to appreciate the ease of working with an
outline .
I love the way it clocks time .
I find the daily and weekly
views really helpful .
I ’ve hacked stuff for it : time / load estimation ,
time reporting , next action summaries , agenda publishing …
I ’m fairly deeply
As a geek , I have to confess — I like Planner more .
Planner is more fun
to code .
Maybe it ’s because I ’ve spent years with it , and I know my
way around the source .
Maybe it ’s because we split Planner up into lots of little pieces that
can be reused and advised .
Maybe the modularity of Planner is because
chunks of the code were written on a computer with a teensy screen ,
which forced me to write functions that fit 80 × 48 characters .
( See ,
that limitation was there for a reason ! )
There are plenty of entry
points .
From time to time , I still find myself copying an entire
function in order to change something in the middle , but usually I can
just get away with wrapping something around something else .
With Org ,
I find myself doing a lot of copy - and - paste programming .
I ’d fix this
by breaking the functions down into smaller bits , but I do n’t have the
brainspace right now .
Maybe after the book .
Org is better for my brain , though .
It gives me a better overview of
both the ground - level tasks ( what am I going to do right now , today ,
this week ) as well as the 50,000 - foot view ( what are my big projects ) ?
Planner ’s good at the ground - level tasks , but the overview ’s always
been a little awkward because it has to visit a number of files to get
a big picture .
Org handles that easily .
And the one - place - for - data thing of Org is pretty cool , too .
Org
dynamically generates reports , which could take a bit longer if you
have a large Org file .
Planner copies data wherever it makes sense , so
you ’d have a copy of the task on your day page and a copy of the task
on your plan page .
Plan pages can get out of sync unless you ’re either
religious about using planner - edit - task - description and other
functions to edit your tasks , or you use planner - id and you ’re lucky .
Timeclock entries get out of sync , too .
You can trust Org more than
Planner in terms of consistency .
So now I ’m kinda in the middle of these two modules .
I use Org for all
my work tasks , and I ’m moving towards using it for all of my personal
tasks as well .
But I still keep my blog entries in Planner , even
though they get mirrored into a WordPress blog on my web server .
* What would I recommend ?*
It depends on the way you think .
If you ’re the kind of person who was
never happy with day planners because you needed more space to doodle ,
write notes , move things around , add other things , try out Planner .
If
you like outlines and organizing your tasks into projects , try out
Org .
Note that just because you work that way now does n’t mean you ’ll work
that way in the future .
Do n’t worry .
Emacs will adapt .
You can switch
between Planner and Org fairly easily .
Just give yourself a week or so
to adjust ( or a month if you ’ve customized your old tool extensively
and miss lots of things about it ) .
Use the tool every day , and you ’ll
be fine .
Have you tried out both ?
Or have you tried out one of them and are curious about the other ?
I ’d love to learn from your experience or answer your questions .

One of our favorite shapes is the Sierpinski triangle .
In one sense , a mere mathematical abstraction , on the other , a pattern that naturally emerges in real life from several different simple algorithms .
On paper , one can play the Chaos Game to generate the shape ( or cheat and just use the java applet ) .
You can also generate a Sierpinski triangle in what is perhaps a more obvious way : by exploiting its fractal self - similarity .
Beginning with a single triangle , replace that triangle with three half - size copies arranged so that their outer border form a new triangle of the same size as the original .
Then , replace each of those three triangles with three triangles half that size , and so forth .
( Turns out of course , that the fractal pattern is due to the algorithm of shrinking and positioning the shapes , not due to the fact that the initial shape that we began with was a triangle– any plane figure can be used . )
This algorithm is easy enough to implement directly and physically , using a flexible medium like polymer clay .
We begin with a few packages of polymer clay– two colors of Fimo Soft , in this case .
( It ’s a common oven - hardening material that you can get at craft and art supply stores .
Overused in some contexts , but still has its uses . )
Knead it until it ’s actually soft and workable , a few minutes .
It turns out , for the color pattern that we are using , that we need a lot more of the beige than the blue .
Form the two clay colors into long triangular shapes .
The cross section of each should be equilateral , with side length near 1/ 2 ″ to 1 ″ .
Using a knife , cut three equal - length sections of the darker color and one equal length of the lighter color , ideally using less than 1/8 of your total supply of the light color .
Mate the three dark pieces to the sides of the light piece , carefully matching them edge to edge and avoiding air gaps to the extent possible .
The stack , as presently assembled , is the first iteration of the Sierpinski triangle , with a total of three dark triangles .
Press the stack of triangles together to make sure that the edges fuse well .
Carefully and deliberately lengthen the triangle to at least 4 times its original length , taking care to preserve the triangular shape and keep the size of the cross section uniform along the whole length as you reduce it .
Using a sharp knife , trim off the rough edges , which may not preserve the cross section as well as you would like .
Cut the stretched “ first iteration ” piece into four pieces of equal length .
Set one of the four pieces aside so that you will have a piece of “ first iteration ” material when you are done .
Make a triangular prism out of the light colored material that matches the shape and size of the three main pieces , and again mate the three dark pieces to the sides of the light piece .
The stack is now a realization of the second iteration of the Sierpinski triangle , with a total of nine dark triangles .
Again stretch the result from the previous iteration , cut into four pieces of equal length and set one aside .
Make a new light colored prism the size of one of the quarters , and mate the three dark pieces to the edges of the light colored piece .
The third iteration , shown here , now has a total of 27 dark triangles .
By now , you should have the hang of the iterative algorithm for making the fractal .
Again , stretch and cut the result from the previous iteration , and mount it to the sides of a new light - colored prism piece .
The fourth iteration , lower left , has 81 dark triangles .
On the lower right you can see a piece of fourth - iteration material next to the set - aside pieces from the first three iterations .
The fifth iteration has 243 dark triangles .
Starting to get interesting , no ?
The sixth iteration , on the far right has 729 dark triangles ; it ’s really looking excellent now .
By the time that we get to the 2187 triangles of the seventh iteration , we begin to reach the point of diminishing returns ; it becomes harder to see the wispy blue lines that remain , and be begin to lose contrast .
Using a color combination with better yet contrast might make another iteration or two more impressive .
The next step is to cut , drill , or otherwise prepare the material as desired and bake to harden the clay .
The set of earrings was made with the sixth iteration material , with its great detail and contrast .
A set of little tiles showing the different iterations also makes a great little handful of fractals .
( You can see more pictures of this project and our results in this photo set . )
These , and the process of making them , are great visual aids for iterative processes , fractals and self - similarity .
This construction process is certainly one that could be adapted to iterate slightly different generating functions ; it will be interesting to see what else can be generated by this method–
What kinds of fractals can you produce in clay ?
THE 1 HIT WONDER
You will never hear this guy / girl ever say anything , whether it be to other students or the professor .
Then one day , after looking extremely intense or constipated for an hour straight , they will say something so gloriously insightful that it will bring tears to the eyes of everyone who bears witness to it .
Then they will never speak again .
THE KID THAT FUCKING NO - ONE LIKES
This kid is a douche bag !
And for arguments sake let ’s call him “ DANNY ” You desperately want to punch him in his ear , but he ’s disabled .
And because he disabled he makes sure to piss EVERYONE OFF with extra annoyance on the side .
This kid will sometime attempt to befriend you then manage to say or do something so unspeakably rude or offer some sort of backwards compliment .
Parties disassemble whenever this Ass hat manages to find his way to one .
Everyone avoids him but secretly watches him to see if he will lose a crutch while walking or roll down the stairs just to get in a good chuckle .
THE SUBURBAN RAPPER
The Suburban Rapper can be found in any common area , listening to his own music on his IPOD at an unreasonable volume .
Generally ( but not always ) white , he awkwardly uses the words Dog , Crib , Homie , Phat , G , or Ill .
If he spots you , he ’ll ask you to “ peep this new track yo , ” or attempt to sell you tickets to his half - assed concert .
His music is generally unbearable , and if you ’re lucky , you can get away with only hearing a few verses .
He always seems surprised that his poser antics never land him a girl , or a record deal .
ACTIVIST ANNIE
Somewhat related to the man-hating feminist but has plenty more to piss her off than just men .
Needs to get involved in every civil rights or ultra liberal campaign that has ever been mentioned on campus .
Tries to make a cause out of every problem anybody has with authority , no matter how absurd or completely unfounded the complaint .
YOU’RE A LITTLE TOO OLD TO BE HERE GUY
Usually in the 28 - 32 year range , this species refuses to let go of the joys of college .
Can be found on campus seven days a week , and is always present at EVERY SINGLE FRAT PARTY .
Will give you some lame , shady excuse why he ’s still in college , and will then befriend you so he can abuse the T1 connection in your dorm room to download porn .
Most often has no friends his own age , is unemployed and still lives with his parents .
Because he is older than everyone else , he will constantly criticize everyone for acting like children , but will then throw a tantrum when you wo n’t let him play a game of HALO .
He loves crappy beer , joints and the cheapest cigarettes available .
You can recognize him by his weird and outdated taste in clothing and his fondness for 80 ’s rock music .
Usually very loud , obnoxious and opinionated in the classroom , with traits similar to that of THE EXAM BEGGER and THE INTELLECTUAL SUPERHERO .
THE EXAM BEGGER
This person cannot take a test without first begging for as much review or information as possible .
They cannot prepare for a test without first knowing seemingly unimportant details like “ How many questions are on this test ? ”
They will beg for extra review sessions , extra credit , and to know the exact breakdown of how the test is scored .
They will waste the whole class when a test is announced if the professor does n’t shut them up .
They will also spend the entire first session of a class , when the syllabus is presented trying to make homework a much higher percentage of the total grade .
BIBLE SLUT
Generally starts out being the CONVERTER , straight - laced and conservative ; they go to church every week and brag about that fact often .
This person even has the ability to recite any and every bible verse from memory .
Then THE LUCKY BASTARD or JOHNNY THREE LEGS introduces them to the marvels of SEX , and it ’s all down hill from there , as they descend into the foul pits of whoredom .
They of course will still go to Church every week in order to keep up a facade of piety , singing the glories of baby Jesus .
THE BABYFACE
This kid graduated high school early , but does n’t really make a big deal about it .
Because of this , his social skills are somewhat undeveloped , and he is quick to attach himself to social groups in order to gain acceptance .
Said social groups are quick to make him the subject of their corruption projects , and take great pleasure in getting him drunk / laid / stoned for the first time .
THE AMICABLE ATHLETE
Sort of the polar opposite of the Hillbilly Gangster , the Amicable Athlete is usually about 6 foot three , weighing in at 225 pounds , and looks like Sam Jackson on steroids .
Attending college on a sports scholarship , the Amicable Athlete probably works a cushy job at a car dealership , gets more tail than you can possibly imagine , is more or less constantly high on primo weed all of the time , and is smart enough to know that he ’s in for an easy ride and to enjoy it and throws great parties !
While he might never turn pro , there ’s a good chance he ’ll get a good gig on the local AM sports radio station
THE STAREDOWN-ER
If this kid is corrected by another student on anything , no matter how wrong they were , and how right the corrector was , his wrath shall be incurred in the most passive - aggressive manner possible : Silently glowering at their new ‘ nemesis ’ .
No matter if the incident occurred once , months ago , any time you look in this kid ’s general direction , he will still be fucking staring at you with the hatred of a thousand warlords .
Will probably lead the victim of his piercing gaze to do a number of ‘ Is he still fucking staring at me ? ’ checks .
THE WHITE RASTAFARIAN
All of his tie - dyed clothes are made from , like , pure natural hemp , man !
He most likely sports an impressive set of dreadlocks and can be easily spotted as he skateboards to his next class .
The White Rasta can also be found playing an odd game called ‘ hackey sack ’ along with others of his kind in any park - like area , or any place that has a couple of trees nearby , and seem to have an affinity for border collies and other shaggier members of the species canine .
They also seem to possess an almost MacGuyver - like ability to create a bong from a combination of nearly any common household objects within a matter of moments .
However , most of their time is spent contemplating whether or not trees can think .
THE NEWLY - RIPE FRUIT
This guy ’s gay !
You see , he ’s only just found out and now he ’s got to make up for lost time .
He may have had a healthy interest in sports , or board games – but no more .
He tries , for the sake of decorum , to occasionally talk about things that do not directly involve his gayness , but he is unequal to the struggle and five or six minutes down the line , the increasingly one - sided conversation has shifted to his multiple fuck buddies , or one of his alarmingly variegated fetishes .
You see , just liking cocks is n’t enough – that ’s not gay enough for the Newly - Ripe Fruit to truly express himself .
He must round his sexuality out with public discussion of whips or chains or piss drinking , but more often than not he decides he is a furry as well , and wo n’t let it escape anyone ’s notice .
Possibly does more to set back the cause of tolerance than Fred Phelps ever did .
THE NURSING STUDENT
OMG BUSY !
These girls ( invariably ) are incredibly busy with their nursing school workload .
Despite this , they get shit faced constantly with their fellow nursing school students , only to wake up at 5 am for their OB rotation .
Often incredibly attractive , these girls typically are still attached to the same guy they knew in high school , who they will marry .
THE CAVE DWELLER
His blinds are never open .
His light ’s never on .
He lives by the light of his computer .
Whenever he goes out , which is very , very rare , he squints and looks frightened , often power walking to class .
He uses the internet for his lectures , and never sleeps when you do , so you ca n’t hang out with your friends / girlfriend at your place .
He ’s not nice , but he ’s not mean .
He ’s clean , but his room ’s a mess .
There ’s Mountain Dew cans everywhere .
He gets average grades , and he ’s usually a science major , though sometimes a Lit or English major .
MUSCLES MCFLAUNTY
This individual ( almost always a guy ) has been lifting weights since age 4 , and never lets you forget about it .
He goes to the gym twice a day , wears nothing more covering than a wife beater , and constantly twitches his pecs just to get you to look at his chest .
McFlaunty may or may not be otherwise annoying , but it is a known fact that he eats creatine for breakfast , lunch and dinner to increase muscle mass even further ; this will result in four different cancers before he is 30 .
Occasionally , Muscles McFlaunty will have a lisp , in which case , laugh at him .
MRS .
DEGREE
Misses degree has no real purpose in college except finding “ Mr. Degree ” majoring in some lucrative field such as computer programming , premed , law , or engineering .
Often packed with great looks , a killer body and half a brain Mrs. Degree has no problem being a mere shadow of their wealthy husband and is always the first to brag and attempt to start “ intelligent conversation ” on the career of Mr. Degree .
Always on the prowl , you may find Mrs. Degree befriending such characters as the Study Nazi , FUCKING DISGUSTING C.S. MAJOR , and the CEO Junior .
SOCIAL DISORDER GUY
Avoided by everyone , this person possess a crippling social tic that goes completely unnoticed to him .
If you ’re unlucky enough to be identified by social disorder guy in public , you will be followed regardless of how much of a hurry you pretend to be in .
You will be forced , due to social etiquette , to engage in a meaningless and awkward conversation that will be filled with characterizations of your self image .
Social Disorder
Guy is completely comfortable stopping on his way to work for fifteen minutes or half an hour to fill you in on one of two things : either his roommate is moving out again or he has a new job .
You have no classes with him , and you never see him except for random times during the day around your campus , yet he considers you one of his best friends .
You probably are .
THE ANSWER MACHINE
This person gets it !
They understand the material .
They can answer the hard questions that require logical induction and they can form arguments using the material .
Unfortunately , everyone else in the class is either the Quiet , Smart Slacker or The Frat Mattress or I ’m Too Important to Be Here .
The professor lectures and asks a question and no one will answer .
Grated by the awkward silence , The Answer Machine finally answers .
The floodgates open .
From the rest of the semester onwards , the class is a dialogs between The Answer Machine and the professor interspersed with infrequent , sometimes mind - numbing comments from The Frat Mattress when she ’s called on and the slacker when they care .
But for the most part , it ’s The Answer Machine .
Even when they do n’t answer , the professor will call on them regardless of whether or not their hand is raised .
THE MEGAPHONE
This guy seems pretty intelligent and contributes with a vast amount of knowledge .
Unfortunately he has got no grasp of volume at all .
Will scream across the room with a content smile on his face while embarrassing the people around him .
When conversing with The Megaphone you ca n’t decide if he is constantly pulling your leg or just does n’t realize what the hell he is telling you .
Does never know when to shut up but magically manages to never piss anyone seriously off .
THE GEEK PROVIDER
The provider tends to be everyone ’s best friend when they need something from him .
Of his various requests , he spends the majority of his time lofting and unlofting bunks , or fixing people ’s computers .
When he is not doing this , the provider is somehow nowhere to be found .
For extra fun , combine THE PROVIDER with the FOREIGN SILENT CURVE DESTROYER
MR. ROTC CADET
Often seen traversing campus in fatigues , yet his pack is devoid of water , map , GPS , or other survival gear .
Instead , he packs the same Biology 101 , Spanish II , and English Rhetoric texts that you do .
Known to major in Criminology or Criminal Justice , and may show up to 8 a .m. class in PT gear , not having had time to make it home for a shower and shave after his morning run .
Placed by God on Earth to counter the ramblings of Passionate Politico with physical threats ( if PP is a male ) or ramblings of his own stripping PP of her human / constitutional rights ( if PP is a female ) .
Very loyal to his friends and beliefs , Mr. ROTC Cadet is generally a good guy to have as a friend , or at least an amiable acquaintance .
MR . I WORK FULL TIME
This guy uses his job as an excuse not to show up and help with group projects .
He will claim that he must work all the time and therefore cannot show up for any of the group meetings .
Impossible to get hold of outside of class .
Generally a 50/50 shot of doing the work .
MUSIC MAJOR
One of the more rare species outside of Music Classes , Practice Rooms , and University Symphony Concerts .
The MM spends 50 % of their time practicing , 25 % studying hard / semi-useless classes which require an A to get accepted to their low - paying major , 25 % at band practices , and 25 % with their music Fraternity / Sorority …is that 125 % ?
Does n’t matter ;
MMs party so much that the high alcohol content in their bloodstream causes them to black out and loose that 25 % .
Tends to only date other music majors because “ Only another MM can understand why they have to practice 3 - 4 hours a day ” .
Depending on the instrument , music majors are laid back , but complain that they are working SOOO hard to eventually get a salary of < $ 35 K a year but that “ I love music SOOO much it does n’t matter ” .
Usually makes fun of the Drama Nerd for not being “ Real Musicians ” and has enough Classical CD ’s to fill up Amazon.com .
FACEBOOK ADDICT
The Facebook Addict often makes references to who changed / added what , and who “ its complicated ” with who .
Most of their sentences begin with “ omg did u see _______ on his / her wall ? ” and end with “ Tag it ! ”
They check facebook every chance they get , only to get pissed when they dont have a new wall post from when they last checked it 18 seconds ago .
They are amazed by those who mini-feed say they have “ no recent activity ” and how they have such self control .
The FACEBOOK ADDICT often joins many groups and is only moments away from becoming the FACEBOOK ZOMBIE .
THE STUDIO ART MAJOR :
The S.A.M. totes around a humongous portfolios ( often containing works of art only other S.A.M. ’s can appreciate ) manages to whack near passersby ’s and destroy other objects in their path .
The studio major whine ’s about spending all their money on ridiculously expensive studio supplies , yet they have enough for a regular smoke … you know , for the stress .
Unfortunately , studio courses are inhumanely time - consuming , so the S.A.M. are almost always held up in the studio labs , yet the degree is absolutely worthless , thus resulting in a downward mental spiraling of the said major students .
You could spot them easily by their odd sense of “ fashion ” , consisting of articles such as striped socks , ripped jeans and unsightly hairstyles .
The best way to test if an individual is a studio arts major is to ask him / her to help you count , as most ca n’t do math to save their lives .
INTELLECTUAL SUPERHERO
Intellectual Superhero is neither an intellectual nor a superhero , but do n’t tell him that !
The Intellectual Superhero is easily identified by his complete inability to allow a class period to pass by without asking at least 654 questions designed to show how “ witty ” and “ clever ” he is .
He will attempt to prove the professor wrong in every class with his inane bullshit , regardless of the fact that the professor has a doctorate in the field .
If it ’s a science course , the Intellectual Superhero will attempt to solve every problem using an alternate method , which is always incorrect .
But do n’t worry ; he ’ll still manage to waste 20 minutes of your life with his insane method of solving the problem .
At least you ’ll get to laugh at him when the professor proves him wrong .
THE FACE BOOK ZOMBIE
This person comes to class every single time , yet spends 100 % of class time on their laptop .
They believe that if one comes to class , one will somehow absorb the material telepathically from the professor .
They usually are on Face book , Forums ( Many are Goons ) Some sort of RPG , Solitaire , you name it .
The important thing , though , is that they are not paying attention to class at all , Ever .
They tend to hover in the back , and have ultra quick minimizing reflexes if a lone TA should wander back there .
THE ETHNIC TREASURE
Comes from a multi-ethnic back ground , and will constantly bring this up .
They will write articles in the school paper about how delightfully confused they are about not knowing which ethnic stereotypes to conform to .
THE “ GARY ”
The name is very personal and is why I choose to use it , it became a code word for these type of guys .
Not exclusive to university .
Usually an unattractive guy who thinks he is a stud and acts like he is hung like a porn star .
Thinks he can charm and seduce any woman by lecherously rubbing her back and give back massages while trying to undo her bra .
Always touching up girls even if they give the message they are not interested , even in front of their boyfriend .
But thats cool , he has a black belt in Karate so will be ready to fight off any pissed boyfriends .
Carries a pair of handcuffs with him and loves to put girls through bondage in the pub even if they do n’t want it .
THEY LIVE AT THE COFFEE SHOP
It might be an on - campus coffee shop or one right near campus , but either way they ’re there .
Always .
The group can get quite large , but there ’s a core of about four people .
Usually this core consists of : a fat , annoying girl ; a gay guy ; a theater major ( male or female ) ; and an older guy , either a grad student / limpet or a townie .
This core group will invariably occupy the coffee shop ’s only couch ; if there are more than one , they will occupy the best couch .
No matter where you are in the coffee shop , you will hear them laughing , shouting , calling one another hot , singing along with the song playing on the stereo ( “ omigod i luv this song ! ! ” ) , and erupting into a chorus of “ BYEEEE ’s ” whenever one of the group finally decides to leave .
45 YEAR OLD COLLEGE STUDENT WITH 2 KIDS
The 45 Year Old College Student with Two Kids is one of the more interesting persona ’s found in the college classroom .
This subject has returned to school in an attempt to better her life , which is a great endeavor .
However , there are a few things about this person that will make you want to punch her in the face by the end of the semester .
The 45 - year - old college student with two kids must write down every word the professor says .
This will cause the class to be peppered with calls of “ can you repeat that ” approximately every 0.23 seconds .
Second , she must ask the most obvious questions , preferably ones the professor has already answered .
THE FLEETING LOVEBIRDS
Comprised mainly of Freshman , these two are fresh out of high school , and are gonna be in love forever .
They take all the same classes together , they ’ve got their first apartment together , and they ’re inseparable .
Most of the time , one of the two had the chance to a scholarship at a better school , but turned it down in the name of love .
They ’ll sit together in class , are always the first to volunteer for group work together , and will no doubt be broken up by the end of their first year .
NIGHT OWL
Staying up long after you ’ve gone to bed , a Night Owl roommate may periodically awaken you with a laughing fit after reading a Chuck Norris joke on some crappy forum or heating water in the microwave for a 3 AM cup of ramen .
May be seen complaining about the lack of places open in town at 1 in the morning on Tuesday night .
The Night Owl is also likely to skip morning classes .
THE GUY WITH INHUMAN HALO SKILLS
This guy does n’t have “ mad skills ” ;
Instead , there is no word in the English language that properly describes how good this fucker is with a plasma rifle or pistol .
He looks rather ordinary , with no unusual physical features , nor obvious personality quirks .
But give him an Xbox , and a copy of Halo , and prepare to have many recurring nightmares of what you ’re about to see .
You could swear that the The Guy with inhuman Halo skills has found a way to wire an Xbox to his brain , because there is no other explanation to how impossibly good he is .
He quite literally can chuck a grenade at a difficult - to - reach weapon , and the explosion will launch the said weapon straight at him , as if he was pulling it telekineticaly .
He knows the location of every item on every map , and knows exactly when that item is gonna respawn .
STUPID UGLY FAT GIRL
Stupid Ugly Fat Girl feels the need to enter into every single class discussion , completely disregarding the fact that she has nothing of substance to add to the conversation .
Stupid Ugly Fat Girl cannot construct a sentence without using the words “ like ” and “ um ” at least 12 times for every 2 other words .
She always wears clothes that are too tight , and seems partial to gaudy rhinestone shirts with incredibly original phrases such as “ Princess ” strewn across the front of her sagging cow tits .
The only way to actually learn something in a class with the Stupid Ugly Fat Girl is to distract her attention with a shiny object .
THE ONE UPPER
This student will make it a point to one - up anything that comes out of anyones mouth .
You study for a test for 6 hours ?
He studied for 10 .
You drank 12 beers ?
He drank 20 .
You ’ve broken your arm twice ?
He ’s broken his 3 times .
The interesting thing to note about the One - Upper is the fact that everything he says is a lie , but he has convinced himself its true .
SMALL TOWN GODDESS
Hails from some microscopic town where she maybe had 5 or 6 classmates in her graduating class , the Small Town Goddess is what is known as HOT .
SMOKING HOT , in fact .
Like , all - natural , blonde haired and blue - eyed 1973 - ish Playboy bunny - like hotness .
However , for some reason unknown to science , she somehow did not develop what is commonly known as ‘ Hot Chick Syndrome ’ and is , instead , incredibly sweet , good natured and friendly to a fault .
This , naturally , causes most members of the opposite sex to be baffled by this seemingly incongruous behavior .
Many a man have approached her , yet few can stand to be around her for very long .
Why , you ask ?
The fault lies not with her , oh dear reader !
Nay , the fault comes from realizing that she is honestly squeaky clean and you , by comparison , are like some filthy hobo in your soul .
JOHNNY FRAT BOY – or – SALLY SORORITY CHICK
While there ’s certainly nothing wrong with being in a Greek organization , some people take their involvement in these groups a little too seriously .
These are the people who ca n’t go 2 consecutive days without wearing their shirts from some drinking party they went to last weekend .
Johnny Frat
Boy likes to brag about how many beers he slammed down on Tuesday night , while Sally Sorority Chick acts as though she is too immaculate to be tarnished by your presence .
In either case you should n’t worry about these two personality types too much because they only associate with each other .
This brings me to another point : when you see these people outside of class , it is perfectly acceptable to run them over with your motor vehicle of choice .
STUDY NAZI
Study Nazi is in school for one reason : to get good grades .
Unfortunately for Study Nazi , he ’s not that bright and he struggles with his classes .
That does n’t stop him from letting everyone know how long he studied for that 5 question quiz though .
Study Nazi , much like the Intellectual Superhero , will ask questions constantly during class .
However , the Intellectual Superhero has some grasp of the material .
Study Nazi , while he can quote his books and his notes verbatim , has no idea what any of it means .
Under no circumstances should you approach Study Nazi outside of class .
Doing so will only remind him that he ’s losing valuable time that he could be using in the library and you might get hurt in his frenzied dash to get there as quickly as possible .
THE KARAOKE SUPERSTAR :
Possessing the incredible ability of knowing the lyrics to every song ever written , but unfortunately lacking the talent to flaunt it properly , the Karaoke Superstar molds every moment of their life into that of an American Idol reject .
Whether it be wailing along to their favorite Nickelback song at the bar , or belting out Phil Collins in the dorm shower at 8 in the morning , the Karaoke Superstar fails to hit the right notes every time .
Those in earshot will reel in horror at the audio assault , exclaiming “ Oh my God , a cat fell into the blender ! ” or “ It sounds like someone is scraping a cheese grater across 200 feet of blackboard ! ”
The Karaoke Superstar falls under the category of “ completely ignorant , ” believing their vocal stylings to be those of a professional .
Frequently an actual Music major , mentioning their shortcomings will result in a major blow to their ego .
THE LUCKY BASTARD
An amorphous presence , he is in your class just to make you feel crappy .
He does n’t try , is n’t smart , and may even be a mean SOB to people , yet gets lucky breaks in grades / finding a job / getting a girl .
For instance he bombs a test but the professor loses it and acknowledges he took the test and gets the class average , or finds an emotionally unstable girl who clings to him and does anything he wants regardless of how he treats her .
He also will get a job because of a crappy reason like him and the recruiter like the same baseball player .
THE BALANCED GUY
They ’re a fairly sociable bunch with lots of common sense , and they have fairly diversified skills .
These guys seldom try to draw attention to themselves but also have a healthy amount of self - esteem ( Balanced Guys generally do n’t attack / insult people in any way unless they feel it ’s warranted ) .
They ’re willing to learn a little about everything and can be found in places such as the gym lifting weights , or even in a kitchen working on their cooking skills … or …. sometimes in their room masturbating to a wide variety of downloaded porn clips .
Who knows what Balanced Guy will do next .
They are n’t spendthrifts , but they are n’t penny pinchers , either .
They play both sports and video games .
When it comes to discussions of any sort , balanced guy keeps an open mind and generally takes a politically “ moderate ” stance .
SILENT FOREIGN CURVE DESTROYER
Silent Foreign Curve Destroyer has nothing better to do than study .
While the average of the rest of the class is a respectable 45 % , Silent Foreign Curve Destroyer has approximately a 1351 % in the course , thereby totally destroying any chance you had of passing the class .
Silent Foreign Curve Destroyer can be identified by the fact that he will be in the library before you get there and stay far after you ’ve left .
He will almost certainly wear the same clothing throughout the entire course , and , while he may be human , it ’s more likely that he ’s some kind of magic robot .
THE CELLPHONE TERRORIST
The Cellphone Terrorist has the capability to disrupt classes without even being present .
They will leave their belongings in class as they go for a bathroom break when , suddenly , the sound of “ My Humps ” fills the room .
Yes , that ’s The Cellphone Terrorists new ring tone for this week and it is n’t going to stop until they return .
Those unfortunate enough to be sitting beside
The Cellphone Terrorist will hang their head in shame as piercing gazes are shot directly their way .
Upon return , The Cellphone Terrorist will usually check their missed calls and proceed to call said person back by means of a covert coat - over - the - head technique that they have perfected .
FUCKING DISGUSTING C.S. MAJOR
Fucking Disgusting Computer Science Major is the reason that you do n’t want to go to class .
He bathes roughly once every leap year and wears the same “ totally awesome ” Japanese video game ( the import version was so much better ) shirt for half a semester at a time .
No matter how far away you get from him , the stench seems to travel across the room and assault your nostrils .
Fucking Disgusting Computer Science Major has no time for the English language , and he will often ask questions that make little to no sense and lack any sort of “ grammatical structure . ”
He ’s the only character that can actually give Silent Foreign Curve Destroyer a run for his money on the intellectual scale , but that ’s only because he was probably born with knowledge of linear algebra and differential equations .
AGENDA ASSAILER
The Agenda Assailer has ( surprise ! ) an agenda to push on everyone else .
If you ’re in , say , a science class you ’ll get to hear about how the scientist who discovered some principle was a racist or misogynist and therefore his scholarly work is somehow meaningless .
Even though the rest of the class is just there to learn , the Agenda Assailer will attempt to turn every class into a political debate .
Here ’s an example from a history class : quote : Professor : Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence .
AA : How can you even SAY that ?!?!?!?!
He owned slaves !!!
Professor :
Well , yes .
But he still wrote it .
AA : Well then he ’s a hypocrite and we should THROW OUT the Declaration of Independence !!!
THE VISIBLE MINORITY
He ’s the only one in your class , sometimes he makes sure that everyone knows it .
Most of the time he ’s pretty cool tough , you just need to get to know them better .
Excels at making you feel bad about random comment you make on his people .
THE ANIME FREAK
Anime Freak is somewhat of a rarity outside of computer science and / or Japanese courses .
However , you still might encounter one in some humanities cores .
The Anime Freak will always be wearing button down shirts with a dragon or some kind of Dragonball Z character on it .
Also , anything with Japanese writing on it is always cool in the eyes of Anime Freak , even if it makes absolutely no sense .
Do not approach the Anime Freak outside of class , unless you want to run into a situation like this : quote : You :
Hey , what ’s up ?
AF : I think episode 185 of [ insert horribly obscure anime show here ] is the best because they use the Power of the Light to slay the dragon beast and save the world from total destruction !!!
You : Um … I have to go .
THE ENGINEER
One who is rarely seen without a TI - 83 Plus or higher model calculator , and actually knows how to , and does , use all the functions of said calculator .
Often makes jokes that one outside of the Engineering spectrum will not understand , or makes really horrible ones , or both .
Example : “ I ’m pretty sure it was a zero - force member … ” “ that ’s what she said . ”
Takes many science / math courses that are said to “ strongly relate to core Engineering ” and “ provide a base for higher level courses ” but in reality 99 % of skills in said classes are rarely used .
MAJOR ELITIST
No , he ’s not in the military !
Ha ha !
All blatantly bad jokes aside , the Major Elitist is generally some type of science or engineering major who looks down on anyone who might even think about getting a humanities or business degree .
After all , we all know that the only thing that ’s important is science .
All that other mamby - pansy bullshit like “ History ” or “ English ” or “ the world economy ” is just a bunch of feel - good rhetorical nonsense anyway .
Besides , any jackass can get a liberal arts degree !
NON - CONFORMIST CONFORMIST
The Non-Conformist Conformist is an interesting species .
While he tries to “ fight the man , ” he is unable to do so without conforming to another group .
The Non-Conformist Conformist can be easily identified by his Rage Against the Machine or Che Guevara t- shirt and dark green corduroy pants .
During the winter he will be wearing a military field coat from Germany with a patch on the side , and he often carries a wallet on a chain .
You can identify him in the classroom because he ’ll feel the need to share with the class his opinions of pop culture .
He ’ll use a condescending tone of voice because he ’s better than little sheep like you .
That ’s all right though because whether it be the punk , goth , or any other subculture , the Non-Conformist Conformist declares boldly , “ I choose to not fit in by fitting in with a DIFFERENT group ! ”
FASHION MONGER
Fashion Monger is on the bleeding edge of fashion !
While having some nice clothes is something everyone should invest in , Fashion Monger ’s entire wardrobe has been purchased from stores so hip that you ’ve never even heard of them .
Apparently , it ’s “ hip ” and “ with it ” to pay 500 dollars for jeans that were hand stitched by the hardworking people of Taiwan .
And , as we all know , 50 dollars for a silk - screened t- shirt is a completely reasonable price , as long as it was designed by an gay Italian man .
Yes , nothing says , “ I have too much money and not enough common sense ” quite like buying clothes with fancy designer labels that are marked up 1000 %
THE SOCIABLE SLACKER
This is the guy who went out of his way to talk to you on the first day .
Was really personable , seems like a normal , social person .
He even suggested trading phone numbers just in case you needed help .
Fast forward to the second week of class – he ’s not there .
Same goes for all the classes until right before the midterm when you get a call .
“ Hey man , what ’s up ?
How ’s it going ?
Oh yeah , I missed the last class can I borrow all your notes and photocopy them ?
Yeah , we should go grab a beer one day . ”
No show again until the final where he calls you up again asking for notes .
And that beer ?
A complete fabrication .
PARADISE LOST
Smart , sheltered kid with a childhood full of religious superstition and intimacy issues .
Finally gets into a relationship ( aka LAID ) and gets suicidal when the breakup comes a few months later .
Will either hang himself in the woods or emerge as an improved species .
Flip a coin .
CEO JUNIOR III
Born to wealth and privilege and toting an ego the size of Australia , CEO Jr. III will rarely be encountered outside of econ , business and business - related courses ( like the lower level computer sciences ) .
Much like the Fashion Monger , CJ3 is fascinated by brand names and drops them wherever possible .
However , instead of dropping “ real ” designer names , he ’ll brag about the cheap shit he bought from Abercrombie last week .
Success is what he ’s aiming for , and he ’ll probably get there , but only through his dad ’s business connections .
Like the Study Nazi , he is not particularly bright , though his particular mode of achieving good grades consists of stroking the professor ’s ego with appropriate questions and office hours schmoozing .
Like the Sociable Slacker he is unfailingly cheerful , but his cheeriness , much like everything else about him , is completely insincere .
He is astoundingly successful at getting laid for reasons which are at present unknown to science .
It ’s probably best to avoid crossing him in social circumstances since he can wield his people skills like a weapon .
THE SKIMMER
The skimmer is easy to identify .
He always sits in the back of lecture halls and is usually asleep 10 minutes into class .
It is not uncommon to hear The Skimmer brag about how much studying he did n’t do for that quiz coming up .
The Skimmer is not usually found in higher level courses .
THE SCOUT
The Scout is always in lecture before you .
Even if you show up five minutes early .
The Scout will use his backpack , notebook , textbook , or anything larger than a piece of paper to cordon off the entire front row for his or her friends , who show up five minutes after the class has already started .
THE PHANTOM
A completely unremarkable student in every way , THE PHANTOM shows up for classes , does the work , and … that ’s it .
You will never see THE PHANTOM outside of class – Existing on his sheepishness and fueled by his silence , even if you live next door to THE PHANTOM you ’ll never hear a word of him , sometimes can be combined with Fucking Disgusting Computer Science Major for a truly wholesome experience .
FORMER MILITARY SERVICEMAN
“ Well , when I was in Iraq … ” And basically media misrepresentation is the cause of virtually everything bad in society these days .
VALLEY GIRL
Women who appear to be made entirely from bronzed plastic , with lips glossy enough to successfully buff the floor of a shopping mall .
Do n’t bother remembering any of their names , as one valley girl is completely indiscernible from the next .
Often seen courting Ugly Assholes .
JOHNNY THREE LEGS
Usually an average - looking , somewhat lanky guy , Johnny Three Legs is extraordinary on one respect : his ten inch penis .
Flaccid .
How do you know ?
Well , he ’s the guy that faces towards everyone else in communal showers .
In dorms with individual showers , he dries himself off in public areas , and spends just a bit more time naked than other residents , who usually whip on a towel before they even draw the curtains open .
Pity his poor roommate , usually a lonely computer science major that is still a virgin , who is kept up awake at nights from the cries of Johnny
Three leg ’s dates – “ Ouch !
That hurts !
Ungggnmph !
Oh yeah … yes …
God … OUCH !
Let ’s try it another way …. yes … oh God … oh Jesus … OUCH ! ”
MADDEN JR .
This student ’s life revolves around sports .
He can quote sports scores , character stats , and just about anything from some obscure game last week .
Not only did he watch it , he studied it while his classmates were studying for that quiz he failed .
He usually arrives in class approximately 10 minutes late wearing his favorite sports team hat and jacket , only to talk about sports for the entire class .
Interestingly , the Madden Jr. rarely , if ever , has any athletic ability of his own , and is often obese due to a diet consisting entirely of nachos .
THE PREMED
The pre-med has a 4.0 cumulative GPA and has junior standing even though he ’s a first semester sophomore .
He ’s got a > 90 average in every class this semester , but is absolutely terrified that he ’s going to fail them all .
Can often be heard making wild assumptions about grading schemes and arguing with the TA over 0.25 point deductions on exams .
BRING ME UP , KNOCK ME DOWN
He / She is a mystery wrapped in an enigma .
One day he will roll out of bed , take an exam without studying , and beat you by two full letter grades after you spent the night studying .
However , the next day , you show him your 0.96 GPA only to find out that he is maintaining a 0.86 ( largely from the fact that he stopped attending a class because it conflicted with his favorite television program . )
He is always there to help .
Whatever jam you have yourself in , he will , with ease , find a way to pull you out .
However , he will do so with so much reluctance , he makes it sound as though Sisyphus ( look it up ) had an easy go of things .
He will passive aggressively start conversations about what a drag it is being the designated driver , only days after he drove your drunk ass home .
He is the infinite conundrum of friendship .
He is always there for you .
Unfortunately he is always there .
BABBLING IDIOT
This kid is sort of like intellectual superhero except that he ’s not really out to prove a point through questions , but rather through his personal experiences .
He is in class to spill as many anecdotes as he can possibly think of , which , for the most part , only relate to the subject at hand tangentially .
His diatribes are voiced in an overly sincere tone , which I ’m sure he believes makes his stories sound more real , true to life , and hard hitting .
Amazingly , his stories always tend to agree with the professor ’s point of view .
You can tell that he thinks he ’s truly oozing schmooze , and that he ’s also in love with his own voice .
It is unknown to me whether his stories are rambling and incoherent because he ’s trying to hear his own voice for an extended period of time , or whether he ’s just a babbling idiot .
Evidence suggests : Babbling idiot .
THE WANNA BE COMPUTER GEEK
They can be found in groups often discussing old internet fads while downloading songs and files from P2P networks .
Often annoying to the people around them .
Will shout out “ LOL INTERNETS ” at random times and you can hear some old techno songs in the background .
THE COMMENTER
Tends to occupy the center of the room for maximum visibility .
Always nods along with the professor .
Provides his / her own commentary , largely to herself , during lecture while jotting down notes .
Most commonly uttered phrases are variations of : “ Oh yeah ” , “ Exactly ” , “ Well , that ’s interesting ” .
Example : Prof. : DNA is blueprint for life .
Comm . : [ Nod ] [ Nod ]
Uh-huh .
Well , ai n’t that something
Tip : Avoid eye contact with the commentator as she / he will attempt to direct future insightful remarks in your direction .
VACATION GUY
This guy did n’t want to go to college in the first place , but did because he did n’t want to disappoint his parents and teachers by not trying .
So he picked a party school , never went to class , and treated the whole thing as a $ 40,000 , year long , spring break away from shitty middle class suburbia .
Then disappeared to a distant part of the country never to be heard from again .
THE BLONDE ASIAN TAMER
Female in a science degree who probably should n’t be .
However , due to chemicals she emits from her hair , holds sway over Silent Foreign Curve Destroyer or other male Asian students who do her beck and call .
Part hive mind , part parasite .
Identify by remarks like “ This stuff is so hard , Haji , you ’re so smart ” or “ What did you get for number 1 ? ” .
Usually a sub-species of Sally Sorority Chick
The PASSIONATE POLITICO
Whatever wing of the political bird he resides within he ’ll be damned sure to inject his angry rhetoric and sound bites into any classroom conversation regardless of topic .
Often twitchy you can spot an outburst before it happens by looking for a grimaced mouth , spasming eye , tapping foot or softly pounding fist ( because he thinks no one will notice ) , then out comes the insanity .
MR. UNCERTAINTY
Mr. Uncertainty is n’t really that bad a guy to have class with , as he ’s virtually guaranteed never to disrupt the class proceedings .
Even when the teacher asks him a question directly , he ’ll attempt to deflect it through a magical combination of stuttering , fumbling , and vague sentences that trail off in the middle .
He probably does n’t take very good notes , but he ’s there every day in hopes of making up for the fact .
He probably has at least two majors and a third concentration that he ’s considering , but it ’s all perpetually up in the air since he does n’t really know what he wants to do .
Because of this , you ’ll almost never see him in an advanced - level class , since he ’s always going back and satisfying the core requirements for a different major .
PROFESSOR CORRECTOR
This student loves to volunteer class time to correct the professors ’ menial mistakes .
Did he say 90 % instead of 85 % ?
Was he off an important date by a year ?
The Corrector will grab this opportunity immediately .
Does the textbook back up the professor ?
Well that ’s wrong too !
The whole world is filled with misinformation , and only this noble lad can spend 20 minutes setting the professor straight as everyone silently whispers “ I HATE YOU . ”
They may be a student , but they already years ahead of the class .
OBNOXIOUS CAR DRIVER
Pulling out of the parking deck at the speed limit while letting pedestrians cross will not fly while the OCD is around .
Loud tire screeching , reeving , horn honking , and blasted music must be accompanied at even the slowest street .
They will outrace and outmaneuver vans in 20 mph zones .
They will rev their engine to make sure they reach the stop sign 20 feet away fast enough .
Their car is modified to maximize every scrape , screech and scratch to it ’s highest volumes .
If it ’s not unnecessarily loud , they are not driving .
DRAMA NERD
Often found roaming ( or more often loafing ) in packs of 4 to 7 , the drama nerd is best known for not shutting the fuck up ever and oh god i mean ever regarding new musicals , old musicals , how non-theater majors are intellectually devoid of any redeeming quality , who got cast where , etc .
The drama nerd is mostly self - delusional , and if one is to ask it about it ’s past , the response often involves “ well you know I just had the WORST time in high school i mean nobody understood me there but when I got to college I just felt like a BUTTERFLY , able to finally open my creative WINGS ” and other such inane metaphors .
The Drama nerd does , somehow , get laid all the goddamn time , but only by other Drama nerds , resulting in chain - reaction mega - drama - bombs that will certainly resonate throughout the school because these losers will not shut up about how Johnny Actor face “ TOTALLY USED ME ” at high volumes in the library during finals week .
Somehow possessing both the largest and smallest reserve of self - confidence of any college student simultaneously , ladies and gentlemen : the Drama Nerd .
THE CONVERSATIONALIST
You ’ll find this one at the back of the class , and they tend to travel in herds .
She spends all semester having conversations with the people around her , that have absolutely nothing to do with the class , usually pertaining to her boyfriend , a movie she just saw , or a party she was at / plans to attend .
Completely ignorant of the people around her who are actually trying to pay attention to the lecture in a typically difficult subject .
Another common trait of The Conversationalist is her apparent lack of any sort of school supplies ( including pens , pencils , paper , and the freaking textbook )
Sociologists have theorized that this is a subconscious ploy designed to draw more people into The Conversationalist ’s tangled web of distraction .
The Conversationalist is more prevalent in community colleges or lower level classes and tends to drop classes the day before the drop date , just in time to add all of her soon to be ex-classmates to her cell phone .
THE FACULTY MEMBER
This is a student who has become very involved and uses his major as a replacement for a social life .
He may , or may not work in the department office , but you ’ll see him wandering around the office anyway , chatting up the actual faculty .
Maybe having lunch in the waiting area .
He ’s only annoying when you actually have a class with him and he takes on the role of a teaching assistant .
THE JACKASS OF ALL TRADES
This man is seemingly adept in all subjects , and will boast about it too .
Hear him complain about how easy his last Abstract Algebra exam was , how he wrote his African paper two hours before its due and how little he prepared for his sociology presentation .
His weakness is poor social skills .
Ask about his girlfriend for massive emotional baggage !
PHILOSOPHER STONER
Easily identifiable by his red eyes , incoherent speech , and the lingering stench of marijuana , the philosopher stoner may or may not be a member of NORML , and probably wo n’t go to class very often .
On the off chance that he actually attends a class , god forbid the professor mention anything related to drugs , because suddenly the philosopher stoner will turn into a walking , talking version of erowid.com .
I ’M TO IMPORTANT TO BE HERE GIRL
This girl is much too busy to do something as menial as class .
She ’s in a sorority , she ’s in the student senate and she ’s got a boyfriend on the lacrosse team .
She treats class like it ’s a bother - much like a PTA meeting .
During the entire class period , her blistered thumbs are hammering at the tiny keys on her super expensive new cell phone that Daddy ’s bought her three times because she keeps wearing it out .
Whenever the professor asks her to stop her hammering , her face curls up worse than Reese Witherspoon ’s after eating out an asshole .
DEER IN HEADLIGHT CHICK
Normally , she ’s quiet .
She ’s so quiet she ’ll duck down when the professor looks to ask questions .
The second she ’s called on to give a speech , her entire body tenses up .
Very rarely will a word escape her mouth that ’s not “ Uhhh ” or “ Like ” .
She ’s known for freezing up for periods of greater than one minute during in - class presentations , much to everyone else ’s amusement .
THE SNIPER
This is the kid , usually a male , who sits in the back of the class and will constantly spout out smart ass remarks at the professor in an attempt to act like he really does n’t really care for the class and thinks he is super cool cause he can be so disrespectful in class .
But this guy is important cause when the class starts dragging and getting boring , he can usually lighten the mood .
Annoying and funny at the same time .
THE REDNECK
This poor troglodyte managed to get into the college because he went to a backwoods school composed entirely of trailers in a swamp , where 4.0 gpas are a dime a dozen , and anyone can pass the classes practically by attending .
Unfortunately , he is probably going to fail multiple classes in a semester and drop out soon .
Unattractive , disgusting hygiene , has a taste for inferior websites , loves to hunt , sometimes wears camouflage to class , attends every athletic event , and likes to “ Git - R - Dun ” occasionally .
Nothing more than a friendly nuisance on his own , he is a very dangerous animal in the company of others exactly the same .
I STUDIED ABROAD AND IT CHANGED MY LIFE
This person has spent anywhere from 3 - 12 months in a country that is n’t too different from our own , but it ’s sooo much better .
It ’s so cultured and you can drink without having the draconian American laws over your back .
Most of this student ’s stories involve getting drunk and hooking up with a creepy older gentleman or passing out on the couch interspersed with some sightseeing .
But it changed her life , like OMG i totally know how people in other countries live and I ’ll keep talking and talking and talking about it .
QUIET SMART SLACKER
Normally found in one of the back rows but not the very back as he is trying to blend in .
Does n’t say much in class , only being social when he has to or with people he knows outside of class .
Wo n’t disrupt class but if called on will answer correctly .
Pays attention , but does n’t always do work , or work hard .
Shows up to class 80 % of the time , but does 40 % of the outside work / study time .
Graduates in 5 - 6 years with a 3.0 but only because of intelligence and test scores , not effort ( as shown in number of years taken to graduate ) .
THE ANNOYING CLONE
This is a person you meet in the class that you share the same interests and hobbies .
At first you enjoy talking and hanging out with them , but then all they do is constantly talk about the same interests and never want to talk about anything else , and every day they want to hang out after class and do something related to the point it drives you insane .
In the end you end up hating both the person , and what you enjoyed .
THE CONVERTER
This guy or gal is a shining beacon of their Religion , and will attempt to bring it to light every chance they get , and attempt to get you to believe in whatever it is they believe .
Anytime your classes mention faith , she is the first to preach to the entire class , and say that her deity is what everyone needs to follow
THE HERETIC
Exact opposite of The Converter , this person hates all forms of Religion and despises God .
Used to be devoted to a faith , but lost his or her faith through some event in the past , such as a major physical / psychological trauma .
This person loves to quote John Milton , and argue with others who believe in God .
THE COMPUTER DUMMY
Cannot use a computer or any technology to save their life .
This person will rely on you to help them type up reports , assignments , or use excel / power point / access for projects .
Will also become dazzled if they see you playing any kind of video game or watching a DVD in your dorm , and will want to learn more about it .
THE LOVE - HATER :
The guy / girl who ’s too cool for romance , and has to insult every couple that passes their way .
Whether staring , snickering , or outright making an idiotic comment , the love - hater somehow tries to be “ different ” by not looking for an opportunity to pass on their genes .
Needless to say , these types are usually at home practicing their five - knuckle shuffle .
THE “ WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THAT ” NINJA :
These people are ninjas in disguise , often lurking amongst the normal people .
They seem nice at first , but when they come to the part of the discussion of majors , the inevitable question of “ What are you going to do with that ? ” comes up .
Usually in a patronizing tone , they also carry shiruken … too bad that the weapons are so far up their a$$es that they ca n’t utilize them .
THE WANNA -BE JOCK :
The chubby idiot in the back of the classes , busy bragging about the amazing three pointer he pulled in a game with the boys .
However , if studied in its natural habitat , the Wanna - be Jock can be seen getting the only sports exposure from a video game console .
NOTE : If encountering one of these during its ritualistic video gaming , beware of celebrations .
They often involve screaming and waving when they get an extra point on Madden NFL .
THE YING - YANGER :
Found in most of the female population in college settings , the Ying - Yangers are those who , if approached by someone athletic , will swoon and bend to their every whim .
However , if approached by someone of the least bit imperfection , the Ying - Yanger will sneer in disgust … if providing a reaction at all .
THE NON - STREET GANGSTA :
Often seen wearing designer clothes , the NSG is often male .
They talk street , smoke pot , and pretend that they are the toughest thing around .
Often found hiding from real fights or blasting rap music from a dorm window in hopes to attract a mate .
THE THREAT :
Black trench coat .
Few words .
Odd knowledge about weapons .
And somehow , he always seems to sit next to you in class .
THE APATHETIC GENIUS
The apathetic genius is the pinnacle of wasted potential .
He shows up to most of his classes , and is minorly sociable .
He is involved in class discussions but will never write a single page of notes , never does any extra credit or optional assignments , and never even reads the textbook or studies .
Despite this he will consistently get A ’s and B ’s in every class he takes , all while exerting no apparent effort .
This person probably has the ability to cure cancer some day , but years of being unchallenged and socially shunned will lead him to drop out after his first or second year .
THE DUDE WHO KNOWS FUCKING EVERYONE
Everywhere you go , this guy knows somebody he has to high five and chat with for a little bit .
He probably grew up in the area , has an outgoing personality , and is involved in a wide variety of activities that breach many social circles .
Generally liked , although he may be too outgoing for some people .
Generally does n’t have a lot of close friends , but makes up for it in sheer volume .
This is the guy to talk to if you ’re interested in a new hobby , want to join a club , or just want to meet new people .
May do incredibly outrageous things to get even more attention .
THE R.A .
The R.A. lives to fuck up your social life .
Lurking behind every dark shadow ;
The R.A. springs to action and stomps out any signs of fun , ranging from a friendly game of Bingo to a raging smörgåsbord orgy .
This guy , often hated by many feels because he is getting free housing owes it to his said college to annoy all with his passive –aggressive confrontational vendetta against all on campus students .
All that is missing is a whistle , and a safety badge .
Often useless , The R.A. does come in handy when the PHILOSOPHER STONER , JOHNNY FRAT BOY – or – SALLY SORORITY CHICK locks themselves out at 4am .
MAN - HATING FEMINIST
Usually found in Women ’s Studies or English classes .
They find enjoyment in discussing how the standard of beauty is too high and how the opposite sex has taken over the world .
They also tend to wear clothing that shows off cleavage in order to show that they are comfortable with their bodies .
They tend to be loud in class discussions and easily annoyed by male classmates .
Almost every conversation turns into a discussion of how men are degrading women .
I- PLACED-INTO-HIGHER-LEVEL-CLASSES-YOU-SHOULD-THINK-I’M-THE-SHIT-CAUSE-I-DO!
This individual is a Freshman , who managed to get placed into upper level courses .
Because of this , he will establish a heightened feeling of self - worth , and will consider himself to be a worthy equal to the majors in said department .
Will bring up the fact that they are a FRESHMAN at every opportunity , and will become confounded when the upperclassmen in the same major are n’t fawning over him or trying to suck his cock out of amazement at how awesome he must be , because he ’s taking upper level classes , but he ’s merely a FRESHMAN .
Will most likely be despised by all other majors of the department , but will remain oblivious to this fact and try to strike up pointless conversation , mostly focusing on how they are a FRESHMAN TAKING THE SAME CLASS AS YOU .
If it is a language course , they will try to chat in that language , regardless of the fact that you wo n’t understand what - the - fuck .
Not because they ’re better than you , but in their pretentious righteousness , they do n’t realize they completely suck at it .
THE SILENT , STRAIGHT -LACED GEM
This girl is rather shy , quite studious , probably pretty conservative , and usually somewhat attractive in a sort of clean , traditional , classic way .
Sometimes , her quietness or straight face may be misinterpreted as indifference or the “ get away from me ” look , but once you get to know her , she is actually quite nice and makes a decent friend .
She does n’t drink or smoke – not because she ’s a “ goody two - shoes ” , but because she genuinely has no desire to .
This girl may end up a loner if she ’s not careful – spending countless hours locked away in her dorm room , reading , or ( if she pushes herself a little ) can be found actually socializing .
Gets along with most people , has a decent social circle , but holds just a few close friends .
May need a little push to get involved in activities .
Makes a reliable friend .
Is a hard worker , but can enjoy having fun too .
THE SKATER
Usually listens to “ emo ” music and wears nothing but skate brands , sagging jeans with a belt and t- shirt ( sometimes a hoodie and a beanie ) .
The skater is rarely seen without skateboard in hand .
He is not particularly bright , nor does he say much .
These types when not skateboarding through campus by themselves travel in pacts .
THE WANNABE
This type pretends to know everything about a few subjects and will attempt to impress you with their extensive knowledge on said subject .
Often times someone who actually knows what they are talking about will correct the wannabe , however the wannabe will argue his or her side until someone presents them with hard evidence that they were actually wrong .
The wannabe will change their personality according to who they are with .
No one knows what the wannabe is actually like because he / she is always changing .
THE INDIE KID
The indie kid is the guy / girl who wear nothing but vintage cloths purchase from thrift stores and listens to music by bands that nobody has ever heard of .
Indie kids stick together , always involved in some sort of “ intellectual ” conversation about a worldly event ( past or present ) that everybody is not talking about .
Often times the indie kid will go out of his or her way to mention something obscure to give themselves “ indie cred ” .
THE EDUCATION MAJOR
As a freshman , the education major parties excessively , because he or she knows in subsequent years , they wo n’t be able to have any more late nights out due to having to go to field experience at a local school .
The education major finds themselves wishing they could sign up for an 8 AM class because it feels like sleeping in when he or she compares it to waking up for field or student teaching at 5:30 in the morning .
If John McCain wins the Republican presidential nomination , it seems to me that the Democrats have only to show the American people this clip :
That alone would be enough to blow the USS McCain out of the water .
What with polls showing [ . pdf ] that most voters want us out by the end of 2008 , McCain has set the GOP up for a very big fall .
Aside from the unpopularity of such a view , however , let ’s examine McCain ’s argument on its merits .
After all , we ’re in Korea , Europe , and elsewhere , and have been since the end of World War II .
What ’s wrong with establishing and maintaining a semi- permanent presence in our latest conquered province ?
In short , what ’s wrong with having an empire ?
The main objection is that such a ubiquitous global presence would have to mean constant warfare .
Empires , once acquired , must be defended , and surely the current worldwide Islamic insurgency that has declared war on us would be provided with plenty of targets , lots of opportunities for mischief , and more than enough encouragement and support from nationalist elements whose resentment of American hegemony over their lands would swell the ranks of our enemies .
Iraq did n’t have a trace of al - Qaeda ’s presence prior to the U.S. invasion ; today , it is ensconced in that unhappy land .
Fifty , one hundred , a thousand years of American occupation will not eliminate that kind of resistance : it ’s as natural as the reaction of antibodies to the invasion of a foreign virus .
Second , the occupation of Iraq , by itself , is not sufficient to defend our newly acquired province , since the entire region opposes our presence and forces from neighboring countries pose a threat .
Therefore , it ’s not surprising that we have targeted Syria and are currently engaged in a propaganda war and a low - level campaign of harassment aimed at the mullahs of Tehran .
You ca n’t just invade a country in the middle of Mesopotamia , plonk down some 150,000 American troops , and wait out the resistance for the next century or so : wars do n’t respect national boundaries , and the guerrillas we are fighting are not about to stay put .
" Hot pursuit " of Iraq resistance fighters , of whichever faction , will necessarily involve crossing those boundaries and eliminating their " terrorist havens . "
This means expanding the war until the battlefield eventually encompasses a great deal of the region .
In addition to these strictly military problems , there are a host of political problems that come with the occupation .
While the " surge " has supposedly calmed the waters sufficiently to give Iraqis the kind of breathing space required to bring about a political settlement and stave off an incipient Shi’ite - Sunni civil war , Iraqi ’s political leaders have not stepped up to the plate  nor is there any incentive for them to do so .
As long as American troops remain on Iraqi soil as the guarantors of the present regime , the Shi’ites have no reason to reach any sort of accommodation with minority religious and ethnic groups .
In spite of all our attempts to influence , pressure , and  when it comes down to it  bully the Iraqi government , the bottom line is that American troops are n’t leaving any time soon , and the Iraqis know it .
We have no leverage , and that means a static political situation with hardly any prospects of improvement .
Which brings us to our main point : when the U.S. invaded Iraq , smashed the Ba’athist state , and established itself as the de facto colonial ruler of the country , we exposed the underlying reality of a Seinfeldian " state " that was and is based on nothing .
" Iraq " has no real historical existence or legitimacy , except as a province of first the Ottoman and then the British empire .
Under Saddam Hussein , it was held together by state terror and the Ba’athist secret police : in the late Iraqi dictator ’s absence , the country has , unsurprisingly , fallen to pieces .
Like Humpty Dumpty , it can not be put back together again , and this is the real reason for the failure to reach a postwar political settlement .
The political turmoil unleashed by the invasion is not , unfortunately , limited to Iraq : as I have pointed out on numerous occasions , the breakup of the Iraqi state has unleashed a virulent strain of Kurdish nationalism .
This has impacted every other nation in the region , notably Turkey , which has sent its warplanes in answer .
Worse , the implosion of the Iraqi state has given the Iranians the advantage in a regional game of " who ’s - the - hegemon , " giving rise to what the policy wonks are calling the " Shi’ite crescent " and stoking the fires of religious sectarianism .
Iraq ’s civil war could easily become a regional cataclysm .
These objections apply not just to Iraq , but to almost any country that we invade , occupy , and reign over .
Aggression breeds resistance , and the resistance fighters have an inherent advantage in that we ’re on their turf .
They will never stop fighting until and unless we leave .
John McCain may be looking forward to the prospect of a new Hundred Years ’
War , but I find it hard to believe that anyone else in America is .
All of these objections to occupying and administering a foreign country are , by themselves , sufficient reason to oppose the imperial project so beloved by our governing elites .
However , for libertarians  and for those liberals and conservatives who want to preserve our republican form of government  the internal consequences of a quest for empire are particularly heinous .
To begin with , the economic consequences of interventionism make such a policy prohibitive .
The United States , which is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy , simply cannot afford the luxury of imperialism .
When all is said and done , the cost of our Iraq misadventure will approach some $ 2 trillion  to say nothing of what a century of occupation would cost us .
It boggles the mind .
And that ’s just the direct cost .
Indirectly , the price of global hegemony is a lot higher .
For the creation of an American empire on which the sun never sets would necessitate a huge diversion of wealth and human resources away from productive use and toward military and other government expenditures .
The distortion of the American economy that would result would put wealth in the hands of those with government contracts  and good government contacts  and political pull would replace entrepreneurial know - how as the coin of the realm .
Furthermore , the diversion of all these resources into essentially unproductive  i.e. , governmental  uses would create a whole new class of tax - eaters whose claim to subsidies is founded on the maintenance and expansion of America ’s newfound imperial domain .
Right now , the numbers of these colonial administrators and commercial outfits  geared to providing " services " such as policing the natives and pandering to the needs of troops and government officials stationed overseas  is limited , but it is growing by the day .
It wo n’t be long before they begin organizing politically , and acting like any other interest group that concerns itself chiefly with increasing its " fair share " of U.S. tax dollars .
In addition , this rising class of soldier - administrators will be constantly agitating for a more belligerent foreign policy in the name of " defending " the Empire  while always looking for new opportunities to expand the frontiers .
Imagine an overseas version of the American Federation of State , County , and Municipal Employees , but with a Washington lobbying operation much more active in the foreign policy field .
I shudder to think of it .
The worst aspect of all this is that once the process of what might be called " imperialization "  for lack of a better word  is allowed to proceed unchecked and unchallenged , it builds political and social momentum until it is practically unstoppable .
Calls for increasing the huge pool of resources available to the empire - builders become more frequent and more irresistible , and the transition from republic to empire is made all but inevitable as large sections of the population become economically dependent on military - related industries whose profitability rests on the defense of America ’s overseas protectorates .
The militarization of the American economy means we get socialism through the back door , as government planners , not entrepreneurs , increasingly determine the allocation of scarce resources .
In this case , however , the real rulers of the coming American dystopia wo n’t be ensconced in the Bureau of Economic Planning  instead , they ’ll be issuing edicts from their offices in the National Security Council , the State Department , and the Pentagon .
On top of it all , the growth of presidential power  epitomized in the openly authoritarian legal " theories " of the current administration , which give the White House something very close [ . pdf ] to absolute power in wartime  is greatly accelerated by imperialization .
Indeed , this has been the main engine of the growing imbalance of power between the three branches of the federal government .
They do n’t call it the " imperial presidency " for nothing .
Every empire must have an emperor or empress .
The rise of American imperialism parallels the growing importance of dynastic politics in America , among the more worrying signs that our old republic is on the way out .
A hundred - year occupation of Iraq : John McCain wants to know " What ’s wrong with that ? "
God willing , the American people will tell him .
AUSTIN ( AP ) 
The state 's director of science curriculum said she resigned this month under pressure from officials who felt she gave the appearance of criticizing the instruction of intelligent design .
The Texas Education Agency put Chris Comer on 30 days paid administrative leave in late October , resulting in what she described as a forced resignation .
The move came shortly after Comer forwarded an e-mail announcing a presentation being given by the author of Inside Creationism 's Trojan Horse .
In the book , author Barbara Forrest says creationist politics are behind the movement to get intelligent design theory taught in public schools .
Comer sent the e-mail to several individuals and a few online communities .
Comer , who held her position for nine years , said she believes evolution politics were behind her ousting .
" None of the other reasons they gave are , in and of themselves , firing offenses , " she said .
TEA officials declined to comment Wednesday on the personnel matter , but they explained their recommendation to fire Comer in documents obtained by the Austin American - Statesman through the Texas Public Information Act .
" Ms. Comer 's e-mail implies endorsement of the speaker and implies that TEA endorses the speaker 's position on a subject on which the agency must remain neutral , " the officials said .
Next year , the State Board of Education begins a review of the state science curriculum , which will set standards for classroom instruction and textbook selection .
The TEA documents show agency officials recommended firing Comer for repeated acts of misconduct and insubordination .
The officials said forwarding the e-mail conflicted with Comer 's job responsibilities .
The e-mail also violated a directive for her not to communicate with anyone outside the agency regarding the upcoming science curriculum review , officials said in the documents .
The memo condemns Comer for giving a presentation and attending an off - site meeting without prior approval and for allegedly saying that then - acting Commissioner Robert Scott was " only acting commissioner and that there was no real leadership at the agency . "
Comer said she does n't remember saying the comments about Scott , who has since been appointed commissioner .
" But even if I did , is that so horrible ? " she said .
" He was , after all , acting commissioner at the time . "
She also said other employees do n't report off - site activities .
Comer said she paused for a moment before forwarding the Forrest e-mail , but she felt sending it was OK because of Forrest 's credentials .
The documents show that Lizzette Reynolds , the agency 's senior adviser on statewide initiatives , started the push to fire Comer over the e-mail .
" This is something that the State Board , the Governor 's Office and members of the Legislature would be extremely upset to see because it assumes this is a subject that the agency supports , " Reynolds said in an e-mail to Comer 's supervisors .
Reynolds joined the agency in January and previously worked in the U.S. Department of Education and as a deputy legislative director during George W. Bush 's term as governor .
Advocacy groups said the action against Comer was troubling .
" This just underscores the politicization of science education in Texas , " said Eugenie Scott , executive director of the National Center for Science Education .
" In most states , the department of education takes a leadership role in fostering sound science education .
Apparently TEA employees are supposed to be kept in the closet and only let out to do the bidding of the board . "

Oil is ' the bloodstain of the earth 's economy ' and will soon trigger a global conflict that will cost millions of lives .
That is the stark claim of a controversial new film , which says a crash in oil production is about to set off worldwide recession and economic collapse .
A Crude Awakening : The Oil Crash , which opens in UK cinemas this week , shows stark images of rusting Texan and Venezuelan wells and fuel riots in Asia and Africa .
Such scenes will be repeated thousands of times around the planet in the near future , argue the film 's makers , who say the world is facing changes ' more frightening than a horror movie ' .
The film is the latest of several polemical documentaries to achieve nationwide release .
Others include Al Gore 's An Inconvenient Truth , Michael Moore 's Sicko , and the forthcoming Darfur Now , in which Don Cheadle provides a voice - over about the Sudanese civil war .
However , A Crude Awakening has had a boost not available to the rest .
Just as its screenings were scheduled to begin here , crude oil prices soared to their highest level for decades , reaching $ 96 a barrel last week .
Petrol and diesel at more than £ 1 a litre at UK garages is now common .
' This is a bleak and very worrying topic , but we have tried very hard to make it entertaining and exciting , ' said Basil Gelpke , who - with Ray McCormack - wrote , directed and produced the film .
And to judge by film festival screenings , they may have succeeded .
A Crude Awakening has won prizes at the Zurich and Palm Beach festivals .
It is a dramatic depiction of the arguments of economists and geologists who say that the day of ' peak oil ' has either occurred or is imminent .
Peak oil is defined as the time when the world produces its maximum output of oil and enters a period when prices start to soar as demand rises - thanks in part to the industrialisation of China and India - while supplies dwindle .
The US Energy Information Administration said recently it believed production had peaked last year .
Others say it has not yet occurred but is imminent , a point backed by geologist Professor Stuart Haszeldine , of Edinburgh University .
' If we have not reached peak oil already , then I am sure it will be upon us within the next two years . '
In the North Sea , oil production has been declining for years , America reached its maximum output decades ago , and in other parts of the world stocks of easily accessible oil are slowly being used up .
' We have reached the peak of oil production , the question is : how steep is the slope downwards on the other side , ' said Matt Simmons , author of Twilight in the Desert : The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy
Oil companies say that there are still major reserves to be exploited .
In particular , Arctic and Antarctic fields - which are being freed of ice and snow as the world heats up - are being sized up for their reserve potential .
In Burma , protests over rising fuel prices led to a crackdown by the country 's military authorities while in China , where there have been critical fuel shortages recently , one man was shot for trying to jump a petrol queue .
Such events are destined to become the norm across the planet , it is argued .
As prices soar and production falters , the world will hurtle into a future of pitched battles over dwindling oil supplies .
' It is not just the threat to transport , ' added David Strahan , author of The Last Oil Shock .
' All across Asia , particularly in India and Bangladesh , farmers use diesel generators to pump water in and out of their fields .
If oil prices soar , they will not be able to afford to irrigate their crops .
The result could be starvation and food riots . '
In addition , crude oil is a basic necessity in the manufacture of materials such as asphalt and plastic .
The construction of a desktop computer consumes 10 times its weight in fossil fuels , for example .
Without cheap oil , such products will no longer be affordable .
It is an alarming scenario , although a note of caution was sounded by John Loughhead , director of the UK Energy Research Centre .
' It is true that we may very soon run out of oil from accessible sources , but there are many other types of fuel that we could exploit , ' he said .
At present , energy companies exploit a field only if they think they can get oil out of the ground at a cost of less than $ 18 a barrel .
This is a very conservative estimate , given current prices .
At present oil is being sold at over $ 90 a barrel .
' If , in future , companies use a more realistic figure of $ 40 a barrel instead of $ 18 , that would make many , many more reserves suddenly become economical - the oil tar fields of Alaska , deep water reservoirs , and others , ' Loughhead said .
' The trouble is that it is very difficult to estimate future oil prices .
Ten years ago they stood at around $ 10 a barrel .
Now they are almost 10 times that .
Certainly , I doubt oil will be cheaper than $ 40 a barrel again , so that means many more fields which once seemed uneconomical will become better bets for exploitation . '
Loughhead said oil was just a small part of the range of hydrocarbons found in the ground .
' It is becoming easier and easier to turn substances like coal and gas into liquid form and use that as a substitute for oil , so fuels based on hydrocarbons will still be with us in some form for a few decades yet , ' he said .
Fuel figures
· The United States has 2 per cent of the world 's oil reserves and consumes 25 per cent of its annual production .
· 98 per cent of all energy used for road , rail , ocean and aviation transport is provided by oil products .
· A barrel of oil is 42 US gallons , or 34.97 British gallons or 159 litres .
· It is thought there are between 1,000 and 2,000 billion barrels of oil left in the planet 's reserves .
The world produces 75 million barrels a day .
· It would take a man working for 25,000 hours to generate the same amount of energy that is stored in one barrelful of oil .
· This article was amended on November 11 2007 .
Daily global oil production is 75 million barrels a day , not 750,000 as we stated in the article above .
This has been corrected .
Understanding the Bush Doctrine
Noam Chomsky
Information Clearing House , October 2 , 2004
Perhaps the most most threatening document of our time is the U.S. National Security Strategy of September 2002 .
Its implementation in Iraq has already taken countless lives and shaken the international system to the core .
In the fallout from the war on terror is a revived Cold War , with more nuclear players than ever , across even more dry - tinder landscapes around the world .
As Colin Powell explained , the NSS declared that Washington has a “ sovereign right to use force to defend ourselves ” from nations that possess weapons of mass destruction and cooperate with terrorists , the official pretexts for invading Iraq .
The obvious reason for invading Iraq is still conspicuously evaded : establishing the first secure US military bases in a client state at the heart of the world ’s major energy resources .
As old pretexts collapsed , President Bush and his colleagues adaptively revised the doctrine of the NSS to enable them to resort to force even if a country does not have WMD or programmes to develop them .
The “ intent and ability ” to do so is sufficient .
Just about every country has the ability , and intent is in the eye of the beholder .
The official doctrine , then , is that anyone is subject to attack .
In September 2003 , Bush assured Americans that “ the world is safer today because our coalition ended an Iraqi regime that cultivated ties to terror while it built weapons of mass destruction . ”
The president ’s handlers know that lies can become Truth , if repeated insistently enough .
The war in Iraq incited terror worldwide .
In November 2003 , Middle East expert Fawaz Gerges found it “ simply unbelievable how the war has revived the appeal of a global jihadi Islam that was in real decline after 9 - 11 . ”
Iraq itself became a “ terrorist haven ” for the first time , and suffered its first suicide attacks since the 13th century CK assassins .
Recruitment for Al Qaeda networks has risen .
“ Every use of force is another small victory for bin Laden , ” who “ is winning , ” writes British journalist Jason Burke in Al - Qaida , his 2003 study of this loose array of radical Islamists , now mostly independent .
For them , bin Laden is hardly more than a symbol .
He may be even more dangerous after he is killed , becoming a martyr who will inspire others to join his cause .
Burke sees the creation of “ a whole new cadre of terrorists , ” enlisted in what they see as a “ cosmic struggle between good and evil , ” a vision shared by bin Laden and Bush .
The proper reaction to terrorism is two - pronged : directed at the terrorists themselves , and at the reservoir of potential support .
The terrorists see themselves as a vanguard , seeking to mobilise others .
Police work , an appropriate response , has been successful worldwide .
More important is the broad constituency that the terrorists seek to reach , including many who hate and fear them but nevertheless see them as fighting for a just cause .
We can help the terrorist vanguard mobilise this reservoir of support , by violence .
Or we can address the “ myriad grievances , ” many legitimate , that are “ the root causes of modern Islamic militancy , ” Burke writes .
That basic effort can significantly reduce the threat of terror , and should be undertaken independently of this goal .
Violent actions provoke reactions that risk catastrophe .
US analysts estimate that Russian military expenditures have tripled during the Bush - Putin years , in large measure a predicted response to Bush administration bellicosity .
On both sides , nuclear warheads remain on hair - trigger alert .
The Russian control systems , however , have deteriorated .
The dangers ratchet up with the threat and use of force .
As anticipated , US military plans have provoked a Chinese reaction as well .
China has announced plans to “ transform its military into a technology - driven force capable of projecting power globally by 2010 , ” Boston Globe correspondent Jehangir Pocha reported last month , “ replacing its land - based nuclear arsenal of about 20 1970s - era intercontinental ballistic missiles with 60 new multiple - warhead missiles capable of reaching the United States . ”
China ’s actions are likely to touch off a ripple effect through India , Pakistan and beyond .
Nuclear developments in Iran and North Korea , also in part at least a response to US threats , are exceedingly ominous .
The unthinkable becomes thinkable .
In 2003 , at the UN General Assembly , the United States voted alone against implementation of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and alone with its new ally India against steps toward the elimination of nuclear weapons .
The United States also voted alone against “ observance of environmental norms ” in disarmament and arms control agreements , and alone with Israel and Micronesia against steps to prevent nuclear proliferation in the Middle East — the pretext for invading Iraq .
Presidents commonly have “ doctrines , ” but Bush II is the first to have “ visions ” as well , possibly because his handlers recall the criticism of his father as lacking “ the vision thing . ”
The most exalted of these , conjured up after all pretexts for invasion of Iraq had to be abandoned , was the vision of bringing democracy to Iraq and the Middle East .
By November 2003 , this vision was taken to be the real motive for the war .
The evidence for faith in the vision consists of little more than declarations of virtuous intent .
To take the declarations seriously , we would have to assume that our leaders are accomplished liars :
While mobilising their countries for war , they were declaring that the reasons were entirely different .
Mere sanity dictates scepticism about what they produce to replace pretexts that have collapsed .
Kennan ’s insight was that a long - term , complex struggle was n’t best judged in terms of winning or losing .
Communism was n’t something we could immediately conquer .
The same holds true for Al Qaeda , a movement that , like Soviet communism , offers its subjects oppression and poverty .
Time is on our side — particularly if we act in a way that does n’t inflame our enemies ’ pride and anger and win them new recruits .
Kennan ’s insistence on a political strategy , rather than a military one , makes more sense now than it did when he published his essay .
Applied today , that advice would entail spending more time and money building up our Muslim allies .
The Center for Strategic and International Studies reports that only about $ 900 million of the $ 10 billion we ’ve given Pakistan since 2002 has gone to health , education and democracy promotion .
Most of the rest has gone to the military .
The Bush administration has recently taken steps to change this ratio .
But Kennan , one of the authors of the Marshall Plan , would have wanted the numbers to be closer to the reverse .
A 21st - century rendering of X’s vision of containment would involve the closing of the Guantánamo Bay detention camp , an unambiguous renunciation of torture and an abandonment of the notion that our legal and moral norms do n’t apply to the current struggle .
Kennan believed we gave our opponents a propaganda victory each time we acted in a manner unfitting of our ideals .
“ To avoid destruction , ” Kennan concluded the X article , “ the United States need only measure up to its own best traditions and prove itself worthy of preservation as a great nation . ”
We ca n’t know for sure how his recommended , wholly political version of containment would have fared in the cold war .
But we do know that a militant foreign policy did n’t lead to nuclear war and did , eventually , help bring about the collapse of Soviet communism .
We also know that a strong offensive policy has yet to succeed against Al Qaeda .
Kennan died two years ago at the age of 101 .
One of his last public statements was a critique , in 2002 , of the looming Iraq invasion .
War , he said , was too unpredictable , and this one was n’t worth it .
As he wrote to Lippmann six decades ago , “ Let us find health and vigor and hope , and the diseased portion of the earth will fall behind of its own doing .
For that we need no aggressive strategic plans , no provocation of military hostilities , no showdowns . ”
In the mid-1990s the U.S. embarked on a new strategy for exploring the Red Planet .
In response to the 1993 failure of the Mars Observer mission — a billion - dollar , decade - in - the - making probe that mysteriously lost contact with ground controllers just before it was scheduled to go into orbit around the planet — NASA administrator Daniel Goldin decided to shift to smaller , less expensive spacecraft and create a sustained exploration campaign by sending one or two probes to Mars at every launch opportunity .
( These opportunities come every two years or so , when Earth and Mars are properly aligned . )
The new strategy spread out the inherent risk of interplanetary travel and ensured that the engineering experience and scientific data acquired by one mission could be rapidly used by the next .
The approach has proved a brilliant success , putting three NASA spacecraft into orbit around Mars and three rovers on the planet ’s surface ( Pathfinder , Spirit and Opportunity ) .
The Phoenix Mars Lander , which left Earth in August , is expected to reach the Red Planet next May , and NASA plans to launch the Mars Science Lab in 2009 .
Subsequent missions are in jeopardy , however .
Alan Stern , associate administrator for NASA ’s Science Mission Directorate , warned in July that at least one of the future Mars probes may have to be scrapped to free up funding for a much costlier mission , tentatively scheduled for the 2018 – 2020 period , that would collect samples of Martian rock and bring them to Earth .
Moreover , highly placed scientists and program leaders report that the new plan may actually require the sacrifice of all other Mars spacecraft after 2009 .
Putting aside the question of whether the redirected funds would actually be devoted to the Mars Sample Return ( MSR ) mission , such a reorganization would be a very bad idea .
A one - shot mission to bring Martian rocks to Earth for laboratory analysis is not really a good way to address the central question of Mars science .
The Red Planet is a critical test bed for the hypothesis that life is likely to arise wherever the appropriate physical conditions — notably , the presence of liquid water — prevail on a planet for a sufficiently long time .
Scientists now know that Mars probably had standing bodies of water on its surface between three billion and four billion years ago , when there was already plentiful microbial life on Earth .
Because asteroid and comet impacts facilitate the transfer of rocks between Mars and Earth , the discovery of microfossils on the Martian surface would not in itself prove that life arose independently on Mars .
To settle the question , researchers would need to find living organisms on the planet and examine their biochemistry .
These organisms , if they exist , are most likely to be found in groundwater .
Thus , the most important goal of the exploration program is to identify sites on Mars where groundwater is within practical drilling distance of the surface .
This task can best be done not with an MSR mission but with a comprehensive scouting program involving orbiters , rovers , drillers and robotic aircraft with ground - penetrating radar .
Furthermore , even if one concedes considerable importance to the MSR mission , it is doubtful whether the reorganization plan is the right way to get there .
If NASA halts its Mars exploration for a decade , all the best people will leave the team and be replaced by those who enjoy drawing charts and schedules .
Instead of wrecking the current Mars program and hoping for the best , the space agency should build on it .
New orbital spacecraft and aircraft should extend the reconnaissance of the Red Planet and identify sites containing potential fossils and near - surface groundwater .
With such discoveries building well - justified public interest , NASA will be able to ask for extra funding to add an MSR mission to the queue .
While the space agency is preparing the mission , it can send rovers and drillers to the most promising sites and cache samples that could reveal the truth about life on Mars .
In addition to providing major scientific discoveries , such a mission might well give NASA the boost it needs to send human explorers to the Red Planet .
The Mars exploration program is one of the brightest jewels in the crown of American science ; indeed , it represents one of the great cultural accomplishments of contemporary human civilization .
It should not be discarded lightly .
Rather than breaking from it , we should build on it .
That is the way to Mars .
Over the course of the 20th Century , doctors waged war against infectious bacterial illness with the best new weapon they had : antibiotics .
But the emergence of dangerous , multi-drug resistant strains of tuberculosis and other killer infections means that in the 21st century antibiotics are losing ground against bacterial disease .
Now , researchers from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City say exciting new molecular targets — so - called " virulence factors " that bacteria use to thrive once they are in the host — present an alternative , potent means of stopping TB , leprosy and other bacterial illness .
" We have developed the first inhibitor of a key small molecule from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae ( which causes leprosy ) utilized to subvert human host 's defenses and damage and invade human host 's cells during infection , " explains study senior author Dr. Luis Quadri , Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Weill Cornell .
" With this work , we now have proof of principle for the inhibition of this virulence factor in bacteria cultured in the lab .
Our next step is to explore whether this inhibitor can stop these pathogens from multiplying in a mouse host , curtailing infection , " Dr. Quadri says .
Dr. Quadri has called this a " paradigm shift " in infectious disease research .
"
We are moving beyond antimicrobials such as antibiotics , which kill the bacterium directly , to anti-infectives , that may have no effect against the pathogen in the test tube but which do compromise its ability to infect and spread in the host , " he explains .
" We believe that the expansion of the drug armamentarium to include such anti-infective drugs could help the fight against multi- drug resistant infection that has become such a challenge today . "
According to World Health Organization data , TB remains one of the world 's top - ten leading causes of death , killing nearly two million people each year .
Multi - drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis — as well as even more dangerous , extensive - drug - resistant ( XDR ) strains of the bug — are emerging each year .

" Obviously , we are going to require more than the traditional antimicrobial approach to turn this situation around , " Dr. Quadri says .
In this study , Dr. Quadri , along with co-lead researchers Drs. Julian Ferraras and Karen Stirrett , focused on particular small - molecule virulence factors called phenolic glycolipids ( PGLs ) .
Various strains of M. tuberculosis use PGLs to weaken our body defenses whereas M. leprae uses PGLs to damage and invade our nerve cells during infection .
" Therefore , we hypothesize that drugs blocking PGL synthesis would reduce the adaptive fitness of PGL - producing M. tuberculosis strains in the human host by eliminating PGL - dependent immunomodulatory effects .
These drugs may also diminish the ability of M. leprae to invade nerve cells and produce nerve function impairment , " Dr. Quadri explains .
In complex work in the laboratory , the researchers investigated and then elucidated a crucial , early step in PGL biosynthesis .
They also pinpointed a key enzyme , called FadD22 , that is essential to that stage of the process .
advertisement
" Based on that , we collaborated with Dr. Derek Tan 's lab at Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center to synthesize a molecule that targets FadD22 and successfully inhibits that early step in PGL production , " Dr. Quadri said .
Follow - up work using both enzyme assays and M. tuberculosis assays confirmed that the new inhibitor does block the production of PGLs .
Although it was technically not possible to test the inhibitor in M. leprae , that pathogen is very closely related to M. tuberculosis , so the researchers believe their agent would inhibit production of PGLs there , as well .
Work is already underway to come up with other , even more potent PGL biosynthesis inhibitors , Dr. Quadri says , with an eye to testing the best candidates in an animal model .
" We are not saying that anti-infectives will ever replace antibiotics , but with pathogens as deadly as M. tuberculosis or as debilitating as M. leprae , you 'd ideally like to have as many pharmaceutical weapons in your armamentarium as you can , to use either alone or in combination , " Dr. Quadri says .
The new discoveries are highly encouraging , he adds .
" I believe that drugs targeting virulence factors are just one component of the paradigm shift in the antimicrobial drug discovery for the 21st century — one that will offer patients more options in the fight against truly global killers , " he says .
The findings are published online in Chemistry and Biology and will be appearing in the journal 's Jan. 26 print edition .

With recession looming or already here , the time has arrived for finding scapegoats .
Expect a long list of these .
Here is the target of the day : tightfisted consumers .
A decline in personal consumption , writes the New York Times , " would be the first since 1991 , and it would almost certainly push the entire economy into a recession in the middle of an election year . "
This recalls Bush 's advice after 9 - 11 , when he assumed the mantle of the nation 's personal financial planner .
He told everyone to go out and spend money so the economy could avoid recession .
Even then , there was confusion about whether he was right or wrong .
Some sensible voices pointed out that economic expansion is based not on spending but on capital expansion rooted in savings .
That is to say , the only path to future prosperity is delaying current consumption in favor of future investment .
One only needs to think of the household budget here to see the point .
If you are planning for the future for your family , what is the wisest course ?
Does one go into debt as much as possible , buy the largest house and the biggest car , throw lavish parties , hand out all existing liquid funds to friends and strangers ?
Based on the view that consumption is the way to avoid economic problems , this would indeed be the right course .
But this also defies everything we know about family finance .
The path to a secure prosperity is delaying consumption .
One should spend as little as possible and save as much as possible for the future , and let that money be used in the service of investments that yield a solid rate of return .
Those who have chosen a different path now see the folly : they are being burned in the soft housing market , for example .
The lesson is also true for the nation at large , because the logic does n't magically change when moving from the family budget to the national stage .
Just because something involves " macroeconomics " does n't mean that we should throw out all good sense .
But that is precisely what people have done with regard to the economy , since J.M. Keynes somehow convinced the world that up is down and left is right .
In a recession or a crisis , the right approach for individuals is to save .
So too for the national economy .
A looming recession will prompt a pullback in consumer spending as a rational response to the perception of economic troubles .
This action does not cause the economy to fall into recession any more than more spending can save it from recession .
The downturn is a fact that can not be avoided .
We do n't blame umbrellas for floods , and , in the same way , we should n't blame tightfisted consumers for recessions .
There is no question that this is what is happening .
American Express reports that the rate of spending by its cardholders fell 4 % in December .
Surveys of consumer satisfaction with the economy report a 15 - year low .
Retailers report that December was a " blood bath " ( NYT 's words ) for them , with sales growing at the slowest rate in seven years .
Market watchers are mostly concerned that high - income buyers are bailing out .
Again , it is critical to keep cause and effect in mind .
The pullback on spending is not going to cause a recession .
If we think about the long term , this is not a dangerous trend but a hopeful one .
The more people pull back and save , the more the foundation is laid for a recovery after the current correction takes its course .
To see that requires that we take a long view .
Government , however , seems constitutionally incapable of seeing the long term , much less doing the right thing to prepare for it .
Making matters worse , this is that dreaded event called an election year .
Prettying things up to make the economy palatable to voters is priority number one .
What does this mean ?
More monetary expansion .
More government spending .
We can fully expect the Bush administration to resort to its old program of sending checks out to every American family with the proviso that the money has to be spent , not saved .
No doubt that many people would be thrilled by this .
But look beneath the surface .
Government has no money to spend on anything that it does n't extract from the pockets of you and me and the whole American public .
This is easy enough to see concerning taxes .
It is not so easy to see when the government runs up debt that is guaranteed by the printing presses .
The monetary issue can be understood by analogy to orange juice .
The more water you add , the less substance it has .
If you keep adding , eventually you come to the point when you can no longer tell that it was ever orange .
This is the same with money .
If you print enough — literally or electronically through the credit markets — it will continue to lose value .
If money grew on trees , it would be about as valuable as autumn leaves .
So long as we have a central bank , government will be tempted to take the easy path of easy money .
There do not need to be any secret phone calls from the White House to the Fed .
The culture of policymaking itself is capable of broadcasting the right signals to all important players .
In any case , it is a myth that the Fed makes policy independent of political pressure .
It is subject to the screams and hollers for looser credit in the same way that bureaucracies are responsive to demands for more regulation .
Yes , government can increase consumption , but by doing so it does nothing to care for the long term .
The long - term health of a nation is not different from that of a household budget .
Tough times require cutbacks and a beefing up of savings .
So let 's not demonize the consuming public for doing what it should be doing .
It 's a good rule of thumb that when the government tells you to spend money , you should close your wallet .
One of the features of this election campaign is how willing both sides have been to give away your money and mine as if it's their own and the reasons are far from altruistic .
Luckily though there are plenty of people who give away their money for the best of reasons .
But altruism is far from straight forward and what Robb Willer 's been studying is something called competitive altruism which no doubt charities love but the competition may be for someone 's charms .
Robb Willer is Professor of Sociology at the University of California , Berkley .
Robb Willer :
What we thought we 'd observed is that people will compete to behave more altruistically than one another if there is some opportunity for a potentially profitable social interaction .
We thought we 'd observed this in mating type dynamics amongst humans but also just in everyday gift giving .
Norman Swan :
The black tie dinner and that sort of thing where you have the business contacts and you give on the side ?
Robb Willer : Exactly , corporate philanthropy is a great example or that rush to pay the bill at a group dinner which seems to be counterintuitive from an economic perspective .
Norman Swan :
So how did you study this ?
Robb Willer :
We set up a study where people could behave altruistically towards someone else and we set up different conditions .
In one no one was watching what they were doing in another someone was watching what they were doing and would interact with them later .
And in a third someone was watching what they were doing who could choose to interact with them or not and it was in that condition that people behaved the most generously , presenting this third party observer who could choose who they wanted to interact with increased generosity and made it also competitive where people were trying to give more than one another .
Norman Swan :
You were sort of currying favour with this third party in a sense .
Robb Willer :
That 's right and in the real word that might correspond to anonymous giving situations towards charity versus giving and getting onto a public list versus giving when you have some instrumental partnership you 'd like to instigate through the giving .
Norman Swan :
So was there much difference between the private giving and just the giving where people would know what you 'd given but there was nothing in return ?
Robb Willer : Absolutely , just as bigger difference there as in the other difference .
Norman Swan :
So how does that translate to the real world do you think ?
Robb Willer :
You can see it clearly , when people compete to behave as generously as possible in order to solicit attention from a potential mate be it male or female .
Norman Swan :
What about the situation where it's not money you 're giving but it 's being nice to somebody .
You see somebody in trouble and you spend time with them or you do a bit of work for them which is often what makes the world go around rather than philanthropy .
Robb Willer : Absolutely , that is every bit as much altruism as giving somebody money is .
Norman Swan :
And have you any evidence of competition in that kind of altruism ?
Robb Willer : I 'm not aware of any existing research that shows competitive altruism with non-monetary resources .
Norman Swan :
What about the sense of obligation ?
If you are on the receiving end of an altruistic act have you looked at obligation ?
Robb Willer : Yeah , there 's an incredibly strong tendency towards reciprocity when somebody gives you a gift it 's believed that maybe not only social and cultural factors but maybe also biological factors drive you to want you to reciprocate that gift .
Norman Swan :
In other words it knits social organisation .
Robb Willer : Yeah , maybe part of the fundamental social fabric .
Norman Swan :
And you 've researched this ?
Robb Willer :
Yes , some recent research I 've done is on paying forward , on people 's tendency to pay forward favours they receive from strangers to new strangers in turn .
Norman Swan :
So in other words if someone has been nice to me I 'll be nice to somebody else , not necessarily back to the person who has given it to me .
Robb Willer :
That 's exactly right , when you get a favour from a stranger and then you interact with a new stranger in turn and I found in my research you tend to behave more generously with them than you otherwise would have been .
The basic drive towards direct reciprocity is so strong that when you receive a gift from a stranger you want to pay it back and if you can't directly you 'll pay it back to the next person you interact with .
Norman Swan :
It 's the philanthropic virus .
Robb Willer :
You 've got it , yeah .
Norman Swan :
Tell me about the research you did which got some publicity a little while ago on male identities , it 's a fascinating study .
Robb Willer : I was interested in masculine overcompensation that when men are insecure about their masculinity they fix that by demonstrating their masculinity to the extreme .
They gave men a gender identity survey and then gave them feedback suggesting they were either masculine or feminine .
Norman Swan : Irrespective of the results .
Robb Willer : Exactly , it had nothing to do with how they had actually scored on the gender identity survey .
And what I found was that men who had been told they were feminine supported the war in Iraq more , had more negative attitudes towards homosexuals and even showed greater interest in purchasing a SUV or a 4 x 4 .
Norman Swan :
And the men who were told they were masculine ?
Robb Willer :
They were not as impressed by the war in Iraq , they did n't have as negative attitudes towards gays and they had baseline levels of interest in a SUV .
Norman Swan :
So this suspicion about homophobes might be right ?
Robb Willer :
It might , and this is not the only research to suggest that homophobia may come in part from masculine insecurity .
Norman Swan :
Where does that research take you ?
Robb Willer : I 'm working on a lot of extensions on that research now , one thing I 'm doing is redoing the study and taking testosterone samples to see if maybe there may be a physiological marker for the process .
Norman Swan :
So you could take a pill against the war in Iraq ?
Robb Willer :
Yes , we are soon going to be developing a series of medication that can modify your political views - yes .
Norman Swan :
Have you done it with women ?
Robb Willer : I have , I also studied women and I found that women were not nearly as sensitive to feedback about their gender identities as men .
One reason is that there 's a variety of ways to be a woman in our society and it involves a mixture of traditionally feminine and masculine traits .
Have a job but also be a mother so women are used to negotiating complex feedback about their identity .
Norman Swan : Robb Willer is at the University of California , Berkeley .

" " A tattoo in progress .

Not too long ago , most Americans associated tattoos with sailors , bikers and sideshow artists .
But tattoos have become more popular in recent years , and the people who get them are as diverse as the styles and designs they choose .
And some people who would never think of tattooing pictures or symbols onto their bodies use permanent makeup -- a type of tattoo -- to emphasize their eyes and lips .
In this article , we 'll look at how the tattoo process works and examine the safety and legal issues surrounding it .

Artists create tattoos by injecting ink into a person 's skin .
To do this , they use an electrically powered tattoo machine that resembles ( and sounds like ) a dental drill .
The machine moves a solid needle up and down to puncture the skin between 50 and 3,000 times per minute .
The needle penetrates the skin by about a millimeter and deposits a drop of insoluble ink into the skin with each puncture .
The tattoo machine has remained relatively unchanged since its invention by Samuel O'Reilly in the late 1800s .
O'Reilly based his design on the autographic printer , an engraving machine invented by Thomas Edison .
Edison created the printer to engrave hard surfaces .
O'Reilly modified Edison 's machine by changing the tube system and modifying its rotary - driven electromagnetic oscillating unit to enable the machine to drive the needle .
This content is not compatible on this device .
Modern tattoo machines have several basic components :
A sterilized needle
A tube system , which draws the ink through the machine
An electric motor
A foot pedal , like those used on sewing machines , which controls the vertical movement of the needle .
­ When you look at a person 's tattoo , you 're seeing the ink through the epidermis , or the outer layer of skin .
The ink is actually in the dermis , which is the second layer of the skin .
The cells of the dermis are far more stable than the cells of the epidermis , so the tattoo 's ink will stay in place , with minor fading and dispersion , for a person 's entire life .
Next , we 'll look at how artists actually create tattoos , from preparation to finishing touches .

Students used Facebook to put pressure on overdraft charges
HSBC is to abandon plans to scrap interest - free overdrafts for students leaving university this summer .
Thousands of students on Facebook had threatened to boycott the bank .
The National Union of Students said this made all the difference to the protest .
The HSBC bank said it was not too big to listen to its customers .
Many students said they had joined the bank in the belief that they could take advantage of such a free overdraft to tide them over between leaving university and starting work , the NUS said .
Facebook pressure
But HSBC had planned to charge students leaving university this summer 9.9 % APR on their overdrafts .
The bank said in a statement : " Following the feedback from our graduate account holders , both directly and via the NUS , we have taken the decision to freeze interest charging on 2007 graduates overdrafts up to £ 1,500 . "
It added that it would be refunding any interest charged in August and was working with the NUS .
NUS president Gemma Tumelty said she was pleased that HSBC had listened to the concerns of students and graduates .
' Customer loyalty '
She added : " Students and graduates are valuable future customers for banks , and it is therefore crucial that those banks recognise that their support and fair treatment is likely to be rewarded with customer loyalty in the long term . "
NUS vice president Wes Streeting said : " There can be no doubt that using Facebook made the world of difference to our campaign .
" By setting up a group on a site that is incredibly popular with students , it enabled us to contact our members during the summer vacation far more easily than would otherwise have been possible .
" It also meant that we could involve our former members - the graduates who were going to be most affected by this policy . "
HSBC said the charges would not now be applied to this year 's crop of graduate account holders , and that it was meeting with the NUS to discuss the shape of future accounts .
The protest came as banks such as HSBC are seeking to recruit new student customers at the beginning of the academic year .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The weak U.S. dollar will likely stabilize in 2008 after sinking for five of the last six years , as the domestic economy emerges from a slump just as world growth slows .

Investors expect poor demand from U.S. consumers early in the year -- as falling housing prices and tight credit bring the country closer to recession -- to take a toll on other major economies in the second half , particularly Europe’s .
That will weigh on their currencies and ultimately push up the dollar .
“ Economies overseas are not as soft as ours but they are declining , and our economy will likely stabilize in the not too distant future , ” said Brandon Thomas , who oversees $ 40 billion in investments for Portfolio Management Consultants in Chicago .
A stronger dollar would boost the buying power of American businesses and consumers , at a time when food and energy prices have remained uncomfortably high even as the U.S. economy slouches toward a recession .
While currency analysts are not necessarily saying the dollar ’s broad decline is completely done , or that the dollar is set to rally sharply higher , they generally believe that in 2008 the dollar will recover against most major currencies .
Signs are already surfacing that economies outside the United States are beginning to falter .
The Canadian dollar , the best performing major currency against the U.S. dollar in 2007 , tumbled to the lowest level in a month on Friday after data showed Canada in December shed the most jobs since May 2003 .
Last year , policy - makers around the world watched nervously as the dollar sank to the lowest level against the euro since the single European currency was launched in 1999 .
Major exporters in countries such as Japan and Brazil struggled as the falling dollar eroded their competitiveness .
In addition , policy - makers feared that a sustained rapid fall in the dollar could turn disorderly , spooking foreign investors and causing them to sell their dollar - denominated assets in droves .
The U.S. current account deficit , a broad measure of the country ’s trade balance , requires about $ 2 billion a day in foreign investment flows ; without those flows , the dollar will need to fall and interest rates will need to rise to attract capital .
And fall it has .
Against a group of currencies from major U.S. trading partners , the dollar touched an all - time low in November , according to an index tracked by the Federal Reserve .
TURNING THE TABLES
Late in 2007 the dollar ’s decline accelerated as markets began to reflect the need for the Federal Reserve to lower substantially its benchmark interest rate , which affects borrowing costs for consumers and companies , because of sluggish economic growth .
However , the tables are expected to turn later this year as currency markets bet that other central banks will have to deal with weakness in their own economies .
“ A lot of the bad news is already priced into the dollar , ” said Ray Uy , vice president of global fixed income at The Hartford .
“ If you look at the euro , there ’s basically no easing priced into that market .
However , data has been coming in on the weaker side of expectations . ”
The euro has risen a staggering 66 percent against the dollar since the end of 2001 , and hit an all - time high of $ 1.49 in November .
Since November , however , institutional investors -- which tend to make longer - term investments -- have been steady sellers of euros and buyers of dollars , suggesting a medium - term layer of support for the dollar , according to Citigroup .
If shorter - term investors , such as hedge funds , begin buying dollars in earnest , the euro could accelerate a decline , Citigroup analysts said in a report .
Bankim Chadha , head of macro foreign exchange research with Deutsche Bank , one of the biggest participants in the currency market , also believes the dollar will stabilize later this year when the housing sector stops subtracting a full percentage point from U.S growth .
He forecast that the euro would sink to $ 1.37 by the end of 2008 from $ 1.48 , where it currently is trading .
Yet , Chadha also acknowledged that a U.S. recession , while he did not expect one , would knock the dollar a lot lower before rebounding .
After following a trend of weakness since the beginning of 2002 , a recession could make the dollar the cheapest it has ever been against the currencies of major U.S. trading partners , according to a valuation measure used by Deutsche Bank .
“ We ’ve never done that before , ” Chadha said .
Iran has sufficient quantities of cruise missiles to destroy much or all of the Fifth Fleet which is within range of Iran ’s mobile missile launchers strategically located along its mountainous terrain overlooking the Persian Gulf .
The Bush administration is deliberately downplaying the vulnerability of the Fifth Fleet to Iran ’s advanced missile technology which has been purchased from Russia and China since the late 1990’s .
The most sophisticated of Iran ’s cruise missiles are the ‘ Sunburn ’ and ‘ Yakhonts ’ .
These are missiles against which U.S. military experts conclude modern warships have no effective defense .
By deliberately provoking an Iranian retaliation to U.S. military actions , the neoconservatives will knowingly sacrifice much or all of the Fifth Fleet .
This will culminate in a new Pearl Harbor that will create the right political environment for total war against Iran , and expanded military actions in the Persian Gulf region .
The Fifth Fleet ’s Vulnerability to Iran ’s Anti-Ship Missile Arsenal
The U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet is headquartered in the Gulf State of Bahrain which is responsible for patrolling the Persian Gulf , Arabian Sea , Suez Canal and parts of the Indian Ocean .
The Fifth Fleet currently comprises a carrier group and two helicopter carrier ships .
Its size peaked at five aircraft carrier groups and six helicopter carriers in 2003 during the invasion of Iraq .
Presently , it is led by the USS Enterprise ( CVN - 65 ) , the first nuclear powered aircraft carrier commissioned in 1961 , and on November 2 , began participating in a Naval exercise in the Persian Gulf .
The Fifth Fleet ’s base in Bahrain , is only 150 miles away from the Iranian coast , and would itself be in range of Iran ’s new generation of anti-ship cruise missiles .
Also , any Naval ships in the confined terrain of the Persian Gulf would have difficulty in maneuvering and would be within range of Iran ’s rugged coastline which extends all along the Persian Gulf to the Arabian sea .
Iran began purchasing advanced military technology from Russia soon after the latter pulled out in 2000 from the Gore - Chernomyrdin Protocol , which limited Russia ’s sales of military equipment to Iran . .
Russia subsequently began selling Iran military technology that could be used in any military conflict with the U.S.
This included air defense systems and anti-ship cruise missiles in which Russia specialized to offset the U.S. large naval superiority .
The SS - N - 22 or ‘ Sunburn ” has a speed of Mach 2.5 or 1500 miles an hour , uses stealth technology and has a range up to 130 miles .
It contains a conventional warhead of 750 lbs that can destroy most ships .
Of even greater concern is Russia ’s SSN - X - 26 or ‘ Yakhonts ’ cruise missile which has a range of 185 miles which makes all US Navy ships in the Persian Gulf vulnerable to attack .
More importantly the Yakhonts has been specifically developed for use against Carrier groups , and has been sold by Russia on the international arms trade .
Both the Yakhonts and the Sunburn missiles are designed to defeat the Aegis radar defense currently used on U.S. Navy ships by using stealth technology and low ground hugging flying maneuvers .
In their final approaches these missiles take evasive maneuvers to defeat anti-ship missile defenses .
So great is the threat posed by the Sunburn , Yakhonts and other advanced anti-ship missiles being developed by Russia and sold to China , Iran and other countries , that the Pentagon ’s weapons testing office in 2007 moved to halt production on further aircraft carriers until an effective defense was developed .
Iran has purchased sufficient quantities of both the Sunbeam and Yakhonts to destroy much or all of the Fifth Fleet anywhere in the Persian Gulf from its mountainous coastal terrain .
Millennium Challenge Wargames
The “ Millennium Challenge ” was one of the largest wargames ever conducted and wargames involved 13,500 troops spread out at over 17 locations .
The wargames involved heavy usage of computer simulations , extended over a three week period and cost $ 250 million .
Millennium Challenge involved asymmetrical warfare between the U.S military forces , led by General William Kernan , and an unnamed state in the Persian Gulf .
According to General Kernan , the wargames “ would test a series of new war - fighting concepts recently developed by the Pentagon . ”
Using a range of asymmetrical attack strategies using disguised civilian boats for launching attacks , planes in Kamikaze attacks , and Silkworm cruise missiles , much of the Fifth Fleet was sunk .
The games revealed how asymmetrical strategies could exploit the Fifth Fleet ’s vulnerability against anti-ship cruise missiles in the confined waters of the Persian Gulf .
In a controversial decision , the Pentagon decided to simply ‘ refloat ’ the Fifth Fleet to continue the exercise which led to the eventual defeat of the Persian Gulf state .
The sinking of the Fifth Fleet was ignored and the wargames declared a success for the “ new war - fighting concepts ” adopted by Gen. Kernan .
This led to Lt General Paul Van Riper , the commander of the mythical Gulf State , calling the official results “ empty sloganeering ” .
In a later television interview , General Riper declared “ when the concepts that the command was testing failed to live up to their expectations , the command at that point began to script the exercise in order to prove these concepts .
This was my critical complaint . ”
Most significant was General Riper ’s claims of the effectiveness of the older Cruise missile technology , the Silkworm missile which were used to sink an aircraft carrier and two helicopter - carriers loaded with marines in the total of 16 ships sunk .
When asked to confirm Riper ’s claims , General Kernar replied : “ Well , I do n’t know .
To be honest with you .
I have n’t had an opportunity to assess what happened .
But that ’s a possibility …
The specifics of the cruise - missile piece …
I really ca n’t answer that question .
We ’ll have to get back to you ”
The Millennium Challenge wargames clearly demonstrated the vulnerability of the US Fifth Fleet to Silkworm cruise missile attacks .
This replicated the experience of the British during the 1980 Falklands war where two ships were sunk by three Exocet missiles .
Both the Exocet and Silkworm cruise missiles were an older generation of anti-ship missile technology that were far surpassed by the Sunburn and Yakhonts missiles .
If the Millennium Challenge was a guide to an asymmetrical war with Iran , much of the U.S Fifth Fleet would be destroyed .
It is not surprising Millennium Challenge was eventually scripted so that this embarrassing fact was hidden .
To date , there has been little public awareness of the vulnerability of the US Fifth Fleet while stationed in the Persian Gulf .
It appears that the Bush administration had scripted an outcome to the wargames that would promote its neoconservative agenda for the Middle East .
The Neo-Conservative Strategy to Attack Iran
Neoconservatives share a political philosophy that US dominance of the international system as the world ’s sole superpower needs to be extended indefinitely into the 21st century .
In early 2006 neoconservatives within the Bush administration began vigorously promoting a new war against Iran due to the alleged threat posed by its nuclear development program .
Iran has consistently maintained that its nuclear development is lawful and in compliance with the Nonproliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
Since 2004 , The Bush administration has been citing intelligence data that Iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons and must under no circumstances be allowed to do this .
Much of Iran ’s nuclear development has occurred in underground facilities built at a depth of 70 feet with hardened concrete overhead that protect them from any known conventional attack .
This led to the Bush administration arguing in early 2006 that tactical nuclear weapons would need to be used to take out Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
This culminated in a fierce debate between leading neo-conservatives such as Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld , with the Joint Chiefs of Staff which remained adamantly opposed .
Seymour Hersh in May 2006 , reported the opposition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . '

A 6 - year - old Park Slope girl is facing a $ 300 fine from the city for doing what city kids have been doing for decades : drawing a pretty picture with common sidewalk chalk .
Obviously not all of Natalie Shea ’s 10th Street neighbors thought her blue chalk splotch was her best work — a neighbor called 311 to report the “ graffiti , ” and the Department of Sanitation quickly sent a standard letter to Natalie ’s mom , Jen Pepperman .
Can somebody stop these bureaucrats before they Kafka again ?
“ PLEASE REMOVE THE GRAFFITI FROM YOUR PROPERTY , ” the Sanitation Department warning letter read .
“ FAILURE TO COMPLY … MAY RESULT IN ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST YOU . ”
Since when is a kid ’s chalk drawing “ graffiti ” ?
Since the City Council passed local law 111 in 2005 , which defined “ graffiti ” as “ any letter , word , name , number , symbol , slogan , message , drawing , picture , writing … that is drawn , painted , chiseled , scratched , or etched on a commercial building or residential building . ”
In other words , Natalie Shea is not an artistic little girl , but a graffiti scofflaw ?
No .
The law goes on to say that the scribbles can only be called “ graffiti ” if they are “ not consented to by the owner of the commercial building or residential building . ”
But how could the 311 caller possibly be expected to know if Natalie had her mom ’s consent to use chalk on her own front stoop ?
“ He could have just asked ! ” Pepperman said .
“ This whole thing is ridiculous .
Admittedly , this drawing was not her best work — she usually sticks to cheerful scenes , not abstracts , frankly — but to send a warning letter like that is outrageous . ”
Pepperman ticked off any number of daily insults to common decency on her block , including ( but not limited to ) dog poop , garbage from ill - kept homes , and noise from car alarms .
But Sanitation did n’t get a 311 call about those indignities .
It got a call about a 6 - year - old ’s drawing .
“ The report came in as ‘ graffiti , ’ and , as you know , the city is trying to crack down on graffiti on private property , ” said agency spokeswoman Cathy Dawkins .
“ It ’s a standard warning letter , ” added Dawkins .
“ The property owner has 45 days to remove it or ask the city to remove it .
We ’ll inspect after that , and if the graffiti is still there , the property owner has another 60 days before we ’ll write a summons . ”
For sidewalk chalk that would dissolve at the first rain ?
Dawkins said the law is on her agency ’s side .
“ The instrument used — whether it ’s paint or chalk — does not matter , ” she said .
But if Dawkins is right , than the city has just criminalized hopscotch or drawing arrows to point neighbors towards a stoop sale down the block — as long as a neighbor calls 311 to complain .
In reality , chalkers have little reason to start using invisible ink .
The city ’s pre-eminent sidewalk chalk illustrator , Ellis Gallagher , says he ’s outlining street furniture and other objects for years and never been arrested .
“ Cops stop me all the time when they see me drawing on the sidewalk , but once they see it ’s just chalk , they always let me go , ” said Gallagher , a Carroll Gardens resident ( see his work at www.myspace.com/ellis_gee).
Gallagher believes that , despite local law 111 , drawing in chalk is not illegal .
But a call to the NYPD revealed that there ’s a lot of gray area .
( UPDATE : Gallagher arrested for chalk drawing .
[ nydailynews.com ] )
“ According the New York penal law , graffiti is the etching , painting , covering , drawing or otherwise placing of a mark upon public or private property with intent to damage such property , ” said an NYPD spokesman .
When pressed to define “ intent ” or , for that matter , “ damage , ” the spokesman added : “ If it can be washed away , it ’s not graffiti , clearly , but it still could be criminal mischief .
If I cover your car with mustard , that ’s not graffiti , but it ’s also not legal . ”
Pepperman is holding firm that her daughter is a pretty artist and not a petty criminal .
And for his part , Natalie ’s father , George Shea , hoped that his daughter would n’t learn the wrong lesson from her “ graffiti ” crime wave .
“ I do love that kid , ” Shea said , “ but I wish she would stop capping my tags . ”

Just four days after eight Israeli high school students were massacred by a Palestinian terrorist in Jerusalem , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino used perhaps the most shocking example yet of moral equivalence in explaining Vice President Dick Cheney ’s upcoming trip to the Middle East .
The trip was necessary said Perino , because “ Neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis are moving fast enough on their respective obligations to end violence and curb expansion of settlements . ”
That the office of the President of the United States now openly equates the deliberate and orchestrated murder of unarmed high school boys with the bureaucratic decision of a municipal Israeli housing authority to permit the construction of new apartments in an existing subdivision is another redundant proof of how far the Bush Administration has retreated from its signature demand that moral clarity was a necessary component to victory in the war on terror .
To get a sense of how detached our diplomats are world imagine a doctor refusing to re-examine the condition of a patient whose condition deteriorates after each treatment .
But in the Middle East , no matter how chronic the patient ’s condition , the only change to treatment is an ever increased dosage of the same bad medicine .

In discussing the volatile situation in Pakistan , Mike Huckabee has made several erroneous or misleading statements at a time when he has been under increasing scrutiny from fellow presidential candidates for a lack of fluency in foreign policy issues .
Explaining statements he made suggesting that the instability in Pakistan should remind Americans to tighten security on the southern border of the United States , Mr. Huckabee said Friday that “ we have more Pakistani illegals coming across our border than all other nationalities , except those immediately south of the border . ”
Asked to justify the statement , he later cited a March 2006 article in The Denver Post reporting that from 2002 to 2005 , Pakistanis were the most numerous non-Latin Americans caught entering the United States illegally .
According to The Post , 660 Pakistanis were detained in that period .
A recent report from the Department of Homeland Security , however , concluded that , over all , illegal immigrants from the Philippines , India , Korea , China and Vietnam were all far more numerous than those from Pakistan .
At modern high - tech conferences , many in the audience go online , and stay online during the presentations .
To facilitate this , conference organizers often provide wireless networking , and extension cords for laptop power .
There is strong disagreement as to whether this A Good Thing or Appalling Discourtesy .
I have observations both from in the audience and on the stage .
At many technology conferences , there is an IRC channel for discussion of the conference and the sessions .
At particularly bleeding - edge events , there will be two screens behind the speaker ; one displaying the visual aids , the other the IRC channel .
I found this particularly weird when I was speaking at last summer ’s RubyKaigi in Tokyo and the IRC screen was in Japanese , so I could n’t tell what they were saying about me .
History ·
The single greatest influence on my technical career was Gaston Gonnet , who was one of the Directors of the New Oxford English Dictionary Project at the University of Waterloo , where I was on research staff .
To the extent that I have any depth of understanding about how computer programs work and how they should be built , I owe it to him .
We had regular project meetings ; at about half of them , he ’d show up with some jottings in a notebook and say “ I have an idea ” and lots of times it ’d be wild and weird and wonderful .
We used to host the odd conference and attend others , and one time Gaston said something like this to me : “ You know , I get some of my best ideas at conferences , sitting in the audience .
You have to be quiet and think about the subject , and your brain goes off in useful directions . ”
I think this anecdote could be introduced as evidence by both sides of the argument .
In the Audience · When I ’m in the audience , I ’m 100 % in favor of connectivity .
At the very best conferences I go to , there are a very small proportion of speakers who saturate my ability to listen and think .
It ’s a fine thing when it happens , but it does n’t happen that often .
I know this is true , and here ’s how .
First , there are a few speakers who make me just shut the computer and listen ( most do n’t ) .
For the ones who do n’t , quite a few of them are still worth listening to , only I want to check for hot emails at the same time , or run some test - cases on misbehaving code , or do a little photo - editing of yesterday ’s snaps .
And then I find myself disagreeing or puzzled and raising my hand ( for the kind of event where you can do that ) and getting into dialogue with the speaker .
Then there ’s the kind of talk where I suddenly realize that I ’ve missed the last ten minutes because the Internet was more interesting than the speaker .
How many of these are good outcomes , do you think ?
From the Stage ·
It ’s painfully obvious that there are quite a few speakers who do n’t really pay attention to what ’s happening in the audience , which to me says do n’t really care how good their performance is .
I ’m not one .
When I give a speech and the crowd is responsive and engaged , I walk away on top of the world , especially when they push back ; when they tune out , I ’m crushed .
I have no trouble at all telling which of the two is happening , and in what proportion of the people facing me .
I do n’t think anyone who actually looks at the individual people in the audience could avoid knowing how they ’re doing .
And I love having the IRC channel on display .
It helps me learn what ’s working and what ’s not , and it gives you lots of chances to crack a first - rate joke based on something in the chat - room .
In my experience , how well I do is a function of how much I care , and of how well I ’ve prepared .
Not how much , how well ; I struck out on a couple in the last year because I worked up passionate , erudite , and exhaustive talks on issues they just did n’t care about .
I have n’t noticed any correlation between how well I do and whether the laptops are open when I start .
Entitlement ·
The people who think that their audience being Internet - enabled is a bad thing tend to say things like “ Being online while someone ’s speaking is appallingly rude and arrogant .
They ’ve gone to the trouble of submitting a talk and getting it accepted and they ’re entitled to your attention . ”
It ’s Over · I ’m sorry ; the traditional conference mode of discourse , where you sit in rows in the dark and shut up and listen , it ’s just over .
Did I mention that every respectable geek conference now has wireless and extension cords ?
That ’s because the audience demands it .
The Audience , near as I can tell , by and large does n’t believe that because someone got a talk accepted , they ’re entitled to anyone ’s undivided attention .
And let ’s be brutal : at most conferences , there are two ways to get a talk accepted : submit an interesting talk , or bribe the conference organizer .
Oops , sorry : I meant “ be a platinum sponsor ” .
The conference business is in many cases deeply corrupt and thus willing to put an airhead droid in front of paying attendees assuming the airhead ’s employer will front up the cash .
Well , these days , fuck the airhead droid .
I got a laptop and a connection , I ’m gonna tune out unless what ’s coming off the stage is relevant to my experience , and I am the only competent judge of that .
Thought Experiment ·
You ’ve got several hundred mostly really smart people in a room .
What ’s the best use of their time ?
Passive listening or active discussion ?
Seems obvious to me .
Unconferences , Open - space meetings , once you ’ve been to one or two you ’ve just had it with this crap about sitting in the dark facing forward and shutting up .
Participation is good .
Being spoon - fed is n’t participation .
3 ½ minutes of questions from someone else after a 45 - minute pitch is n’t participation .
Silencing all the parts of your mind that are n’t being engaged by the speaker is n’t participation .
Conclusion ·
In the audience , I ai n’t closing my laptop .
When I ’m on the stage , it ’s my job to send ’em away happy .
If my mojo ’s working , the Internet wo n’t get in the way .
If it ’s not , banning laptops wo n’t save me .
Or us .
Preferably us .
He can always recant and say , " Oops , I was wrong " in his bunker .
We 'll be long gone by then , so what does he care ?
Very little , in all probability .
Bush is a bit like an unhinged iconoclast who has arbitrarily decided he does n't believe in cows , and loudly and repeatedly denies their existence until you get so annoyed you drive him to a farm and show him a cow , and he shakes his head and continues to insist there 's no such thing .
At which point it moos indignantly , but he claims not to hear it , so in exasperation you drag him into the field and force him to touch the cow , and milk the cow , and ride around on the cow 's back .
And , finally , he dismounts and says , " That was fun 'n'all , but dagnammit , I still do n't believe in no cow . "
And then he shoots it in the head regardless , just to be on the safe side .
Just so it is n't a threat .
Come to think of it , Bush is so vehemently fact - phobic , he might as well expand the war on terror into an outright war on reality , in which anything palpably authentic is the enemy .
There 'll be an " Axis of Real Stuff " , encompassing everyone and everything from hairbands to dustmen , all of which Must Be Eliminated .
" If it 's provable , we can kill it . "
That 's our new motto .
God 's on our side , because he can't be proved or disproved .
He 's one of our most valuable allies - the others being Santa Claus , the Tooth Fairy , ghosts , the bogeyman , and Bigfoot .
Not to mention a vast fleet of UFOs , which the enemy wo n't have a chance of defeating because it never existed in the first place .
Our armies wo n't be constrained by the laws of physics , and even if we lose , we 'll simply say we won , even if we have to say it from an afterlife which does n't exist either .
That 's the power of unwavering denial .
It makes deities of us all .
Of course , by rejecting anything he does n't want to hear , Bush is simply proving he 's human .
Humans hate the truth .
Once someone 's made up their mind , they rarely change it , no matter how much evidence to the contrary you show them .
Changing your mind or admitting you were wrong is seen as weak , as though life itself were an almighty pub quiz where incorrect answers are penalised .
The only option left is to interpret the facts in a new and interesting way that supports your overall position .
This is what Bush has done .
He says that since the report indicates that Iran halted its weapons programme in 2003 , there 's a clear possibility it could start it up again .
The very fact that the Iranians do n't have a nuclear bomb proves they might still develop one .
Therefore , Iran is dangerous .
That 's a clever thing to say , because a ) the future is unknowable , so it 's impossible to tell him he 's wrong , and b ) the more he says it , the more likely it is to come true .
Since Bush has shown that he 'll view Iran as a nuclear threat regardless of whether it's got the bomb or not , the Iranians might as well build one .
What have they got to lose ?
Also , the report does n't say whether the Iranians are developing a giant laser beam capable of sawing the sun in two , but that 's no reason to assume they wo n't be starting work on it next week .
Picture a world in which Ahmadinejad holds us to ransom by threatening to plunge one sawn - off half of the sun into the Atlantic , sending 900 ft waves of boiling water rushing toward our shores .
We can't let that happen .
We 've got to get in first : drive a space shuttle into the sun and blow the damn thing up before the enemy get their hands on it .
It might solve global warming too .
Let 's hope the Pentagon is across this .
Do n't let us down , guys .
Knock that baby out .
Another benefit of ignoring the report and piling in regardless is that at least this time round we 'll know for sure that the invasion and subsequent war is based on a false premise in advance , which beats finding out later and feeling a bit disgusted with ourselves .
Forewarned is forearmed .
It 's a narrative tweak which keeps things fresh and interesting .
The TV series Columbo used a similar device : instead of being served a common - or - garden whodunnit , you 'd see the murderer committing the crime at the start , so the fun came from watching his plan slowly unravel .
There 's no danger of that happening to Bush though , because he does n't believe in plans either .
So nothing unravels .
It 's a win -win situation .
He should unleash the hounds tomorrow .
Go ahead , George .
We 'll be fine , out here , outside the bunker .
Do n't you worry about us .
· This week Charlie watched what felt like the entire year 's worth of television in preparation for his Screen Wipe review of 2007 : " It was like being a crap Doctor Who : I did n't go back very far and I achieved nothing . "
Charlie felt sorry for the canoe couple : " The authorities should free them for Christmas on the grounds that they have entertained the whole nation . "
AT&T says it 's time to start filtering copyrighted content at the network level .
During a panel discussion at the International Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) , The New York Times reports , the communications giant joined Microsoft and NBC Universal in arguing that internet service providers - like AT&T itself - should be sniffing your networks packets and blocking anything that copyright holders do n't traveling over the wire .
" We are very interested in a technology based solution and we think a network - based solution is the optimal way to approach this , " said James Cicconi , senior vice president for external and legal affairs for AT&T .
" We recognize we are not there yet , but there are a lot of promising technologies .
But we are having an open discussion with a number of content companies , including NBC Universal , to try to explore various technologies that are out there . "
He also said the company has spent the last six months discussing this plan with the Recording Industry Ass. of America ( RIAA ) and its counterpart in the movie biz , the Motion Picture Ass. of America ( MPAA ) .
As if they would n't be involved in the end - all , be - all plan to crack down on P2P file - sharers .
When Cicconi was asked if AT&T 's customers would stand for this sort of thing , he played coy .
" Whatever we do has to pass muster with consumers and with policy standards .
There is going to be a spotlight on it , " he told the NY Times .
" We ’ve got to figure out a friendly way to do it .
There ’s no doubt about it . "
We wonder if Cicconi would use the word " friendly " to describe the way Comcast surreptitiously throttled its customers ' BitTorrent traffic . ®
Calls have grown for tighter security on the US border with Mexico
Two - thirds of Mexicans who migrate , or try to migrate , to the US every year do so without documents , it said .
The report , timed to coincide with the UN International Migrants Day , said almost 30 million people in the US were direct descendants of Mexican migrants .
Illegal immigration is set to be a key issue in the 2008 US presidential poll .
Tricky issue
The illegal entry to the US , via its southern border , of an estimated 500,000 people each year , has led the US government to start building a security fence along the most sensitive areas .
US President George W Bush 's attempts to overhaul immigration laws collapsed amid heated debate in Congress earlier this year .
The question of how to address illegal immigration , without alienating the large Hispanic electorate , is a tricky political issue for candidates .

Jeff
Minter
Calling himself " Yak " and having an obsession with sheep , llamas , and camels , Jeff Minter has written more games than just about anyone .
Best known for his VIC - 20 hit " Gridrunner " and the Commodore 64 sequel , " Revenge of the Mutant Camels , " his games have ranged from the popular ( " Llamatron " ) to the bizarre ( " Sheep in Space " ) , but they 've almost always been raw , psychedelic action games that lean hard on basic playability .
Though a popular figure in the C64 and Atari ST worlds , the Minter name became more widely known in early 1994 with the release of " Tempest 2000 , " an update of Dave Theurer 's 1981 coin - op " Tempest , " becoming one of the few solid titles in the Atari Jaguar library .
Two years later he followed it up with " Defender 2000 " but the Jaguar was commercially dead and buried by that point .
For more insight into the Yakly philosophy , see the Llamatron " read me " file .
What led up to the programming of your first commercial game , " Andes Attack " ?
Oh , bloody hell , that goes way back .
My first encounter with coding was at sixth form college where they had a Commodore PET , and I taught meself BASIC on that and started writing games for me mates .
When I ran out of steam with BASIC I turned to 6502 machine code , hand assembled , by God .
The first machine I actually owned was the ZX80 , and in fact I did a few pre-Llamasoft games for the ZX80 / ZX81 for an outfit called dk'tronics in the U.K .
However , they treated me spectacularly badly , and so the founding of Llamasoft coincided with my getting my hands on the VIC .
Games were just something I did in my spare time before that .
Andes Attack was coded during a period of illness and , to my surprise and delight , sold pretty well when I 'd finished it , despite being painfully jerky and buggy now that I look back on it .
I think learning to write games as a hobby , just for the benefit of your mates , is a pretty good grounding ; your mates do n't hesitate to tell you if they think you 've made a shitty game !
I always knew if I 'd done a good 'un because all the chipheads at the college would be staying after hours playing the games and writing their hi-scores on the walls of the computer room –for which I got shit .
How did you find a publisher for " Andes Attack ? "
In the U.K. , we published it ourselves .
I was at a Commodore show in Hammersmith where we were demonstrating and selling the game for the first time and got spotted by a guy from HES who subsequently published the game in the U.S .
How well did " Andes Attack " do commercially ?
Not too bad , considering how shitty it actually was .
But my God , you should have seen what the competition was like at that time in the U.K. – some really diabolical stuff that made " Andes Attack " look great by comparison .
It was published in the U.S. as " Aggressor " , " with some minor cosmetic changes , and did okay , but nothing compared to " Gridrunner . "
It was good enough that it got Llamasoft into the market and got us the hook - up with HES that later proved to be pretty lucrative .
The limitations of the VIC - 20 seem severe today .
Did they feel constraining at the time ?
Well , after using the PET , which had 8 K , was monochrome and had no bitmapped graphics or sound , and the ZX80 / ZX81 , which had 1 K , was monochrome , had a membrane keyboard , no sound –Ugh !
Bleachh !
–the VIC , with a proper keyboard , a sound chip , programmable bitmaps and , above all , color and joystick ports , seemed like the very lap of luxury !
How was your company , Llamasoft , founded ?
Basically I was motivated by seeing " Asteroids " by Bug Byte on the VIC - 20 , by S. Munnery .
That name is branded on my brain .
It was so bad , I mean , unbelievably bad .
You only had one spaceship , and the program would poke your ship on the screen , then randomly poke on the asteroids , and fully half the time it would poke a rock right on top of your ship before you even had a chance to move or fire , and it would be " Game Over " before it even started .
When you fired , instead of individual bullets that actually moved , you just got this chain of full stops that stuck out of the end of your ship while the VIC made a sound like a vacuum cleaner .
Shudder .
They were charging seven quid for that pile of wank , and I thought , hell , I could do better than that , so I started work on what would eventually become " Andes Attack . "
Originally Llamasoft was founded to sell that .
After a brief period of misguided partnership with your archetypical dodgy geezer , my mum came into the partnership , we kicked him out , and Llamasoft proper came into being in 1982 .
I guess I have to thank S. Munnery for something , even if that game he wrote was execrable !
What were the early years of Llamasoft like , say , 1982 - 1986 ?
Absolutely brilliant .
It was totally like a dream come true .
After a fairly slow start , things went ballistic when " Gridrunner " became a big hit in the U.S. , and we made some silly money for a while .
Meanwhile , in the U.K. , we started to get a reputation for games that were weird , but playable .
We used to go to five or six big shows in the U.K. every year , and they were a total blast .
I got to meet a lot of great people , sell a lot of games , and drink a lot of beer !
I also got to do a lot of stuff I would never have dreamed possible before it all started : go to Peru to be with llamas , get a new car , go skiing every year .
It was just great .
I was a bloody lucky git to have such a good time !
Was there ever any temptation to sell out ?
Not really .
I was perfectly happy to do my own thing .
We never had any ambitions to become a big software empire .
I 'm sure we could have done it if we 'd wanted to , but me and my mum liked it the way it was , just me coding , my mum and dad doing the administrative stuff .
I 'm afraid I was much more interested in having a good time than getting seriously commercial .
People have called me a fool for that , but I do n't care .
I had a great time and do n't regret it for a minute .
When did you start to feel that the " golden age " of home computer gaming was drawing to a close ?
I guess around 1987 things started getting a bit thin .
The biz was becoming more serious , with arcade and movie licenses dominant instead of just a bunch of rogue coders all trying to come up with original stuff .
That 's what I really liked about the early scene ; there was a very high premium placed on originality in a game .
Now you tend to have your genres : driving , bloody endless fighting games , bloody " Doom " clones .
No disrespect to id , " Doom " is a fantastic game , and they created the genre .
It 's just that now every flipping game , apart from the aforementioned fighting and driving ones , tends to look like " Doom . "
You wait , I 'm going to do something about that one of these days !
You 've written quite a few " Defender " inspired games .
What is it that fascinates you about " Defender " ?
" Defender " is just a beautiful game design and the effects , for their time , were astounding .
It broke a lot of new ground , introducing the scanner and the smart bomb ; it was the first game to provide a coherent play area larger than the screen within which one had complete freedom to maneuver .
In playing " Defender " one is not just memorizing a pattern , one has to think and respond dynamically to a threat that is constantly changing .
You had to take the time to actually learn to fly your ship , but when you 'd learned , you could pull off the most beautiful moves .
A wonderful game to play , and one that I still play , surrounded though I am with awesome next - gen tech .
The game stands the test of time .
It 's a true classic .
Have you ever met Eugene Jarvis ?
Yes , at CES in 1994 .
He 's a lovely bloke , witty and intelligent–very much so–and not at all big - headed , ' specially as he 's a god !
It was a real case of hero worship for me !
Mind you , I have to say I think he made me tone down the difficulty on my Jag implementation of " Defender " a bit too far .
He was the guy we had to satisfy for approval from Williams on " Defender 2000 . "
I played " Defender " on " Williams Arcade Classics " the other day , and it kicked my ass by comparison to Classic mode on " Defender 2000 . "
What 's the story behind your long series of " light synthesizer " programs ?
That 's a long and strange story that 's not over yet .
Long , long ago , in a galaxy far away , or at least in Basingstoke , the fourteen - year - old proto - Yak got invited to a party where he had his first taste of alcohol .
Not knowing any better , he went on drinking the stuff all night and ended up having a pretty bad time involving a lot of throwing up and feeling rotten .
On the way , however , he met a really nice girl who he totally failed to get off with and also saw these really primitive disco lights that the DJ had and thought to himself , in a drunken , twisted kind of a way , that there had to be a better way of interpreting music visually than that .
This was before I had even seen a computer , but a lot of listening to Pink Floyd and watching the patterns on the backs of my eyelids in a darkened room kinda made me think there would be a better way , and somehow that it would involve large projection screens .
The first lightsynth was finally created after a particularly enlightening trip to Peru , hanging out in the Andes with lots of llamas and returning home inspired .
We 've been through a lot of incarnations since then , most recently with the " Virtual Light Machine " for the Jag CD - ROM .
And it 's not over yet .
I am about to get involved with some hardware that could do a lightsynth so amazing that just owning the software could get you in trouble with the DEA !
My ambition is to have Pink Floyd use one of my systems .
I better hurry though ; Dave and the boys are getting to be old geezers .
How do you feel your 8 - bit games hold up today ?
Hell , I do n't think they 're too shabby .
I look at some of them and think , " My , was n't I a rotten coder back then , " especially some of the earlier ones .
But most of them were fun to play and it always used to make me happy when I 'd see some geezer at a show with baggy eyes and a sore thumb from playing all night .
The very idea that I could do that to someone with my game !
It still does give me a buzz when I hear of people getting addicted to my games .
I like it if someone feels they got their money 's worth out of my game .
Are there any that make you think " Ugh !
I ca n't believe I wrote that ! " ?
Yeah !
The bugs in " Andes Attack " on the VIC , abominations like the , thankfully rare , " Ratman " on the VIC and " Rox 64 " on the C64 .
Hey !
It was written in one night , and that night happened to be the first night I actually owned a 64 .
What 's your philosophy of game design ?
Gameplay Uber Alles .
And if you can make it psychedelic too , great !
My idea of fun is not so much creating a realistic world with the computer , so much as creating a surrealistic one .
Rather than use the machine to emulate reality , use the machine to go to places that no - one ever imagined before .
I think that 's the real potential of the new generation of ultra-powerful machines , at least as far as my future designs are concerned .
I have things in my head that you could create with the power of , say , five PlayStations , that 'd have to be made illegal , they 'd be so trippy .
How did you hook up with Atari ?
I kinda fell in with Atari U.K. back in the 1980s and , when it was getting impractical to publish our own stuff , did the odd contract for them – " Defender 2 , " " Photon Storm . "
Then I hooked up with Atari U.S. and my old boss , John Skruch–a lovely bloke , you could not ask for a better producer to work for –to work on the Falcon and subsequently on the Jaguar .
I met my first Tramiel shortly after the ST came out .
I was at Comdex with " Colourspace , " my ST lightsynth , and Leonard T. brought his Uncle Jack over to take a look at it !
I was pretty awestruck to meet the guys who ran Atari and who founded Commodore , the company that had made the machine I first learned to code on !
Do you prefer reworking classics or creating original games ?
I have greatly enjoyed reworking the likes of " Defender " and " Tempest . "
Those two are probably my fave arcade games , ever .
But I would like to do some original stuff now , I think .
However , I do count bringing those old games to a new generation of players as one of my proudest achievements .
Those designs were so cool .
Do you still program in assembly language or have you switched to something more fashionable ?
Assembly all the way so far .
I know the day will come , but for now , there is still a demand for true assembler coders if you know where to look .
What games , from either the 1980s or 1990s , have you been most impressed with ?
" Star Raiders . " " Defender . " " Tempest . " " Rescue on Fractalus ! " " F - Zero " –and " Wipeout " on the PlayStation , " F - Zero 's " logical successor .
" Thrust " on the C64 .
" Doom . " " Robotron . "
" Tetris " –pure elegance !
And , of course , the Mario canon on the Nintendos ; no denying Shig his greatness .
What do you think , in general , of the games currently on the shelves ?
There are only a few must - have games around .
There are a lot of technically great games around , but very few have that real spark of gameplay excellence that just makes you drool and need to play all the time .
" WipeOut " on the PlayStation is great .
Not only did I love it , but it has managed to addict all my brothers , even those who do not usually play video games–always the sign of a great game if it can do that .
Any chance of a Llamasoft game that does n't feature yaks or llamas or other furry beasts ?
Now what possible reason would I have for giving up my love of beasties ?
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - South Korean display screen maker Samsung SDI Co 006400 .KS said on Thursday it had developed a 31 - inch ultra - thin organic screen , raising the stakes in an accelerating worldwide race for organic displays .
People walk in front of Samsung Group 's main office in Seoul August 6 , 2007 .
South Korean display screen maker Samsung SDI
Co said on Thursday it had developed a 31 - inch ultra - thin organic screen , raising the stakes in an accelerating worldwide race for organic displays .
REUTERS / Lee Jae-Won
Samsung SDI 's announcement comes after Sony Corp 6758 .T began sales of 11 - inch OLED TVs in November .
The Japanese company has showcased a 27 - inch prototype OLED TV in the past .
Flat screen makers are increasingly looking at active - matrix organic light - emitting diode ( AM - OLED ) as a growth driver because they produce brighter images and use less power .
Samsung SDI officials declined to say when the company ’s 31 - inch OLED screen would be mass - produced , saying the decision depended on TV set makers ’ plans .
But they said Samsung Electronics 005930 .KS , the world 's largest maker of liquid crystal display ( LCD ) TVs , would showcase a 31 - inch prototype TV set at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January .
Samsung SDI is also planning to mass - produce 14 - inch screens in 2008 , Yoo Eui-jin , head of Samsung SDI ’s AM - OLED team , said at a press conference introducing the display .
Although
Yoo declined to name the companies that would use the AM - OLED screens , he said a number of companies had expressed interest .
Samsung SDI said its 31 - inch module is only 4.3 mm thick , or one - tenth of a typical liquid crystal display panel , and consumed less than half the electricity needed for a 32 - inch LCD screen .
Samsung SDI also said the lifespan of its display was 35,000 hours , the best performance among existing AM - OLEDs .
While small AM - OLED displays are already in use on premium mobile phones and media players , large - sized models are particularly difficult and costly to make .
Shipments of Sony ’s 11 - inch OLED TVs have been limited to 2,000 units per month .
Earlier this month , Japan's Toshiba Corp 6502 .
T said it had shelved plans to sell AM - OLED TVs in 2009 - 10 because of the cost of mass production .

2007年11月24日、「楽天テクノロジーカンファレンス2007」において、Ruby言語の開発者で楽天技術研究所フェローのまつもとゆきひろ氏は、開発中の大規模分散処理基盤「Roma」（ローマ）と「 Fairy」（フェアリー）のコンセプトを語った。研究段階ではあるものの、米グーグルなど世界トップクラスのネット企業だけが持つ大規模分散処理技術に真っ向から挑戦する試みだ。
米グーグル、米ヤフー、米アマゾンなど世界トップクラスの大手ネット企業は、巨大なトラフィックに対処するため、大規模データセンターの信頼性、可用性、性能などを確保する大規模分散処理基盤の研究開発を進めている。最近では、こうした大規模分散処理基盤は“ウェブOS”と呼ばれることもあり、注目を集めている。つまり世界トップクラスのネット企業は“ウェブOS”を自社開発しているわけだが、楽天でも国産の“ウェブOS”が生まれつつある。
楽天テクノロジーカンファレンス2007で講演する、まつもとゆきひろ氏
楽天技術研究所は、楽天社内の研究開発組織として長期的な戦略に基づく研究開発を進めている。2007年6月には、Ruby言語の開発者であるまつもとゆきひろ氏をフェローとして迎えている。まつもと氏を迎えた楽天技術研究所がRuby言語を使って進めるプロジェクトが、RomaとFairyである。
楽天技術研究所が研究開発を進めるRomaとFairyは、サーバ機を1000台といった規模で設置し、大規模並列処理を行うことを想定した基盤技術であり、世界トップクラスのネット企業に基盤技術で挑戦する格好となる。現時点では研究段階であり、実システムに投入するまでには多くの課題があるものの、巨大データセンターを運用するネット企業である楽天がウェブOSの開発に着手したことは注目に値する。
Romaは分散ストレージ 、Fairyは分散処理基盤
Romaは、メモリ上にデータを保持した多数のマシンを組み合わせることで、高速で信頼性が高いストレージを実現することを狙う。具体的には、巨大なオンメモリのハッシュ・テーブルをネットワーク上に分散した多数のサーバ上に構築する。P2P（peer-to-peer）ネットワークのルーティング技術として注目されている分散ハッシュ・テーブル（DHT)と似た動作モデルに基づくという。
まつもと氏は、Romaのコンセプトについて「 CPUやネットワークに比べてハードディスクの速度は上がっていない。メモリ上にデータを保持し、マシンを大量にネットワーク上にばらまいたら、そちらの方が速い」と説明する。「単にメモリを分散するだけならmemcached（注：大規模BlogサイトLiveJournal.comの性能向上のために作られたオープンソースの分散キャッシュ・システム）でいいと思うかもしれないが、マシンを1000台並べ、そのうち1台が壊れても止まらない信頼性と一貫性を確保することを考えると、より高度なアイデアが必要。ただしその分、実用化までには壁がありそうだ」（まつもと氏）。
Romaの応用として、巨大セッションを保持するコンテキスト基盤などを考えている。Romaの技術的な位置づけは、米グーグルの「GFS 」（Google File System）、米ヤフーの 「 Hadoop」（ハドゥープ）、米オラクルの「Coherence」（コヒーレンス）、米アマゾンの「Dynamo」（ダイナモ）など大規模分散ストレージ技術と似ている。楽天技術研究所代表の森正弥氏によれば「特にDynamoに位置づけが近い」とのことである。
一方 の Fairyは並列処理向けの技術で、MapReduce（注：グーグルが分散処理の基盤技術として利用することで知られる並列処理向けアルゴリズム）のRuby実装として検討を始めたもの。大規模並列処理の負荷分散への適用を狙う。「現在は、並列処理よりも負荷分散に主眼を置いて研究を進めている」（森氏）。
このほか、楽天技術研究所の成果としてリコメンデーション・エンジンや動画解析技術に関しても報告した。
研究段階だけでなく、実サービスとして投入済みの技術のセッションや展示もあった。楽天が内製するアプリケーションの開発言語は現段階ではPHPが主流だが、Rubyを活用するプロジェクトも6〜7件が進行中という。Rubyで開発した実例として、マウス操作でカスタマイズ可能なポータル画面「MyRakuten」の新バージョンなどのデモンストレーションを見せた。
今後3年で3000人超の技術者を確保したい
楽天が技術者向けカンファレンスを開催した大きな狙いは技術者を確保することである。
楽天取締役常務執行役員 チーフプロデュースオフィサー 開発・編成統括本部長の杉原章郎氏は、カンファレンスの狙いについて「楽天のテクノロジーを知ってもらい、社内外への刺激としたい」と話す。「現在、楽天社内と協力会社を含めて1100人規模の技術者がいるが、3年後には3倍といったスケール感で数を伸ばしていきたい。当然、東京の開発者だけでは足りない。すでに全国主要都市に開発拠点を立ち上げつつあるが、海外拠点を作ることもありうる」（杉原氏）と、今後も積極的な拡大を続ける姿勢を明らかにした。

Mitt Romney gave his much anticipated speech on faith and politics today :
COLLEGE STATION , Texas — Republican Mitt Romney , confronting voters ’ skepticism about his Mormon faith , declared Thursday that as president he would “ serve no one religion , no one group , no one cause , ” and said calls for him to explain and justify his religious beliefs go against the profound wishes of the nation ’s founders .
At the same time , he decried those who would remove from public life “ any acknowledgment of God , ” and he said that “ during the holiday season , nativity scenes and menorahs should be welcome in our public places . ”
In a speech less than a month before the first nomination contests , Romney said he shares “ moral convictions ” with Americans of all faiths , though surveys suggest up to half of likely voters have qualms about electing the first Mormon president .
“ I believe in my Mormon faith and I endeavor to live by it , ” Romney said .
“ My faith is the faith of my fathers .
I will be true to them and to my beliefs . ”
Nonetheless , he strove to clarify his personal line between church and state , recalling a similar speech delivered by John F. Kennedy in 1960 as Kennedy sought to become the first Catholic elected president .
“ I do not define my candidacy by my religion .
A person should not be elected because of his faith , nor should he be rejected because of his faith , ” Romney said at the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum , 90 miles from Kennedy ’s speaking site in Houston .
“ Let me assure you that no authorities of my church , or of any other church for that matter , will ever exert influence on presidential decisions .
Their authority is theirs , within the province of church affairs , and it ends where the affairs of the nation begin , ” Romney said .
He added : “ If I am fortunate to become your president , I will serve no one religion , no one group , no one cause and no one interest .
A president must serve only the common cause of the people of the United States . ”
It will be interesting to see watch the reaction to this speech .
On the whole , I thought that Romney did a pretty good job of answering the unjustified questions that some have asked about his faith — and this is coming from someone who opposes Romney ’s candidacy .
Whether that will be enough to change the minds of Evangelicals who continue to believe that Mormons are not Christians is another question .
As Andrew Sullivan notes , though , Romney ’s plea for religious tolerance has one very big gapping hole :
A president of the United States does not just represent people of all faiths , he also represents those who have none .
There is a lacuna in Romney ’s vision of religious tolerance , and it is a deliberate lacuna .
In order to appeal to evangelicals , he places himself on their side against the other : the secularists .
But that is simply another form of the religious test .
By insisting on faith – any faith – as the proper criterion for public office , Romney draws the line , oh - so - conveniently , so as to include Mormonism but exclude atheism and agnosticism .
And so he side - steps the critical issue in the debates over religion in public life : what if there is no unifying faith for a nation ?
What if faith itself cannot unify a nation – and , in fact , can divide it more deeply than any other subject ?
That is our reality .
An intelligent and wise conservative would try to find a path to a common discourse that does not rest on religious foundations .
Exactly .
And this is the problem with the Republican Party today .
Because it has tied it ’s fortunes to the continued loyalty of a group of people to whom religion is not only important , but who believe that the lack of religion is an sign of moral defectiveness , Romney turns the idea of religious tolerance on its head — under the new definition it does n’t mean that you ’re entitled to believe whatever you want , including nothing but that you are entitled to believe in something .
Romney is right to argue that being a Mormon does not make him less of an American , and that his faith should not be an issue in this political campaign .
In listening to his speech , though , its clear that he would not extend the same right to an athiest or an agnostic running for political office who believed in the American ideals of individual liberty and freedom of thought , but refused to believe in the civic religion that some Republicans seem to think exists in this country .
There ’s one more problem with Romney ’s argument and it lies in this quote from his speech today :
“ There are some who may feel that religion is not a matter to be seriously considered in the context of the weighty threats that face us .
If so , they are at odds with the nation ’s founders , for they , when our nation faced its greatest peril , sought the blessings of the Creator .
And further , they discovered the essential connection between the survival of a free land and the protection of religious freedom .
In John Adams ’ words :
‘ We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion …
Our constitution was made for a moral and religious people . ’
“ Freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom .
Freedom opens the windows of the soul so that man can discover his most profound beliefs and commune with God.
Freedom and religion endure together , or perish alone . ”
You ’re wrong there Governor .
Freedom , in the sense of individual liberty , does not require religion and more than it requires one to believe in the existence of extraterrestrials .
Individuals possess rights because of their nature as individuals , not because of doctrines established 1,000 years ago at a religious conference .
And , more importantly , one can believe in individual liberty without believing in any god .
Before he continues down the path that he laid out in his speech , perhaps Romney should consider the words of America ’s 3rd President :
Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God , that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship , that the legislative powers of government reach actions only , and not opinions , I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should ‘ make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof , ’ thus building a wall of separation between church and State .
It ’s time to extend that wall and separate religion and politics .

The industry believes cloning makes for predictable animals
After six years of study , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) ruled that meat and milk from cloned pigs , cattle and goats and their offspring is safe .
Lack of data meant the agency could not reach a decision on sheep products .
The FDA does not expect to see a lot of products from cloned animals being sold now , because of cost .
It expects clones would first be used for breeding .
The agency released almost identical draft conclusions in December 2006 .
Since then , new scientific information has strengthened its central view .
Just because something was created in a lab , does n't mean we should have to eat it
Senator Barbara Mikulski
The FDA will not require food derived from cloned animals to be labelled as such .
Low confidence
The agency was criticised by activist groups and by US politicians who were not convinced that enough scientific data was available to justify a decision .
" The FDA has acted recklessly , and I am profoundly disappointed in their rush to approve cloned foods , " said Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski , co-sponsor of a bill amendment passed by the US Senate which asked the FDA not to rule until further research was available .
" Just because something was created in a lab , does n't mean we should have to eat it . "
Her criticisms were echoed by Andrew Kimbrell of the Center for Food Safety , a prominent US pressure group .
" The FDA 's bull - headed action disregards the will of the public and the Senate and opens a literal Pandora 's Box , " he said .
Observers do not anticipate a rush to market cloned milk and meat
A survey in 2005 by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that two - thirds of US consumers were " uncomfortable " with animal cloning ; nearly half believed food from clones would be unsafe to eat .
Some US food companies have indicated they do not plan to stock products derived from cloned animals .
But Smithfields , which claims to be the biggest producer of pigs and pork products in the country , left the door open to a change of tack , saying it would " continue to monitor further scientific research on this technology " and was committed to improving its products " through careful selective breeding and genetic research " .
Breeders themselves expressed their approval .
" The biotechnology industry applauds the FDA for its comprehensive scientific review of this new assisted reproductive technology , " said Jim Greenwood , president and CEO of the Biotechnology Industry Organization ( Bio ) , which represents companies and institutions in the biotech field .
" Cloning ... can effectively help livestock producers deliver what consumers want : high - quality , safe , abundant and nutritious foods in a consistent manner . "
Delayed action
US authorities do not expect to see a wave of products derived from cloned animals on the shelves immediately .
Creating a clone is far more expensive than breeding animals conventionally .
The US Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) believes it is more likely that companies will produce clones with " desirable " traits , breed them , and bring products from the offspring into the food chain .
The USDA is asking companies not to market products immediately , but to continue observing the moratorium they agreed to in 2001 when the FDA began its deliberations .
" USDA encourages the cloning industry continue its voluntary moratorium for a sufficient period of time to prepare so that a smooth and seamless transition into the marketplace can occur , " it said in a statement .
The US developments will be watched closely in Europe , where evaulation of cloned animals is at an earlier stage .
Last week the European Food Safety Authority ( Efsa ) initiated a public consultation on its draft guidance .
The draft concluded , among other things , that :
foods from cloned pigs and cattle are essentially identical to those from conventionally bred animals
animal cloning is unlikely to have environmental impacts
there are health and welfare issues , but these are likely to diminish as technology progresses
The EU has indicated that if products from cloned animals were approved , they would have to be labelled .
This contrasts directly with the US position , opening up the possibility of trade disputes similar to the lengthy and costly row between the EU and US over genetically modified foods .

Genes may influence waking and sleeping patterns
Scientists have found that each cell of the body has an internal " clock " , which can be affected by various genes .
Research in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that skin cells can be used to measure the speed of a person 's body clock .
The work could lead to better diagnosis of sleep disorders and conditions such as Seasonal Affective Disorder .
Master clock
It has long been known that the body has a biological clock that regulates sleeping , digestion and brain performance to fit in with the different demands of day and night - time living .
It now appears that virtually all cells in the body have their own ticking circadian clock , including skin cells
Dr Simon Archer
University of Surrey
The brain has overall control of this time - keeping mechanism , but individual cells appear to have their own " clocks " , which can be affected by a series of clock genes .
A German -Swiss team led by Dr Steven Brown of the University of Zurich took skin biopsies from 28 volunteers and grew their cells up in the lab .
They measured how fast the " clocks " in the skin cells " ticked " , then compared these results with questionnaires showing whether each subject was an early type ( " lark " ) or a late type ( " owl " ) .
They found that the " clocks " in the skin cells matched up with behaviour in most of the subjects .
Some of the remaining volunteers appeared to be suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder ( Sad ) , a type of winter depression .
Sleep disorders
The work could be used as a basis for the diagnosis of certain sleep disorders , said Dr Simon Archer , Senior Lecturer in Molecular Neuroscience at the Surrey Sleep Research Centre at the University of Surrey , Guildford .
He said previous research at the University of Surrey had shown that genetic differences in clock genes could explain why some people are night lovers and others are early risers .
His group has identified a mutation in a gene known as Period3 that makes someone more likely to be a morning person .
The mutation makes them more prone to tiredness during the day , so they prefer to go to bed early .
Traditional studies of such genes have been carried out in controlled conditions in specialised sleep labs , and these are time - consuming and costly to perform .
" What Steve Brown has developed is a much more economic way of making some of those clock period measurements without having to keep people in a lab for three days , " Dr Archer explained .
" He basically takes a sample of their skin cells , keeps them alive in culture and measures the period of the oscillating clock genes . "
Molecular clues
The central circadian clock resides in the hypothalamus in the brain , he added .
It keeps in touch with the outside world by means of light signals from the eyes , and then synchronises numerous other peripheral clocks in tissues around the body such as the heart , liver and gut .
" The reason why the Brown experiment works is because it now appears that virtually all cells in the body have their own ticking circadian clock , including skin cells , " said Dr Archer .
" So , the skin cell assay is just a way of easily getting a handle on someone 's body clock .
But in more molecular detail than just knowing if they are a lark or an owl , which can be determined quite easily . "
Description :
The immense , awe - inspiring , Überschwerer Kampfschreitpanzer ( Superheavy Armored Walking Tank ) is thought to be the brainchild of notorious Nazi ( mad ) scientist Doctor Siegfried Qual , who built the initial prototype as a gift to Adolph Hitler .
However , considering Qual 's well - deserved reputation for intellectual prowess , it seems doubtful such an unworkable construct would have been devised by him .
Thus , several historians mention the infamous Dr. Clausenhausen ( a.k.a. Dr. Klanenhissen ) , Wehrmacht vunderkind and creator of a number of unique Nazi " wonder weapons , " as the true mind behind the Überschwerer Kampfschreitpanzer 's creation .
At any rate , the massive " Thor 's Hammers " first appeared on the eve of the German invasion of Russia .
Although the Wehrmacht felt they were far too big , slow , and vulnerable to be of any use , they appealed to Hitler 's vanity , and he authorized the construction of a series of the enormous walking machines .
When finally deployed they initially had quite a demoralizing effect on the Russian forces , since the twin 88 mm cannon ( mounted in the vehicle 's “ head ” ) were capable of wrecking any Russian tank encountering it .
As the war progressed , the Überschwerer Kampfschreitpanzers became less of an asset and more of a liability .
Their height made it nearly impossible to hide them , and at least one was totally destroyed and another wrecked beyond repair by a concentrated rocket attack from Katyusha multiple rocket launchers ( the so - called " Stalin's organ " )
Several others were damaged from artillery barrages , Russian dive bombers claimed another , and if reports are correct , one of the last Fortresses was taken by several P - 38 Lightning pilots , who brought it down with wing - mounted rockets .
The basic shape of a Überschwerer Kampfschreitpanzer was of a huge box - like structure , roughly 10 meters long , 5 meters high , and divided on the inside into two decks .
At one end was a semi- flexible " neck " ending in a heavily armored head .
Twin 88 mm
Flak cannon were mounted under the head .
They were aimed by swinging the head from side to side , and were often fired in alternating succession , since the killing power of the 88 was more than enough to take out most tanks with a single shot .
On the sides of the head , in blister turrets , was a single trainable machine - gun .
Two additional trainable machine - guns were mounted in the sides of the body and fired from pivot points with a small slit for sighting .
A fifth gun was set on the roof of the vehicle , as an antiaircraft defense ( although it was also useful for strafing tall buildings and the like ) .
The head and body were set on four 10 meter legs , driven by a powerful diesel engine and hydraulic actuators .
The entire vehicle weighed around 75 tons and was capable of a top speed of only 25 miles per hour , although to give the Überschwerer Kampfschreitpanzer credit where credit is due , this speed was fairly constant regardless of terrain .
Crew consisted of a commander , radioman , two pilots , a gunner ( for the 88s ) , two loaders , and upwards of 40 infantrymen , who would man the machine - guns as well as look after the engine .

Kristol defends ' widely mocked ' op - ed on ' why Bush will be a winner '
Will Menaker
Published : Monday July 16 , 2007 Print This Email This
In an online chat at Washingtonpost.com on Monday , neo - conservative pundit Bill Kristol discussed his recent op - ed piece , " Why Bush Will Be a Winner " in which he predicts the Bush presidency will be seen as successful .
The column has been widely mocked for its magical thinking from everyone from Arianna Huffington to Kristol 's fellow Time Magazine columnist Jay Carney .
Kristol urged Americans to " look at the broad forest rather than the often unlovely trees .
What do we see ?
First , no second terrorist attack on U.S. soil -- not something we could have taken for granted .
Second , a strong economy -- also something that was n't inevitable .
And third , and most important , a war in Iraq that has been very difficult , but where -- despite some confusion engendered by an almost meaningless ' benchmark ' report last week -- we now seem to be on course to a successful outcome . "
" What 's next ? " Time 's Carney asked .
" Promises that Iraqis will welcome new rotations of American G.I. 's with roses ? "
In his online chat , Kristol was taken to task almost immediately for his record of Iraq - related prognostication , with one reader asking , " you have been wrong about every important prediction you have made about the outcome of this war and this presidency -- why should anyone pay attention to you now ? "
To which Kristol responded , " Feel free not to ! "
When asked about the possibility that no significant progress will be made in Iraq by the time of Gen. Petraeus ' September report , Kristol stated that a troop draw - drown would be likely , saying , " it will be very , very difficult to sustain any support for the war , and the debate will be over how to get out . "
He was also confronted about his assertion that Bush is to be credited for the fact that there has been no follow - up terrorist attack in America since 9/11 .
One reader reminds him that terrorists operate on a different clock that we are used to , reminding Kristol that " they are incredibly patient , and just because no attack has occured since Sept. 11 , that is no indication that attacks are not planned . "
Another reader put it this way , " Ever since I bought this tiger - repelling rock I have not been attacked by a tiger , hence the rock is clearly working . "
Kristol maintained that most experts predicted a much greater level of success for terrorist attacks on America after 9/11 .
The battle in the Senate over how to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) begins on Monday when , over the objections of prominent Democrats , Majority Leader Harry Reid will introduce the White House–supported version of a reform bill approved in October by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence .
This past Tuesday , fourteen Democratic senators — including presidential contenders Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama , Joseph Biden , and Chris Dodd — signed a letter urging Reid to instead bring to the floor an alternative bill produced in November by the Judiciary Committee .
That version of the legislation , which will now be offered as an amendment to the Intelligence Committee 's bill , contained a variety of additional restrictions and checks on government wiretaps sought by civil liberties groups .
It also , crucially , omitted a provision granting telecom companies retroactive immunity from lawsuits related to their cooperation with the president 's extrajudicial eavesdropping program .
President Bush has pledged to veto any FISA amendment that failed to provide such immunity — a threat that did not deter the House from passing just such a bill last month .
Meanwhile , Senator Dodd , whose attempt to place a " hold " on the Intelligence Committee bill was overridden by Reid , is pledging to filibuster any legislation that does include retroactive immunity .
While Democrats have struggled to counteract a frustrated base 's perception of congressional capitulation to the White House , the executive branch has mounted a full court press in favor of its preferred version of the law .
In a Los Angeles Times op - ed on Wednesday , Attorney General Michael Mukasey warned that the changes made in the Judiciary Committee 's version of the bill " would have the collective effect of weakening the government 's ability to effectively surveil intelligence targets abroad . "
And on Thursday , Mukasey and Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell made their case directly to the Senate in a closed - door briefing .
With divisions sharp , various attempts to split the difference between the alternatives have fallen flat .
Reid had earlier sought , under the Senate 's Rule Fourteen , to offer a pair of his own bills mixing and matching provisions from the two committees , a solution that appears to have pleased nobody .
And on Thursday , the Judiciary Committee rejected a proposal by Senator Arlen Spector to allow lawsuits against the telecom companies to go forward , but with the government substituted as the defendant .
( The groups bringing the suits worry that the government would be able to invoke legal defenses , such as executive privilege and sovereign immunity , that are unavailable to private telecom providers . )
Michelle Richardson , a legislative consultant for the American Civil Liberties Union , hopes that this may be a strategic blunder on the administration 's part .
" A lot of people would probably support giving the government broader authority if they would decouple that issue from the immunity question , " says Richardson , " so they 're probably shooting themselves in the foot by forcing it to go forward like this . "
The current wrangling continues a debate that began this summer with the hasty passage of the Protect America
Act in response to a ruling by the FISA court — a ruling which the court has declined to release , but which is purported to have required intelligence agencies to acquire warrants when wiretapping conversations between foreign parties that were routed ( and recorded ) through US telecom switches .
Eavesdropping on purely foreign communications had previously been unrestricted — primarily because , traditionally , the physical tap on foreign - to - foreign calls had occurred overseas , outside US jurisdiction .
But the Protect America
Act , which is due to expire in February , went beyond merely closing this " intelligence gap " and authorized a broad program of surveillance , under minimal court oversight , that permits Americans ' conversations with foreigners to be collected , so long as the American party to the communication was not " targeted " by an investigation .
The bills now under consideration seek to establish a more permanent solution : the Intelligence Committee version of the FISA Amendment would remain in effect for six years , while the Judiciary Committee version sunsets in four .
While media attention has focused largely on the question of immunity for telecom firms , the additional limitations on surveillance contained in the Judiciary Committee 's version of the bill are , arguably , at least as significant .
That bill would explicitly bar " bulk " or " vacuum cleaner " surveillance of international telecom traffic that is not directed at a particular person or telephone number .
It would require individualized FISA court review whenever the collection of an American 's communications became a " significant purpose " of an investigation , whether or not that person was a " target " of the investigation .
And it would provide for a congressional audit of past extrajudicial surveillance by the National Security Agency .
A spokesman for Reid says the majority leader hopes to be able to send a bill to conference before Congress adjourns for winter recess , though some observers find this unlikely , and civil liberties groups are anxious to avoid a repetition of the sort of last - minute legislation that produced the Protect America Act .
Meanwhile , some civil libertarians are already casting an eye toward the next battle .
" We 're going to keep fighting to get the important judicial protections in , the immunity out , but if we can't do those things we 're going to get as many no votes on the final product as possible , " says the ACLU 's Richardson .
" We do n't want the members owning this bill , owning this program , so that when it finally does sunset we can get meaningful changes . "

In a previous post I mentioned that if you are the type of person who focuses on personal productivity , you probably should n’t be working for someone else .
I wanted to explain why .
Many people focus on being highly productive , but no one seems to talk about how to actually benefit from being more productive .
Sure you can make your boss really like you , but just because you are helping your employer be more efficient does n’t mean you are going to see any personal benefit–other than being well liked .
How Businesses Make Money
Businesses make money by selling items or services for more than it costs them to produce those items or services .
The dry cleaner may charge you $ 2.00 per shirt , which is probably at least twice what it costs them to actually clean the shirt .
If you are paying for their services then $ 2.00 must be less than the value of your time to do it yourself .
In most businesses , they make money not because their employees are highly motivated pinnacles of productivity , but because they have a good system in place .
The employee that cleans your shirt is n’t necessarily any more productive than you .
However , they have access to equipment that you do n’t have and have a procedure for cleaning and pressing the shirts that allow them to do it more efficiently than you could yourself .
So it is n’t necessarily their personal productivity that allows the business to make money , but the productivity that comes from following the business system using the business tools .
Some businesses make money by having employees that will work for a much smaller amount of pay than what the company can get away with charging .
Consider the recent lawyer graduate who works for $ 75 per hour for a firm that bills them out at $ 275 per hour .
The firm provides assistance and gets clients that the lawyer probably could n’t get on their own , but when it comes down to it , the work the lawyer does is much more valuable to the client than the amount the lawyer is being paid .
When You Should Consider Starting Your Own Business
If in your employment you fit with the dry cleaner example , you probably should n’t go out and try to start a business .
The individual working for the dry cleaner is making money by following a process–not by being particularly efficient or productive .
However , if you fit in the young lawyer category , you are unlikely to be paid what your time is actually worth .
If you are highly motivated and really focus on being productive and efficient you will make a great deal of money for your employer , but very little of that will ever make it to your pocket .
Consider this :
If you are able to refine your productivity habits to the point that you are twice as productive in your line of work than the average employee , how much more do you think you will be paid ?
How likely is it that your employer will pay you double what your co-worker makes even if you produce twice as much ?
It is very unlikely .
In a large business it is very unlikely that you ’ll end up making even 15 % more than an equivalent co-worker based on your higher productivity .
Benefiting from Higher Productivity
If you really want to benefit from being a highly productive individual you will have to go into business for yourself .
A highly productive employee that only costs 10 % more than an average employee is an employers dream .
It is like getting an extra employee almost for free–especially after you take into account the additional cost of benefits , vacation time , etc .
This is n’t to say you should just quit and go into business for yourself .
Starting a business is a difficult undertaking .
There may be valuable things you can still learn from your current employer and getting paid to learn is always a good financial choice .
But , your long term goal ( if you want to really benefit from being productive ) needs to be putting yourself in a position where your ability to do more work translates into a bigger paycheck .
Why People Do n’t Start Their Own Business
Starting a business can be scary .
Leaving a steady paycheck and insurance benefits and depending on your own ability to run a business is n’t something you should do lightly and it is n’t something you should do without some serious study .
You have to understand what you are doing .
The great thing about already having a job is that you can learn about starting your business while you work for someone else–in many cases you can even start your business while you are still an employee .
To start your own business you ’ll eventually need to get over your fears and step out .
This is n’t for everyone , but if you are serious about being productive it is probably the only way for you to really benefit from your investment in yourself ( unless making your employer very very happy is enough of a reward for you already ) .

Computer discs containing patient details have gone missing .
Hundreds of thousands of adults and children are thought to be affected by the breaches , which emerged as part of a government - wide data security review .
The Department of Health says patients have been told and there is no evidence data has fallen into the wrong hands .
It follows losses of millions of child benefit claimant and driver details .
Archive records
The Sunday Mirror reports that one of the breaches was thought to involve the loss of names and addresses of 160,000 children by City and Hackney Primary Care Trust , after a disc failed to arrive at an east London hospital .
I think it 's the tip of the iceberg , actually , because there 's such carelessness within the NHS

Another , lost by Gloucester Partnership Foundation Trust , consisted of archive records relating to patients treated 40 years ago - none of whom is still alive .
The details of what data has been lost by the other trusts have not been disclosed .
The other trusts involved are Bolton Royal Hospital , Sutton and Merton PCT , Sefton Merseyside PCT , Mid-Essex Care Trust , and Norfolk and Norwich .
The East and North Hertfordshire Trust reported a loss but has since found its missing data .
Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS
Trust has reported two breaches - meaning that 10 cases have occurred in total .
' Scandal '
The Department of Health said the security breaches were being dealt with locally , and it did not have details of how many patients were affected .
It said investigations were under way , and action would be taken against anyone who had failed to fulfil their responsibilities under data protection laws .
Shadow health secretary Andrew Lansley said : " You have to wonder why on earth it took the Revenue and Customs to lose their discs and for government to institute an inquiry across government for these losses of data to come to light .
" It does feel like there 's a sense in government , all parts of government , that we 're required to provide data and we are constantly told that it will be protected , but in reality that level of protection simply is n't there . "

And Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb said : " The whole culture of data management in the public sector has to change . "
Dr Richard Vautrey , of the British Medical Association , told BBC News 24 there was a strong case for patients having their information available when they see doctors in different medical situations .
But he said : " It 's vitally important that any development of centralised systems is done in a careful and measured way . "
Dr Vautrey said he did not think the treatment of patients whose data had been lost would be affected , but it would be damaging if patients became reluctant to be fully open with their doctors .
" Government does need to prove that we can trust it in the way that it holds information . "
Joyce Robins , from the patient support group Patient Care , said ministers could not gloss over yet another " scandal " .
She said : " Every week we hear of a new one .
Health records can have anything from your ex-directory phone number to your HIV status .
" I think it 's the tip of the iceberg , actually , because there 's such carelessness within the NHS and it 's always impossible to hold anyone to account and find out who 's actually done anything . "
Other incidents
NHS chief executive David Nicholson recently wrote to NHS managers reminding them of their responsibilities with regard to data handling .
A DoH spokesperson said : " Since the recent heightened concern about data protection a small number of trusts ( nine ) have reported breaches of their own security rules .
" There are strict guidelines and procedures for dealing with such breaches . "
Police are still searching for two computer discs containing the names , addresses , dates of birth and bank account details of every child benefit claimant after it emerged they had been lost in the post by HM Revenue and Customs in November .
Then on Monday it was revealed the details of three million learner drivers had also been lost after being sent to Iowa in America 's mid-west .

An Essay on Inconsistencies in the Bible
Mark D. Ball , Ph.D .
" The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is reason , " says Thomas Paine in the preface to his treatise on religion , The Age of Reason .
In this day of cancerous acrimony across political , ideological , and , especially , religious spectra , Paine 's words have never been more apropos .
To achieve peaceful coexistence in a shrinking world , reason must be the medium of exchange among people of differing views .
Religionists and non-religionists alike must beware the fallacy of converse accident in characterizing each other , remembering that " if you 've seen one , you have n't necessarily seen them all " .
In that spirit , this essay seeks to challenge a particular mind - set in the Christian community , one that is not universal among professing Christians , but a mind - set nonetheless tonitrual in the public arena .
For many Christians , the Bible is the infallible and internally consistent revealed Word of God .
Every word therein , though penned by a man , God himself inspired .
Every verse not only harmonizes with every other but also accords with the laws of Nature .
One should not doubt the Bible , but endeavor to understand it , to glean the Truth from its pages .
Any perceived errors or inconsistencies in the Bible are problems not with the book , but with the interpretation of the person reading it .
To exemplify this particular mind - set , I offer the words of a Christian minister , who , directing this disquieting remark at listeners skeptical about the supernatural , said , " You 've been educated , and that 's a shame " [ 1 ] .
As I intend to argue , however , many " perceived " contradictions are true ones , and efforts to reconcile disparate verses often involve contortions of reasoning , amounting to what one might euphemistically call " creative interpretation " .
Despite its imperfection , though , the Bible is a valuable book , rich with accounts of historical events and with insightful apothegms .
The Bible affords us glimpses of antiquity , and in its stories , whether factual or fictional , one finds the elements of great literature : comedy and tragedy , triumph and defeat , hope and despair , hedonism and asceticism , war and peace , heroism and poltroonery , virtue and vice , reason and faith , and so on .
Perhaps the Bible assuages the fear of mortality or of being otherwise alone in the universe .
Perhaps the Bible prevents societal chaos , through its many mandates and proscriptions , which the promise of heavenly reward and the threat of eternal punishment reinforce .
Whatever the reason for the Bible 's appeal , though , it has regrettably supplanted critical thinking in the minds of too many people .
No single book should have a hammerlock on the human mind .
Even the Christian apologist Elton Trueblood believed " It is the vocation of the Christian in every generation to outthink all opposition " [ 2 ] .
This essay examines biblical incongruity within four specific issues : the goodness of God , the requirements for salvation , vowing , and the relationship among fear , love , and punishment .
Although the Bible is replete with references to God 's goodness , many scriptures reveal him as shockingly cruel .
Indeed ,
God himself confesses to being capable of evil in Jer. 18:8 .
The believer might dismiss these inconsistencies as only " apparent " ones , which , upon closer examination , prove not to be inconsistencies at all , whereas another believer might dismiss them simply by citing humankind 's inability to comprehend God 's actions or to ascertain his motivation .
The question : is God good , or is he not ?
Ex. 34:6 describes
God with a string of glowing adjectives that should dispel any doubt :
... The Lord , The Lord God , merciful and gracious , longsuffering , and abundant in goodness [ 3 ] and truth
Similar praise comes from David in Ps. 145:7-9 :
They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness , and shall sing of thy righteousness .
The Lord is gracious , and full of compassion ; slow to anger , and of great mercy .
The Lord is good to all : and his tender mercies are over all his works .
Of course , understanding any Biblical passage requires , at the very least , understanding its component words ( and some would argue that such understanding further requires guidance by the Spirit ) .
The multitude of religious denominations and sects present in the world bears witness to the inevitable conflict arising from the Bible 's use of abstract , polysemous , and pliable words .
Dictionaries define the word " good " , for example , as " virtuous " , " honorable " , " right " , and " benevolent " .
Despite the plasticity of these words , though , there is a consensus among rational people , believers and nonbelievers , about the notions that these words represent .
If so , then , what is goodness -- and what is it specifically in a human - to - human context ?
Many people define goodness in terms of certain actions , such as feeding the hungry , sheltering the homeless , treating the ill , or educating the ignorant .
For others , goodness is found in the willingness to risk one 's life for another , perhaps by serving as a soldier , firefighter , or police officer .
Some see goodness as neatly encapsulated in the aphorism " live and let live " , whereas others salute the ancient Golden Rule ( which , by the way , Lev. 19:18 paraphrases ) .
Although these various notions of goodness , and others not mentioned , are different prima facie , their common motif is simple : respect for human life .
Nearly all people agree that the unjustified taking of human life or the intentional inflicting of pain and suffering on human beings , especially innocent ones , is evil ( even people who argue that warfare is sometimes justifiable call it " a necessary evil " ) .
Thus , what may be easier than defining " goodness " in terms of what it is , is defining " goodness " in terms of what it is not , or in terms of attitudes , behaviors , and actions that it does not encompass .
Clearly , goodness does not encompass such crimes as murder , rape , enslavement , or child abuse .
On this point , humanity can be proud of a strong consensus ( even though what humanity preaches is sometimes diametrical to what it practices ) .
This proposition becomes the first premise in a syllogism with the conclusion of which most believers , and nonbelievers for whom a hypothetical God must be worthy of worship , would not disagree .
Goodness does not include murder , rape , enslavement , or child abuse .
God is " abundant in goodness " ( Ex. 34:6 ) , his goodness is " great " ( Ps. 145:7 ) , and he " is good to all " ( Ps. 145:9 ) .
Therefore , God does not engage in murder , rape , enslavement , or child abuse .
The Bible itself itemizes exclusions from goodness in Gal. 5:19 - 23 , many so - called " works of the flesh " .
Among them , not surprisingly , are murder , as well as certain attitudes and behaviors that can culminate in murder : hatred , variance ( discord ) , emulations ( ambitious rivalry ) , wrath , strife , seditions , and others .
Because murder is listed only as one of several works of the flesh , however , the others are also presumably antipodal to goodness , i.e. , goodness excludes them whether or not they culminate in murder .
Sharply contrasted with these " works of the flesh " in this passage is " the fruit of the Spirit " , comprising several virtues listed in verses 22 and 23 : " love , joy , peace , longsuffering , gentleness , goodness [ 4 ] , faith , Meekness , [ and ] temperance " ( my italics ) .
By collecting goodness and parallel virtues in a passage clearly distinct from the one in which he collects murder and parallel vices , the author of Galatians confirms the irreconcilability of goodness and murder , of goodness and wrath , etc .
The Bible is rife with examples of God 's acting in a manner inconsistent with goodness .
Revisiting the syllogism above , consider the passage relating the story of Israel 's war with Midian ( Num. 31 ) , wherein , as I intend to show , God sanctions the very crimes that he should abhor , namely , murder , rape , enslavement , and child abuse .
First , he orders Moses to lead Israel in a war against the Midianites :
And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying , Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites ... ( vss. 1 - 2 )
Moses and the children of Israel obey :
And they warred against the Midianites , as the Lord commanded Moses ; and they slew all the males .
( vs. 7 , my italics )
The slaying continues in verse 8 .
Then in verse 9 , the children of Israel take captive all the Midianite women and children , confiscating as well " the spoil of all their cattle , and all their flocks , and all their goods . "
Eventually , the captives are brought before Moses , who condemns to death all the male children and all the unvirginal women :
Now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him .
( vs. 17 )
Moses then encourages his men to use the female children for ( presumably ) sexual pleasure :
But all the women children , that have not known a man by lying with him , keep alive for yourselves .
( vs. 18 )
Thus , in the 31st Chapter of Numbers occur God-sanctioned murder , rape , enslavement , and child abuse .
First ,
God specifically orders the war -- he does not simply allow the Israelites to visit pain , suffering , and death upon another people , in which case God 's role would be a passive one -- on the contrary , he assumes an active role by demanding the carnage .
Second , all the men are summarily killed .
Third , all the Midianite boys and unvirginal women are ordered to their deaths .
Fourth , the Israelite men are urged to ( presumably ) enslave and rape the virgin Midianite girls .
Most civilized people abhor all such actions as these ( with less accord on the issue of war itself ) , considering them so evil that they must be prevented , even at high cost , and punished when efforts at prevention fail .
Murder is still a capital crime in many states , imprisonment is the punishment for rape , the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution forbids slavery , and convicted child abusers face not only incarceration but also a stigma , arguably deserved , that will follow them perhaps their entire lives .
Although the believer must concede God 's demanding the war , he or she may still reject the notion that God sanctioned the postbellum savagery of Moses and the Israelites .
Whereas verses 1 , 2 , and 7 state clearly that God ordered the war , the believer may insist that what happened to the Midianite captives after the war was ordered by Moses , not by God.
Verses 8 - 18 do not explicitly implicate God in the atrocities inflicted on the captives -- Moses issues the orders .
Nonetheless , it is not less than sanction to intervene in the affairs of Israel and Midian to start the war , while not intervening on behalf of the helpless victims to palliate their pain .
If God does intervene in human affairs , and is abundant in goodness , then surely he intervenes not to start wars , but to stop them .
Surely he intervenes not to cause pain and suffering , but to end it .
Thus , because God was willing to intervene to demand the war , his refusal to intercede afterwards , i.e. , his postbellum silence , must be tacit approval of the Israelites ' cruelty toward the Midianites .
Although the believer may still correctly argue that silence is not necessarily endorsement , harder evidence for God 's approval comes in verses 25 - 30 , in his directing the distribution of the spoils , which include the captives :
And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying , Take the sum of the prey that was taken , both of man and of beast ... And divide the prey ... " ( vss. 25 - 27 )
This explicit command from God punctuates his earlier tacit approval .
Instead of rebuking Moses and the Israelites for their violence against the Midianites , he rewards them with the plunder .
Clearly , God approves of Moses ' treatment of the Midianite captives .
Neither God nor Moses has mercy on the most helpless and innocent of the Midianites , the women and children .
Such mercilessness cannot be reconciled with Eph. 2:4 , which declares that God is " rich in mercy " , or with Ps. 145:9 , which claims he " is good to all " and which mentions his " tender mercies " , or with Ex. 34:6 , which calls him " merciful " , or with Deu. 32:4 , which calls him " just and right " .
Neither can such mercilessness be reconciled with the spirit of Jesus ' own words :
... Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren , ye have done it unto me .
( Mat. 25:40 )
Darkening the scenario further is God 's reason for the war , namely , vengeance ( vs. 2 ) .
To even the score , God initiated a chain of events that would earn for any human world leader the status of a villain .
Even though 1 Jn. 4:8 equates
God with love [ 5 ] , Lev. 19:18 proclaims the irreconcilability of love and revenge :
Thou shalt not avenge , nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people , but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself : I am the Lord . ( my italics )
Instead , according to the Bible , love entails forgiveness :
He that covereth a transgression seeketh love ...
[ NIV :
He who covers over an offense promotes love ... ]
( Pro. 17:9 )
The pivot point in Lev. 19:18 is the disjunction " but " , placing vengeance and love on opposite sides of the line demarcating goodness from non -goodness .
This scripture presents love and vengeance as mutually exclusive propositions : one who engages in activity mentioned before the " but " in this sentence is not engaging in activity mentioned after the " but " , and vice versa .
Of course , the famous biblical passage on love ( 1 Cor. 13 ) also plays at cross-purposes with God 's role in the Midian affair .
With revenge as his motive , God is acting contrary to goodness and peace , at least according to Gal. 5:22 .
His action clashes thunderously with several unambiguous biblical directives on dealing with one 's enemies :
... Love [ 6 ] your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use you , and persecute you ... ( Mt. 5:44 ) And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other ... ( Lk. 6:29 ) Therefore if thine enemy hunger , feed him ; if he thirst , give him drink : for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head .
Be not overcome of evil , but overcome evil with good .
( Rom . 12:20 -21 )
God 's reported behavior in the Bible is dichotomous .
God is love in the New Testament , but does not seem to be so in the Old Testament .
He is praised as merciful in some passages , while he withholds mercy in others , even from the helpless and innocent .
Finally , vengeance seems to motivate him , notwithstanding precepts to the contrary elsewhere in the Bible .
Oddly enough , Jesus declares in Mk. 10:18 that only God is good [ 7 ] .
According to 1 Tim. 4:4 [ 8 ] , however , " every creature of God is good " ( my italics ) .
Admittedly , this equivocation arises from the use of the same English word for rendering two different Greek words .
Along this line , the believer may defend God 's actions in the Midian affair as inherently good , claiming they were only apparently bad because man , being flawed , cannot discern the goodness in them ( i.e. , God works in mysterious ways ) .
In effect , then , the believer would be arguing that child abuse may per se be good under some circumstances or may per se be bad but , by leading to some good that only God understands , is sometimes acceptable .
Either of these two scenarios is morally obnoxious .
Furthermore , forget not the Lord 's own confession about his being capable of evil :
If that nation , against whom I have pronounced , turn from their evil , I will repent of the evil [ 9 ] that I thought to do unto them .
( Jer. 18:8 )
The 31st chapter of Numbers , however , is not the only scripture in which God 's behavior is morally puzzling .
The 19th chapter of Genesis is another , the famous story of Sodom , Gomorrah , and Lot .
This narrative begins with two angels of the Lord arriving at Sodom ( Gen. 19:1 ) , which city the Lord will soon destroy because its people fornicate ( Jud. vs. 7 ) , unless he finds at least ten righteous people living there ( Gen. 18:32 ) .
[ Earlier in Gen. 18:20 - 21 , the Lord turns a phrase curiously .
In explaining his intentions to Abraham concerning Sodom and Gomorrah , the Lord seems to admit to ignorance of the situation in those cities :
And the Lord said , Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great , and because their sin is very grievous ; I will go down now , and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it , which is come unto me ; and if not , I will know .
( my italics )
In no uncertain terms , the Lord confesses to not knowing , even as he speaks , just how unrighteous Sodom and Gomorrah are .
He is going down to " see " , to ascertain , the degree of the two cities ' sinfulness , because he does not know .
Punctuating these words , the Lord then states plainly that he will know , meaning , of course , that he does not know at present .
The theological conundrum arising from this confession is self - evident : how could God be omniscient and unaware of something simultaneously ? ]
The two angels newly arrived in Sodom encounter the man Lot , who persuades them to spend the night in his house ( vss. 2 - 3 ) .
Later that evening , the men of Sodom surround Lot 's house , demanding that he surrender the two men to them for sexual purposes :
And they called unto Lot ... Where are the men which came in to thee this night ?
bring them out unto us , that we may know them .
( vs. 5 )
Hoping to placate the men of Sodom at his door , Lot then offers his two virgin daughters to them instead , encouraging the men to do as they please with the girls :
... let me , I pray you , bring them out unto you , and do ye to them as is good in your eyes ... ( vs. 8 )
Then becoming violent , the men of Sodom try to break into Lot 's house , but the angels stop the men by striking them blind .
The next morning , because the angels will soon destroy Sodom and its denizens , they urge Lot to flee with his wife and daughters to escape the cataclysm .
Ironically , the Bible then says that the Lord was merciful to Lot ( vs. 16 ) , merciful to a man who offered his own daughters to be raped ( vs. 8 ) !
The enigma here is not so much the apparent forgiveness of Lot , but the inconsistency .
Why would God , merciful and gracious ( Ex. 34:6 ) , and full of compassion ( Ps. 145:8 ) , show mercy to such a man as Lot , but withhold mercy from the innocent Midianite women and children ?
God has condemned the innocent but pardoned the guilty , despite his being extolled as " just " in Is. 45:21 and Deu. 32:4 .
Perhaps the believer is tempted to defend
Lot by claiming that he had no choice but to offer his daughters to the men of Sodom .
Had he been a respectable father , however , Lot would have protected from the aggressors not only his visitors , but his daughters as well , and by physical force if necessary .
Instead ,
Lot cowers to the men of Sodom , offering his daughters to them in verse 8 .
In a parallel with Israel 's treatment of the Midianite captives , discussed above , God rewards Lot 's turpitude and cowardice by sparing him from annihilation , as he rewards the Israelites for their cruelty by granting them the spoils of war .
Punishment by fire is yet another response to transgression that most civilized people regard as draconian .
Even advocates of " an eye for an eye " justice would reserve such drastic retribution as fire for the most heinous crimes .
Although one could argue easily that murder , rape , enslavement , and child abuse are indeed heinous crimes ( and this list of four is certainly not exhaustive ) , whether burning at the stake is a suitable punishment even for these offenses is , at the very least , debatable .
What transcends debate , however , is the gross absurdity of treating breaches of courtesy , and other comparatively minor transgressions , as capital crimes .
Nonetheless , in Num .
11:1 the Lord punishes some querulous Israelites by killing them with fire -- not for a heinous crime like murder , rape , enslavement , or child abuse -- not even for a crime -- but for the act of complaining :
And when the people complained , it displeased the Lord : and the Lord heard it ; and his anger was kindled ; and the fire of the Lord burnt among them , and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp .
The people were complaining about their circumstances , including culinary ones , recalling the fish , cucumbers , melons , leeks , onions , and garlic that they evidently had enjoyed in Egypt ( Num. 11:5 ) , despite their captivity there .
He again punishes the Israelites for complaining in Num. 21 , though not by fire this time , but by snakebite :
And the people spake against God , and against Moses , Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness ?
for there is no bread , neither is there any water ; and our soul loatheth this light bread .
And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people , and they bit the people ; and much people of Israel died .
( vss. 5 - 6 )
In punishing complaining with fire and snakebite , God is not only acting contrary to the myriad biblical characterizations of him as good , just , and merciful , but he is also , and perhaps more notably , ranking the impropriety of complaining as worse than the crimes of murder , rape , enslavement , and child abuse .
Thus , not only does complaining become a capital crime , but a capital crime for which fire and snakebite are seemingly fitting penalties .
To justify this gradation of wrongs , the believer might reply that it is not the admittedly trivial offense of complaining per se for which God punishes the Israelites ; rather , he punishes them for some substantial transgression that manifests in their complaining -- perhaps ingratitude for the Lord 's having delivered them from bondage in Egypt , or a lack of faith that the Lord will thereafter meet their needs .
Are ingratitude and faithlessness , however , capital crimes commensurate with murder ?
What transgression implicit in these two passages from Numbers is more egregious than rape , enslavement , or child abuse , the last of which encompasses offering one 's own daughters to be raped ?
Child abuse is a recurring theme in the Old Testament , with both God and his prophets seeming to lack the respect due children in general .
God 's role in the killing of the Midianite children , and of the children who presumably lived in Sodom and Gomorrah as well , I have discussed already .
In Lev. 26:22 God threatens to " send wild beasts among [ the Israelites ] , which shall rob [ them ] of [ their ] children ... " , and in Jer. 6:11 the prophet warns that even children are not exempt from the Lord 's wrath :
Therefore I am full of the fury of the Lord ; I am weary with holding it in : I will pour it out upon the children abroad ...
[ NIV : But I am full of the wrath of the Lord , and I cannot hold it in .
" Pour it out on the children in the street ... " ]
Later , in the 18th chapter of Jeremiah , the prophet angrily urges the Lord to starve , and then slaughter , the children of certain unrepentent wayward Israelites :
Therefore deliver up their children to the famine , and pour out their blood by the force of the sword ... ( vs. 21 )
The reasons for Jeremiah 's gruesome petition are ( a ) the refusal of the children 's parents to heed the prophet 's admonitions ( vs. 18 ) , ( b ) the parents ' plotting against him ( vs. 18 ) , and ( c ) the parents ' ingratitude for his prior intercession with the Lord on their behalf ( vs. 20 ) .
The principle that punishment should befall the transgressor 's innocent child ( ren ) pervades the Old Testament , even though the Lord decrees that
... The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , nor the children be put to death for the fathers ; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
( 2 Ki. 14:6 ; also 2 Ch. 25:4 )
Echoing this passage are Jer. 31:29-30 and the entire 18th chapter of Ezekiel , the essence of which this excerpt captures :
... The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father ... ( Ezek. 18:20 )
Speaking to Moses , the Lord himself breaches those very words by promising to punish children for their fathers ' evil :
... visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children , and upon the children 's children , unto the third and to the fourth generation .
( Ex. 34:7 )
In contrariety to 2 Ch. 25:4 , Jer. 31:29 - 30 , and Ezek. 18 stands Ex. 20:5 , in which God ordains vicarious punishment :
... for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me ...
Innocent children suffer not only in Num. 31 , discussed above , but also in 1 Sam. 15 , where God orders Saul to lead Israel against the Amalekites to exact revenge :
Now go and smite Amalek , and utterly destroy all that they have , and spare them not ; but slay both man and woman , infant and suckling , ox and sheep , camel and ass .
( vs. 3 , my italics )
The children of froward priests are not safe either :
Behold , I will corrupt your seed , and spread dung upon your faces ...
[ NIV : Because of you I will rebuke your descendants ; I will spread on your faces the offal from your festival sacrifices ... ]
( Mal. 2:3 )
Moses explains
God 's targeting of Egyptian children :
And it came to pass , when Pharoah would hardly let us go , that the Lord slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt ... ( Ex . 13:15 )
In Ps. 109 is still another call for children to suffer for the sins of their fathers .
Rather than killing them in this case , though , David wants the children to beg for food in the streets ( vs. 10 ) , after they have been made " fatherless " ( vs. 9 ) .
Another striking example is Ps. 137 , wherein the psalmist unabashedly advocates the violent murdering of children as retaliation for their fathers ' sins :
O daughter of Babylon , who art to be destroyed ; happy shall he be , that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us .
Happy shall he be , that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones .
( vss. 8 - 9 )
To be sure , this psalm is macabre .
The choice of adjective for the man smashing children against rocks in this passage clearly calls into question not only the psalmist 's moral values but also his mental health .
This scripture , which God himself purportedly inspired , teaches that , at least when righteous indignation is the motivation , happiness can derive from savagery directed against children if their parents consequently suffer .
This precept , an affront to decency , is wholly irreconcilable with the notion of God 's infinite goodness .
In Gen. 22 God tests Abraham 's loyalty by ordering him to kill Isaac , his own son , sacrificially .
The believer might argue that because the Lord intervenes before the knife breaks Isaac 's flesh , the act is not one of child abuse , and in God 's eyes , Abraham 's readiness to plunge the knife into his son obviates the actual slaying .
Nonetheless , Isaac is an innocent victim of both God 's truculent megalomania and Abraham 's blind obsequiousness .
First , Abraham lies to Isaac when the boy asks about a lamb for the intended offering :
... but where is the lamb for a burnt offering ?
And Abraham said , My son , God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering : so they went both of them together .
( vss. 7 -8 )
Although a lamb does appear eventually ( vs. 13 ) , Abraham is not expecting one .
Second , Abraham ties up Isaac and lays him on an ad hoc altar :
And they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Abraham built an altar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar upon the wood .
( vs. 9 )
Third , Isaac presumably watches his father prepare to plunge the knife into him :
And Abraham stretched forth his hand , and took the knife to slay his son .
( vs. 10 )
Despite the Lord 's intervening at this juncture to stop Abraham , Isaac is already a victim of cruelty , having been bound and placed on an altar by his own father , and now fully expecting to be killed by him at any moment .
Neither God nor Abraham respects Isaac 's intrinsic value as a human being or his comparative innocence as a child .
In this passage , Isaac 's value to God derives only from his usefulness as a tool .
Because God sees him as something Abraham cherishes ( vs. 2 ) , Isaac becomes a means for God to evaluate Abraham 's faithfulness .
Furthermore , notwithstanding the trauma that Isaac suffers during this ritual , God rewards Abraham for obedience :
And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham ...
And said ... because thou hast done this thing , and hast not withheld thy son , thine only son ...
I will bless thee ... ( vss. 15 - 17 , my italics )
Either God is unaware of Isaac 's torment , or , despite being aware , he regards faithfulness as more important than a child 's peace of mind .
An omniscient God , however , would not be unaware of Isaac 's torment , and an infinitely good God would not psychologically torture an innocent child for any reason , least of all to ascertain the father 's faithfulness to an omniscient God who should already know whether or not the father is faithful .
By his own admission , in fact , God 's reason for ordering the sacrifice is ignorance , which the angel of the Lord reveals after intervening :
Lay not thine hand upon the lad , neither do thou any thing unto him : for now I know that thou fearest God , seeing thou hast not withheld thy son , thine only son from me .
( vs. 12 , my italics )
This scripture is unequivocal .
God was uncertain about Abraham 's faithfulness until the latter had proven his willingness to sacrifice Isaac .
Omniscience and ignorance remain mutually exclusive states .
More behavior inconsistent with God 's image as the paragon of goodness underlies the eschatology of Revelation .
Consider Rev. 9:3 - 5 , for example , which foretells torture in the last days for those without God 's seal on their foreheads :
And there came ... locusts upon the earth : and unto them was given power , as the scorpions of the earth have power .
( vs. 3 ) And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads .
( vs. 4 ) And to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tormented five months : and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion , when he striketh a man .
[ NIV :
They were not given power to kill them , but only to torture them for five months ... ] ( vs. 5 , my italics )
The torture is indeed deliberate .
Verse 5 squarely declares that torture itself , not death , is the express objective , and verse 6 reiterates it :
And in those days shall men seek death , and shall not find it ; and shall desire to die , and death shall flee from them .
The believer might argue that , in the last days , those without God 's seal deserve this comeuppance ; such people , after all , are God 's enemies .
But who are these people without God 's seal on their foreheads ?
Two chapters earlier , Rev. 7:3 broadly identifies the recipients of the seal as " the servants of our God " , whereas verses 4 - 8 specifically identify them as 144,000 " children of Israel " from the twelve tribes .
The author of Revelation continues by describing his vision of " a great multitude " of people , people " of all nations " , standing " before the throne " ( vs. 9 ) , who serve God ( vs. 15 ) , and who have made their robes " white in the blood of the Lamb " ( vs. 14 ) , i.e. , they have accepted Jesus as their redeemer ( see Rom. 3:25 ) .
Consequently , if the multitude bears
God 's seal , then being a servant of God ( Rev. 7:15 ) must require salvation through faith in Jesus Christ .
Does this mean , then , that unsaved people who otherwise qualify as " good " , are doomed to five months of torture in the last days ?
The relationship between salvation and goodness is unclear .
The plurality of Christian denominations in the world bears witness to the Bible 's lack of clarity on the requirements for entry into heaven ( i.e. , for salvation ) , and this confusion , in turn , arises from a bewildering web of scriptural incongruities .
Jesus himself enunciates the requirements for salvation in the 3rd chapter of John :
vs. 3 , " ... Except a man be born again [ 10 ] , he can not see the kingdom of God " ; vs. 5 , " ... Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of God " ; vs. 15 , " ... whosoever believeth [ 11 ] in [ the Son of man ] should not perish , but have eternal life " ; vs. 16 , " ... whosoever believeth [ 11 ] in [ God 's son ] should not perish , but have everlasting life " ; vs. 18 , " He that believeth [ 11 ] on [ God 's son ] is not condemned : but he that believeth not is condemned already ... " .
John the Baptist echoes :
vs. 36 , " He that believeth [ 11 ] on the Son hath everlasting life : and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life ; but the wrath of God abideth on him . "
Whereas verses 3 and 5 are nebulous , all the others specify the key to salvation as belief in Jesus as the Christ , as the Son of God , as the Son of Man. Mk. 16:16 , coupling verses 3 and 5 with the others , specifies the conjunct of belief and baptism as the qualification for eternal life :
He that believeth [ 11 ] and is baptized shall be saved ; but he that believeth not shall be damned .
( my italics )
Silent about baptism , verses 15 , 16 , 18 , and 36 above point to belief as the necessary and sufficient condition for salvation , in contrast both to Mk. 16:16 and to verses 3 and 5 above .
Belief in Jesus Christ is cardinal according to other verses as well .
In Ac. 16:30 - 31 , for example , Paul and Silas ' jailer asks them how he may be saved , to which query they reply
Believe [ 11 ] on the Lord Jesus Christ , and thou shalt be saved ...
In Jn. 6:47 , Jesus himself says
... He that believeth [ 11 ] on me hath everlasting life .
Other verses confirming the centrality of belief ( faith ) are Heb .
10:38 - 39 , 2 Tim. 3:14 - 15 , and 1 Pet. 1:9 .
Belief is so important that the Bible even proscribes the extension of ordinary hospitality to anyone not embracing the " doctrine of Christ " ( 2 Jn. vss. 9-10 ) .
Paul fears critical thinking among his followers so much that , with overtones of cultic mind - control , he declares imperiously in 2 Cor. 10:5-6
[ We bring ] into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ ;
And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience ...
[ NIV : ... we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ .
And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience ... ]
Along the same line , Rev. 2:10 urges the believer to be faithful even if doing so means death :
... be thou faithful [ 12 ] unto death and I will give thee a crown of life .
Finally , referring to those whose faith is wavering , James ominously warns
For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord .
( Jas. 1:7 )
The 13th chapter of 1 Corinthians stands in stark contrast to the many scriptures that elevate belief above all else .
In this passage , belief is not paramount :
... and though I have all faith [ 12 ] , so that I could remove mountains , and have not charity [ 5 ] , I am nothing .
( vs. 2 ) And now abideth faith [ 12 ] , hope , charity , these three ; but the greatest of these is charity [ 5 ] .
( vs. 13 , my italics )
These two verses are plain and unconditional , with the latter verse clearly placing charity ( " love " in the NIV and RSV ) above faith in the hierarchy of virtues .
This passage does not qualify the superlative by saying " the greatest for earthly happiness " or even " the greatest for salvation " ; it says simply " the greatest " .
If 1 Cor. 13 is correct , the many scriptures identifying faith rather than charity as the key to salvation must be incorrect .
According to Jas. 2:14 , even faith is no guarantee of salvation :
What doth it profit , my brethren , though a man say he hath faith [ 12 ] , and have not works [ 13 ] ? can faith [ 12 ] save him ?
( my italics )
By its peculiar phrasing that anticipates a negative answer , James ' second question powerfully implies the ineffectuality of faith .
If James regarded faith as necessary but insufficient for salvation , he surely would have phrased his query " can faith alone save him ? " or " can faith without works save him ? " .
Not only would such alternate phrasing have reinforced the complementarity of faith and works that he implies in the first question , but it would also have agreed with later admonitions in the second chapter of his epistle :
... faith [ 12 ] , if it hath not works [ 13 ] , is dead , being alone .
( vs. 17 ) ... But wilt thou know , O vain man , that faith [ 12 ] without works [ 13 ] is dead ? ( vs. 20 ) ... by works [ 13 ] a man is justified [ 14 ] , and not by faith [ 12 ] only ( vs. 24 )
For as the body without the spirit is dead , so faith [ 12 ] without works [ 13 ] is dead also .
( vs. 26 )
Verse 24 , moreover , flatly contradicts Rom. 3:28 :
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified [ 14 ] by faith [ 12 ] without the deeds [ 13 ] of the law .
( my italics )
The believer might try to reconcile the two by interpreting " works " in the former to exclude " deeds of the law " in the latter .
If keeping the law ( circumcision , etc. ) may be categorized as " works " , the contradiction is undeniable .
If keeping the law is not a " work " , however , the word " works " must refer generically to good deeds or acts of kindness .
But because acts of kindness are part of Jewish law , circuitous reasoning then restores the contradiction .
Even so , James lifts up the law as summarized by Lev. 19:18 ( discussed above in another context ) , as a criterion whereby God will judge :
If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself , ye do well .
( Jas. 2:8 ) So speak ye , and do so , as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty .
( Jas. 2:12 , my italics )
Finally , James underscores his caveat in 4:11 - 12 , where he once again urges being a " doer of the law " , while he cautions against judging it .
In the 19th chapter of Matthew , a young man asks Jesus the question , " what good thing shall I do , that I may have eternal life ? "
Differently than in Jn. 6:47 , Jesus replies unambiguously
... if thou wilt enter into life , keep the commandments .
( Mat. 19:17 )
Jesus continues by reiterating several of the Ten Commandments , and then concludes by mandating poverty .
According to this scripture , what secures salvation is works , not faith .
Furthermore , in Mat. 22 , Jesus is asked for the " great commandment in the law " ( vs. 36 ) .
He responds with two :
... Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart ... ( vs. 37 ) ... Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
( vs. 39 )
Although faith is again not part of his answer , the believer might argue that loving the Lord entails such faith , and that faith is therefore mentioned , though implicitly .
Even so , verse 39 is clearly an ethical teaching , standing apart from faith , that Jesus himself includes as one of the two supreme commandments .
Consistent with this verse is 1 Cor. 13 , which distinguishes love from faith .
James stresses works throughout his epistle , not just in the 2nd chapter .
In his eyes , effective faith operates in concert with ethics .
In 1:22 , for example , James urges his fellow believers to be " doers of the word , and not hearers only " , while in 1:27 he goes so far as to present " pure religion " as action , not as faith :
Pure religion [ 15 ] and undefiled before God the Father is this , To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction , and to keep himself unspotted from the world .
An allusion to faith is conspicuously absent .
Because it is capable of being impure and defiled before God , religion is evidently important for James -- and faith is not even a component .
Nonetheless , many scriptures focusing on belief ( e.g. , the 3rd chapter of John , Ac. 16:30 - 31 , Jn. 6:47 ) altogether fail to mention works as a requirement for salvation .
For the Christian , expecting Jesus himself to tell the whole truth about any grave issue , especially eternal life , is axiomatic .
As noted above , however , Jesus seems to reveal only half the formula for salvation in Jn. 6:47 .
According to his own words in Mk. 16:16 , the missing half is baptism , whereas according to James , it is works .
In his second epistle to Timothy , Paul muddles the issue even more by disclosing something other than salvation as the very reason for scripture itself :
All scripture is ... profitable for doctrine , for reproof , for correction , for instruction in righteousness :
That the man of God may be perfect , thoroughly furnished unto all good works [ 13 ] .
[ NIV : All Scripture ... is useful for teaching , rebuking , correcting and training in righteousness , so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work . ]
( 2 Tim. 3:16 - 17 , my italics )
This passage , in line with James ' teaching , elevates good works above faith by identifying the former , not the latter , as the raison d'être of scripture .
Because Paul does not say to Timothy that scripture prepares people for salvation , one may conclude that if salvation is the ultimate objective of Christianity , then scripture fails by preparing people only for good works .
Jesus ' own words corroborate this inference :
Search the scriptures ; for in them ye think ye have eternal life : and they are they which testify of me .
[ NIV :
You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life .
These are the Scriptures that testify about me ] ( Jn. 5:39 )
The believer might interpret this passage to mean that although scripture per se does not save , it does lead one to Jesus and , hence , salvation .
Thus , scripture 's ultimate goal , albeit only implicit in the above passage from 2
Timothy , is indeed salvation ; the explicit reasons for scripture that Paul cites therein become the means to the implicit end .
Because , however , Paul unequivocally declares good works to be the goal of scripture , good works must be among the requirements for eternal life , another conclusion in conflict with those aforementioned scriptures that identify faith as the singular essential for salvation .
Thus , on the subject of salvation , the scriptures are rife with disparity .
In some passages , belief , or faith , is the way to eternal life , whereas in others baptism , rebirth in the Spirit , keeping the law , or doing good works is requisite .
Resolution of these conflicts is left to the individual believer , who is forced either ( a ) to interpret the scriptures in accord with his or her own rationality and conscience , ( b ) to seek from someone else the " proper " interpretation , or ( c ) to discontinue treating the Bible as inerrant and internally consistent .
If faith is the critical criterion on Judgment Day , persons not saved , even if they kept the law and did good works , will not enter paradise .
Torture is the punishment for those who have chosen to interpret the scriptures as metaphor because of the honest confusion arising from semantic muddiness .
The metaphor in question is that " belief in Jesus Christ " , expressed in such verses as Jn. 6:47 , is not necessarily belief in his divinity , but rather is assent to his ethics .
After all , might argue the damned , not only did James stress ethics in his epistle , but Jesus himself devoted most of his teaching to ethics as well ( including the issue of salvation ) -- and he did so parabolically .
Treating faith as the critical criterion on Judgment Day , however , conflicts with Paul 's words in Rom .
2 . In describing " God 's righteous judgment " , he says that God
... will render to every man according to his deeds [ 13 ] .
[ NIV : ... according to what he has done . ] ( vs. 6 , my italics ) Tribulation and anguish , upon every soul of man that doeth [ 16 ] evil ... ( vs. 9 , my italics )
But glory , honour , and peace , to every man that worketh [ 16 ] good ... ( vs. 10 , my italics )
Because the Bible 's presentation of salvation is so foggy , the appearance of heterodoxies should be expected , with many people reasonably concluding that the scriptures inculcate something other than simple faith in Jesus Christ , such as the leading of an ethical earthly life , as the way to an eternal heavenly life .
If simple faith is the way , however , God is punishing people for honest confusion , which behavior is antithetical to his image as good , merciful , and loving .
Is honest confusion , or ignorance , an excuse for not knowing God ?
The Bible itself is contradictory on this question -- or God is inconsistent by changing his mind .
Consider , for example , the 17th chapter of Acts , wherein Paul discovers that the Athenians had been worshipping a god whom they could not identify .
Paul says to them ,
For as I passed by , and beheld your devotions , I found an altar with this inscription , TO THE UNKNOWN GOD .
Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship , him declare I unto you .
( vs. 23 )
Paul then delivers his Christian message to the Athenians , revealing his God as the one they had been unwittingly worshipping all along .
In Paul 's eyes , the Athenians must now understand and accept God .
In his noting that God has overlooked the Athenians ' ignorance , it becomes clear that God accepted ignorance as their excuse for not knowing him :
And the times of this ignorance God winked at ; but now commandeth all men every where to repent ... ( vs. 30 )
Conflicting with this passage is Romans 1 , wherein Paul declares that there is no excuse for not knowing God :
Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them ; for God hath shewed it unto them .
[ NIV : since what may be known about God is plain to them , because God has made it plain to them . ] ( vs. 19 ) For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead ; so that they are without excuse .
[ NIV :
For since the creation of the world God 's invisible qualities -- his eternal power and divine nature -- have been clearly seen , being understood from what has been made , so that men are without excuse . ] ( vs. 20 , my italics )
Evidently , God is perspicuous in the things of creation , and no one cannot know him -- reason alone will bring one to an understanding of God ( good news for disciples of Thomas Paine ) .
Thus , ignorance of God is not an excuse for not knowing him .
The second verse above ( Rom. 1:20 ) implies free agency ; one may accept or reject the notion of God , notwithstanding the overwhelming preponderance of evidence for his existence .
This verse , though , stands in contrast to others that are strongly deterministic :
And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him , whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world .
[ NIV :
All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast -- all whose names have not been written in the book of life belonging to the Lamb that was slain from the creation of the world . ]
[ RSV : and all who dwell on earth will worship it , every one whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that was slain . ]
( Rev. 13:8 , my italics )
Only those whose names are written in the Lamb 's book of life will enter heaven ( Rev. 21:27 ) .
Although the issue of determinism is contentious , the question here is not whether predestination is the way of things but whether the Bible is clear and consistent in its treatment of issues impinging on that of predestination .
Jeremiah 's choice of words leaves no doubt :
And it shall come to pass , if they say unto thee , Whither shall we go forth ?
then thou shalt tell them , Thus saith the Lord ; Such as are for death , to death ; and such as are for the sword , to the sword ; and such as are for the famine , to the famine ; and such as are for the captivity , to the captivity .
[ NIV :
And if they ask you , ' Where shall we go ? ' tell them , ' This is what the Lord says :
Those destined for death , to death ; those for the sword , to the sword ; those for starvation , to starvation ; those for captivity , to captivity . ']
( Jer. 15:2 , my italics )
According to Jeremiah , then , destiny operates .
Furthermore , Rev. 6:11 declares that select individuals are destined to be killed :
And white robes were given unto every one of them ; and it was said unto them , that they should rest yet for a little season , until their fellowservants also and their brethren , that should be killed as they were , should be fulfilled .
[ NIV : ... until the number of their fellow servants and brothers who were to be killed as they had been was completed . ] ( my italics )
Although the believer might reply that these verses are referring to prescience rather than determinism , the Bible once again fails to settle the issue .
Jesus clearly forbids vowing in his Sermon on the Mount :
But I say unto you , Swear [ 17 ] not at all ; neither by heaven ; for it is God 's throne ... Nor by the earth ... Neither shalt thou swear [ 17 ] by thy head ... ( Mat. 5:34 - 36 )
James reiterates :
But above all things , my brethren , swear [ 17 ] not , neither by heaven , neither by the earth , neither by any other oath ... ( Jas. 5:12 )
The words of both Paul in the New Testament and Moses in the Old , however , conflict with those of Jesus and James .
For men verily swear by the greater : and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife .
Wherein God , willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel , confirmed it by an oath : ( Heb. 6:16 - 17 , my italics )
Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God , and serve him , and shalt swear [ 18 ] by his name .
( Deu. 6:13 , my italics )
Thus , not only does Paul advocate vowing but he also reports that God himself is not above making an oath , while Moses actually instructs his people to swear , and to do so by God 's name .
There is no fear [ 19 ] in love [ 5 ] ; but perfect love casteth out fear : because fear hath torment .
He that feareth [ 20 ] is not made perfect [ 21 ] in love [ 5 ] .
[ NIV :
There is no fear in love .
But perfect love drives out fear , because fear has to do with punishment .
The man who fears is not made perfect in love . ]
( 1 Jn. 4:18 )
Nonetheless , threats of punishment and torment abound in the Bible , examples being Lk. 6:25 , Mat. 25:44-46 , 2 Th. 1:7-9 , Heb .
10:29 -31 , Jude vss. 6 - 7 , Mat. 24:50 - 51 , and 2 Cor. 10:6 .
The author of 1 John firmly contraposes fear and love , as the author of Leviticus does revenge and love , discussed earlier .
Even though , according to 1 Jn. 4:18 , fear and love are mutually exclusive states , Moses imparts to Israel God 's dual imperative to fear and love simultaneously :
Thou shalt fear [ 22 ] the Lord thy God ... ( Deu . 6:13 ) And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy might .
( Deu . 6:5 )
Jesus also clashes with the author of 1 John by issuing the same two directives .
In his missionary discourse related by Matthew , Jesus instructs his twelve apostles to
... fear [ 20 ] him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
[ NIV : ... be afraid of the one who can destroy both soul and body in hell . ]
( Mat. 10:28 , my italics )
whereas , recalling the " first and great commandment " from Deu. 6:5 , he also enjoins them to
...love [ 23 ] the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind .
( Mat. 22:37 )
Notice that the NIV translates as " be afraid of " what both the King James and the RSV translate as " fear " .
While one obeys Jesus ' mandate to be " perfect " [ 21 ] ( Mat. 5:48 ) , one must " fear " God ( Mat. 10:28 ) , even though one " who fears is not made perfect in love " ( NIV , 1 Jn. 4:18 ) .
If the last of those three verses is true , then the simultaneous fulfillment of the first and second is logically impossible -- unless , as the believer might reply , the root word " fear " in the first and third instances carries different denotations .
In other words , because they differ contextually , " fear " in Mat. 10:28 and " fear " in 1 Jn. 4:18 are not equivalent definitionally .
The two contexts , however , are virtually identical .
In no uncertain terms , the fear in both 1 Jn. 4:18 and in Mat. 10:28 arises from the threat of punition , although in the former that punition is general " punishment " and in the latter it is specifically the destruction of " both soul and body in hell " .
Thus , the impossibility of simultaneously obeying Jesus ' two commands in Mat. 5:48 and Mat. 10:28 stands .
Furthermore , in relating love , fear , and punishment , the verse in 1 Jn. collides with yet another , this time one from Hebrews :
NIV : But perfect love drives out fear , because fear has to do with punishment .
( 1 Jn. 4:18 ) NIV : ... the Lord disciplines [ 24 ] those he loves , and he punishes [ 25 ] everyone he accepts as a son .
( Heb. 12:6 )
By linking punishment directly with fear , the former passage avers the incompatibility of love and punishment , whereas the latter passage , by uniting love with punishment , accomplishes precisely the opposite .
As there is a difference between arguing against a position and arguing against the right to hold that position , so there is a difference between looking to scripture as a resource , or even as a guide , and surrendering one 's rationality to it .
In view of the presence of inconsistencies in the Bible , the believer must decide how to identify the apodictic verses .
Furthermore , what other errors might scripture contain ?
How heavily should one defer to the Bible in his or her search for truth ?
Although these questions lie beyond the scope of this essay , the believer who wishes to evangelize must be prepared to answer the skeptic 's concerns about the private and public dangers of placing blind unquestioning faith in a flawed , albeit best - selling , 2000 - year - old book that purports to reveal the ultimate truth .

[ 3 ]
The Hebrew word appearing here is chesed , generally meaning kindness .
Although efforts to translate chesed accurately have stirred debate , most renderings converge on a sense for which the word kindness is not inappropriate .
At the elementary level , chesed is what one feels and extends to someone piteous .
Thus , LXX renders chesed as eleëmon , which denotes active compassion .
Accordingly , the Vulgate renders the word as miseracordia , meaning pity or compassion , while the RSV translates it as steadfast love , and the NIV simply as love .
[ 4 ]
In the original Greek text , the word for goodness is agathosynë , meaning uprightness or moral honorability .
[ 5 ]
In this passage , the original Greek text uses agapë to denote the kind of love characterized largely by goodwill and beneficence .
Such is the love of Christian for Christian ( Gal. 5:13 ) , man for God ( Jn. 5:42 ) , and God for man ( Rom. 5:8 ) .
[ 6 ]
From the same root as the noun agapë [ see endnote # 5 ] , the imperative verb agapatë is used in the original Greek text here .
Jesus ' command is to love one 's enemies , in the sense of regarding their welfare or advocating their best interest .
[ 7 ]
The original Greek uses agathos , meaning excellent in whatever respect the context indicates .
This adjective encompasses several acceptations , including fruitful , useful , agreeable , and moral .
[ 8 ]
The original Greek uses kalos , which means good in the sense of being well - suited for the intended purpose .
[ 9 ]
The Hebrew word for the noun evil is rah , standing in contrast to chesed [ see endnote # 3 ] .
Thus , rah is antipodean to good , implying misery , injury , wickedness , distress , violence , etc .
[ 10 ]
The phrase born again appears in the original Greek as gennethë anothen , meaning literally begotten from heaven or begotten from the first .
Begotten may symbolize having been successfully proselytized or excited toward a new way of life , which progression of thought leads to an even more - liberal rendering , such as imbued with spiritual life , especially when coupled with from heaven or from the first .
In effect , then , upon being born again one begins living anew .
[ 11 ]
The original Greek word is a form of the verb pistoö , meaning to believe , with various acceptations : to think true , to be convicted of , and to place confidence in .
[ 12 ]
From the same root as pistoö [ see endnote # 11 ] , the Greek words pistos ( adjective ) and pistis ( noun ) both refer to believing , to having confidence in .
[ 13 ]
The original Greek word is a form of ergon , meaning deed or act .
[ 14 ]
The Greek verb used here is dikaioö , meaning to declare righteous or innocent .
[ 15 ]
The Greek noun is threskeia , meaning worship .
[ 16 ]
The Greek verbs for doeth and worketh , respectively , are forms of katergazomai , meaning to perpetrate , and ergazomai , meaning to labor or to perform .
Denotatively and connotatively , each word involves action .
[ 17 ]
The Greek verb is omnuo ( omoö ) , meaning to swear .
[ 18 ]
The Hebrew verb is shawbah , meaning to swear .
LXX renders this word as omë , a form of the same Greek verb for to swear used in Mat. 5:34 - 36 and Jas. 5:12 [ see endnote # 17 ] .
[ 19 ]
The original Greek uses the noun phobos , from which derives the English word phobia , an exaggerated or irrational fear .
In the context of this passage , phobos was not fear in the complex sense of veneration or reverence , but rather was fear in the simpler sense of dread or of being afraid , inasmuch as this verse posits the mutual exclusivity of fear and love , going so far as to connect fear with " torment " .
[ 20 ]
With the same root as the noun phobos [ see endnote # 19 ] , the Greek verb used here is phobeo , meaning to fear or to be afraid of .
[ 21 ]
To be " made perfect " , rendered in the original Greek as a form of teleioö , is to be complete or to lack nothing .
[ 22 ]
The Hebrew word is yawre , meaning , in this case , to venerate or to revere .
The other color of this word , however , is that of conventional fear , i.e. , dread or being afraid .
Thus , conceding God 's power over man stirs affright , and , capturing the consequent alarm in man 's veneration of the omnipotent deity , LXX renders yawre as phobeo [ see endnote # 20 ] , despite the alternatives to phobeo that were available to translators and that conveyed the idea of respect : ( 1 ) sebomai , meaning to revere or to worship ( e.g. , Mat. 15:9 ) , ( 2 ) timao , meaning to honor or to venerate ( e.g. , Jn. 5:23 ) , and ( 3 ) proskyneo , meaning to prostrate or to pay homage ( e.g. , Jn. 4:20 ) .
The Vulgate renders yawre as timeo , meaning to fear in the sense of dreading or apprehending .
[ 23 ]
To love , in this case , is the Greek verb agapao , the same as Jesus used in Mat. 5:44 [ see endnote # 6 ] .
[ 24 ]
The Greek word is paideuo , meaning to discipline , to castigate , or to chasten .
[ 25 ]
The Greek verb here is mastigo , meaning to scourge or to flog .

" any person who drinks artificially fluoridated water for a period of one year or more will never again be the same person mentally or physically . "
- Charles E. Perkins , Chemist .
Water Fluoridation has hit the main stream media after decades being brushed aside .
Scientific American had an article about the dangers of fluoride if its overused , revealing that its almost impossible not to overuse it .
Many people do n't think twice about the toxic waste that we are drowning in .
Fluoride is not what you think , and the deceit is painfully obvious , you just have to look .
Calcium Fluoride is what is usually found naturally in water but the cheaper , Hexafluorosilicic Acid , is dumped in our drinking water and its not even similar to " calcium fluoride " .
Hexafluorosilicic
Acid is a highly toxic chemical , that has a laundry list of ailments and diseases to go along with it .
According to DR .
Hardy Limeback 's research , most American cities are purchasing an industrial grade source of fluoride to fluoridate drinking water .
It comes from smokestack scrubbers that produce phosphate fertilizer , its cheaper than the pharmaceutical grade .
He explains , " Tragically , that means we 're not just dumping toxic fluoride into our drinking water .
We 're also exposing innocent , unsuspecting people to deadly elements of lead , arsenic and radium , all of them carcinogenic .
Because of the cumulative properties of toxins , the detrimental effects on human health are catastrophic . "
But we drink it , bathe in it , wash our clothes and dishes in it without hesitation .
Artificially fluoridated water is not beneficial to our health and naturally occurring fluoride is not essential for ANY living thing , and that should be common knowledge .
Acceptable amounts of fluoride to ingest is 1 part per million of water .
More than 2 PPM has been ruled toxic .
Acceptable levels allowed in our tap water have been rising , and more than 90 percent of our public water is fluoridated , so our food is grown with it , soda , soup , all canned with it , we are being bombarded with fluoride .
Unfortunately , we have no way of knowing how much of the toxic fluoride we have stored in our bodies , it stays in your body , for unknown period 's of time .
" Half of all ingested fluoride remains in the skeletal system and accumulates with age " Dr. Hardy Limeback
Mao Tse-tung in 1956 called the United States an empire .
He called it a paper tiger .
In appearance it is very powerful but in reality it is nothing to be afraid of ; it is a paper tiger .
Outwardly a tiger , it is made of paper , unable to withstand the wind and the rain .
I believe the United States is nothing but a paper tiger .
It is now half a century later .
The United States is bogged down in a war that has lasted longer than its participation in World War II .
The government ’s on - budget debt is in the $ 9 trillion range .
Its off - budget debt is in the $ 70 trillion range .
Here was Mao ’s assessment in 1956 .
The United States owes debts everywhere .
It owes debts not only to the countries of Latin America , Asia and Africa , but also to the countries of Europe and Oceania .
The whole world , Britain included , dislikes the United States .
The masses of the people dislike it .
Japan dislikes the United States because it oppresses her .
None of the countries in the East is free from U.S. aggression .
The United States has invaded our Taiwan Province .
Japan , Korea , the Philippines , Vietnam and Pakistan all suffer from U.S. aggression , although some of them are allies of the United States .
The people are dissatisfied and in some countries so are the authorities .
All oppressed nations want independence .
Everything is subject to change .
The big decadent forces will give way to the small new - born forces .
The small forces will change into big forces because the majority of the people demand this change .
The U.S. imperialist forces will change from big to small because the American people , too , are dissatisfied with their government .
Mao has been dead for three decades , yet his words seem strangely prophetic .
He understood what the United States was facing .
Yet he had no clue about what China was facing .
He was completely wrong about China ’s role in the world economy in the decades that followed his death .
China remains officially Marxist politically , yet in fact has become the fastest growing large capitalist economy in history .
This began in 1979 under Deng Xiao- ping , the man Mao failed to execute .
( Deng was saved by the personal intervention of Col. von Trapp ’s son - in - law , but that ’s another story for another day . )
THE OTHER TIGER
Economist F. A. Hayek in 1969 offered his version of having a tiger by the tail : monetary inflation .
Now we have an inflation - borne prosperity which depends for its continuation on continued inflation .
If prices rise less than expected , then a depressing effect is exerted on the economy .
I expected that ten years would suffice to produce increasing difficulty ; however , it has taken 25 years to reach the stage where to slow down inflation produces a recession .
We now have a tiger by the tail : how long can this inflation continue ?
If the tiger ( of inflation ) is freed he will eat us up ; yet if he runs faster and faster while we desperately hold on , we are still finished !
I ’m glad wo n’t be here to see the final outcome .
( Hayek , A Tiger by the Tail , Institute for Economic Affairs , 1972 , p. 112 . )
As he spoke , a recession in the United States was about to hit .
There was another in 1975 .
The United States went off the international gold standard in 1971 .
Price inflation soared in the decade .
Then the Federal Reserve stabilized money in 1979 .
The result was a pair of recessions , 1981 and 1982 .
Price inflation slowed , but then an international monetary crisis hit in August , 1982 , when Mexico threatened to default .
To avoid a disaster , the FED pumped in money .
Price inflation continued , though at a slower pace .
Hayek died in 1992 .
He lived long enough to see the Soviet Union fall .
He did not see the end of inflation .
So far , the West has not gotten off the tiger ’s back .
But the tiger has not yet eaten us .
Now it is China ’s turn to ride the monetary tiger .
CHINA’S MONETARY POLICY
At the beginning of 2007 , the Chinese central bank announced its monetary goals for the year .
As it does every year , it announced that the policy would be prudent .
It said it will continue to implement a prudent monetary policy and improve its foresight on the country ’s economy and financial sector .
Here is what prudence is in today ’s China .
This was the target for M - 2 .
China aims to keep the annual growth of its broad money supply this year to within 16 percent , nearly 1 percentage point down from that of 2006 , the central bank announced on Sunday .
The target was set on the basis of an expected 8 percent growth in gross domestic product ( GDP ) and a less than 3 percent rise in consumer prices year - on - year , the central bank said at its annual work conference that concluded yesterday .
Consider 8 % growth .
This means a doubling of the economy every nine years .
As for price inflation , the bankers expected 3 % .
This means that they expected real economic growth of 5 % , which is very high for a nation of 1.3 billion people .
As for M - 1 , the narrow money supply , the bank issued no target figure .
China ’s bankers underestimate money growth , year after year .
Last year , the central bank set its macro-control targets at a 16 percent annual growth for M2 , a 14 percent rise for M1 , and 2.5 trillion yuan ( US $ 312.5 billion ) of newly added loans in Renminbi .
Data from the bank show the country ’s M2 last year rose 16.94 percent year on year to 34.56 trillion yuan , with M1 up 17.48 percent to 12.6 trillion yuan and new credit surging to 3.18 trillion yuan , or 27 percent beyond target .
This discrepancy was easily explained : “ The money supply and credit targets are not missions it must meet but only a policy guide , the bank has said . ”
How will the bank achieve its goals in 2007 ?
By winging it .
“ The central bank pledged to adopt multiple tools for monetary macro-control and to advocate flexibility in interest rate adjustments to address excessive currency liquidity . ”
The money supply in China has risen in the 15 % to 18 % range , year after year .
By April , the increase in M - 2 was around 17 % , year to year , slightly higher than the announced rate .
But what of official growth figures ?
The government claimed 10.7 % growth in 2006 , meaning a doubling every 6.7 years .
It claimed price inflation of 1.3 % , meaning that China in 2006 had real growth of 9.2 % .
This is astronomical .
There is no historical precedent for anything like this .
I think we should employ skepticism regarding these figures .
Statisticians in Marxist countries must toe the line .
POPULATION MOVEMENT
Jim Jubak has offered an explanation of how these high economic growth rates are possible .
I have mine .
They agree .
It is due to a freeing up of labor and capital .
The labor market is outside the compulsory welfare system of the Chinese government .
He thinks this is bad .
I think it is good .
He writes :
It works like this .
A peasant looking for a better life can move to a city or an industrial zone and get a job .
But they ca n’t get a “ hukou , ” the certificate of residence required to access public services such as schools , health care and unemployment benefits .
These migrant workers live crammed in company dormitories , usually earning far below the official minimum wage and sometimes as little as $ 1 for a 12 - hour day , doing the dirtiest and most dangerous work that no worker with a certificate of residence wants .
And quite often , the company refuses to pay the migrant worker even those wages .
Official Chinese government figures say that more than 70 % of the country ’s migrant workers were owed pay by their employers last December .
This is a free labor market involving huge numbers of people .
Jubak writes : “ Estimates of the number of migrant workers in China range from 110 million to 120 million . ”
He estimates that 3.7 million migrants live in Guangzhou , which has 7.5 million people .
“ Migrants make up 80 % of all urban construction workers and 68 % of workers in electronics manufacturing , according to UNESCO ( the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ) . ”
Consider some implications of these numbers .
In China , Inc. ( 2005 ) , author Ted Fishman offers these tidbits of information .
“ Every month , China must build enough urban infrastructure to accommodate a city the size of Houston in order to absorb the 300 million rural Chinese who will move to cities in the next 15 years . ”
“ China has 450 cities with a population of at least 250,000 , compared to 68 cities in the United States with at least a quarter of a million people . ”
“ China has over 100 cities with a population of at least 1 million people — the United States has 9 . ” “ Half of China ’s 1.3 billion people are under age 24 .
Over 300 million , more than the population of the US , are under the age of 14 . ”
We begin to see the nature of the tiger that China is riding .
China has the highest rate of monetary inflation of any large industrial nation .
It is experiencing the largest migration of population in recorded history .
In less than one generation , well over a hundred million people have moved from farms to cities .
It may be closer to 200 million people .
Monetary inflation is not the main source of China ’s economic boom .
This kind of increased economic productivity does not arise out of increases in the money supply .
Fiat money does not create new wealth .
Economic growth has arisen out of a freeing up of capital and labor in what had been a Communist economy .
Monetary inflation does affect the allocation of capital and labor at the margin .
Companies that get access to the newly created money can buy goods and services at yesterday ’s prices .
They can fund new plants and new projects more inexpensively than companies that get access to the fiat money later in the flow of funds .
Which are these companies ?
Obviously , among the winners are companies that export to the West , whose importers can buy the Chinese yuan at a low price due to the increase in the supply of yuan .
China is imitating the five Asian “ tiger ” economies that were built on exports to the West : Japan , Taiwan , Hong Kong , South Korea , and Singapore .
To subsidize the export sectors of the economy , the Chinese central bank has adopted monetary inflation .
It has used its newly created currency units to buy foreign currencies , which it then uses to buy the debt certificates issued by Western governments , including the United States .
This has helped keep interest rates lower in the United States than what would have prevailed , had the Chinese central bank not inflated or else had bought assets other than T - bills .
THE BOOM - BUST CYCLE
Hayek pointed out the nature of the tiger in 1969 .
He had learned this from Ludwig von Mises , who had discovered the nature of the boom - bust cycle in 1912 .
The cycle comes from monetary inflation , which stimulates economic growth .
Then , when the rate of price inflation slows , the underlying forces of the economy reassert themselves .
Interest rates rise as prices rise .
Projects that had been launched because of the low interest rates that had been produced by the fiat - money - funded purchases of government debt , now face bankruptcy because of rising interest rates .
China has now moved into the industrial world .
It is part of the world economy .
It is experiencing huge population movements .
People are moving off low - output farms and moving into huge cities .
In cities , there is a much higher division of labor than in rural villages .
There is much greater specialization of production .
So , there will be much greater economic losses when a recession hits .
On a farm , you can switch production to self - sufficiency when market demand declines .
In a city , you get fired when market demand declines .
Your income ceases .
You must find different employment .
How do you do this if the urban economy takes the brunt of the economic losses ?
You lower your price .
You work for less .
To persuade workers to do this , companies must create incentives .
They fire people .
Until workers recognize the new conditions and adjust to them by lowering their wage demands , they remain unemployed .
This is a major threat to the Communist government .
The tight controls imposed on the population by the political system were justified by guaranteed employment in state - owned companies .
These have been steadily shut down by the government .
What happens to the political order when the tiger of inflation is replaced by the tiger of recession ?
This is the nature of the tiger that Hayek described .
The central bank has placed the entire society on the back of this tiger .
It dares not stabilize the money supply .
So , it continues to create new money , hoping that prices will not rise domestically because of the downward pressure on wages created by the flood of rural workers streaming into the cities .
So far , this policy has worked politically .
Enormous economic growth has kept down domestic prices .
But the threat of recession grows ever greater as people keep filling the cities .
A fall in employment in a city where millions of newcomers are living is far more dangerous politically to a centralized political order than a dispersed , unorganized rural society is .
CONCLUSION
No society is riding a more dangerous tiger than China .
China has combined an aging , centralized political hierarchy with a youthful market - driven population .
To this risky brew the central bank has added monetary inflation , which has now become endemic .
Participants in the economy have planned on this monetary inflation .
It is unexpected changes in the rate of monetary expansion that create serious losses .
The central bank dares not reduce the rate of inflation .
So , the results are predictable : rising commodity prices , supply bottlenecks , real estate bubbles in fast - growing cities , a stock market bubble , and euphoria regarding the future .
The move from farms to cities by young men is the central factor in the deferral of production crises .
Labor is a large component of any economy .
China ’s is no exception .
The flood of immigrants from the farms is holding down production costs .
The bubble in China resembles the bubble 1995 — 2000 NASDAQ in the United States .
The Chinese stock market is trading at a price / earnings ratio above 50 .
Some stocks are trading at 80 .
In a speech on June 12 , Alan Greenspan commented , “ Some of these price - earnings ratios are discounting Nirvana . ”
But let us not forget that the NASDAQ reached a p/e ratio of more than 200 in December , 1999 .
China ’s goods will continue to be cheap .
In a recession , they will be even cheaper .
The problem will be in the debt markets .
When the Chinese central bank starts buying its own government ’s debt in order to bail out the Chinese government directly , interest rates in the West will rise .
China has exported price deflation : cheap goods .
It has done this by purchasing western governments ’ debt .
When that strategy hits the iceberg of domestic recession and unemployment , the West ’s days of low interest rates and economic boom will cease abruptly .

TEHRAN , Oct 2 ( Reuters ) - Iran , the world ’s fourth - biggest oil exporter , has boosted oil export earnings in non-U.S. dollar currencies to 85 percent , an Iranian oil official said on Tuesday .
“ Iran is selling about 85 percent of its oil in the non-dollar currencies , ” state television quoted Mohammad Ali Khatibi , deputy director of international affairs at the state oil company National Iranian Oil Company ( NIOC ) , as saying .
Last week , Hojjatollah Ghanimifard , international affairs director of NIOC told Reuters : “ With the arrangements we ’ve made with our Asian customers , hopefully by the end of October we will have around 80 percent of our export revenue in currencies other than the dollar . ”
Iran , embroiled in a standoff with the West over its nuclear programme , has for nearly two years been reducing its exposure to the dollar , saying the weak U.S. currency is eroding its purchasing power .
“ Currently , about 65 percent of Iran ’s crude exports are based on euro and 20 percent based on yen , ” said Khatibi .
In July , NIOC made an official request to customers in Japan , which imports more than 300,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) of Iranian crude , to pay in yen .
A switch in payment by Japan 's Nippon Oil 5001.T and other Japanese refiners to yen had already pushed Iran 's non-U.S. dollar income to more than 70 percent in September .
Iran ’s total crude oil exports are around 2.3 million bpd .
Food banks face ' critical shortage ' over holidays Katie Baker
Published : Friday December 21 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Food banks across the United States are in desperate need of food or else many will go hungry this Holiday season , reports the Jim Lehrer News Hour .
Chicago correspondent Elizabeth Brackett visited numerous food pantries throughout the city , all of which are struggling with lack of supplies .
According to Debra Ocampo , director of the Union Ave. United Methodist Church Pantry , supplies have gone down to about 2/3 of what they were in recent years .
These past months have been especially troubling : barely any vegetables or fruit have been donated .
" From week to week we worry ... are we going to be able to feed the people who come in ? " says Ocampo .
Vicki Escarra of America 's Second Harvest estimates that more than 35 million Americans lack access to enough food to stay healthy .
" This is a really critical time [ to turn people away ] , " she says .
It 's not just the homeless who are affected , but 25 million Americans , including individuals who are unable to work to support themselves : 9 million children and 3 million senior citizens are in need of food .
" I knew I had to swallow my pride , " says David Suarez , a senior citizen recently overwhelmed by medical bills .
Suarez and his wife found themselves in want of food for the first time in their lives due to their recent illnesses .
" I never expected to be ' everybody , ' " says Suarez , but adds that the people at the food bank made him feel welcome and " told [ him ] not to walk around with [ his ] head down . "
Banks and pantries receive most of their food from government commodities and donations from the food industry , with the rest coming from local donations .
Unfortunately , government commodities have decreased to less than half of what they were two years ago , due to a healthy farm economy and higher food prices .
Additionally , the 140 million dollars allocated for the Government 's emergency food assistance program ( EFAP ) does n't buy as much food as it did when the program began in 2002 .
Would the newly proposed farm bill -- which calls for 250 million dollars allocated as well as more money for fruits and vegetables -- help the cause ?
According to Kate Maehr , president of the Greater Chicago Food Depository , the bill , which is currently under danger of presidential veto , would mean that " food would flow out ... all throughout this community . "
Unfortunately , the bill is not a solution for the immediate crisis , and it's not just Government commodities that are in decline .
For years , large food companies have donated dented and crunched cans to food banks .
But , due to higher efficiency standards and better operating systems , less flawed cans are produced , causing a decline in food industry donations .
" At the end of the day ... that 's part of the changing landscape of being a food bank , " says Maehr .
Now , according to Maehr , food drives are becoming a critical source of food .
But , will small , local donations really help the crisis ?
Maehr says she " could n't get out of bed in the morning " if she did n't believe individual donations could make up for the decline in government and corporate donations .
But , without a significant increase in contributions before the end of the year , Maehr feels that " hunger will be a part of far too many Americans ' holiday season . "

On top of that , many Fed officials counted on the housing boom to prop up the economy after the stock market collapsed in 2000 .
Mr. Greenspan , in an interview , vigorously defended his actions , saying the Fed was poorly equipped to investigate deceptive lending and that it was not to blame for the housing bubble and bust .
On Tuesday , under a new chairman , the Federal Reserve will try to make up for lost ground by proposing new restrictions on subprime mortgages , invoking its authority under the 13 - year - old Home Ownership Equity and Protection Act .
Fed officials are expected to demand that lenders document a person ’s income and ability to repay the loan , and they may well restrict practices that make it hard for borrowers to see hidden fees or refinance with cheaper mortgages .
It is an action that people like Mr. Gramlich and Ms. Bair advocated for years with little success .
But it will have little impact on many existing subprime lenders , because most have either gone out of business or stopped making subprime loans months ago .
Before this year , officials here enthusiastically praised subprime lenders for helping millions of families buy homes for the first time .
“ I was aware that the loosening of mortgage credit terms for subprime borrowers increased financial risk , ” Mr. Greenspan wrote in his recent memoir , “ The Age of Turbulence : Adventures in a New World . ”
“ But I believed then , as now , that the benefits of broadened home ownership are worth the risk . ”
As housing prices soared in what became a speculative bubble , Fed officials took comfort that foreclosure rates on subprime mortgages remained relatively low .
But neither the Fed nor any other regulatory agency in Washington examined what might happen if housing prices flattened out or declined .
Had officials bothered to look , frightening clues of the coming crisis were available .
The Center for Responsible Lending , a nonprofit group based in North Carolina , analyzed records from across the country and found that default rates on subprime loans soared to 20 percent in cities where home prices stopped rising or started to fall .

Wringers , twin tubs , front loader , top loading – even coppers and scrubbing boards and of course the old bucket ; there ’s not many washing devices I have n’t had the opportunity to try .
While a scrubbing board is probably the most earth friendly option ; it ’s not one that is really suited to modern life and I ’ve never had to wash more than a couple of items with one .
I also have memories of nearly being pulled through a wringer :) .
So what type of washing machine is the most “ green ” ?
The wringer system was pretty inefficient and is long gone and twin tub machines have very limited application ( and tend to tie your clothes in knots ) ; so it ’s really between the top loading and front loading systems .
Assuming the quality of two brands / models of washers is equal ; it really comes down to a couple of important factors :
a) The amount of energy consumed
b ) The amount of water consumed
This is certainly where front loading washing machines win out on both counts .
1. Water Consumption
A front loading washing machine I recently acquired uses around 51 litres ( 13 gallons ) of water per full load .
Even a modern top loading washing machine of similar capacity will use around 80 litres , or 21 gallons – over 50 % more .
Over a year of even washing just once a week , the top loader will save around 1,500 litres of water .
Thinking tap water , this is more than enough for provide one person ’s drinking water requirements .
2. Electricity consumption
Approximately 85 - 90 % of the energy used by a washing machine is consumed through heating the water .
This is where water consumption comes in again ; the more water needed , the more that needs to be heated .
As mentioned in my article on earth friendly clothes washing , unless you are washing particularly greasy and filthy clothes , hot water is not needed ; cold water works just fine .
Even based on cold water alone , a front loading washing machine will often consumes less energy .
A few other advantages of front loading machines include
1. Less wear and tear on clothes
Front loading washing machines tumble clothing through the water whereas top loaders pull clothes through the wash ; so you ’re likely to get longer life out of clothes you wear often using a front loader .
This is another money and resource saver .
2. Faster drying times
Because of the horizontal axis and faster spin speeds , more water is removed and your clothes will dry faster .
Another energy saver if you use a clothes dryer .
3. Quieter operation
Assuming you have the washing machine totally level ( and that is really important ) , you ’ll find front loaders to be quieter in operation .
4. Larger loads
Generally front loaders allow for bigger loads , so getting back to the points about water consumption and electricity ; there ’s savings for the environment and your wallet there too .
5. Less detergent
While front loaders require a special low - sudsing detergent , far less is required and the price is comparable with standard detergents .
Less chemicals going into our waterways is always a good thing .
6. Rebates and tax breaks
Some states / countries offer rebates or tax credits on the purchase of front loading machines and we ’ll likely see more governments providing these initiatives in the future .
A few disadvantages of front loaders
– Heavier
– More bending in loading and unloading
– No soaking capabilities
– Initial purchase price is higher
– Can wind up with a mildewy smell , but this can be rectified by leaving the washer door open
– Longer wash times
If you visit various forums and reviews sites , you ’ll read opinions from fanatical front loader fans and die - hard top loader proponents .
Because there are so many brands and models of washing machines around it can be hard to compare apples to apples – but if it ’s the environment you have close to mind in your next purchase ; then a front loading washing machine is probably the best way to go .
Regardless of whether you choose to go with a front loader or top loading machine for your next purchase , do n’t skimp – buy the best quality you can afford .
It ’s a big purchase so research thoroughly as there are good and bad brands and models in both types .
Even among front loaders , there may be major differences between various brands and models in terms of water and electricity consumption .
Focus on the core features and specifications rather than novelty - type options and additional gadgets .
A washing machine is a workhorse , not a show pony .
A good machine will last you many years – and that ’s another great way to lessen environmental impact as the fewer machines you buy over your life , the less you ’ll need to dump once they ’ve finally given up the ghost .

The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have stretched US armed forces
The panel said there were high levels of fraud and waste in relation to contracts worth $ 4bn ( £ 1.9 bn ) a year .
It blamed a lack of oversight and said only about half the army 's contracting staff were properly qualified .
Defence Secretary Robert Gates said he was " dismayed " by the report and the Pentagon would pursue its suggestions .
The army says it is pursuing 83 criminal inquiries related to contract fraud and more than $ 15 m in bribes have been exposed .
The panel did not address specific allegations against individuals , but made clear that a lack of oversight and too few army contracting personnel had exacerbated systemic problems .
This is a systemic issue within the army
Jacques Gansler
Former US undersecretary of defence
The number of army personnel responsible for managing contracts in Kuwait , Iraq and Afghanistan dropped as the number of contracts and their value soared over 12 years , the panel found .
Only about half of all contracting personnel are certified to do their jobs , it added .
The panel said some 2,000 extra staff were needed to deal with a 600 % increase in the workload .
" This is a systemic issue within the army and within the DoD [ Department of Defense ] , " said Jacques Gansler , chairman of the commission .
" It usually takes a crisis to make change .
We have a crisis , we can make those changes . "
Defence Secretary Gates said he was " dismayed by a lot of the findings " but encouraged by the group 's suggested improvements .

Because I am constantly moving equipment , I drive my car or use a car service almost every day — and I am still in favor of the congestion pricing .
Who should be the next president ?
A Democrat , please .
I could live with Clinton in spite of her pitifully weak war rap , I respect Edwards for just mentioning poor people , and I dream of Obama .
Times , Post , or Daily News ?
The Times .
There is no comparison .
The Times is simply the real news , though I find when there is something truly ludicrous going on , I become one of those “ two paper ” dudes and get the Times and the News or the Post .
Yankees or Mets ?
I grew up in Boston , so just the premise of the question is a little uncomfortable for me .
I support my friends who are Yankees fans , but I find the team itself corporate and a tad self - possessed .
It ’s really odd for a team to expect to win the World Series every year .
What makes someone a New Yorker ?
One of the many great things about New York is that anyone can be a New Yorker .
A new intelligence institution to be inaugurated soon by the Bush administration will allow government spying agencies to conduct broad surveillance and reconnaissance inside the United States for the first time .
Under a proposal being reviewed by Congress , a National Applications Office ( NAO ) will be established to coordinate how the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) and domestic law enforcement and rescue agencies use imagery and communications intelligence picked up by U.S. spy satellites .
If the plan goes forward , the NAO will create the legal mechanism for an unprecedented degree of domestic intelligence gathering that would make the U.S. one of the world 's most closely monitored nations .
Until now , domestic use of electronic intelligence from spy satellites was limited to scientific agencies with no responsibility for national security or law enforcement .
The intelligence - sharing system to be managed by the NAO will rely heavily on private contractors including Boeing , BAE Systems , L - 3 Communications and Science Applications International Corporation ( SAIC ) .
These companies already provide technology and personnel to U.S. agencies involved in foreign intelligence , and the NAO greatly expands their markets .
Indeed , at an intelligence conference in San Antonio , Texas , last month , the titans of the industry were actively lobbying intelligence officials to buy products specifically designed for domestic surveillance .
The NAO was created under a plan tentatively approved in May 2007 by Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell .
Specifically , the NAO will oversee how classified information collected by the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency ( NGA ) and other key agencies is used within the U.S. during natural disasters , terrorist attacks and other events affecting national security .
The most critical intelligence will be supplied by the NSA and the NGA , which are often referred to by U.S. officials as the " eyes " and " ears " of the intelligence community .
The NSA , through a global network of listening posts , surveillance planes , and satellites , captures signals from phone calls , e-mail and Internet traffic , and translates and analyzes them for U.S. military and national intelligence officials .
The National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency ( NGA ) , which was formally inaugurated in 2003 , provides overhead imagery and mapping tools that allow intelligence and military analysts to monitor events from the skies and space .
The NSA and the NGA have a close relationship with the super - secret National Reconnaissance Office ( NRO ) , which builds and maintains the U.S. fleet of spy satellites and operates the ground stations where the NSA 's signals and the NGA 's imagery are processed and analyzed .
By law , their collection efforts are supposed to be confined to foreign countries and battlefields .
The National Applications Office was conceived in 2005 by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) , which Congress created in 2004 to oversee the 16 agencies that make up the U.S. intelligence community .
The ODNI , concerned that the legal framework for U.S. intelligence operations had not been updated for the global " war on terror , " turned to Booz Allen Hamilton of McLean , Virginia -- one of the largest contractors in the spy business .
The company was tasked with studying how intelligence from spy satellites and photoreconnaissance planes could be better used domestically to track potential threats to security within the U.S. .
The Booz Allen study was completed in May of that year , and has since become the basis for the NAO oversight plan .
In May 2007 , McConnell , the former executive vice president of Booz Allen , signed off on the creation of the NAO as the principal body to oversee the merging of foreign and domestic intelligence collection operations .
The NAO is " an idea whose time has arrived , " Charles Allen , a top U.S. intelligence official , told the Wall Street Journal in August 2007 after it broke the news of the creation of the NAO .
Allen , the DHS 's chief intelligence officer , will head the new program .
The announcement came just days after President George W. Bush signed a new law approved by Congress to expand the ability of the NSA to eavesdrop , without warrants , on telephone calls , e-mail and faxes passing through telecommunications hubs in the U.S. when the government suspects agents of a foreign power may be involved .
" These [ intelligence ] systems are already used to help us respond to crises , " Allen later told the Washington Post .
" We anticipate that we can also use them to protect Americans by preventing the entry of dangerous people and goods into the country , and by helping us examine critical infrastructure for vulnerabilities . "
Donald Kerr , a former NRO director who is now the number two at ODNI , recently explained to reporters that the intelligence community was no longer discussing whether or not to spy on U.S. citizens : " Our job now is to engage in a productive debate , which focuses on privacy as a component of appropriate levels of security and public safety , '' Kerr said .
'' I think all of us have to really take stock of what we already are willing to give up , in terms of anonymity , but [ also ] what safeguards we want in place to be sure that giving that does n't empty our bank account or do something equally bad elsewhere . ''
What Will The NAO Do ?
The plan for the NAO builds on a domestic security infrastructure that has been in place for at least seven years .
After the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the NSA was granted new powers to monitor domestic communications without obtaining warrants from a secret foreign intelligence court established by Congress in 1978 ( that warrant - less program ended in January 2007 but was allowed to continue , with some changes , under legislation passed by Congress in August 2007 ) .
Moreover , intelligence and reconnaissance agencies that were historically confined to spying on foreign countries have been used extensively on the home front since 2001 .
In the hours after the September 11th , 2001 attacks in New York , for example , the Bush administration called on the NGA to capture imagery from lower Manhattan and the Pentagon to help in the rescue and recovery efforts .
In 2002 , when two deranged snipers terrified the citizens of Washington and its Maryland and Virginia suburbs with a string of fatal shootings , the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) asked the NGA to provide detailed images of freeway interchanges and other locations to help spot the pair .
The NGA was also used extensively during Hurricane Katrina , when the agency provided overhead imagery -- some of it supplied by U - 2 photoreconnaissance aircraft -- to federal and state rescue operations .
The data , which included mapping of flooded areas in Louisiana and Mississippi , allowed residents of the stricken areas to see the extent of damage to their homes and helped first - responders locate contaminated areas as well as schools , churches and hospitals that might be used in the rescue .
More recently , during the October 2007 California wildfires , the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) asked the NGA to analyze overhead imagery of the fire zones and determine the areas of maximum intensity and damage .
In every situation that the NGA is used domestically , it must receive a formal request from a lead domestic agency , according to agency spokesperson David Burpee .
That agency is usually FEMA , which is a unit of DHS .
At first blush , the idea of a U.S. intelligence agency serving the public by providing imagery to aid in disaster recovery sounds like a positive development , especially when compared to the Bush administration 's misuse of the NSA and the Pentagon 's Counter - Intelligence Field Activity ( CIFA ) to spy on American citizens .
But the notion of using spy satellites and aircraft for domestic purposes becomes problematic from a civil liberties standpoint when the full capabilities of agencies like the NGA and the NSA are considered .
Imagine , for example , that U.S. intelligence officials have determined , through NSA telephone intercepts , that a group of worshippers at a mosque in Oakland , California , has communicated with an Islamic charity in Saudi Arabia .
This is the same group that the FBI and the U.S. Department of the Treasury believe is linked to an organization unfriendly to the United States .
Imagine further that the FBI , as a lead agency , asks and receives permission to monitor that mosque and the people inside using high - resolution imagery obtained from the NGA .
Using other technologies , such as overhead traffic cameras in place in many cities , that mosque could be placed under surveillance for months , and -- through cell phone intercepts and overhead imagery -- its suspected worshipers carefully tracked in real - time as they moved almost anywhere in the country .
The NAO , under the plan approved by ODNI 's McConnell , would determine the rules that will guide the DHS and other lead federal agencies when they want to use imagery and signals intelligence in situations like this , as well as during natural disasters .
If the organization is established as planned , U.S. domestic agencies will have a vast array of technology at their disposal .
In addition to the powerful mapping and signals tools provided by the NGA and the NSA , domestic agencies will also have access to measures and signatures intelligence ( MASINT ) managed by the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) , the principal spying agency used by the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
( MASINT is a highly classified form of intelligence that uses infrared sensors and other technologies to " sniff " the atmosphere for certain chemicals and electro - magnetic activity and " see " beneath bridges and forest canopies .
Using its tools , analysts can detect signs that a nuclear power plant is producing plutonium , determine from truck exhaust what types of vehicles are in a convoy , and detect people and weapons hidden from the view of satellites or photoreconnaissance aircraft . )
Created By Contractors
The study group that established policies for the NAO was jointly funded by the ODNI and the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) , one of only two domestic U.S. agencies that is currently allowed , under rules set in the 1970s , to use classified intelligence from spy satellites .
( The other is NASA , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . )
The group was chaired by Keith Hall , a Booz Allen vice president who manages his firm 's extensive contracts with the NGA and previously served as the director of the NRO .
Other members of the group included seven other former intelligence officers working for Booz Allen , as well as retired Army Lieutenant General Patrick M. Hughes , the former director of the DIA and vice president of homeland security for L - 3 Communications , a key NSA contractor ; and Thomas W. Conroy , the vice president of national security programs for Northrop Grumman , which has extensive contracts with the NSA and the NGA and throughout the intelligence community .
From the start , the study group was heavily weighted toward companies with a stake in both foreign and domestic intelligence .
Not surprisingly , its contractor - advisers called for a major expansion in the domestic use of the spy satellites that they sell to the government .
Since the end of the Cold War and particularly since the September 11 , 2001 attacks , they said , the " threats to the nation have changed and there is a growing interest in making available the special capabilities of the intelligence community to all parts of the government , to include homeland security and law enforcement entities and on a higher priority basis . "
Contractors are not new to the U.S. spy world .
Since the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the modern intelligence system in 1947 , the private sector has been tapped to design and build the technology that facilitates electronic surveillance .
Lockheed , for example , built the U - 2 , the famous surveillance plane that flew scores of spy missions over the Soviet Union and Cuba .
During the 1960s , Lockheed was a prime contractor for the Corona system of spy satellites that greatly expanded the CIA 's abilities to photograph secret military installations from space .
IBM , Cray Computers and other companies built the super - computers that allowed the NSA to sift through data from millions of telephone calls , and analyze them for intelligence that was passed on to national leaders .
Spending on contracts has increased exponentially in recent years along with intelligence budgets , and the NSA , the NGA and other agencies have turned to the private sector for the latest computer and communications technologies and for intelligence analysts .
For example , today about half of staff at the NSA and NGA are private contractors .
At the DIA , 35 percent of the workers are contractors .
But the most privatized agency of all is the NRO , where a whopping 90 percent of the workforce receive paychecks from corporations .
All told the U.S. intelligence agencies spend some 70 percent of their estimated $ 60 billion annual budget on contracts with private companies , according to documents this reporter obtained in June 2007 from the ODNI .
The plans to increase domestic spying are estimated to be worth billions of dollars in new business for the intelligence contractors .
The market potential was on display in October at GEOINT 2007 , the annual conference sponsored by the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Foundation ( USGIF ) , a non-profit organization funded by the largest contractors for the NGA .
During the conference , which took place in October at the spacious Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center in downtown San Antonio , many companies were displaying spying and surveillance tools that had been used in Afghanistan and Iraq and were now being re-branded for potential domestic use .
BAE Systems Inc .
On the first day of the conference , three employees of BAE Systems Inc. who had just returned from a three - week tour of Iraq and Afghanistan with the NGA demonstrated a new software package called SOCET GXP .
( BAE Systems Inc. is the U.S. subsidiary of the UK - based BAE , the third - largest military contractor in the world . )
GXP uses Google Earth software as a basis for creating three - dimensional maps that U.S. commanders and soldiers use to conduct intelligence and reconnaissance missions .
Eric Bruce , one of the BAE employees back from the Middle East , said his team trained U.S. forces to use the GXP software " to study routes for known terrorist sites " as well as to locate opium fields .
" Terrorists use opium to fund their war , " he said .
Bruce also said his team received help from Iraqi citizens in locating targets .
" Many of the locals can't read maps , so they tell the analysts , ' there is a mosque next to a hill , ' " he explained .
Bruce said BAE 's new package is designed for defense forces and intelligence agencies , but can also be used for homeland security and by highway departments and airports .
Earlier versions of the software were sold to the U.S. Army 's Topographic Engineering Center , where it has been used to collect data on more than 12,000 square kilometers of Iraq , primarily in urban centers and over supply routes .
Another new BAE tool displayed in San Antonio was a program called GOSHAWK , which stands for " Geospatial Operations for a Secure Homeland - Awareness , Workflow , Knowledge . "
It was pitched by BAE as a tool to help law enforcement and state and local emergency agencies prepare for , and respond to , " natural disasters and terrorist and criminal incidents . "
Under the GOSHAWK program , BAE supplies " agencies and corporations " with data providers and information technology specialists " capable of turning geospatial information into the knowledge needed for quick decisions . "
A typical operation might involve acquiring data from satellites , aircraft and sensors in ground vehicles , and integrating those data to support an emergency or security operations center .
One of the program 's special attributes , the company says , is its ability to " differentiate levels of classification , " meaning that it can deduce when data are classified and meant only for use by analysts with security clearances .
These two products were just a sampling of what BAE , a major player in the U.S. intelligence market , had to offer .
BAE 's services to U.S. intelligence -- including the CIA and the National Counter - Terrorism Center -- are provided through a special unit called the Global Analysis Business Unit .
It is located in McLean , Virginia , a stone 's throw from the CIA .
The unit is headed by John Gannon , a 25 - year veteran of the CIA who reached the agency 's highest analytical ranks as deputy director of intelligence and chairman of the National Intelligence Council .
Today , as a private sector contractor for the intelligence community , Gannon manages a staff of more than 800 analysts with security clearances .
A brochure for the Global Analysis unit distributed at GEOINT 2007 explains BAE 's role and , in the process , underscores the degree of outsourcing in U.S. intelligence .
" The demand for experienced , skilled , and cleared analysts - and for the best systems to manage them - has never been greater across the Intelligence and Defense Communities , in the field and among federal , state , and local agencies responsible for national and homeland security , " BAE says .
The mission of the Global Analysis unit , it says , " is to provide policymakers , warfighters , and law enforcement officials with analysts to help them understand the complex intelligence threats they face , and work force management programs to improve the skills and expertise of analysts . "
At the bottom of the brochure is a series of photographs illustrating BAE 's broad reach : a group of analysts monitoring a bank of computers ; three employees studying a map of Europe , the Middle East and the Horn of Africa ; the outlines of two related social networks that have been mapped out to show how their members are linked ; a bearded man , apparently from the Middle East and presumably a terrorist ; the fiery image of a car bomb after it exploded in Iraq ; and four white radar domes ( known as radomes ) of the type used by the NSA to monitor global communications from dozens of bases and facilities around the world .
The brochure may look and sound like typical corporate public relations .
But amid BAE 's spy talk were two phrases strategically placed by the company to alert intelligence officials that BAE has an active presence inside the U.S. .
The tip - off words were " federal , state and local agencies , " " law enforcement officials " and " homeland security . "
By including them , BAE was broadcasting that it is not simply a contractor for agencies involved in foreign intelligence , but has an active presence as a supplier to domestic security agencies , a category that includes the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , the FBI as well as local and state police forces stretching from Maine to Hawaii .
ManTech , Boeing , Harris and L - 3
ManTech International , an important NSA contractor based in Fairfax , Virginia , has perfected the art of creating multi-agency software programs for both foreign and domestic intelligence .
After the September 11th , 2001 attacks , it developed a classified program for the Defense Intelligence Agency called the Joint Regional Information Exchange System .
DIA used it to combine classified and unclassified intelligence on terrorist threats on a single desktop .
ManTech then tweaked that software for the Department of Homeland Security and sold it to DHS for its Homeland Security Information Network .
According to literature ManTech distributed at GEOINT , that software will " significantly strengthen the exchange of real - time threat information used to combat terrorism . "
ManTech , the brochure added , " also provides extensive , advanced information technology support to the National Security Agency " and other agencies .
In a nearby booth , Chicago , Illinois - based Boeing , the world 's second largest defense contractor , was displaying its " information sharing environment " software , which is designed to meet the Office of the Director of National Intelligence 's new requirements on agencies to stop buying " stovepiped " systems that can't talk to each other .
The ODNI wants to focus on products that will allow the NGA and other agencies to easily share their classified imagery with the CIA and other sectors of the community .
" To ensure freedom in the world , the United States continues to address the challenges introduced by terrorism , " a Boeing handout said .
Its new software , the company said , will allow information to be " shared efficiently and uninterrupted across intelligence agencies , first responders , military and world allies . "
Boeing has a reason for publishing boastful material like this :
In 2005 , it lost a major contract with the NRO to build a new generation of imaging satellites after ringing up billions of dollars in cost - overruns .
The New York Times recently called the Boeing project " the most spectacular and expensive failure in the 50 - year history of American spy satellite projects . "
Boeing 's geospatial intelligence offerings are provided through its Space and Intelligence Systems unit , which also holds contracts with the NSA .
It allows agencies and military units to map global shorelines and create detailed maps of cities and battlefields , complete with digital elevation data that allow users to construct three - dimensional maps .
( In an intriguing aside , one Boeing intelligence brochure lists among its " specialized organizations " Jeppesen Government and Military Services .
According to a 2006 account by New Yorker reporter Jane Mayer , Jeppesen provided logistical and navigational assistance , including flight plans and clearance to fly over other countries , to the CIA for its " extraordinary rendition " program . )
Although less known as an intelligence contractor than BAE and Boeing , the Harris Corporation has become a major force in providing contracted electronic , satellite and information technology services to the intelligence community , including the NSA and the NRO .
In 2007 , according to its most recent annual report , the $ 4.2 billion company , based in Melbourne , Florida , won several new classified contracts .
NSA awarded one of them for software to be used by NSA analysts in the agency 's " Rapidly Deployable Integrated Command and Control System , " which is used by the NSA to transmit " actionable intelligence " to soldiers and commanders in the field .
Harris also supplies geospatial and imagery products to the NGA .
At GEOINT , Harris displayed a new product that allows agencies to analyze live video and audio data imported from UAVs .
It was developed , said Fred Poole , a Harris market development manager , " with input from intelligence analysts who were looking for a video and audio analysis tool that would allow them to perform ' intelligence fusion ' " -- combining information from several agencies into a single picture of an ongoing operation .
For many of the contractors at GEOINT , the highlight of the symposium was an " interoperability demonstration " that allowed vendors to show how their products would work in a domestic crisis .
One scenario involved Cuba as a rogue nation supplying spent nuclear fuel to terrorists bent on creating havoc in the U.S. .
Implausible as it was , the plot , which involved maritime transportation and ports , allowed the companies to display software that was likely already in use by the Department of Homeland Security and Naval Intelligence .
The " plot " involved the discovery by U.S. intelligence of a Cuban ship carrying spent nuclear fuel heading for the U.S. Gulf Coast ; an analysis of the social networks of Cuban officials involved with the illicit cargo ; and the tracking and interception of the cargo as it departed from Cuba and moved across the Caribbean to Corpus Christi , Texas , a major port on the Gulf Coast .
The agencies involved included the NGA , the NSA , Naval Intelligence and the Marines , and some of the key contractors working for those agencies .
It illustrated how sophisticated the U.S. domestic surveillance system has become in the six years since the 9/11 attacks .
L - 3 Communications , which is based in New York city , was a natural for the exercise :
As mentioned earlier , retired Army Lt. General Patrick M. Hughes , its vice president of homeland security , was a member of the Booz Allen Hamilton study group that advised the Bush administration to expand the domestic use of military spy satellites .
At GEOINT , L - 3 displayed a new program called " multi-INT visualization environment " that combines imagery and signals intelligence data that can be laid over photographs and maps .
One example shown during the interoperability demonstration showed how such data would be incorporated into a map of Florida and the waters surrounding Cuba .
With L - 3 a major player at the NSA , this demonstration software is likely seeing much use as the NSA and the NGA expand their information - sharing relationship .
Over the past two years , for example , the NGA has deployed dozens of employees and contractors to Iraq to support the " surge " of U.S. troops .
The NGA teams provide imagery and full - motion video -- much of it beamed to the ground from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAV ) -- that help U.S. commanders and soldiers track and destroy insurgents fighting the U.S. occupation .
And since 2004 , under a memorandum of understanding with the NSA , the NGA has begun to incorporate signals intelligence into its imagery products .
The blending technique allows U.S. military units to track and find targets by picking up signals from their cell phones , follow the suspects in real - time using overhead video , and direct fighter planes and artillery units to the exact location of the targets -- and blow them to smithereens .
That 's exactly how U.S. Special Forces tracked and killed Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , the alleged leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq , the NGA 's director , Navy Vice Admiral Robert Murrett , said in 2006 .
Later , Murrett told reporters during GEOINT 2007 , the NSA and the NGA have cooperated in similar fashion in several other fronts of the " war on terror , " including in the Horn of Africa , where the U.S. military has attacked Al Qaeda units in Somalia , and in the Philippines , where U.S. forces are helping the government put down the Muslim insurgent group Abu Sayyaf .
" When the NGA and the NSA work together , one plus one equals five , " said Murrett .
Civil Liberty Worries
For U.S. citizens , however , the combination of NGA imagery and NSA signals intelligence in a domestic situation could threaten important constitutional safeguards against unwarranted searches and seizures .
Kate Martin , the director of the Center for National Security Studies , a nonprofit advocacy organization , has likened the NAO plan to " Big Brother in the Sky . "
The Bush administration , she told the Washington Post , is " laying the bricks one at a time for a police state . "
Some Congress members , too , are concerned .
" The enormity of the NAO 's capabilities and the intended use of the imagery received through these satellites for domestic homeland security purposes , and the unintended consequences that may arise , have heightened concerns among the general public , including reputable civil rights and civil liberties organizations , " Bennie G. Thompson , a Democratic member of Congress from Mississippi and the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , wrote in a September letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff .
Thompson and other lawmakers reacted with anger after reports of the NAO and the domestic spying plan were first revealed by the Wall Street Journal in August .
" There was no briefing , no hearing , and no phone call from anyone on your staff to any member of this committee of why , how , or when satellite imagery would be shared with police and sheriffs ' officers nationwide , " Thompson complained to Chertoff .
At a hastily organized hearing in September , Thompson and others demanded that the opening of the NAO be delayed until further studies were conducted on its legal basis and questions about civil liberties were answered .
They also demanded biweekly updates from Chertoff on the activities and progress of the new organization .
Others pointed out the potential danger of allowing U.S. military satellites to be used domestically .
" It will terrify you if you really understand the capabilities of satellites , " warned Jane Harman , a Democratic member of Congress from California , who represents a coastal area of Los Angeles where many of the nation 's satellites are built .
As Harman well knows , military spy satellites are far more flexible , offer greater resolution , and have considerably more power to observe human activity than commercial satellites .
" Even if this program is well - designed and executed , someone somewhere else could hijack it , " Harman said during the hearing .
The NAO was supposed to open for business on October 1 , 2007 .
But the Congressional complaints have led the ODNI and DHS to delay their plans .
The NAO " has no intention to begin operations until we address your questions , " Charles Allen of DHS explained in a letter to Thompson .
In an address at the GEOINT conference in San Antonio , Allen said that the ODNI is working with DHS and the Departments of Justice and Interior to draft the charter for the new organization , which he said will face " layers of review " once it is established .
Yet , given the Bush administration 's record of using U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on U.S. citizens , it is difficult to take such promises at face value .
Moreover , the extensive corporate role in foreign and domestic intelligence means that the private sector has a great deal to gain in the new plan for intelligence - sharing .
Because most private contracts with intelligence agencies are classified , however , the public will have little knowledge of this role .
Before Congress signs off on the NAO , it should create a better oversight system that would allow the House of Representatives and the Senate to monitor the new organization and to examine how BAE , Boeing , Harris and its fellow corporations stand to profit from this unprecedented expansion of America 's domestic intelligence system .

Amazon.com said today that it has agreed to buy digital spoken word audio provider Audible Inc for $ 11.50 a share .
The online retailer valued the transaction at about $ 300 m which includes Audible 's cash and short - term investments .
Under the deal , Amazon said it will start a cash tender offer to buy all of Audible 's remaining shares .
New Jersey - based Audible sells around 80,000 programs that include audiobooks from the likes of Stephen King and Jane Austen .
The firm , which was founded in 1997 , also has operations in the UK , Germany and France .

By firing radioactive ammunition , the U.S. , U.K. , and Israel may have triggered a nuclear holocaust in the Middle East that , over time , will prove deadlier than the U.S. atomic bombing of Japan .
So much ammunition containing depleted uranium ( DU ) has been fired , asserts nuclear authority Leuren Moret , “ The genetic future of the Iraqi people for the most part , is destroyed . ”
“ More than ten times the amount of radiation released during atmospheric testing ( of nuclear bombs ) has been released from depleted uranium weaponry since 1991 , ” Moret writes , including radioactive ammunition fired by Israeli troops in Palestine .
Moret is an independent U.S. scientist formerly employed for five years at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and also at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , both of California .
Adds Arthur Bernklau , of Veterans For Constitutional Law , “ The long - term effect of DU is a virtual death sentence .
Iraq is a toxic wasteland .
Anyone who is there stands a good chance of coming down with cancer and leukemia .
In Iraq , the birth rate of mutations is totally out of control . ”
Moret , a Berkeley , Calif. , Environmental Commissioner and past president of the Association for Women Geoscientists , says , “ For every genetic defect that we can see now , in future generations there are thousands more that will be expressed . ”
She adds , “ the ( Iraq ) environment now is completely radioactive . ”
Dr. Helen Caldicott , the prominent anti-nuclear crusader , has written : “ Much of the DU is in cities such as Baghdad , where half the population of 5 million people are children who played in the burned - out tanks and on the sandy , dusty ground . ”
“ Children are 10 to 20 times more susceptible to the carcinogenic effects of radiation than adults , ” Caldicott wrote .
“ My pediatric colleagues in Basra , where this ordnance was used in 1991 , report a sevenfold increase in childhood cancer and a sevenfold increase in gross congenital abnormalities , ” she wrote in her book , “ Nuclear Power is not the Answer ” ( The New Press ) .
Caldicott goes on to say the two Gulf wars “ have been nuclear wars because they have scattered nuclear material across the land , and people --- particularly children --- are condemned to die of malignancy and congenital disease essentially for eternity . ”
Because of the extremely long half - life of uranium 238 , one of the radioactive elements in the shells fired , “ the food , the air , and the water in the cradle of civilization have been forever contaminated , ” Caldicott explained .
Uranium is a heavy metal that enters the body via inhalation into the lung or via ingestion into the GI tract .
It is excreted by the kidney , where , if the dose is high enough , it can induce renal failure or kidney cancer .
It also lodges in the bones where it causes bone cancer and leukemia , and it is excreted in the semen , where it mutates genes in the sperm , leading to birth deformities .
Nuclear contamination is spreading around the world , Caldicott adds , with heaviest concentrations in regions within a 1,000 - mile radius of Baghdad and Afghanistan .
These are , notably , northern India , southern Russia , Turkey , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Tibet , Pakistan , Kuwait , the Gulf emirates , and Jordan .
“ Downwind from the radioactive devastation in Iraq , Israel is also suffering from large increases in breast cancer , leukemia and childhood diabetes , ” Moret asserts .
Doug Rokke , formerly the top U.S. Army DU clean - up officer and now anti-DU crusader , says Israeli tankers fired radioactive shells during the invasion of Lebanon last year .
U.S. and NATO forces also used DU ammunition in Kosovo .
Rokke says he is quite ill from the effects of DU and that members of his clean - up crew have died from it .
As a result of DU bombardments , Caldicott writes , “ Severe birth defects have been reported in babies born to contaminated civilians in Iraq , Yugoslavia , and Afghanistan and the incidence and severity of defects is increasing over time . ”
Like symptoms have been reported among infants born to U.S. service personnel that fought in the Gulf Wars .
One survey of 251 returned Gulf War veterans from Mississippi made by the Veterans Administration found 67 % of children born to them suffered from “ severe illnesses and deformities . ”
Some were born without brains or vital organs or with no arms , hands , or arms , or with hands attached to their shoulders .
While U.S. officials deny DU ammunition is dangerous , it is a fact Gulf War veterans were the first Americans ever to fight on a radioactive battlefield , and their children apparently are the first known to display these ghastly deformities .
Soldiers who survived being hit by radioactive ammunition , as well as those who fired it , are falling ill , often showing signs of radiation sickness .
Of the 700,000 U.S. veterans of the first Gulf War , more than 240,000 are on permanent medical disability and 11,000 are dead , published reports indicate .
This is an astonishing toll from such a short conflict in which fewer than 400 U.S. soldiers were killed on the battlefield .
Of course , “ depleted uranium munitions were and remain another causative factor behind Gulf War Syndrome ( GWS ) , ” writes Francis Boyle , a leading American authority on international law in his book “ Biowarfare and Terrorism , ” from Clarity Press Inc .
“ The Pentagon continues to deny that there is such a medical phenomenon categorized as GWS --- even beyond the point where everyone knows that denial is pure propaganda and disinformation , ” Boyle writes .
Boyle contends , “ The Pentagon will never own up to the legal , economic , tortious , political , and criminal consequences of admitting the existence of GWS .
So U.S. and U.K. veterans of Gulf War I as well as their afterborn children will continue to suffer and die .
The same will prove true for U.S. and U.S. veterans of Bush Jr. ’s Gulf War II as well as their afterborn children . ”
Boyle said the use of DU is outlawed under the 1925 Geneva Convention prohibiting poison gas .
Chalmers Johnson , president of the Japan Policy Research Institute , writes in his “ The Sorrows of Empire ” ( Henry Holt and Co. ) that , given the abnormal clusters of childhood cancers and deformities in Iraq as well as Kosovo , the evidence points “ toward a significant role for DU . ”
By insisting on its use , Johnson adds , “ the military is deliberately flouting a 1996 United Nations resolution that classifies DU ammunition as an illegal weapon of mass destruction . ”
Moret calls DU “ the Trojan Horse of nuclear war . ”
She describes it as “ the weapon that keeps killing . ”
Indeed , the half - life of Uranium - 238 is 4.5 - billion years , and as it decays it spawns other deadly radioactive by - products .
Radioactive fallout from DU apparently blew far and wide .
Following the initial U.S. bombardment of Iraq in 2003 , DU particles traveled 2,400 miles to Great Britain in about a week , where atmospheric radiation quadrupled .
But it is in the Middle East , predominantly Iraq , where the bulk of the radioactive waste has been dumped .
In the early Nineties , the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority warned that 50 tons of dust from DU explosions could claim a half million lives from cancer by year 2000 .
Not 50 tons , but an estimated two thousand radioactive tons have been fired off in the Middle East , suggesting the possibility over time of an even higher death toll .
Dr. Keith Baverstock , a World Health Organization radiation advisor , informed the media , Iraq ’s arid climate would increase exposure from its tiny particles as they are blown about and inhaled by the civilian population for years to come .
The civilian death toll from the August , 1945 , U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki has been put at 140,000 and 80,000 , respectively .
Over time , however , deaths from radiation sickness are thought to have claimed the lives of another 100,000 Japanese civilians .

None other than Time magazine sets the record straight this week about Edwards , and indirectly indicts the absurdly biased and irresponsible behavior by campaign reporters and pundits alike :
" Another challenge is that much of the attention he 's gotten recently has been the unflattering kind , stories that question his sincerity and assail his image as a fighter for the little guy by focusing on his pricey haircuts , huge house and hedge - fund job .
These viral attacks , spreading from the Drudge Report and other blogs to newspapers everywhere , make a dumb argument .
They assume that someone who 's wealthy can't be a sincere advocate for poor and working people .
By that logic , the healthy can't speak on behalf of the sick , or whites on behalf of people of color ...
Here 's what would truly be hypocritical : if Edwards spoke out on behalf of the disadvantaged while pushing policies that benefit the rich .
This he does not do .
He favors boosting the capital - gains tax rate for families earning over $ 250,000 and closing the loophole that allows fund managers — like those at Fortress Investment Group , where he earned almost $ 500,000 in 2006 — to get taxed at just 15 % .
' He wants to take money away from the people who paid him , ' says deputy campaign manager Jonathan Prince .
' That 's not hypocrisy .
That 's sincerity . ' "
That 's exactly right .
No one is saying Edwards ' moves have been perfectly smooth , but the idea that his actions are somehow hypocritical or that they undermine his credibility on the major issues he 's campaigning on ( and has made his life 's career about ) is just ridiculous .
And let 's be clear :
On the flip side , we know what true hypocrisy is .
To refresh your memory , here are some examples ( in no particular order ) :
U.S. Senate candidate Bob Schaffer ( R - CO ) grandstanding and telling his fellow school board commissioners to disclose their conflicts of interest , and then himself refusing to disclose his own conflicts of interest .
Mitt Romney ( R ) campaigning for governor aggressively billing himself as pro-choice to the point where he gets angry at his opponent for saying otherwise ;
And then , just a few short years later , campaigning for president declaring he's the greatest anti-choice leader in contemporary American history .
Presidential candidate Fred Thompson ( R ) billing himself as a down - home political outsider even though he 's spent most of his adult life as a corporate lobbyist in Washington .
President George Bush portraying himself as a plain - spoken cowboy and independent entrepreneurial businessman even though he grew up an aristocrat and had his personal fortunes built by massive public subsidies secured by his father 's financial and political network .
Presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani ( R ) presenting himself as the strongest candidate in the race on homeland security issues , even though his single defining homeland security experience was negligently contributing to the health plight of New York firefighters .
Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton ( D ) billing herself as the candidate of " change " and the candidate who will represent the middle class , at the same time Businessweek reports that she is allowing Wall Street titans to " refine " her economic policy platform .
Now , I 'm not naive .
I realize it is probably more fun for reporters and pundits to fulminate about John Edwards ' haircuts and to make up gotcha narratives - all while giving probably the most serious speech in the last last 30 years of presidential campaign politics just 275 words on page A15 .
It is more fun , and requires no actual work , reporting or thinking - you know , those old fashioned and unfortunately outdated tenets of " journalism . "
But at least one magazine managed to get the story right about Edwards - and about the media .
It 's not much - but it is a start .

But temperamental conservatives are suspicious of the idea of settling issues on the basis of abstract truth .
These kinds of conservatives hold that moral laws emerge through deliberation and practice and that if legislation is going to be passed that slows medical progress , it should n’t be on the basis of abstract theological orthodoxy .
Over the past four decades , free market conservatives within the Republican Party have put freedom at the center of their political philosophy .
But the dispositional conservative puts legitimate authority at the center .
So while recent conservative ideology sees government as a threat to freedom , the temperamental conservative believes government is like fire — useful when used legitimately , but dangerous when not .
Over the past few decades , the Republican Party has championed a series of reforms designed to devolve power to the individual , through tax cuts , private pensions and medical accounts .
The temperamental conservative does not see a nation composed of individuals who should be given maximum liberty to make choices .
Instead , the individual is a part of a social organism and thrives only within the attachments to family , community and nation that precede choice .
Therefore , the temperamental conservative values social cohesion alongside individual freedom and worries that too much individualism , too much segmentation , too much tension between races and groups will tear the underlying unity on which all else depends .
Without unity , the police are regarded as alien powers , the country will fracture under the strain of war and the economy will be undermined by lack of social trust .
To put it bluntly , over the past several years , the G.O.P. has made ideological choices that offend conservatism ’s Burkean roots .
This may seem like an airy - fairy thing that does nothing more than provoke a few dissenting columns from William F. Buckley , George F. Will and Andrew Sullivan .
But suburban , Midwestern and many business voters are dispositional conservatives more than creedal conservatives .
They care about order , prudence and balanced budgets more than transformational leadership and perpetual tax cuts .
It is among these groups that G.O.P. support is collapsing .
American conservatism will never be just dispositional conservatism .
America is a creedal nation .
But American conservatism is only successful when it ’s in tension — when the ambition of its creeds is restrained by the caution of its Burkean roots .
1 A 10 - Pound Hairball ( unidentified 18 - year - old woman – New England , USA )
The New England Journal of Medicine reported on November 2007 how doctors took a 10 - pound hairball from an 18 - year - old woman after she came to them with pain and a 40 - pound weight loss .
The woman had been suffering with pain in her abdomen for about five months .
Doctors found a mass there , and when they used a small camera , found that the hairball was taking up nearly her entire stomach .
The patient said that she has a habit of eating her own hair , a condition called trichophagia .
Doctors tried to use small incisions to remove the mass , but then had to go to traditional surgery to make sure the entire hairball was removed .
The journal ’s report said the girl left the hospital after five days and was asked to follow up with a psychiatrist .
Within a year , she had regained about half of the weight she lost and said she had stopped eating her hair .
2 Live Frogs and Rats ( Yang Dingcai – China )
Yang Dingcai , in southeast China says 40 years of swallowing tree frogs and rats live has helped him avoid intestinal complaints and made him strong .
Jiang Musheng , a 66 - year - old resident of Jiangxi province , suffered from frequent abdominal pains and coughing from the age of 26 , until an old man called Yang Dingcai suggested tree frogs as a remedy , the Beijing News said on Tuesday .
“ At first , Jiang Musheng did not dare to eat a live , wriggling frog , but after seeing Yang Dingcai swallow one , he ate … two without a thought , ” the paper said .
” After a month of eating live frogs , his stomach pains and coughing were completely gone . ”
Over the years Jiang had added live mice , baby rats and green frogs to his diet , and had once eaten 20 mice in a single day , the paper said .
3 20 cobblestones ( unidentified young woman – China )
In 2006 , a girl from Foshan , China , swallowed down more than 20 cobblestones in a moment of anger after a big quarrel with her boyfriend .
Initially , she thought the stones would be flushed out after clearing her bowels , but unfortunately they remained intact within her body for the next few days .
To make matters worse , she constantly felt that the stones were knocking against each other within her stomach which caused some pain and discomfort .
After visiting the hospital and taking an X - ray , she was advised to undergo surgery to remove the stones .
Shocked and not knowing what to do , she tried seeking for help at a local hospital ’s online forum .
As further complications may occur if she delays her medical treatment , doctors have advised her to undergo treatment as soon as possible , with the first attempts through the non-painful gastroscope for extracting stones .
4 A Plane , a Bike , and so on ( Michel Lotito – France )
Michel Lotito ( born 1950 ) is a French entertainer , famous as the consumer of undigestables , and is known as Monsieur Mangetout ( Mister Eat - it - all ) .
Lotito ’s performances are the consumption of metal , glass , rubber and so on in items such as bicycles , televisions , a Cessna 150 , and smaller items which are disassembled , cut - up and swallowed .
The aircraft took roughly two years to be ‘ eaten ’ from 1978 to 1980 .
He began eating unusual material while a child and has been performing publicly since 1966 .
Lotito does not often suffer from ill - effects due to his diet , even after the consumption of materials usually considered poisonous .
When performing he consumes around a kilogram of material daily , preceding it with mineral oil and drinking considerable quantities of water during the ‘ meal ’ .
He apparently possesses a stomach and intestine with walls of twice the expected thickness , and his digestive acids are , allegedly , unusually powerful , allowing him to digest a certain portion of his metallic meals .

Which Type of Light Bulb is Better for the Environment ?
The era of conventional light bulbs , also known as incandescent light bulbs , is about to run out soon .
This is because laws are being passed throughout the world to ban these types of light bulbs for more efficient light bulbs .
For instance , the new compact fluorescent light bulbs ( CFLs ) use significantly less electricity when used .
This is mainly because CFLs produce a lot less heat compared to incandescent light bulbs , and the generation of heat is basically the loss of energy .
Even though CFLs are more expensive than incandescent light bulbs , if it believed that CFLs are more cost effective when factoring in their longer life spans and lower energy consumption .
If this is true , then there is no need to ban the traditional incandescent light bulbs ; because the free market will automatically obsolete the least cost effective type of light bulb .
The only problem with CFLs is that they contain an extremely toxic substance called mercury .
If a single CFL breaks , then it could be very costly to clean up .
For instance , a carpet or rug would need to be thrown away and that could cost thousands of dollars , however using a disposable wet rag is all that is necessary to clean mercury off of tile or cement .
Furthermore , because CFLs contain mercury , they are not allowed to be thrown away with the regular trash in most places in the world , and proper disposal for CFLs is not well known or available everywhere .
As a result , CFLs should not be considered environmentally friendly , even though they use less electricity .
In fact , a lot of scientists and environmentalists are against CFLs , at least until CFLs are created without extremely toxic materials such as mercury .
The third and least popular type of light bulbs are light emitting diodes ( LEDs ) .
LEDs supposedly use less electricity than CFLs and incandescent light bulbs ; however LEDs are currently much more expensive and harder to find .
LEDs also have the added benefit of containing no toxic substances .
Furthermore , LEDs supposedly last significantly longer than CFLs and incandescent light bulbs too .
Hopefully with further scientific advances and larger scales of mass production , the price of LEDs will become competitive .
Therefore , LEDs are the most energy efficient and environmentally friendly light bulbs .
As a result , politicians should stop trying to ban the old traditional light bulbs but instead help decrease the costs of LEDs .
Though not available for light bulbs , another friend to the environment is photoluminescent lighting .
It absorbs and re-radiates photons , and is most commonly used for exit signs in office buildings .
It is a cost - effective and eco-friendly alternative to the traditional forms of lighting used for emergency signage .

Mexico City also allows same sex civil unions
It is the first country in Roman Catholic - dominated Latin America to approve such a measure nationwide .
The Uruguayan President , Tabare Vazquez , is now expected to sign the bill into law .
Under its provisions , couples who have lived together for five years will have rights similar to those already enjoyed by married couples .
Couples will have to register their relationship with authorities to gain the cohabitation rights - covering areas such as inheritance , pensions and child custody - and will also be able to formalise the end of their union .
Several cities across Latin America , including Buenos Aires and Mexico City , have recently adopted similar measures .

Jean Charles de Menezes was killed by firearms officers
It heard the Brazilian was shot seven times because of " fundamental failures " in Metropolitan Police planning .
One armed officer put a gun into a colleague 's chest and a Tube driver was chased down a tunnel .
The force denies breaking health and safety laws when it mistook Mr de Menezes for a suicide bomber in 2005 .
Opening the unprecedented trial of the force at the Old Bailey , Clare Montgomery QC , prosecuting , said that the Metropolitan Police was subject to the same health and safety obligations as any other employer or public body in the UK .
22 JULY 2005 : EVENTS 0455 : Bomber Hussain Osman linked to address 0600 : Surveillance team reach flats 0933 : De Menezes leaves flats 0939 : Tailing officers unsure who he is 1002 : De Menezes reaches Stockwell Tube 1005 : Armed police take over 1008 : De Menezes reported shot
These laws were there to ensure public safety , she said , but a " shocking and catastrophic " failure to stick to a clear strategy to apprehend one of the 21 July 2005 bombers had left the public at risk of being blown up and ultimately led to Mr de Menezes ' avoidable death .
" It was the police operation itself that invited the disaster that occurred , " she said .
" We say that the police planned and carried out the operation so badly that the public was put at risk and Jean Charles was killed . "
Ms Montgomery said that in fast moving events , detectives had identified one of the suspected 21 July suicide bombers , Hussain Osman , within hours of the botched attacks .
They linked him to a small block of flats in Tulse Hill , south London which was also the home of Mr de Menezes .
The fact the police ended up pointing a gun at another police man and mistaking a terrorised train driver for a bomber gives you a clue as to just how far wrong the operation had gone
Clare Montgomery QC
But when Mr de Menezes left his home and was followed , neither the officers on the ground , nor those in operational control at Scotland Yard , were certain of his identity .
One spotter told commanders it was " ridiculous " to ask him for a " percentage certainty " that the target was Osman .
" By comparing the photo of Jean Charles with a photo of Hussain Osman , you may understand why some of the officers at least thought Jean Charles might be Osman , " said Ms Montgomery .
" None of them said he was definitely Osman . "
This uncertainty continued until the very last moments of his life when commanders at Scotland Yard and firearms officers on the ground make a series of rapid decisions which dictated who was going to try to arrest the electrician , the court heard .
Scotland Yard 's operation room was noisy and staffed by tired and drained staff , the court heard .
More and more officers were crowding in as news of the operation spread .
As surveillance officers sat near Mr de Menezes on the tube , firearms officers " burst " onto the platform , said Ms Montgomery .
One surveillance officer , codenamed ' Ivor ' , alerted them to Mr de Menezes ' position .
Terrified driver
" As the armed officers entered the train , Jean Charles stood up , " said the lawyer .
" He was grabbed by ' Ivor ' and pushed back into his seat .
" Two firearms officers leant over Ivor who was holding Jean Charles and [ one ] put his pistol against Jean Charles ' head and fired .
He was shot seven times and died immediately . "
At the same time , one of the armed officers physically dragged ' Ivor ' onto the platform while holding a gun against his chest .
Ivor shouted he was a policeman and heard more shots in the carriage .
Terrified , the tube driver fled his cab - but was chased by another armed officer into the tunnel .
Ms Montgomery said : " You may think , members of the jury , that the fact the police ended up pointing a gun at another police man and mistaking a terrorised train driver for a bomber gives you a clue as to just how far wrong the operation had gone . "
Comment Somebody toss me a Che Guevara T - shirt .
Google and Microsoft have gone to war over open source software .
On Aug. 10 , Redmond submitted the Microsoft Permissive License to the Open Source Initiative ( OSI ) .
Should the license be approved , Microsoft would receive the " open source " seal of approval that only the OSI – by self - proclamation – can okay .
Many open source watchers have applauded Microsoft 's OSI approach .
You 'll remember that Microsoft has dubbed some open source software the work of cancer - ridden communists .
So , seeking " open source " approval shows the software maker has come a long way .
Of course , one could argue that Microsoft – once blessed with the open source label – will only abuse its status .
The company could claim to be a huge open source supporter , derailing critics ' arguments by displaying nothing more than the OSI logo when needed .
Chris DiBona , Google 's open source manager , seems to fall into this cynical camp .
I 'll quote DiBona 's Aug. 16 posting to an OSI discussion list in full as proof .
I would like to ask what might be perceived as a diversion and maybe even a mean spirited one .
Does this submission to the OSI mean that Microsoft will : a ) Stop using the market confusing term Shared Source b)
Not place these licenses and the other , clearly non-free , non-osd licenses in the same place thus muddying the market further .
c)
Continue its path of spreading misinformation about the nature of open source software , especially that licensed under the GPL ? d)
Stop threatening with patents and oem pricing manipulation schemes to deter the use of open source software ?
If not , why should the OSI approve of your efforts ?
That of a company who has called those who use the licenses that OSI purports to defend a communist or a cancer ?
Why should we see this seeking of approval as anything but yet another attack in the guise of friendliness ?
Finally , why should yet another set of minority , vanity licenses be approved by an OSI that has been attempting to deter copycat licenses and reduce license proliferation ?
I 'm asked this for all recent license - submitters and you are no different :-)
The smiley face did n't go as far as DiBona hoped toward diluting the force of his questions .
Bill Hilf , Microsoft's , er , open source chief , shot back at DiBona .
I 'm unclear how some of your questions are related to our license submissions , which is what I believe this list and the submission process are designed to facilitate .
You 're questioning things such as Microsoft 's marketing terms , press quotes , where we put licenses on our web site , and how we work with OEMs - none of which I could find at http://opensource.org/docs/osd.
If you 'd like to discuss this , I 'd be happy to - and I have a number of questions for you about Google 's use of and intentions with open source software as well .
But this is unrelated to the OSD compliance of a license , so I will do this off - list and preferably face to face or over the phone .
Come on , guys .
Do n't discuss the issues behind closed doors .
We all want to watch the show .
Hilf Me
I think it would be near impossible for an outside observer not to take Microsoft 's side here .
For one , Microsoft has done all the OSI asks by submitting its license in the proper fashion for review .
If the license meets the OSI 's open source definition , does it really matter who submitted it ?

This is n't Russia , Danny .
Beyond that , Google hardly stands as a model open source company – a point noted by Hilf .
Google has become the poster child for the software as a service ( SaaS ) abuse of open source software .
The ad broker uses copious amounts of open code but gets around returning changes to " the community " by claiming it does not redistribute the code .
Instead , Google simply places the software on servers and ships a service to consumers .
The Free Software Foundation avoided closing the SaaS hole – a problem caused by an archaic notion of distribution as being tied to a diskette or CD – with GPL v3 .
Google could n't care less about that though , since it will avoid any problematic license
" We have enough engineering resources that , if the license has obligations we are not interested in , we can just not use it , " DiBona said , at the recent OSCON conference .
Google 's secretive nature leaves us in the dark as to how much code it has turned back to " the community . "
The best statement I 've seen thus far has a Google official claiming to have put back 1 million lines of code .
Does such generosity move you ?
Or do you find Yahoo !'s forceful backing of Hadoop more impressive ?

Congress 's failure last week to agree whether and how to fund the war puts the onus on the Pentagon , at least for now , to find a way to cover expenses in Iraq , potentially forcing the Defense Department to close dozens of domestic military bases and imperil the livelihoods of tens of thousands of defense workers .
The congressional inaction may trigger Secretary Robert Gates to carry out his threat last week to furlough as many as 200,000 civil servants and defense contractors this winter , raising the stakes for Democratic lawmakers determined to tie war funding to a drawdown of US troops from Iraq .
Before lawmakers left town Friday for their Thanksgiving recess , they did approve the Pentagon 's $ 470 billion base budget , but not a supplemental funding request to pay for war operations .
Democrats do n't want to fund that $ 189 billion defense request from President Bush unless the money is tied to deadlines , or at least goals , to bring the bulk of troops home from Iraq by the end of 2008 .
One Democratic measure , to provide $ 50 billion for war operations as long as the Pentagon aims to all but finish the redeployment of troops by December 2008 , failed in the Senate on Friday .
Another measure backed by Republicans , to provide $ 70 billion with no such deadline language , also failed , leaving the Pentagon uncertain about how to pay for the next several months of operations in Iraq .
That leaves the Pentagon with no choice , according to Secretary Gates , who said bluntly last week that the furloughs would be " the least undesirable " of the limited options if it runs out of money .
The Defense Department would begin laying off nonuniformed defense workers , effectively shutting down all Army bases by February , followed by at least some Marine bases a month later .
The urgency stems from federal laws that require workers to be notified 60 days in advance that they might be furloughed in another month .
Though Gates is considered one of the least partisan members of the Bush Cabinet , some see his strategy as politically shrewd .
It may well force congressional Democrats to back away , at least for now , from their strategy to tie war funding to a troop - withdrawal deadline , says Loren Thompson , a senior analyst at the Lexington Institute , a think tank near Washington .
Otherwise , Democrats could be seen as not supporting troops in the field , even though the furloughs would not affect troops directly at first .
" If this is yet another cat - and - mouse game over war funding , people should be clear that Gates is the cat , because in the end the Democratic mice are not going to be able to have their way , " he says .
At the Pentagon Thursday , Gates complained that an uncertain funding stream at best creates busy work for defense planners – and at worst negatively affects the troops .
" The high degree of uncertainty on funding for the war is immensely complicating this task and will have many real consequences for this department and for our men and women in uniform , " he said .
Unlike during last year 's budget showdown with Congress over war funding , the Pentagon this time has little wiggle room for moving money around , said Gates .
The Pentagon currently can move only about $ 3.7 billion into accounts for war operations – roughly the equivalent of one week 's worth of war funding .
That 's largely true , says Rep. Joe Sestak ( D ) of Pennsylvania , a former Navy admiral who worked on the Pentagon 's Joint Staff before retiring and running for Congress .
" Money is only so fungible among various accounts , " he says .
" Congress makes it that way . "
Representative Sestak voted in favor of the ultimately unsuccessful proposal to fund war operations at $ 50 billion as long as troops start leaving soon .
But he says he does n't want Congress to micromanage the war via its purse strings and says the better option for Democratic lawmakers is to put such goal - post language in an authorization bill instead of insisting that it be part of an appropriations bill .
The distinction would give Pentagon planners a date to work toward , without directly affecting their ability to spend the money Congress appropriates for war operations .
" It makes Congress a less blunt instrument , " Sestak says .
Only when lawmakers end their rancor over the war can the two parties come to an agreement about how to proceed , he says .
" I do n't think we sit down enough with the other side to work things out . "
This is not the first time the Pentagon has threatened severe consequences for delayed or insufficient war funding .
Earlier this year during budget negotiations for fiscal 2007 , the Defense Department said it would have to curtail critical predeployment training for troops and other procurement programs if Congress did n't provide enough money for the war .
But the situation was different then , because the Pentagon already had what 's called " bridge supplemental " funding that allowed it more flexibility to get through budgetary dry spells .
This year , no such supplemental funding exists – hence the Pentagon 's threat to begin shutting down US bases .
Ultimately , gridlock over war funding may not end until after the '08 election , says think tank analyst Mr. Thompson .

Conservative group : Craig 's bathroom arrest is effectively declaration of ' war on the West ' Nick Juliano
Published : Friday September 7 , 2007
Print This Email This Airport spokesman tells RAW STORY police were trying to ensure ' safe ' restrooms A conservative group has come to Sen.
Larry Craig 's defense , saying his arrest in an airport restroom amid allegations he tried to solicit sex was an example of overzealous police profiling and entrapment .
The American Land Rights Association , a longtime supporter of the Idaho Republican , is calling for a boycott of the Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport , where Craig was arrested in June .
The airport is aware of the call for a boycott , but so far is not worried about a possible loss of business .
" We believe that most people will be appreciative of the fact that we try to keep the entire airport safe , including the restrooms , " Patrick Hogan , a spokesman for the Metropolitan Airports Commission , which operates the airport , told RAW STORY .
In a lengthy e-mail to supporters , ALRA head Chuck Cushman accused police of " ambushing " Craig , and said the airport has " effectively declared war on the West . "
Craig 's behavior was profiled by police and they arrested him " even though he never did anything wrong , " Cushman wrote .
" Frankly , Ive been in that Minnesota airport many times .
Virtually everything Senator Craig did , I have done , " Cushman told ALRA members in an e-mail .
" I have a medical problem that means I must find a usable stall quickly .
Ive looked in stalls .
I always take my roller bag in the stall with me .
Ive actually made noise outside a stall to encourage the person inside to move along as fast as possible . "
Craig was arrested in June after a police officer said Craig peered into his stall " for about two minutes " while " fidgeting " with his hands .
The Senator took a stall next to the officer , moved his foot into the officer 's stall and ran his left hand along the bottom of the right stall divider between the two .
Police said Craig 's actions mimic those employed by men hoping to engage in lewd conduct in the restroom , and he was one of dozens of men arrested in a months - long crackdown on such behavior .
Hogan told RAW STORY that the sting was a " positive action . "
It was initiated in response to complaints about sexual activity in the restrooms from customers and extensive evidence online that men used the bathroom as a staging ground for illicit trysts .
" I think it was important that we take pro-active efforts ... to ensure people know they can be safe when they use the restrooms , " Hogan said Craig pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge hoping to make the incident disappear , but news of the arrest broke last week , and a media maelstrom has engulfed the senator ever since .
Cushman called for a boycott of the airport for at least the next year , and he noted his group has led successful boycotts in the past .
Craig 's views are solidly in line with ALRA , which seeks to limit the government 's attempts to create public lands and considers itself a defender of " property rights . "
Critics say ALRA is an anti-environmental group .
After announcing his intention to resign las week , Craig 's intentions have become unclear .
He says now he is seeking to withdraw his guilty plea in Minneapolis , which aides say may cause him to stay in the Senate .
Republican leaders also have called for an investigation of Craig from the Senate Ethics Committee that he has retained a laywer to fight the ethics investigation if the guilty plea is overturned .

When Taxpayers Ignore Less Visible Taxes " Reminding shoppers of the tax at the time of purchase made for more cautious consumers , suggesting that most of them do not normally take into account the sales tax on such products . "
When analyzing tax policies , economists traditionally have assumed that individuals take maximum advantage of ( that is , optimize fully with respect to ) the incentives created by those policies .
In Salience and Taxation : Theory and Evidence ( NBER Working Paper No. 13330 ) , Raj Chetty , Adam Looney , and Kory Kroft test that assumption by studying whether the salience ( or visibility ) of tax rates affects consumers ' purchase decisions .
The researchers find that salience is quite important in their data , and that salience matters because shoppers are inattentive to taxes .
They develop a new theoretical model to analyze the economic effects of taxation with inattentive individuals .
To begin their investigation , Chetty , Looney , and Kroft partnered with a supermarket chain to conduct a three - week experiment in one of its stores .
For taxable items , like cosmetics and other non-food products , stores customarily do not include the sales tax in the price tags on the shelves .
Instead , the tax appears only on the sales slip when the purchases are rung up at the cash register , making them less salient to the consumer .
In the targeted store , the researchers adjusted the price tags to display prices including the 7.375 percent sales tax .
The result was a decline in sales of those items by 6 to 8 percent .
Reminding shoppers of the tax at the time of purchase made for more cautious consumers , suggesting that most of them do not normally take into account the sales tax on such products .
To complement this experimental evidence , Chetty , Looney , and Kroft ran a second test using observational data over a longer time period and comparing the effect of price changes with tax changes .
Here they focused on alcohol consumption , because alcohol is subject to both the ( salient ) excise tax , which is included in the shelf price , and the less - salient sales tax that appears only at the cash register .
Looking at state - level changes in these two tax rates between 1970 and 2003 , and at data on annual alcohol consumption by state , the researchers found that the drop in consumption attributable to increases in the excise taxes was measurably larger than the reduction caused by the increases in sales taxes .
Thus , sales and excise taxes appear to induce different consumer behavior in both the short and the long run .
The researchers identify two possible explanations for why consumers under react to taxes that are not included in posted prices .
One is that shoppers are ignorant of the sales tax rate or of which items are taxable .
Another is that salience matters : that is , shoppers know what is taxed , yet still focus on the posted price .
To distinguish these explanations , Chetty , Looney , and Kroft surveyed supermarket customers and found that their awareness of the tax rate and of what items were taxable was very high .
The researchers concluded that when shoppers make their purchases , they simply do not bother to compute tax - inclusive prices .
To explain this behavior and understand its implications for tax policy , Chetty , Looney , and Kroft develop a theoretical model of inattentive consumers and tax policy .
Their first observation is that from an individual 's perspective , the cost of not paying attention to taxes is actually quite small .
For example , they calculate that the value of learning about a 10 percent tax on an item that costs $ 1,000 ( and thus choosing to spend less on that item ) is only $ 5 .
Hence , it is not surprising that people who have limited time or attention ignore taxes .
Surprisingly , though , the authors show that these same taxes can be quite important from a social perspective : a 10 percent tax raises a substantial amount of revenue for the government , and can create substantial social efficiency costs by distorting economic decisions .
In the authors ' model , the tax policies differ substantially from the predictions of the traditional theory that assumes that everyone pays attention to all taxes .
A key prediction of the traditional theory is that a tax creates an efficiency cost - that is , a loss of aggregate economic welfare - only to the extent that it reduces demand for the taxed good .
In the authors ' model of inattentive consumers , a tax can have a substantial efficiency cost even when the demand for the taxed good does not change .
This is because a tax that is completely ignored by consumers distorts consumption of other goods .
For example , an individual who does not account for taxes on cars would over - spend on the car and end up with less money left than he would like for food or healthcare , reducing economic welfare .
Another implication of the model is that the incidence or pass - through of the tax -- that is , who ultimately bears the burden of paying the tax once price changes are taken into account -- depends on whether the tax is levied on consumers or firms .
This result challenges the conventional wisdom that it does not matter if the government taxes consumers or firms , which again is based on the presumption that all individuals pay attention to taxes .
The authors give the example of a cell - phone plan whose " sticker price " is $ 39.99 but whose actual price , including taxes and fees levied on the consumer , may be $ 47.00 .
If the same taxes were levied on the firm , it could only pass them through by raising the sticker price , thereby reducing demand .
Therefore , firms would be more likely to bear the burden of the tax if it were levied on them rather than on the consumers .
The finding that individuals optimize inaccurately -- even with respect to relatively simple sales taxes -- suggests that similar issues may arise in the analysis of a broad set of government policies .
The approach proposed by Chetty , Looney , and Kroft could shed light on a wide range of issues that have received attention in recent policy debates , such as consumption taxation ( where taxes may be included in posted prices ) , social security reform ( where the link between taxes paid and benefits received is currently not salient ) , and the value of simplifying the tax code .

The Intel juggernaut continued to roll forward in 2007 , but all eyes were on AMD .
Intel continued to recapture market share from its main competitor .
The world ’s largest semiconductor company aggressively shipped new products , and even managed to slip in one CPU based on the company ’s shiny new 45nm manufacturing process before year ’s end .
The Core 2 Extreme QX9650 is currently the top performing desktop CPU available .
Despite Intel ’s aggressive product push , most industry watchers were focused on AMD .
AMD ’s K10 “ true ” quad - core CPUs were the company ’s last best hope on the processor front , as it was forced to slash prices on a dual core product line that looked anemic next to Intel ’s Core 2 architecture .
These price cuts , coupled with continued delays in shipping the K10 , resulted in massive financial losses .
When AMD ’s server quad - core processors began to ship in late August , rumblings began to surface about anemic performance .
AMD had been unsuccessful in shipping the new server CPU at higher clock frequencies , but even discounting clock rate , performance looked less than stellar .
When the quad - core desktop CPU , Phenom , arrived on the scene , AMD could only muster enough performance and clock rate to compete with Intel ’s lowest - end quad - core offering .
Even that matchup tended to favor Intel .
Then , after finally shipping its long - awaited K10 , serious bugs appeared in the way the TLB ( translation lookaside buffer ) works .
While AMD has offered a workaround , the fix degrades the performance , something the company ca n’t afford .
The bug is more serious on server side CPUs , however .
While it does exist in the desktop Phenom CPUs , it ’s less likely to appear , so AMD has asked motherboard makers to build the ability to enable or disable the feature in their BIOS settings .
For AMD , 2007 has been a disastrous year .
Substantial financial losses , sub - par quad core CPU products and missteps in the company ’s graphics division has shaken both customer and investor confidence .
It remains to be seen whether or not AMD can regain its stride in 2008 .
One thing is for sure : 2008 will be a make or break year for AMD .

American Home Mortgage Investment Corp. , citing " unprecedented " disruptions in the credit markets , did not make a quarterly dividend payment on its common stock as scheduled on July 27 as the company engages in efforts to preserve liquidity amid severe market stress .
In a statement released very late July 27 , American Home said that by withholding the dividend payment it hopes to gain " a better understanding of the impact that current market conditions in the mortgage industry and the broader credit market will have on the company 's balance sheet and overall liquidity . "
It had declared a dividend of 70 cents per share on June 15 to common shareholders of record as of July 9 .
The company also anticipates delaying its planned July 31 payment of dividends on its series A and B cumulative redeemable preferred stock .
The credit - market disruptions , American Home said , led to " major write - downs " of its portfolios of loans and securities , and the company is facing what it characterized as " significant margin calls " on its credit facilities .
News broke on July 27 in Long Island , N.Y. 's Newsday that the company was reportedly in the process of laying off more than a thousand employees .
A company spokeswoman confirmed to the newspaper that it had recently eliminated 228 positions — for a total of 428 positions through the month of July — as a result of what she described as " right - sizing our departments in response to market conditions and to keep our departments efficient during challenging times for our industry . "
American
Home 's shares had plunged by more than 20 % on July 19 amid rumors that one of its warehouse facilities had been pulled by a major investment bank .
The decline was such that the NYSE asked the company to issue a statement to indicate whether there were any corporate developments to explain the unusual market activity .
Initially , the company did not respond publicly , but the same spokeswoman told several news organizations the following day that no warehouse lines had been pulled .
The company issued earnings guidance on June 28 in which it withdrew earnings guidance for 2007 and predicted that its second - quarter results would include " substantial " charges for credit - related expenses .
But American
Home reaffirmed its common stock dividend at that time , citing " a stabilization of the secondary mortgage market . "
The company said on June 28 that its loan pools offered for sale " are now attracting multiple bidders and are being traded at supportive prices . "
It did , however , caution that its dividend policy is subject to change without notice and that its board may either reduce or eliminate the dividends if it believes prospects warrant such a change .
In mid-July and continuing through the latter part of the month , secondary market conditions were widely viewed as having deteriorated substantially as a result of a variety of factors .
Countrywide Financial Corp. CEO
Angelo Mozilo said during a July 24 earnings conference call that " volatility in the secondary market has increased significantly early in the third quarter , and liquidity for mortgage securities has been reduced as a result . "
But while markets sold off during the week of July 23 in response to Countrywide 's earnings report and commentary , American Home 's July 27 close at $ 10.47 per share was only 29 cents below its day - end level on July 19 .
Forget what you learned about markets in your introductory economics class .
In a new book titled , The Tyranny of the Market : Why You Ca n’t Always Get What You Want , Wharton professor of business and public policy Joel Waldfogel challenges the conventional thinking that markets will provide adequately if left to their own devices .
In the prevailing view , markets allow everyone to get what they want , regardless of what others want — recalling Blockbuster Video ’s “ Go Home Happy ” slogan — while allocation through government imposes what John Stuart Mill called a “ tyranny of the majority ” — that you get what you want only if the majority wants it .
This stark distinction between markets and government , advanced by Milton Friedman in his book Capitalism and Freedom , has been the rationale behind letting markets decide a wide variety of questions for decades .
But according to Waldfogel , the tyranny of the majority is also at work in many markets , benefiting some , harming others , and not always ending up promoting efficiency .
The tyranny of the majority — Waldfogel calls it “ the tyranny of the market ” — arises whenever two conditions hold .
First , production entails substantial fixed costs ; and second , preferences differ across groups of consumers .
High fixed costs limit the number of products that markets can profitably offer , so that only large groups get appealing products .
And when preferences differ across groups , then those not targeted — “ preference minorities , ” in Waldfogel ’s words — are unable to go home happy .
The all - virtuous view of free markets is an influential one in contemporary policy making , often paired with a cynical view of government involvement .
Waldfogel cites President George W. Bush ’s words on the occasion of Friedman ’s 90th birthday : “ Milton Friedman has shown us that when government attempts to substitute its own judgments for the judgments of free people , the results are usually disastrous .
In contrast to the free market ’s invisible hand , which improves the lives of people , ” Bush continued , “ the government ’s invisible foot tramples on people ’s hopes and destroys their dreams . ”
Waldfogel offers a series of detailed empirical and case studies to counter that view .
“ My goal in this work is not so much to argue that Friedman is wrong , ” he writes , but to “ demonstrate that Friedman ’s dichotomy between markets and collective choice is not right .
In many markets , what I get depends on how many others also want it .
Market allocation shares many of the features of allocation through collective choice . ”
Waldfogel presents evidence suggesting “ a more nuanced view on the ‘ wonders of markets ’ and the ‘ evil of government . '”
His book makes the case that while markets do a good job of providing products that a majority of people demand , they can fall short in meeting the needs of consumers with less prevalent preferences .
Potentially left by the wayside are African Americans , Hispanics , people with unusual medical conditions and residents of remote areas , to name a few groups .
The Misuse of Economics
The Tyranny of the Market is based on academic papers that Waldfogel wrote over the past decade .
He says he has repeatedly made the argument to his fellow economists that markets share some messy features of politics and are far from perfect .
Now he aims to bring the same ideas “ to people outside the narrow world of academic economics , ” a goal that meshes with his role over the past 18 months as the Dismal Science columnist at Slate .
According to Waldfogel , his arguments , though “ not revolutionary , ” buck the popular wisdom that government involvement in markets is automatically bad .
“ Economics has allowed itself to be used as a bludgeon in favor of free markets and against a government role , but I do n’t think that ’s what economics has to say , ” he suggests .
“ Let ’s look at how markets actually work and then make our decisions . ”
In contrast to the Blockbuster Video conception of markets in which everyone goes home happy , Waldfogel ’s research shows many situations in which larger groups get more satisfaction , and smaller groups less , from markets .
He first noticed this phenomenon about a decade ago when he was looking at radio - listening data broken down by racial groups .
Blacks and whites have sharply different preferences in radio programming .
The formats that attract most black listeners get almost no white listeners .
A higher share of blacks listens to the radio in U.S. cities with larger black populations .
This illustrates that having more people who share your tastes raises the number of products appealing to you , and your group gets more satisfaction from what ’s available .
But having more whites in the market does not raise the share of blacks listening to the radio , and having more blacks does not increase the share of whites listening .
So while more demand generally helps bring forth more variety and more resulting satisfaction , your satisfaction really only increases when there are more people who share your preferences .
This is a far cry , Waldfogel says , from the hypothetical situation where you can get what you want simply because you want it .
Instead , you get what you want if enough other people also want it .
Daily newspapers offer an even starker example .
While your typical U.S. city has multiple radio stations , it has only one major newspaper .
Newspaper preferences differ across groups , so the paper can be pitched to appeal to one group or another .
As with radio , in cities with more whites , whites are more likely to read the paper , while blacks are more likely to read the paper in cities with more blacks .
What ’s striking , Waldfogel says , is that blacks are less likely to subscribe in cities with larger white populations where the paper is pitched more toward white readers ’ tastes .
Not only do you not get what you want simply because you want it , but you get something even less like what you want because others want something else .
This is the tyranny of the majority translated almost literally into the market .
Having more people who share your preferences helps you by making the product suit your tastes , and having more who do not actually hurts you by making the product less appealing to you .
Because these problems arise when fixed costs are large in relation to market size , they can be alleviated by increased market size — for example through trade across geographic areas — or through new technologies or managerial approaches that allow cheaper customization of products .
A Preference for Action Movies
The book also explores the liberating effects of trade and the Internet , bringing desirable options to people who lack appealing local options .
While trade goes some distance toward solving this group ’s problems , it is not a complete solution .
“ Instead , with products that remain high in fixed costs even relative to the world market , exporting can shift products away from the preferences of the old domestic consumers , ” he says , and toward the preferences of the new market .
Hollywood , for instance , has begun catering to customers in new - found movie markets , in some cases at the expense of the preferences of moviegoers in this country .
“ Hollywood has figured out that Japan and some parts of Europe are markets worth worrying about .
And it ’s been observed lately that Hollywood has skewed products toward things that will export well , like action movies .
If you like what Hollywood used to make — dramatic movies and movies with dialogue — you ’ll be less happy . ”
Waldfogel says there are some business - to - the - rescue stories , where technology and other advances are addressing the downsides to the market .
On - line booksellers and movie purveyors can offer more titles for a wider variety of tastes than your neighborhood book or video store .
And pharmaceutical companies , traditionally focused on finding the next blockbuster drug , are envisioning a day when medicines can be specifically “ designed ” for individuals or smaller groups of people based on their genetic profiles .
In restaurants , there is a trend for companies to locate several of their brands under one roof , allowing a family to eat items from Taco Bell and Pizza Hut at the same time .
All this criticism of markets raises the question of whether allocation through government is better or even different .
“ It ’s tough to find an apples - to - apples comparison of market and government allocation , ” Waldfogel says , “ but one interesting comparison is between municipal public libraries and bookstores . ”
Markets make bookstores available in rich and populous areas , while governments make libraries available in both populous and less populous areas , and local library availability is about equally sensitive to white and black populations .
“ It ’s clear that a decision to ‘ let the market decide ’ is good for some and not for others , ” he suggests .
According to Waldfogel , there are no pat answers or simplistic formulas to determine the correct balance between free markets and government intervention .
“ The standard economist view of a subsidy is that it ’s venal , and there ’s often some truth to that , ” he says , adding , however , that the benevolent view of markets is over - stated , too .
“ While it is true that in a perfectly competitive market , everything that should be done will be done and nothing that should not be done will be done , this expectation does not carry over to realistic , high fixed - cost examples .
For people inclined to favor markets because of their efficiency properties , many real - world industries lack an efficiency rationale for a hands - off — or ‘ laissez - faire ’ — approach . ”
Society , Waldfogel says , “ needs to discuss the shortcomings of market allocation honestly — and with evidence — when choosing whether to let the market decide . ”

But just because I come from a different food by - product background — and a big city like Manhattan , Kansas — that does not mean I cannot make this particular company run smooth ...ly .
A monologue about a monologue in the full - length play :
ISOBEL : This flower .
This imperfect , little crap highway flower .
Probably part weed , cast out of the daisy family many generations ago .
Its tiny , slim stalk bent by the weight of a bottle cap , making it lean like it's in a yoga stretch .
This was not some impossibly beautiful flower arrogantly reeking perfection .
This was just a simple , beautiful misfit — craning its neck in a sea of trash .
Out among gravel , weeds , fry boxes , cigarette butts , plastic bags , shredded tires .
Not even able to stand tall , but standing nonetheless .
The most hostile environment imaginable , and there she was .
Surviving .
Offering her little splash of color and organic beauty to a sickly world of sun-stained dirt and patches of gray .
Ever wonder if your deceased grandmother is hovering around you watching your every move ?
Do the deceased respect the privacy of the living ?
Are they with you in the bathroom and in the bedroom ?
What exactly do they see , and what do they think of what you ’re doing ?
Yes , deceased people can see what you ’re doing .
The question is are they looking and do they really care ?
Here ’s how it works .
When you die you make your way merrily to the afterlife .
After a period of acclimation you ’re faced with some choices .
Move on completely , severing your emotional connection to the people you left behind on Earth , or hover around your loved ones in an attempt to guide them , help them , or just see your grandkids ( or mess with the family dog 😉 ) .
When you cross over completely you can still tune in to what ’s going on here on Earth but it ’s not your main priority .
When you hover , though , you ’re tuned in quite a bit and you see just about everything .
Is this fair to the living to have an invisible shadow watching their every move ?
Are n’t there any privacy laws in the ether ?
The thing is that the deceased do n’t really care what you do in the privacy of your own bedroom .
They were human once too .
They know about sex , they know you have it , alone or with someone else .
It ’s really not a big deal to them .
Any guilt or shame you ’re feeling is something you should be dealing with regardless of whether someone is watching you .
Do n’t spare too much time wondering if someone is watching you , it can ruin the mood .
😉
Likewise there ’s no need to show off to your audience , “ Hey Grandma , look what I can do with this ! ” 🙂
Just go on about your life , doing good , and treating your body with respect .
This is important outside of the bedroom as well .
Would you act differently if you knew your deceased parents were watching how you treated other people ?
Do n’t forget the flip side of all of this .
You ’re not ever really alone .
Even if your loved ones have fully crossed over you still have guides and angels watching over you .
Yep , they can see what you ’re doing too .
It ’s their job to know !
They do n’t judge us though so do n’t fret .
When you ’re feeling sad , lonely , and depressed , realize they are right there with you , arms around your shoulders while you ’re crying .
Try to feel them next time you feel down .
When I read for people who are very depressed or even suicidal , that ’s when I see the angels around them .
Whenever I see angels with their energy around someone I know that person is going through an emotional crisis .
It freaked me out a little until I figured out the pattern .
The angels really are there when you need them .
You never have to navigate the ups and downs of life alone .
You can lean on them when you ’re in crisis .
In summary , yes , the dead could watch you masturbate if they really wanted to .
I doubt most do so you ’re probably safe .
Probably … 😉
On November 12th , Lawrence Krauss and James Dent wrote a paper that caused quite a kerfuffle in the media :
Most of the paper is quite technical , but on November 22 , the New Scientist took a couple of sentences and blew them out of proportion in a story with a far - out title :
Has observing the universe hastened its end ?
On November 24 , Krauss and Dent changed those sentences to something a bit more reasonable .
The bulk of the paper remains unchanged … but nobody ever talked about that part .
It ’s a cute example of how sensationalism amplifies the least reliable aspects of science , while ignoring the solid stuff .
Details follow …
For the most part , Krauss and Dent ’s paper is an unremarkable analysis of what might happen if the universe were in a ‘ false vacuum state ’ — that is , a state with a bit more energy density than it would have in its ‘ true ground state ’ .
Astronomers believe the Universe contains about a billionth of a joule of ‘ dark energy ’ per cubic meter .
Could we be in a ‘ false vacuum state ’ ?
If so , the false vacuum could decay into true vacuum !
The universe could be unstable !
But , it could last a long time .
A similar but much simpler problem is the decay of a radioactive atom .
An atom of uranium - 238 has a bit more energy before it decays than afterwards .
Why does n’t it decay right away ?
Because the nucleus must tunnel through a classically forbidden ‘ barrier ’ before it can shoot out an alpha particle and decay .
Metaphorically , we ’re talking about something like this :
The nucleus tunnels from 1 to 3 in a random sort of way , with a half - life of about 4.5 billion years .
So , if you occasionally look at an atom of this isotope , the chance of it still being U - 238 decreases exponentially … but very slowly .
In theory , our universe could be in a similar situation .
If it ‘ decayed ’ to a state of lower energy density , that could be really bad .
What if the half - life were , say , 15 billion years ?
Then it might go poof !
any day now .
Or in just a few billion years !
This is way , way , way down on my list of worries .
But , it ’s fun subject for theoretical physics papers .
There are lots of subtleties my simplified description overlooks .
For one thing , the ‘ decay ’ probably would n’t happen everywhere at once — we ’re talking quantum field theory here , not quantum mechanics .
For another , we ’re talking about quantum field theory on curved spacetime .
Krauss and Dent focus on another subtlety .
I said that radioactive decay proceeds exponentially .
But , this is only approximately true !
There are some theorems that say there must be deviations from this exponential law .
Under some reasonable assumptions , people think the approximate exponential decay switches over to an approximate power - law decay at late times .
This is a little - known and somewhat controversial fact , mainly because the deviations are very small in practice .
As far as I know , they ’ve never been seen !
Krauss and Dent give a nice review of these slight deviations and then apply the idea to cosmology — that ’s what ‘ The late time behavior of false vacuum decay ’ means .
They might be right , they might be wrong .
Either way , it ’s not the sort of thing you ’d normally find huge crowds of people arguing about on the internet .
You need to understand the Paley–Wiener theorem to really follow this stuff , for god ’s sake !
But the last sentence of their abstract was this :
Several interesting open questions are raised , including whether observing the cosmological configuration of our universe may ultimately alter its mean lifetime .
Could just looking at the Universe speed or slow the decay of a false vacuum state ?
That ’d sound completely crazy if you ’d never heard of the quantum Zeno effect , where repeatedly observing a quantum system can keep it from changing its state .
If you understand this effect , I think you ’ll conclude that while it ’s not completely crazy , it ’s just wrong to worry about human observations of the cosmos affecting the decay of a false vacuum state .
For one thing , the relevant concept of “ observation ” in the quantum Zeno effect is not at all anthropomorphic .
The universe was “ observing ” itself long before we ever showed up .
Krauss and Dent do n’t say much about this , except in the last two sentences of the paper :
If observations of quantum mechanical systems reset their clocks , which has been observed for laboratory systems , then by measuring the existence dark energy [ sic ] in our own universe have we reset the quantum mechanical configuration of the universe so that late time will never be relevant ?
Put another way , could internal observations of the state of a metastable universe affect its longevity ?
But then the folks at New Scientist got ahold of this and ran with it .
Who cares that nobody knows if we ’re in a false vacuum state .
And forget the quantum Zeno effect !
What if observing the universe made the false vacuum decay faster ?
Then we could blame cosmologists for hastening the end of the Universe !
Now that ’s a story !
So , the New Scientist published this :
Has observing the universe hastened its end ?
22 November 2007
Marcus Chown
Have we hastened the demise of the universe by looking at it ?
That ’s the startling question posed by a pair of physicists , who suggest that we may have accidentally nudged the universe closer to its death by observing dark energy , which is thought to be speeding up cosmic expansion .
Lawrence Krauss of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , Ohio , and colleague James Dent suggest that by making this observation in 1998 we may have caused the universe to revert to a state similar to early in its history , when it was more likely to end .
“ Incredible as it seems , our detection of the dark energy may have reduced the life - expectancy of the universe , ” says Krauss . [… ]
Clearly Krauss shares a lot of the blame if he actually said that sentence .
Then folks at newspapers like the Telegraph read the New Scientist article and processed it into something even more sensational .
Instead of a question , the headline is now a bald statement of ‘ fact ’ :
Mankind ‘ shortening the universe ’s life ’
By Roger Highfield , Science Editor Forget about the threat that mankind poses to the Earth : our very ability to study the heavens may have shortened the inferred lifetime of the cosmos .
[ read on - the version you ’ll see has been edited to make it less nutty than the original ]
Then the blogosphere kicked into action , with Slashdot advertising the story and Peter Woit pouring some much - needed cold water on it .
Krauss got embarrassed , and on November 24 he wrote on Woit ’s blog :
Hi .
I wanted to chime in with an apology of sorts regarding the confusion in the press regarding our work .
Our paper was in fact about late - decaying false vacuum decay and its possible cosmological implications .
Needless to say , the explosion of press interest , prompted by the final two sentences of the paper , misrepresented the work , which was not intended to imply causality , but rather to ask the question of whether by cosmological measurements we constrain the nature of the quantum state in which we find ourselves , inferring perhaps that we are not in the late - decaying tail .
However , I do take responsibility in part for the flood , as I was undoubtedly glib in talking to the new scientist reporter who read the paper on the arxiv .
I have learned that one must be extra careful in order not to cause such misrepresentations in the press , and I should know better .
In any case , the last two sentences of the paper have been revised so that it should be clear to the press that causality will not be implied .
mea culpa
He changed the last sentence in the paper ’s abstract from this :
Several interesting open questions are raised , including whether observing the cosmological configuration of our universe may ultimately alter its mean lifetime .
to this :
Several interesting open questions are raised , including whether observing the cosmological configuration of a metastable universe can constrain its inferred lifetime .
Note how ‘ alter ’ becomes ‘ constrain ’ .
And , he changed the last two sentences in their paper to this :
Have we ensured , by measuring the existence dark energy [ sic ] in our own universe , that the quantum mechanical configuration of the universe is such that late time decay is not relevant ?
Put another way , what can internal observations of the state of a metastable universe say about its longevity ?
This is n’t terribly clear .
But the tempest in the teacup has blown over — apparently with no one the wiser about the actual contents of the paper , or the fascinating issue of deviations from exponential decay .
To begin remedying the last point , here ’s an old post of mine on sci.physics .
research , written on May 23,1992 :
Carlo Graziani writes : Exponential decay is in fact a theoretical necessity .
It is a generic quantum mechanical feature of problems in which you have a discrete state ( e.g. an excited atomic or nuclear state ) coupled to a continuum of states ( e.g. the atomic or nuclear system in the ground state and an emitted photon flitting around somewhere ) .
There is nothing ad hoc about it .
The original paper is Weisskopf & Wigner , 1930 , Z. Physik , 63 , 54 .
If you ca n’t get a translation from German , ( or do n’t speak German ) , see Gasiorowicz , “ Quantum Physics ” 1974 ( Wiley ) , pp 473-480 , or Cohen - Tannoudji , Diu , & Laloe , “ Quantum Mechanics ” 1977 ( Wiley ) , vol 2 , pp. 1343–1355 .
The essence of the result is the effective modification of the energy of the excited state by a small complex perturbation , E ↦ E + ( d E − i R / 2 ) E \mapsto E + ( d E - i R/2 ) where d E d E is the small radiative energy correction ( Lamb shift ) and R R is the decay rate .
The time dependent phase factor is thus also modified : exp ( − i E t ) ↦ exp [ − i ( E + d E ) t ] exp [ − R t / 2 ] . exp ( - i E t ) \ mapsto exp [ - i( E+d E ) t] exp [ - R t/2 ] .
This is the source of the decay ; probabilities , which go as the square of the amplitudes , will exhibit a time dependence exp [ − R t ] exp [ - R t ] .
This is indeed the conventional wisdom .
Let me begin by saying : 1 ) I agree that the exponential decay law is backed up by theory in this sort of situation and is far from an ad hoc “ curve fitting ” sort of thing .
2 ) The exponential law is apparently an excellent approximation , and as far as I know no deviations from it have ever been observed .
Here I am not talking about the ( necessary ) deviations due to finite sample size .
I am talking about deviations present in the limit as the sample size approaches infinity .
3 ) If you ever wanted someone to actually calculate a decay rate for you , I ’m sure Graziani would do a whole lot better job than I would .
What follows has nothing to do with the important job of getting an answer that ’s good enough for all practical purposes .
It is a matter of principle ( my specialty ) .
There ’s no real conflict .
Okay .
So , Graziani has offered the conventional wisdom , what everyone knows about radioactive decay , that it is a “ theoretical necessity ” .
It ’s precisely because this is so well - entrenched that I thought I should point out that one can easily prove that quantum - mechanical decay processes cannot be EXACTLY exponential .
There are approximations in all of the arguments Graziani cites .
Let me just repeat the proof that decay processes are n’t exactly exponential .
It uses one mild assumption , but if the going gets rough I imagine someone will raise questions about this assumption .
It ’d be nice to get a proof with even weaker assumptions ; I vaguely recall that one could use the fact that the Hamiltonian is bounded below to do so .
This is just the proof that Robert Israel gave a while ago ( an improved version of mine ) .
Let ψ \psi be the wavefunction of a “ new - born radioactive nucleus ” , together with whatever fields that are involved in the decay .
Let P be the projection onto the space of states in which the nucleus has NOT decayed .
Let H H be the Hamiltonian , a self - adjoint operator .
The probability that at time t the system will be observed to have NOT decayed is | | P exp ( − i t H ) ψ | | 2 | |P exp ( - i t H ) \psi||
^2
The claim is that this function cannot be of the form exp ( − k t ) exp ( - k t ) for all t > 0 t\gt 0 , where k k is some positive constant .
Just differentiate this function with respect to t t and set t = 0 t = 0 .
First , rewrite the function as ⟨ exp ( − i t H ) ψ , P exp ( − i t H ) ψ ⟩ , \langle exp ( - i t H ) \psi , P exp ( - i t H ) \psi \rangle , and then differentiate to get ⟨ − i H exp ( − i t H ) ψ , P exp ( − i t H ) ψ ⟩ + ⟨ exp ( − i t H ) ψ , − i P H exp ( − i t H ) ψ ⟩ \langle - i H exp ( - i t H ) \psi , P exp ( - i t H ) \psi \rangle + \ langle exp ( - i t H ) \psi , - i P H exp ( - i t H ) \psi \rangle and set t = 0 t = 0 to get ⟨ − i H ψ , ψ ⟩ + ⟨ ψ , − i H ψ ⟩ = 0 \langle -i H \psi , \psi \rangle + \langle \psi , -i H \psi \rangle = 0
Here we are using P ψ = ψ P \psi = \psi .
Since we get zero , the function could not have been equal to exp ( − k t ) exp ( - k t ) for k k nonzero .
That should satisfy any physicist .
A mathematician will worry about why we can differentiate the function .
This is a simple issue if you know about unbounded self - adjoint operators .
( Try Reed and Simon ’s Methods of Modern Mathematical Physics vol .
I : Functional Analysis , and vol .
II : Fourier Analysis and Self - Adjointness . )
For the function to be differentiable it suffices that ψ \psi is in the domain of H H .
For physicists , this condition means that ‖
H ψ ‖ < ∞ \ |H \psi\| \lt \infty .
[ Let me put in a digression only to be read by the most nitpicky of nitpickers , e.g. myself .
An excited state ψ \psi , while presumably an eigenvector for some “ free ” Hamiltonian which neglects the interactions causing the decay , is not an eigenvector for the true Hamiltonian H H , which of course is why it does n’t just sit there .
One might worry , then , that the eigenvector ψ \psi of the “ free ” Hamiltonian is not in the domain of the true Hamiltonian H H .
This is a standard issue in perturbation theory and the answer depends on how singular the perturbation is .
Certainly for perturbations that can be treated by Kato - Rellich perturbation theory any eigenvector of the free Hamiltonian is in the domain of the true Hamiltonian H H , cf. Thm X.13 vol .
II R&S .
But I claim that this issue is a red herring , the real point being that any state we can actually prepare has ‖
H ψ ‖ < ∞ \ |H \psi \| \lt \infty .
Instead of arguing about this , I would hope that any mathematical physicists would just come up with a theorem with weaker hypotheses . ]
As Israel pointed out , this argument shows what ’s going on : when you are SURE the nucleus has not decayed yet ( i.e. , it ’s “ new - born ” ) , the decay rate must be zero ; the decay rate then can “ ramp up ” very rapidly to the value obtained by the usual approximate calculations .
Physicists occasionally mistrust mathematicians on matters such as these .
Arcane considerations about the domains of unbounded self - adjoint operators probably only serve to enhance this mistrust , which is ironic , of course , since the mathematicians are simply trying to avoid sloppiness .
In any event , just to show that this is n’t something only mathematicians believe in , let me cite the paper : Grotz and Klapdor , Time scale of short time deviations from exponential decay , Phys. Rev. C 30 ( 1984 ) , 2098 –2100 .
“ In this Brief Report we discuss critically whether such quantum mechanically rigorously demanded deviations from the usual decay formulas may lead to observable effects and give estimates using the Heisenberg uncertainty relation .
It is easily seen that the exponential decay law following from a statistical ansatz is only an approximation in a quantum mechanical description .
[ Gives essentially the above argument . ]
So for very small times , the decay rate is not constant as characteristic for an exponential decay law , but varies proportional to t. […. ]
Equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) tell us that for sufficiently short times , the decay rate is whatever [ arbitrarily - these guys are German ] small .
However , to make any quantitative estimate is extremely difficult .
Peres uses the threshold effect to get a quantitative estimate for the onset of the exponential decay [ … ]
Applying this estimate to double beta decay yields approximately 10 − 21 10 ^{ - 21} sec , which is much too small to give any measurable effect .
[ They then go on to argue with Peres . ] ”
This is all I want to say about this , unless someone has some nice theorems about the allowed behavior of the function ‖
P exp ( − i t H ) ψ ‖ 2 \ |P exp ( - i t H ) \psi\| ^2 when H H is bounded below and ψ \psi is not necessarily in the domain of H H .
( This would probably involve extending t t to a complex half - plane . )
I sound like quite a showoff in that post — am I still that bad , 15 years older ?
I hope not .
I probably am .
My post was far from definitive .
The argument I gave uses the assumption P ψ = ψ P \psi = \psi — it assumes that at the start of the experiment , we ’re sure the atom has not decayed .
Do we need that ?
Also , it treats the situation as a closed system .
What if we treat it as an open system ?
Also , Grotz and Klapdor talk about short - time deviations from exponential decay .
What about long - time deviations ?
How does the Paley–Wiener theorem get into the act ?
And : has anyone ever seen deviations from exponential decay for radioactive nuclei or similar systems ?
There are lots of interesting questions .
You can learn a lot about some of them — though not , alas , the last — from the paper by Krauss and Dent .
But you ’d never know that from the media kerfuffle .
BBC News | March 24 , 2008
Vehicles driving on roads in planned eco - towns will have to stick to 15 mph speed limits , it has emerged .
The restriction is among proposals designed to minimise the environmental impact of the settlements .
Government sources say the new town centres are to be car - free , and the 15 mph limit will be enforced on “ key roads ” leading into them .
Environmental protesters have criticised the scheme for focusing too narrowly on carbon emissions .
‘ Revolutionary living ’
More than 50 bids to create the zero- carbon developments have been entered by companies .
Housing minister Caroline Flint will set out standards expected of them later this week and the announcement of the shortlist of 10 new towns is expected in the coming weeks .
Ms Flint said : “ These developments will be exemplars for the rest of the world , not just the rest of the country .
It ’s critical that we get it right – and I make no apology for setting the bar as high as possible .
“ We have a unique opportunity to deliver a programme which will genuinely revolutionise the way people live . ”
Up to five eco -towns are expected to be built by 2016 , and up to 10 by 2020 .
They will have populations of around 5,000 to 20,000 and be linked to larger towns and cities .

I BM has released a beta version of its new Office suite named Symphony and has made it available as a free download .
It contains four software namely " Lotus Symphony Documents " , " Lotus Symphony Presentations " , " Lotus Symphony Spreadsheets " and an integrated web browser .
But what should be quite interesting is that IBM has released a Linux version of this office suite too though it works only on Red Hat Enterprise Linux ver 5 and Suse Linux ver 10 for the time being .
I downloaded the Linux version of IBM's Symphony Office suite and I was able to install it without any problem .
One of the striking feature of Symphony is that you can Open the document , spreadsheet and presentation files all within the main interface and the files will be opened in tabs which is quite a convenience .
Fig : Welcome page when Symphony starts
Fig : Menu to open new documents
The interface is well designed and built using Eclipse IDE .
One of the highlights of Lotus Symphony is that it is based on the Open Document Format ( ODF ) standard - which means you 're not locked into proprietary file formats , software licensing agreements and upgrades .
Symphony can open Microsoft Office documents be they MSWord , Excel or Powerpoint files without any problem .
Fig : Document interface of Symphony
But when it is compared to Microsoft Office or even OpenOffice.org , I feel Symphony has a bit more catching up to do .
For example , in OpenOffice.org , when you insert an image , you can drag and place it in any location in the document , which I find is a very nice feature .
But I was not able to do this in Symphony document .
And you cannot open or save encrypted Doc or ODF files nor can you edit or save encrypted macro libraries .
More over since Symphony is a free offering from IBM , you can avail of help only from the support forums and not directly from IBM .
This two - part article looks at the many ways to freeze food ( including specifics for common food types ) , as well as a few suggestions for getting the most out of your freezer itself .
It can be a wonderful piece of equipment .
Chances are that when you buy a new refrigerator , the freezer just comes along for the ride .
It ’s a part of the kitchen that most people do n’t spend much time thinking about .
It can be , however , an extremely efficient tool for putting aside excess food for later use .
If you enjoy saving time when preparing your evening meal ; being able to add fruit to your breakfast all through the year ; or just love the idea of having home - made sorbet on hand whenever you like – read on .
The basics of freezing
No matter what type of food you ’re freezing , there are several basic guidelines that will make your life easier , and help you get the best results .
These are :
Freezing can retain quality , but not increase it .
Begin with good quality food .
Try to prevent air coming in contact with the food , and moisture from escaping .
Both of these will dry things out , and can ‘ burn ‘ them in many cases .
Freeze foods as quickly as possible .
This will minimise the size of ice crystals that will form , limiting the damage to the food when thawed .
Foods should be slightly undercooked when frozen if they are to be reheated when thawed .
Only put as much food in the freezer as will freeze within the next 24 hours or so ( usually about 2 - 3 lb per cubic foot ) .
Rather than freezing spices , add them just prior to serving a meal .
They can change colour and flavour when frozen .
Label things so you know when they were frozen , and when to take them out .
How to freeze vegetables
Most vegetables freeze quite well ( they ’ll happily stay frozen for several months ) .
Where possible , use the youngest and most tender of those available .
Here ’s what ’s involved :
Preparation
Clean the vegetables to remove as much dirt as possible .
Trim them , removing any unwanted stalks and leaves .
Cut them into bite - size portions .
Blanching
Many vegetables contain a number of enzymes which cause them to lose their colour and flavour when frozen .
Blanching ( putting the vegetables briefly in boiling water ) stops these enzymes from acting .
To blanch the vegetables , set up a pan of boiling water beside a bowl of ice water .
Using a slotted spoon , put a small handful of vegetables into the boiling water for a couple of minutes * , then transfer it to the ice water ( to stop it cooking ) .
Pat it dry , and put it aside .
Repeat with the rest .
* times vary , so here are the recommended blanching times for a number of common vegetables :
Vegetable Blanching time Asparagus Wash , sort by size .
Snap off tough ends .
Blanch for 2 - 3 min. Beans Wash .
Trim ends .
Cut if desired .
Blanch for 2 - 3 min. Beetroot Wash .
Remove tops , leaving about an inch .
Cook until tender ( 25 –30 min for small beets ; 45 - 50 for large ones ) .
Cool promptly , peel , trim tap root and stem .
Cut into slices or cubes .
Pack into freezer containers .
Broccoli Wash .
Trim leaves .
Cut into pieces .
Blanch for 3 min .
Brussels sprouts Wash .
Remove outer leaves .
Blanch for 4 - 5 min. Cabbage Wash .
Discard course outer leaves .
If shredded , blanch for about 1.5 min .
For wedges , blanch for 3 - 4 min.
Carrots
Wash , peel and trim .
Cut if desired .
Blanch for 2 min ( small carrots ) – 5 min ( large ones ) .
Cauliflower Discard leaves and stem , wash .
Break into
flowerets or leave small heads whole .
Add 1 tbsp vinegar to water , and blanch for 6 min .
Corn on the cob Remove husks and silks .
Trim ends .
Blanch medium - sized ears for 8 min .
Wrap ears individually in plastic wrap or freezer bags .
Eggplant Wash , peel , slice 1/3 inch thick .
Blanch for 4 min in water containing a tablespoon of citric acid or lemon juice .
Herbs Wash .
Snip or leave on stalks .
For basil only , blanch for a minute .
For other herbs ,
blanching is not necessary .
Freeze in a single layer on trays or baking sheets .
Mushrooms
Wipe with damp paper towel .
Trim .
May be frozen without blanching .
Once all the vegetables have been blanched and cooled , pack them straight into containers or bags .
Alternatively , lay them out on baking sheets / trays and freeze them like this ( put them into containers or bags later – they ’ll fit better , and can be easily broken up ) .
How long will they last ?
Frozen vegetables will generally last for 3 - 6 months .
Cooking with frozen vegetables
Frozen vegetables can generally be cooked when still frozen ( no defrosting required ) , although some leafy greens are easier to separate when thawed a little .
To boil them , use about 1 / 2 cup of water for every 2 cups of vegetables ( the rest is already in the ice ) .
Steaming and microwaving are also good options .
How to freeze fruit
When it comes to freezing fruit , different types are treated in different ways .
Before we get into specifics , here are a few general guidelines :
Berries do well when frozen straight after harvesting .
Apples , plums and peaches may need to wait a few days before hitting the freezer .
Small whole fruits ( such as cherries ) can be frozen on trays for later use in salads , drinks and garnishes .
Most fruits can be happily frozen for 8 - 12 months .
Citrus fruits and juices should only be kept 4 - 6 months .
The general process for freezing fruit is to clean , trim and slice it ; place it on trays or hard containers , and cover it with a mild syrup to prevent it from going brown .
The specific steps for a number of common fruits are listed below , but first : the anti-browning syrup .
Preventing the fruit from going brown
If the fruit is likely to darken when frozen ( see table below ) , simply cover the pieces with ascorbic acid or citrus juice ( in the case of firm fruits , they can even be steamed ) .
To do this :
Ascorbic acid : this can usually be purchased from pharmacies or supermarkets .
If you ’re unable to find any , just crush up a couple of Vitamin C tablets and add a little water .
Citrus juice : although this is n’t quite as effective as the ascorbic acid , it definitely helps .
Add a few tablespoons of juice to a quart of cold water , and soak the fruit pieces in it for a minute or two .
Afterwards , pat them dry , put them in the containers and cover them with sugar , syrup , water or fruit juice .
Packing
Prior to freezing , the fruit is ‘ packed ‘ or placed into containers and covered with acid , syrup , water , fruit juice or sugar .
This prevents the fruit from losing quality whilst frozen – when thawed it should be identical to a freshly picked piece .
Common methods of packing include :
Syrup pack : a 30 % syrup ( a third sugar , the rest water ) is recommended for most fruits ( very sour fruits may need a little more sugar ) .
When the syrup is cold , pour about 1/2 cup into the container .
Add the fruit , and then cover with the syrup .
Make sure to leave a bit of space at the top of the container ( it ’ll expand slightly ) .
Sugar pack : sprinkle a little sugar over the fruit , and mix gently with a large spoon .
The sugar will help to draw the excess juice out of the fruit .
Once again , make sure there ’s a bit of room at the top of the container .
Unsweetened pack : use water ( with ascorbic acid if necessary ) to cover the fruit .
Allow some headspace for expansion .
Tray pack : spread small , whole fruits out in single layers on trays or baking sheets .
Once frozen , repack them into bags or containers and put back in the freezer .
As they ’re already frozen , there ’s no need to allow for expansion in the containers .
The process itself
Details of the process for common fruits are :
Fruit Preparation Apples
Wash , peel , core , and cut into pie slices .
Cover with ascorbic acid .
Apricots , Peaches and Nectarines Wash in cold water and sort .

How to freeze nuts
Most nuts ( whether whole or chopped , shells or not ) freeze quite well .
To do this , simply double - bag them in freezer bags ; and pop them in the freezer .
They ’ll keep for around 6 months .
Do the nuts need to be defrosted prior to use ?
This varies according to the way you intend to use them .
For dishes that are going to be heated in any case ( such as stir fries ) , using them frozen is fine .
If you ’re going to eat them as they are ( say you ’re sprinkling them on ice - cream ) , thaw them a little first .
They ’ll taste better .
How to freeze meats
Whilst the frozen vegetables , fruit and nuts are all great to have ; for most people the core of their freezer use centres around meat .
After all , this is where the big financial savings come in ( more on that in part II ) .
Although freezing meat is a fairly straightforward process , there are a few things to keep in mind :
Freezing meat does n’t magically reverse spoiling .
Make sure the meat is fresh to begin with .
If you ’ve ever tried to separate a couple of pieces of frozen meat , you ’ll know just how frustrating it can be .
If you ’re putting two or more pieces in the same bag or container , place a couple of sheets of freezer paper between them .
Game meats should be dressed and cleaned as soon as possible after shooting .
There is no need to stuff them before freezing .
Label things with the date by which they should be used .
The general process
To freeze meat , simply :
Trim fat and remove unnecessary bones
Cut into meal - sized portions
Place into freezer bags , plastic containers or wrap in foil or freezer paper ( make sure to separate pieces with paper or foil )
Place in the freezer for desired time ( maximum storage times listed below )
Nice and simple .
How long will it last ?
Meats vary a little ; depending on type , whether they ’re cooked or not and the amount of liquid in them .
Here are a few suggested times :
Type Time Large cuts of meat ( such as steaks ) 6 - 12 months Ground or minced meat 3 months Cooked meats 1 - 2 months Bacon and cured hams 1 month Hotdogs , lunchmeats and shaved meats 1 - 2 weeks
NB : For meats bought at the supermarket , they ’re probably already packed in some form .
Before freezing them , cut them to size ( one piece per meal ) and repack them .
This will get rid of the excess gases and fluids which were present when purchased .
Freezing Seafood
Seafood can certainly be frozen , and fresh seafood freezes well .
A few points to keep in mind :
Freeze the seafood as soon as possible after it ’s caught
Whole fish should be gutted and cleaned
Once frozen , take out of the freezer , dip in water and put back in ( this forms a protective coating )
Smoked fish tastes slightly salty after freezing
Freeze small fish whole , and cut larger fish into steaks prior to freezing
All varieties of seafood can be frozen ( for specifics , see the table below )
Freezing seafood other than fish
There are many , many varieties of seafood available – and several ways to freeze it .
The following table lists the process for several common items .
Food Process Lobster
Cook in salted , boiling water for 8 - 10 min .
Place in bags or containers , and cover with brine .
Freeze .
To use , boil for another 8 - 10 minutes ( from frozen ) .
Scallops
Rinse well to remove sand and shell .
Drain , place in bags or containers and cover with brine ; freeze .
Clams and Mussels Rinse well .
Steam until opened , and remove shells .
Cover with brine and freeze .
Prawns
The shells can be left on .
Simply put them in containers , cover with water and pop them in the freezer .
Squid and Octopus Freezing actually tenderises the meat .
Clean and gut them , place in an airtight bag and throw them in .
Oysters Rinse well .
Shuck , cover with their own liquid and freeze .
NB : Oysters can also be frozen invidually ( in their own liquid ) in ice - cube trays .
How long does it last ?
Most fish will last for a few months or more .
Here ’s the breakdown :
Food Time Oily fish Up to 3 months Smoked fish Up to 3 months Other fish Up to 6 months Oysters Up to 6 months Prawns Up to 3 months Squid and Octopus Up to 3 months
Freezing Pastries
Most pastries freeze extremely well ( my own freezer is generally filled with them ) .
A few things to keep in mind :
Custard and cream do n’t freeze terribly well ( they both soak into the base ) .
If you ’re planning to add some , wait until you ’re ready to eat it .
Meringue toppings tend to toughen during freezing .
As with the cream , add it just before serving .
Sheets of pastry are notoriously difficult to separate when frozen .
Make sure there ’s a sheet of freezer paper between each one .
Overall , it ’s a straightforward process .
Place individual items in bags or plastic containers ; and stack sheets with freezer paper between each .
Both cooked and uncooked pastry can be frozen .
How long does it last ?
Pastry generally keeps well .
A few approximate times :
Food Time Baked pastries with fruit fillings 3 - 4 months Baked pastry ( plain ) 2 - 3 months Unbaked pastry 6 - 8 weeks Pumpkin pie 4 - 5 weeks
What not to freeze
Foods that do not freeze well include :
mayonnaise
cream puddings and fillings
custard
gelatin salads
cheese
the whites of hard - cooked eggs and uncooked egg yolks
gravies made with wheat flour
spices
Final thoughts on freezing food
Freezing food can be a great way to save money , make sure your favourites are available all year and cut down on food waste .
Leftovers are often ready for re-use in another form .
As far as food safety is concerned , freezing food – for any length of time – is safe to eat .
The various ‘ best before ‘ times noted above simply refer to the flavours and appearance of the food .
This has been the first part of The Ultimate Guide to Freezing Food .
Keep an eye out for the second part – which looks at the aspects of saving money and defrosting – next week .
You have to wonder whether reality ever comes knocking on George W. Bush 's door .
If it did , would the president with the unsettling demeanor of a boy king even bother to answer ?
Mr. Bush is the commander in chief who launched a savage war in Iraq and now spends his days happily riding his bicycle in Texas .
This is eerie .
Scary .
Surreal .
The war is going badly and lives have been lost by the thousands , but there is no real sense , either at the highest levels of government or in the nation at large , that anything momentous is at stake .
The announcement on Sunday that five more American soldiers had been blown to eternity by roadside bombs was treated by the press as a yawner .
It got very little attention .
You can turn on the television any evening and tune in to the bizarre extended coverage of the search for Natalee Holloway , the Alabama teenager who disappeared in Aruba in May .
But we hear very little about the men and women who have given up their lives in Iraq , or are living with horrific injuries suffered in that conflict .
If only the war were more entertaining .
Less of a downer .
Perhaps then we could meet the people who are suffering and dying in it .
