It ’s become common belief that Muslim women , particularly those wear the hijab , are liberated from the media - driven standards of beauty that values the thin and the willowy .
But it ’s a belief that couches on the idea that head - coverings and modest clothes provide little incentive for showing off a great looking body in public .
In other words , Muslim women are supposed to live blissfully unaffected by media and social pressures that both distorts our body image and damages our self - esteem .
So when levels of anorexia amongst teenage girls in the U.A.E. were reported to nearly double those in the U.K. , the phenomenon was described to be “ astonishing ” .
The news report I refer to is something Fatemeh had posted up on the Friday Links last week .
It revealed that the occurrence of anorexia nervosa amongst young women aged 13 to 19 years old in the Emirates were found to be around 1.8 percent , compared to the 1.0 percent in Britain .
Although the article does not explain what drives Emirati teenagers into self - starvation , it does attempt to highlight a little known fact : that women and girls outside the West also suffer from eating disorders , and that the global nature of the disorder is partially attributed to Western influences .
According to one psychiatrist , these influences infiltrate in foreign - made films and other forms of media :
“ We have so much influence from other countries , we have the same movies and [ the same ] messages in the media like in the UK and USA , however there is not any form of understanding about the meaning of the illnesses which are said to be linked to these . ”
But it ’s not as clear - cut as that .
A thought - provoking study led by Tracy Mann , a professor of health psychology at the University of California of Los Angeles , showed that women do not have to be bombarded by imported media to aspire to thinness .
In her experiment , she compared the attitudes to beauty and body image of female Iranian university students in Tehran with those studying at the UCLA campus and found that , startlingly , the female students in Iran were just as obsessed with their weight as their American counterparts .
And not only that , the number of students in Tehran who desired an empty stomach , went for long periods without food , and vomited to control their weight were significantly higher than those in the U.S .
Problematising the issue of self - induced starvation further is the news media ’s portrayal of women on hunger strike as heroines .
Although hunger strikes are not anything like anorexia , young and beautiful women like Roxana Saberi have resisted food in what is perceived by many to be a heroic act of protest .
Inadvertently , she , like other women in the media and in the fashion industry who may or may not have eating disorders become role models to young women who follow their path to meaningful self - deprivation .
Though the causes for anorexia are notoriously complicated , the one major causal factor ( other than physical and psychological trauma ) appears to be the dangerous effects of unrealistic media imagery .
Without a counterculture that celebrates alternatives to thin Western media ideals , women are made to believe that it ’s not okay to be a size 12 or have flabby arms if they want to be successful in romance and life .
Ironically , the exemplary models of counterculture that offer hope to women of all body shapes and sizes emerge from the West as well .
By this I mean stuff like the Dove Campaign For Real Beauty , among other things .
( Although I find Dove ’s problematic use of naked women and women in their underwear to uplift the diversity of female bodies does a sad disservice to the dismantling of the male gaze , but you know that they ’ve at least got their heart in the right place ) .
But back to the U.A.E. Psychiatrists at Al Ain University have proposed for a campaign to raise public awareness about how harmful both extreme dieting and binge eating can be .
Just as important is pointing out to the public that eating disorders are not as rare as it looks , as many who suffer do not recognise that they had a problem to begin to with .
Personally , I think it would be interesting to see if campaigning efforts aim to tackle the media into getting these disorders on their agenda and deal with them in a sensitive and effective way .
Teen Mom Bristol Palin : the New Face of Abstinence
Teen mother said telling her parents about pregnancy was " harder than labor . "
May 6 , 2009  --
She has a healthy baby boy who has just learned to sit up , but Bristol Palin said she 's using her fame to tell other teens to do what she did n't do -- abstain from sex .
" Regardless of what I did personally , I just think that abstinence is the only ... 100 percent foolproof way to prevent pregnancy , " she told " Good Morning America " today , backing away from a previous statement on Fox News that abstinence was n't realistic , saying it was taken out of context .
The spotlight has been on the 18 - year - old since her pregnancy was announced a few days after her mother accepted the offer to become the GOP 's vice presidential nominee .
She 's now using that spotlight to promote a national campaign to raise awareness for teen pregnancy prevention .
The daughter of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was appointed as a teen ambassador for the New York City - based Candie 's Foundation because she believes she could be a living example of the consequences of teen pregnancy , which is foundation 's mission .
" It 's a hard choice , but it 's the safest choice and it's the best choice , " Palin said .
Neil Cole , founder of the Candie 's Foundation , said the company , which manufactures shoes marketed to teens , wanted to use that relationship to help prevent teen pregnancy .
" Just because you 're wearing high - heeled sexy shoes does n't mean you should have a baby , " he said .
Palin's is a poignant message on this National Day to Prevent Teen Pregnancy .
" I do n't see myself as a celebrity ; I do n't want to be one , " she said .
" But I think using this experience in my life to help others , I think it 's a blessing . "
Palin said telling her mother and father that she was pregnant was " harder than labor . "
" I knew that it would be a huge shock and a huge surprise for my parents , " she said , adding that their disappointment eventually turned into support .
" I hope that me speaking out now will prevent girls from having to do that in the future . "
Palin said son Tripp , born in December , is sitting up , rolling over and starting to giggle .
" He 's doing awesome , " she said .
" He 's getting so big and so chubby . "
But Palin said he life consists mainly of school , diapers , bottles and chores , all on a " few hours of sleep . "
" It 's a 24 - hour job and that 's a huge responsibility , " she said .
" Your priorities completely change once you have a baby . "
But Palin said giving up the baby or terminating the pregnancy was never an option .
" I knew from the second I found out I was pregnant I was going to keep the baby , " she said .
Still , if she could do it all over again , Palin said she would wait to have sex .
" My son is a blessing .
He 's the best thing that ever happened to me
He 's the love of my life but I do wish that years from now I could have had the same son . "
Bristol Palin Wants Levi Johnston in Son's Life
The September 2008 revelation that the then 17 - year - old high school senior was pregnant ignited a cultural debate about sexual education .
The story not only received media play because her mother was the Republican vice presidential nominee , but also because of Sarah Palin 's abstinence - only education leanings .
Studies show that 80 percent of pregnant teens do n't marry the fathers of their babies , which includes Bristol Palin .
Though she and then boyfriend Levi Johnston announced their engagement once the news of their pregnancy was revealed , the pair broke up shortly after the birth of their son .
The former couple 's relationship has since been tenuous , at best , with 19 - year - old Johnston being labeled as a deadbeat dad by Sarah Palin 's father .
Johnston has said the Palins have limited his access to Tripp since the breakup , which he said was mutual .
In the weeks following the split , Johnston said he needed to mature before becoming a husband but held out hope that he and Palin would reconcile .
Bristol Palin said she wants to maintain some kind of relationship with Johnston for the benefit of her son .
" I 'd love Levi to be a part of his life and I know he will be , " she said .
" Every child needs a father . "
Palin said she did n't pay much attention to the intense media coverage that started when her mother was thrust into the national spotlight during the presidential campaign , including Tina Fey 's Sarah Palin impersonation .
" It 's unreal , " she said .
Palin is but one visible example of a nationwide trend .
For the second year in a row , the country 's teen birth rate has increased .
Three out of 10 girls in the United States will get pregnant and less than half of those women will earn their high school diploma , according to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy .
HARTFORD , Conn . --
Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun got into a heated exchange at a postgame news conference Saturday with a freelance journalist and political activist who questioned why the coach of a public university was making $ 1.6 million in tough economic times .
" Not a dime back , " Calhoun joked as Ken Krayeske asked about Calhoun 's salary and the state 's budget deficit , which is estimated at $ 944 million for the current fiscal year and up to $ 8 billion over the next two years .
When Krayeske continued the line of questioning , Calhoun got angry .
" My best advice to you is , shut up , " said Calhoun , who offered to talk to Krayeske after the news conference that followed the top - ranked Huskies ' 64 - 50 victory over South Florida .
" If these guys covered this stuff , I would n't have to do it , " said Krayeske , who had been granted a photo pass to attend the news conference .
Now visibly angry , Calhoun responded .
" Quite frankly , we bring in $ 12 million to the university , nothing to do with state funds , " Calhoun shouted back .
" We make $ 12 million a year for this university .
Get some facts and come back and see me .
...
Do n't throw out salaries and other things .
" Get some facts and come back and see me .
We turn over $ 12 million to the University of Connecticut , which is state - run .
Next question . "
Krayeske , of Hartford , is a political activist and self - described freelance journalist who has landed in the headlines after other high - profile incidents in the past .
They included his January 2007 arrest at Gov. M. Jodi Rell 's inaugural parade , where Hartford police charged Krayeske with breach of peace and interfering with an officer .
The charges were later dismissed .
Calhoun , who has two national championships , is set to make $ 1.6 million in 2009 - 10 , the final year of his contract .
Women 's basketball coach Geno Auriemma , who has brought five national championships to Storrs , recently signed a 5 - year , $ 8 million deal that begins July 1 .
Connecticut football coach Randy Edsall signed a 5 - year deal a year ago that pays him an average of $ 1.5 million annually .
The three coaches are among the state 's highest paid employees .
Even if you are tired of zombie flicks , you'd be glad to hear that World War Z – a novel about a zombie infestation that almost destroys the entire planet – is being turned into a movie . . .
Written in 2006 , World War Z was the “ sequel ” to author Max Brooks ’
The Zombie Survival Guide , which offered “ complete protection from the living dead ” as the blurb declared .
It was a one - joke , tongue - in - cheek book in which that one joke got pretty tired pretty quick and it is best read ( if at all ) as a companion piece to World War Z .
World War Z is one of those fictional books that pretends to be non-fiction – who knows what aliens scavenging the remains of our dead culture will make of all this one day !
It tells the story of a zombie plague that nearly wiped out mankind when governments and armies are initially unable to control the global infestation .
Ten years after the war has ended , author Max Brooks goes around interviewing various people across the globe about their experiences during World War Z .
A critic once remarked of George Romero ’s seminal 1968 zombie flick Night of the Living Dead that it is a science fiction movie pretending to be a horror movie .
The same goes for World War Z .
It is more science fiction than horror , less interested in chills than in recounting how this future world ’s various governments and societies fail to cope with a virus that turns the recently dead into mindless cannibalistic creatures that in turn infect the living .
Ironically it is only geographically isolated , authoritarian societies such as North Korea and Cuba that copes best with controlling the outbreak .
( In a stunning reversal of fortune , Cuba in fact becomes the world ’s economic powerhouse since its population and infrastructure remain largely unscathed during the outbreak .
All because Castro ’s secret police early on threw the zombies into prison camps ! )
Open democratic societies have a much tougher time halting the spread of the disease and coping with the zombie hordes within their own borders .
Brooks especially has it in for incompetent government bureaucracies ( which keep the public uninformed of the rising threat in an effort to prevent any large - scale panic ) and huge multinational corporations that cynically produce a zombie “ inoculation ” that does n’t work .
What is Brooks trying to tell us ?
That our governments will have a tough time coping with a large - scale zombie infestation ?
No arguments there .
We do n’t think that that is exactly a possibility covered by their Civil Defense planning . . .
The zombie invasion alters the Earth ’s geopolitical map .
Pakistan and Iran nukes one another ; China becomes a democracy following a civil war ; and Russia becomes a scary theocracy .
Unlike Brooks ’ previous novel , World War Z is pretty darned serious .
And it works rather well except for one or two daft moments .
In one such daft segment a blind Japanese pensioner becomes an adept zombie - slayer .
In another South Africa repurposes an old Apartheid - era plan that was meant to be a last possible resort to deal with a full - scale uprising by its native Black population .
The plan ends up saving the world , thanks to Nelson Mandela – the Great Reconciler – who insisted upon it being used even though it was dreamt up by a racist apartheid apparatchik !
The good outweighs the bad by far however .
There are several action set pieces in the novel that makes one salivate at the thought of them being turned into a movie .
One is in an “ interview ” in which a US soldier tells of the epic Battle of Yonkers .
The battle was supposed to be a showpiece by the US military to illustrate that it is indeed ready to simply blow away the zombie threat .
The direct opposite of course happens : the battle is a huge setback instead .
The soldiers are trained for conventional warfare against , well , the living .
Being engulfed by hordes of the undead that can only be killed by headshots was n’t exactly something NATO planners considered a possibility during the Cold War .
Soon they are overrun by the living dead despite their massive firepower .
( Click on image to enlarge )
Another great action scene is one in which a lone female pilot crash - lands in hostile zombie territory and must make her way to a safe zone .
Other “ interviews ” or segments include a soldier telling of the extreme disciplinary measures taken by the Russian military when soldiers refuse to leave doomed civilians to their fate ; a Japanese computer geek escaping his infested apartment block using sheets tied together like in a , er , movie ; divers having to clear the ocean bottom of “ live ” zombies ; and so on .
Sure , some of it is your typical post - apocalypse stuff that will be familiar to anyone who has seen 28 Weeks Later , I Am Legend or even The Happening , but Brooks lends an unexpected emotional resonance to the material at hand by taking it all very seriously .
This ai n’t no Shaun of the Dead .
Which is probably how Brad Pitt ’s production company ( who obtained rights to the novel after outbidding Leonardo diCaprio ’s company ) managed to attract Marc Forster to direct a movie version of the book .
The movie is set for a 2010 release date .
Forster is a very “ serious ” film - maker ( The Kite Runner , Monster 's Ball , Stranger Than Fiction ) who is sometimes criticized for his ham - fisted approach by film critics .
He has proven himself capable of directing larger scale action blockbusters with the recent Bond movie , Quantum of Solace .
Quantum was however a mixed bag at best , but hopefully Forster has been reading some reviews and will have dropped some of his annoying tricks copied mostly from the Bourne movies such as jerky cam movements , incoherent editing and the like .
( As well as his attempts at being “ deep , ” which in Quantum resulted in a laughably pretentious action scene set in an opera house . )
J. Michael Straczynski , best known for Babylon 5 , has already written a script for World War Z .
There are two ways for a film - maker to present the material at hand : a fake documentary approach which echoes the mockumentary “ interviews ” in Brooks ’ book ; or a straight - forward narrative in which several of the characters in the book are condensed into one or two central figures .
Wisely enough Straczynski has opted for the latter option .
After all , did we really need yet another zombie movie filmed in the style of Quarantine ?
Forster has likened the planned movie to ‘ Seventies conspiracy thrillers such as All the President 's Men. Straczynski in turn has compared the movie to The Bourne Identity and remarked that World War Z will have a large international scope while keeping the film as political as the book was .
Judging from some concept art work leaked onto the Internet ( see this page ) , it seems that this approach still means an epic approach in which scenes such as the Battle of Yonkers scene have been retained .
There are many such epic scenes – of masses of humanity fleeing the oncoming zombie hordes ; of harbors being blocked by derelict ships ; and so on .
As of yet little is known of the project .
There have been no announcements regarding casting and the film ’s budget .
Filming such scenes can be hugely expensive .
The famous evacuation scene in Will Smith ’s I Am Legend is rumored to have cost the studio anything from $ 5 million to $ 30 million , for example .
One can only wonder how much World War Z is going to cost - and whether it will be money well spent .
Horror movies have great opening weekends , but they soon taper off at the box office .
They are ultimately profitable because they are cheap to produce .
You do n’t need expensive crowd scenes and CGI effects to make Friday the 13th or Halloween , but if they want to do Brooks ’ book justice then that is exactly what World War Z will need .
This means that World War Z will probably be marketed at more mainstream audiences to justify its no doubt bigger budget .
Does that mean a star for the main role instead of the usual unknowns to be found in horror flicks ?
One can only speculate .
A “ borderline ” expensive horror movie such as I Am Legend only scored big at the box office because it had Will Smith and a minimum of gore .
Director Forster would probably want to push World War Z into more “ dramatic ” pastures instead of focusing on its horror elements .
The problem is , will mainstream audiences buy into a post - apocalyptic zombie flick after the likes of 28 Days Later and its sequel , I Am Legend and Dawn of the Dead not to mention the countless other recent cheapo zombie DVDs making the shelves groan at your local video store ?
Going green does n't mean joining some radical organization , using pig waste to power your data center or flying the ecology flag at your place of business .
It does mean doing your part to save electricity , fossil fuel and your own money .
I know what you 're thinking : " Oh great , another ' green ' article telling me I have to spend a bundle of money to save a few pennies . "
To the contrary , these tips will save you money and for the most part require very little effort and no money .
What could be better than that ?
Moneymaking tips , perhaps ?
Implement enough of these , and it will feel like you 're making money rather than just saving it .
Alternative Desktops
Are you having difficulty finding ways to ' go green ' ?
Here are some simple tips to get you started .
Traditional desktop computers consume a huge amount of energy .
Most have 350 - 450
Watt power supplies that constantly gobble up electric juice to the tune of 200 Watts or more .
Printers are also very hungry power users , as are copiers , fax machines , computer monitors , cell phone chargers and standard light bulbs .
Alternative desktop computers , such as thin - client terminals , netbooks and standard laptop computers sip power compared to their traditional desktop brethren .
Although most of these alternative devices cost from $ 150 up to $ 600 , and go even higher for more powerful models , their low heat production and low power consumption make them perfect desktop replacements .
When your standard desktops die off or become obsolete , replace them with something alternative for the same price as traditional fare .
Save significant money on power by choosing energy - saving models .
Power Management
Do you use power management on all of your computers and other office machines that offer it ?
If not , you should .
In Control Panel ( Windows computers ) , look for Power Options or Power Management , and select a power scheme that turns off the monitor and hard disks after 15 minutes of idle time .
Set the System standby to 30 minutes .
Hibernation settings are n't necessary unless the computer operates on batteries .
Most office equipment has power saving settings .
Check your user manual on how to set those for each device that stays on all the time .
If a computer or office machine does n't participate in nightly maintenance , updates or backups , power down those devices at the end of each workday .
It 's far less costly to power up than to leave everything on .
Rearrange Your Workspace
Believe it or not , a simple rearrangement of your workspace can have significant ramifications .
Arrange your desktop computer and monitor so they have plenty of air circulating around them .
Heat build - up decreases the life expectancy of electronics and therefore costs you more money .
Heat also makes electronic devices run less efficiently .
With proper air circulation around your computer " box " and its monitor , you might find that you do n't need your thermostat set on 65 degrees all the time .
Allow your computer to breathe , and you 'll breathe easier with fewer heat - related failures and lower power consumption for cooling you and your computer .
Unplug Idle Devices and Peripherals
Gadgets suck a lot of power .
So do their chargers , power strips and other associated devices , such as speakers .
Turn off and unplug electronic gadgets and devices that are n't used .
Lengthen the life of electronic gadgets , including laptop computers , by allowing them to operate on battery power .
Leaving your laptop continuously plugged into power decreases the battery 's life and renders it unable to maintain a charge per its design specifications .
Increase the life of your electronic devices through proper battery conditioning .
This saves you money and decreases the amount of e-waste and its disposal .
Green Data Center Tips
How can a data center possibly go green ?
By using low power - consumption server systems , such as blade servers , to replace current hardware that 's ready for refresh , you 'll use less power , have less heat to dissipate and gain centralized power management of those systems to boot .
Power off monitors connected to server systems when not in use .
Monitors generate heat and use power , which , in turn , uses more power for cooling them and co-located systems .
Enable power management on your non-blade server systems that do not need to run at full - capacity 100 percent of the time .
Use exhaust fans on racks and in enclosures instead of fans that blow directly onto your systems for air circulation .
Blowing air distributes dust that collects on electronic components rendering them less efficient and often leads to overheating as well .
Exhaust fans pull in fresh air and blow out warmer air , thereby cooling your systems more efficiently .
Server virtualization makes more economical use of resources than any other method mentioned here .
Fewer hardware systems to power and cool means less money sucked out of power outlets and blown out of exhaust fans .
Finally , examine your server layout and , as much as possible , separate your server systems so there is sufficient air space between them in racks and in enclosures .
Replace failing or aging hardware with newer , more efficient hardware .
Seriously consider virtualization to consolidate and decrease the number of physical systems required to run your business .
There 's no need to tie yourself to a tree to find some green peace in your office or data center .
Some simple techniques are all you need to make your business and your bank account a little greener .

US Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner says that we do n't need to bail out the banks anymore based on the results of his stress tests .
We should follow up quickly on his assessment and start shutting the special Fed lending facilities enjoyed by the banks , the FDIC loan guarantee programme and the AIG slush fund .
However , given the hundreds of billions that have already gone out the door , it is still worth asking whether this bailout was necessary .
The argument made by many economists was that it would cost taxpayers more money to do an FDIC - type takeover of banking behemoths like Citigroup and Bank of America than the tens of billions handed over to keep them afloat .
In their story , the taxpayer bailout of bank stockholders , bondholders and top management was an unfortunate side effect .
While the next step in this argument is a calculation of the cost of a bite - the - bullet now approach versus a handout - and - wait strategy .
With the right assumptions , the handout - and - wait strategy can be shown to come out on top , so we really were just helping ourselves when we gave hundreds of billions of dollars to the bankers that wrecked the economy .
But this calculation not only requires a very specific set of assumptions , it also requires some really bad logic , a commodity supplied in abundance by nation 's top economists .
The economists claimed that killing the zombie banks would cost more money because it would effectively set in motion a bank run .
The argument goes that people would withdraw money even from insured deposits .
The result would be that the government would suddenly be liable to make good on all the banks ' deposits , which could easily exceed the value of their assets by more than $ 1tn .
The economists argued that it was better to have costly bailouts than to deal with a massive collapse .
To see the fallacy in the economists ' logic , suppose that the banks ' depositors gathered together $ 1tn in cash .
Suppose they accidentally set the cash on fire and burnt it up so that $ 1tn in cash no longer existed .
What if the government then stepped in and replaced the lost money .
However , instead of borrowing money in the bond market , it simply printed up another $ 1tn in cash .
In this case , there is no greater debt burden on the government in the future , since the $ 1tn has no interest costs .
Nor is there any threat of inflation as a result of the printing up an additional $ 1tn .
The newly minted $ 1tn simply replaced $ 1tn that was destroyed .
There is no more money in circulation as a result of this printing than there had been before the big fire .
In short , replacing the $ 1tn destroyed by the fire imposes no real cost on the government at all .
( If this all sounds a little too fast and loose , it is .
If we let the depositors suffer their $ 1tn loss , then the rest of us would be richer as a result .
The depositors would have less claim on the economy 's output , leaving more for the rest of us . )
How does this relate to the great bank heist of 2008 - 2009 ?
It 's very simple .
If we actually got the scary bank runs described by the leading economists , then the Fed could just print the money needed to make the depositors whole .
This additional money would not add in any real sense to the government 's debt burden .
We would just be replacing money that had effectively disappeared with new money .
This would impose no additional interest costs , nor would it increase the threat of inflation .
The great benefit of going this route is that it would not use taxpayer dollars to reward the bankers executives who got us into this mess , and the bondholders and stockholders who were foolish enough to trust them with their money .
We could honour all guaranteed deposits while allowing the bondholders and stockholders to enjoy the full fruit of their risk - taking .
In other words , they would get wiped out , which is what is supposed to happen in a capitalist economy .
We would also replace the bank executives with more competent people , who presumably would work for much lower pay .
As quickly as possible the banks would be restructured and then sold back to the private sector .
That is the way things are supposed to work in a market economy .
In short , there were really no legitimate horror stories , at least from the taxpayers ' side .
The horror stories were only horror stories for the bank executives and their bondholders and shareholders .
The economists who missed the housing bubble helped to deceive the public yet again and steer more taxpayer dollars in the pockets of this wealthy clique .
Sex offender hysteria kills children Share This :
But I simply do not believe society now produces 10x , 20x , 100 x more sexual offenders than it did a few decades ago when children walked home from school alone and safely .... as I did , as did every other child I knew .
I do not believe the politicized and self - serving statistics I read from social workers , PC feminists , law enforcement and others who draw money / prestige from the " child abuse industry . "
I know for a fact ( because I investigated several cases ) that the lives of entirely innocent people are being destroyed by false or otherwise ungrounded accusations that , once made , are a de facto GUILTY conviction in the eyes of the public .
The soaring number of sex offenders on registries and in jail are far more a result of unreasonably expanded definitions that include an 18 - year - old having sex with his teenaged girlfriend , teens texting each other , etc .
It is the result of a legal system that draws little distinction between violent sexual assault and the distasteful but non-violent act of exposing one 's genitalia .
And , so , an increasing number of sexual offenders ( overwhelmingly males ) now live under bridges or on the street because of residency restrictions ; they can not get jobs ; they have fewer and fewer legal rights every day ; any chance of rehabilitation is virtually stripped away and non-violent offenders naturally turn brutal or suicidal in facing utter hatred from all whom they meet ...
Today I read a story that made my blood run cold .
There has been ( from what I can see ) an increasing trend toward a vigilantism in which sex offenders are brutalized -- sometimes to the point of death -- by neighborhood residents who are informed by the authorities that an " offender " is moving nearby .
What the hell do the police think will happen when they announce that Satan has come to town in order to rape your 3 - year - old ?
The blood - curdling story from this morning : Parents told how to protect kids from predators .
The police chief in a town in Vermont is apparently frustrated that a soon - to - be released sex offender -- who is named in the story , of course -- has the right to live wherever he wishes .
I presume he was sentenced prior to residency restriction laws because such freedom is severely curtailed for those sentenced today or in recent years .
And , so , the police chief gathered together parents from the community to personally warn them of the fellow 's background and advise them to ' protect ' their children from him .
Of course , he adds the standard boilerplate warning that lets him entirely ' off the hook ' ,
No rough stuff , now !
Do n't break the law .
I have no doubt officials such as this police chief turn their faces away ( whenever they can do so with impunity ) from the brutalization of sex offenders within their jurisdictions ; hell , the police themselves are the main perpetrators .
A final irony of the sexual offender hysteria is that the drive to protect children is actually endangering them .
Decent , decent men -- like my husband -- know to stay away from children ... even to help them .
They know how vulnerable they are to false or mistaken charges that could ruin their lives merely by being spoken aloud .
I have made Brad promise NEVER to volunteer for a Special Olympics or any other event where he will be in contact with children ; this has been a hardship for him because volunteering in the community in one of his favorite things .
What do parents and authorities expect will happen to children when decent men with common sense literally avert their eyes when they see a child approaching ?
Do they think that child will have people rushing to assist him / her when lost , hurt or in other danger ?
They have destroyed the social network of decent human beings whose natural instinct is to help a child in need .
This helps children ?
This train of thought reminded me of an article I wrote years ago about an incident that drives home the impact of sex offender hysteria upon children .
Some children will die because of it ....
On Nov. 28 , 2002 , 2 - year - old Abigail Rae died by drowning in a village pond in England .
Her death is currently stirring debate because the ongoing inquest revealed an explosive fact .
A man passing by was afraid to guide the lost child to safety because he feared being labeled " a pervert . "
In the article " Day of the dad : paedophilia hysteria leaves men afraid to help , " The Telegraph raises a question that applies equally to North America .
Have high profile cases of pedophilia created such public hysteria that the average decent human being , especially a man , is now reluctant to approach a child in need ?
Instead , he assured himself that the parents must be " driving around " and would find her .
A few minutes thereafter , Abby fatally fell into an algae - covered pond .
Meanwhile , the nursery staff searched .
When the mother noticed the staff near her home , she was told they were looking for a " lost dog " but the truth soon emerged .
The frantic mother 's search ended when she leaped into the pond to fish out what she thought was Abby 's shoe .
She stated , " As I grabbed for the shoe , I missed and was shocked to touch what felt like a leg .
I pulled the leg upwards . "
The dead child emerged .
Abby 's case may be extreme but it hinges on a question that commonly confronts everyone who interacts with other people 's children .
Is it possible to touch a child in a non-abusive manner without risking terrible repercussions ?
Before moving to this question , however , it is necessary to consider a related issue that arises in almost every discussions of Abby .
Is Clive Peachey legally or morally responsible for her death ?
For several reasons , I argue that he is not .
First and foremost , the responsibility lies with the nursery staff who became her guardians .
Abby was in no immediate danger when Peachey saw her and he contacted the police upon later hearing a ' missing child ' report .
Arguably , if he had phoned the police immediately , Abby would have been dead long before they arrived .
Moreover , by coming forth , Peachey has accepted the damage to his life that comes with the public disgrace of saying " I drove past her . "
Important information in judging Peachey is missing .
For example , if Peachey has a family , he may have been reluctant to place his reputation or livelihood at risk .
He may have balanced possible harm to his own children against helping a stranger 's child .
Peachey 's fears have precedence on this side of the Atlantic .
Last summer , an Illinois man lost an appeal on his conviction as a sex offender for grabbing the arm of a 14 - year - old girl .
She had stepped directly in front of his car , causing him to swerve in order to avoid hitting her .
The 28 - year - old Fitzroy Barnaby jumped out his car , grabbed her arm and lectured her on how not to get killed .
Nothing more occurred .
Nevertheless , that one action made him guilty of " the unlawful restraint of a minor , " which is a sexual offense in Illinois .
Both the jury and judge believed him .
Nevertheless , Barnaby went through years of legal proceedings that ended with his name on a sex offender registry , where his photograph and address are publicly available .
He must report to authorities .
His employment options are severely limited ; he can not live near schools or parks .
Arguably , the law would have punished Barnaby less had he hit the girl or not cared enough to lecture her .
Perhaps that 's the equation that ran through Peachey 's mind .

The effect on average people in non-extreme situations can be partially gauged through a study conducted by Dr. Heather Piper at Manchester Metropolitan University : " The Problematics of ' Touching ' Between Children and Professionals . "

Consider what happened to Abby .
The toddler wandered from her nursery school , Ready Teddy Go , through a door left open .
A bricklayer named Clive Peachey drove past her in his truck .
At the inquest , he stated , " I kept thinking I should go back .
The reason I did n't was because I thought people might think I was trying to abduct her .
" Instead , he assured himself that the parents must be " driving around " and would find her .
A few minutes thereafter , Abby fatally fell into an algae - covered pond .
Meanwhile , the nursery staff searched .
When the mother noticed the staff near her home , she was told they were looking for a " lost dog " but the truth soon emerged .
The frantic mother 's search ended when she leaped into the pond to fish out what she thought was Abby 's shoe .
She stated , " As I grabbed for the shoe , I missed and was shocked to touch what felt like a leg .
I pulled the leg upwards . "
The dead child emerged .
Abby 's case may be extreme but it hinges on a question that commonly confronts everyone who interacts with other people 's children .
Is it possible to touch a child in a non-abusive manner without risking terrible repercussions ?
Before moving to this question , however , it is necessary to consider a related issue that arises in almost every discussions of Abby .
Is Clive Peachey legally or morally responsible for her death ?
For several reasons , I argue that he is not .
First and foremost , the responsibility lies with the nursery staff who became her guardians .
Abby was in no immediate danger when Peachey saw her and he contacted the police upon later hearing a ' missing child ' report .
Arguably , if he had phoned the police immediately , Abby would have been dead long before they arrived .
Moreover , by coming forth , Peachey has accepted the damage to his life that comes with the public disgrace of saying " I drove past her .
" Important information in judging Peachey is missing .
For example , if Peachey has a family , he may have been reluctant to place his reputation or livelihood at risk .
He may have balanced possible harm to his own children against helping a stranger 's child .

Every day I read news items on the hysteria that surrounds the closely - related issues of sex offenders and pedophilia .
As a woman who lived on the streets briefly as a runaway teen , I would never deny the existence of sexual abuse or the unique vulnerability of children to it .
But I simply do not believe society now produces 10x , 20x , 100 x more sexual offenders than it did a few decades ago when children walked home from school alone and safely .... as I did , as did every other child I knew .
I do not believe the politicized and self - serving statistics I read from social workers , PC feminists , law enforcement and others who draw money / prestige from the " child abuse industry . "
I know for a fact ( because I investigated several cases ) that the lives of entirely innocent people are being destroyed by false or otherwise ungrounded accusations that , once made , are a de facto GUILTY conviction in the eyes of the public .
The soaring number of sex offenders on registries and in jail are far more a result of unreasonably expanded definitions that include an 18 - year - old having sex with his teenaged girlfriend , teens texting each other , etc .
It is the result of a legal system that draws little distinction between violent sexual assault and the distasteful but non-violent act of exposing one 's genitalia .
And , so , an increasing number of sexual offenders ( overwhelmingly males ) now live under bridges or on the street because of residency restrictions ; they can not get jobs ; they have fewer and fewer legal rights every day ; any chance of rehabilitation is virtually stripped away and non-violent offenders naturally turn brutal or suicidal in facing utter hatred from all whom they meet ... Today I read a story that made my blood run cold .
There has been ( from what I can see ) an increasing trend toward a vigilantism in which sex offenders are brutalized -- sometimes to the point of death -- by neighborhood residents who are informed by the authorities that an " offender " is moving nearby .
What the hell do the police think will happen when they announce that Satan has come to town in order to rape your 3 - year - old ?
The blood - curdling story from this morning : Parents told how to protect kids from predators .
The police chief in a town in Vermont is apparently frustrated that a soon - to - be released sex offender -- who is named in the story , of course -- has the right to live wherever he wishes .
I presume he was sentenced prior to residency restriction laws because such freedom is severely curtailed for those sentenced today or in recent years .
And , so , the police chief gathered together parents from the community to personally warn them of the fellow 's background and advise them to ' protect ' their children from him .
Of course , he adds the standard boilerplate warning that lets him entirely ' off the hook ' ,
No rough stuff , now !
Do n't break the law .
I have no doubt officials such as this police chief turn their faces away ( whenever they can do so with impunity ) from the brutalization of sex offenders within their jurisdictions ; hell , the police themselves are the main perpetrators .
A final irony of the sexual offender hysteria is that the drive to protect children is actually endangering them .
Decent , decent men -- like my husband -- know to stay away from children ... even to help them .
They know how vulnerable they are to false or mistaken charges that could ruin their lives merely by being spoken aloud .
I have made Brad promise NEVER to volunteer for a Special Olympics or any other event where he will be in contact with children ; this has been a hardship for him because volunteering in the community in one of his favorite things .
What do parents and authorities expect will happen to children when decent men with common sense literally avert their eyes when they see a child approaching ?
Do they think that child will have people rushing to assist him / her when lost , hurt or in other danger ?
They have destroyed the social network of decent human beings whose natural instinct is to help a child in need .
This helps children ?
This train of thought reminded me of an article I wrote years ago about an incident that drives home the impact of sex offender hysteria upon children .
Some children will die because of it .... On Nov. 28 , 2002 , 2 - year - old Abigail Rae died by drowning in a village pond in England .
Her death is currently stirring debate because the ongoing inquest revealed an explosive fact .
A man passing by was afraid to guide the lost child to safety because he feared being labeled " a pervert .
"
In the article " Day of the dad : paedophilia hysteria leaves men afraid to help , " The Telegraph raises a question that applies equally to North America .
Have high profile cases of pedophilia created such public hysteria that the average decent human being , especially a man , is now reluctant to approach a child in need ?

COLUMBIA , S.C. --
Authorities in the South Carolina county where Michael Phelps was photographed smoking from a marijuana pipe have been arresting people as they seek to make a case against the superstar swimmer , lawyers for two arrested people said Thursday .
Attorneys Joseph McCulloch and Dick Harpootlian told The Associated Press they each represent a client charged with possession of marijuana who was questioned about the party Phelps attended near the University of South Carolina campus in November .
The lawyers said the two clients were renters at the house where the party apparently took place .
Harpootlian said his client was at the party , but did n't see Phelps smoke marijuana , while McCulloch said his client was n't there .
The two have since moved and were arrested after police executed a search warrant at their new home and accused them of having a small amount of marijuana there .
" After they arrested him , they did n't ask him , ' Where did you get the marijuana ? ' or ' Who sold it to you ? '
Almost all the questions they asked him were about Michael Phelps , " Harpootlian said .
The lawyers would not name their clients , who each face up to 30 days in jail and a $ 200 fine if convicted on the pending charges .
The Richland County Sheriff 's Department would not comment on the lawyers ' remarks .
" As soon as we 're ready to release information on this case , we will [ comment ] , and we 're still in the middle of this investigation , " Lt. Chris Cowan said .
Authorities have n't contacted the swimmer , who issued an apology for his behavior earlier this month , one of his agents said .
" Michael has not been contacted and we are not going to speculate , " agent Drew Johnson said .
After the photo was published Feb .
1 , Sheriff Leon Lott said his office would investigate and possibly charge Phelps , though officials have not specified what the offense might be .
The effort to prosecute Phelps seems extreme compared to similar cases , lawyers said , and have led some to question whether the sheriff is being overzealous because he 's dealing with a celebrity .
" The efforts that are being made here are unlike anything I 've ever seen before , " said Jack Swerling , a defense attorney in South Carolina .
" I know Leon Lott , I know him to be an honorable guy .
I 've known him for 30 something years .
But the efforts here are extraordinary on simple possession cases . "
Phelps , 23 , and his representatives have not disputed the photo 's accuracy .
Phelps has issued a public apology , acknowledging " regrettable " behavior and " bad judgment " after the photo appeared .
USA Swimming has suspended Phelps for three months and the Kellogg Co. has cut ties with him , although other sponsors are sticking with the swimmer .
McCulloch , who said his client was out of town at the time , doubted that anything his client told authorities would assist them in the case against Phelps .
" Our clients answered questions but I do n't know that their information would be helpful to law enforcement , " McCulloch said .
" It seems to me that Richland County has a host of its own crime problems much more serious than a kid featured in a photograph with a bong in his hand . "
Lott has said Phelps should not get a break because of his fame .
Harpootlian said that he believes police are being overzealous .
" I find it amazing the justification is they do n't want to treat him any differently just because he is a celebrity , and he is being treated far differently than any other Joe Blow who might have smoked marijuana four or five months ago . "
Under South Carolina law , possession of one ounce or less of marijuana is a misdemeanor that carries a fine up to $ 200 and 30 days in jail for the first offense .
Possession of drug paraphernalia is a $ 500 fine .
Columbia television station WIS - TV was first to report earlier this week that eight arrests related to the party had been made , but did not name a source .
McCulloch said college students and lawyers have told him that about eight arrests have been made .
However , although the Richland County Sheriff 's Department did execute search warrants last weekend on a couple locations at the University of South Carolina , the charges the eight people face are from last weekend and not from the November incident involving Phelps .
A source told ESPN that those charged were mostly college students .
Lott has made fighting drug crimes a central plank of his career .
He rose from patrol officer to captain of the narcotics division in the early 1990s .
He was first elected sheriff in 1996 and has held the post since .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
Normally Colin Powell does n't get involved in political scuffles .
That 's not to say that political discourse is a bad thing .
It can be wildly entertaining .
But that 's not his M.O .
The general dipped his toe into the pond last night .
He did n't go off and pull a Jeanine Garofalo or anything .
His criticism was mild .
It 's hard to even call it criticism .
The Boston Globe reports Powell was speaking to a well - heeled crowd last night ( including Patriots quarterback Tom Brady ) when he mentioned the talk show host .
" Rush Limbaugh says , ' Get out of the Republican Party . '
Dick Cheney says , ' He 's already out . '
I may be out of their version of the Republican Party , but there 's another version of the Republican Party waiting to emerge once again , " Powell told the crowd .
Limbaugh responds
What happens next is entirely predictable .
Not foolproof , but predictable .
Limbaugh fights back .
Although he did not engage in a war of words with comedian Wanda Sykes when she called him out during the White House Correspondents Dinner .
But had no problem in lighting Powell up .
" Colin Powell represents the stale , the old , the worn - out GOP that never won anything , " he said on his radio program .
" The party of Gerald Ford , Nelson Rockefeller , Bill Scranton , Arnold Schwarzenegger and those types of people .
Has anybody heard Colin Powell say a single word against Obama 's radicalism -- or Pelosi or Reid , for that matter ?
Maybe he has but his fawning media sure has n't reported if he has said it . "
Then Limbaugh acted as Powell 's spokesperson outlining what he believes the former Secretary of State supports :
Massive debt
Slashing the military 's budget
Federal funding of abortion
Activist judicial nominees
Nationalizing private industries
Duran , Duran
Later in the program , Limbaugh quoted Roberto Duran ( no mas , no mas ) when he announced he was resigning as the " titular head of the Republican party . "
Then he appointed someone else to replace him .
Any guesses ?
" There frankly is someone far more qualified and capable and more in tune with the Republican Party than I , " he said .
" And that would be General Colin Powell .
So now I pass the baton to Colin Powell as the titular head of the Republican Party . "
Dictionary please
Certainly there are many other blogs that would n't have to look up the word " titular " -- but that 's not us .
Titular : Existing or being such in title only ; nominal ; having the title but none of the associated duties , powers , etc. : the titular head of the company .
No word on whether Powell will accept the honor .
-----------
Some speculate that if Powell does not accept the position , Duran Duran is next in line .

Texas Still Tops in Wind Power , Iowa Takes No. 2 Spot
April 14th , 2009 by Dave Tyler
Yes , even the wind power is bigger in Texas .
The Lone Star State held the top spot again in the just released American Wind Energy Association ’s annual industry report .
[ social_buttons ]
In fact , if Texas was its own country it would rank sixth worldwide in production , with 7,118 megawatts installed .
Texas added 2,671 MW just last year .
The AWEA report breaks down a record 2008 for wind power in the U.S. The U.S. now ranks ahead of Germany as the world ’s top wind power producer .
More than 8,500 MW of wind power came online last year , the report says , a more than 50 percent jump in U.S. production .
Iowa ( 2,791 MW ) leapfrogged California ( 2,517 MW ) to take the number two spot in the rankings , the AWEA said .
California ranked third and Minnesota ( 1,754 MW ) and Washington ( 1,447 MW ) , round out the top five .
More than 85,000 people are now employed in the U.S. wind industry , a jump of 50,000 from last year , despite the nation ’s economic tumult .
AWEA CEO Denise Bode thinks all the development is a good start on the way to a bigger destination .
“ … ( W ) e can not rest on past achievements , ” she said .
“ We need the right policies in place for our industry to maintain its momentum .
A national Renewable Electricity Standard , requiring utilities to generate 25 percent of their electricity from renewable energy sources by 2025 , is vital to provide the long - term , U.S. - wide commitment businesses need to invest tens of billions of dollars in clean energy installations and manufacturing facilities , and create hundreds of thousands of American jobs . ”
Wind Power Growth Highlights
Other interesting notes from the report :
Indiana had the top growth rate , expanding installations from zero to 131 MW .
Others in the top five : Michigan ( 48 percent ) , Utah ( 21 percent ) , New Hampshire ( 17 percent ) and Wisconsin ( 6 percent ) .
Minnesota and Iowa now get more than 7 percent of their electricity needs from wind .
Ten new manufacturing facilities came online , 17 were expanded , and 30 were announced in 2008 , the AWEA says .
The 25,300 MW of wind power in place as of December 31,2008 will generate enough power enough to serve the equivalent of close to 7 million average U.S. homes .
NextEra Energy
Resources remains atop the list of project owners and GE Energy turbines topped the manufacturers list again .
Xcel Energy was tops for wind users among utilities .
With all sorts of big projects on the drawing board 2009 looks to be a banner year for wind too .
Only now , wind may kick start both renewable energy use and the economy at the same time .

A UN inquiry accused the Israeli military today of " negligence or recklessness " in its conduct of the war in Gaza .
The summary of the UN report , commissioned by the UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , censured the Israeli government for causing death , injuries and damage to UN property in seven incidents involving action by the Israeli Defence Force ( IDF ) .
It said : " The board concluded that IDF actions involved varying degrees of negligence or recklessness with regard to United Nations premises and to the safety of United Nations staff and other civilians within those premises , with consequent deaths , injuries , and extensive physical damage and loss of property . "
However , in a blow to human rights campaigners , Ban said there would be no further investigation despite the report calling for a full impartial inquiry .
Although the full , 184 - page findings of the UN board of inquiry will not be made public , the 27 - page summary emphasised that UN premises are inviolable , and that inviolability cannot be set aside by the demands of military expediency .
" UN personnel and all civilians within UN premises , as well as civilians in the immediate vicinity of those premises , are to be protected in accordance with the rules and principles of international humanitarian law , " the summary says .
Among the incidents for which the Israeli government is held responsible are :
• The deaths of three young men killed by a single IDF missile strike at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) Asma school in Gaza City on 5 January ;
• The firing of heavy IDF mortar rounds into the UNRWA Jabalia school on 6 January , injuring seven people sheltering in the school and killing up to 40 people in the immediate vicinity ;
• Aerial bombing of the UNRWA Bureij health centre on the same day causing the death of a patient and serious injuries to two others ;
• Artillery firing by the IDF into the UNRWA field office compound in Gaza city on 15 January that in turn caused high explosive shells to explode within the compound causing injuries and considerable damage to the buildings .
The summary notes that it disrupted the UN 's humanitarian operations in Gaza ;
• Artillery firing by the IDF into the UNRWA Beit Lahia school on 17 January , causing the deaths of two children
• Aerial bombing by the IDF of the Unesco compound on 29 December causing damage to UN buildings and vehicles .
In his accompanying letter to the summary , Ban noted that the Israeli government had significant reservations and objections to the document .
He said he was reviewing the inquiry boards recommendations " with a view to determining what courses of action , if any , I should take " .
Those recommendations include demanding from the Israeli government that it retract earlier claims that Palestinians had been firing at the IDF from within UN premises , and that the UN should pursue Israel for reparations and reimbursement for all expenses incurred .
Those reparations would cover the death or injury of UN personnel or third parties , and the repair of UN property .
Israel had dismissed the report , given to an Israeli foreign ministry official , as " tendentious " and " patently biased " .
The UN investigation is the first into the war , and looked only at deaths , injuries and damage caused at UN sites in Gaza during the three - week conflict .
The document was compiled by a board of inquiry – a team of four led by Ian Martin , a Briton who is a former head of Amnesty International and a former UN special envoy to East Timor and Nepal .
Israel 's foreign ministry attempted to pre-empt the report today , saying the Israeli military had already investigated its own conduct during the war and " proved beyond doubt " that it did not fire intentionally at UN buildings .
It dismissed the UN inquiry .
" The state of Israel rejects the criticism in the committee 's summary report , and determines that in both spirit and language the report is tendentious , patently biased , and ignores the facts presented to the committee , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
It said the inquiry had " preferred the claims of Hamas , a murderous terror organisation , and by doing so has misled the world " .
International human rights groups including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have accused Israel 's military and Palestinian militant groups of serious violations of international law and possible war crimes during the conflict .
The UN board of inquiry report has limited scope : it is confined to investigating death or injuries or damage at UN buildings or during UN operations .
The UN human rights council is also to dispatch a fact - finding mission to Gaza , but Israel has already suggested it will not co-operate , saying the council is biased .
DNA profiles of almost a million innocent people are to be destroyed as part of a major overhaul of the police national database .
They include people who have been arrested and never charged , and those taken to court but found not guilty .
Civil rights groups gave a cautious welcome to the proposals - which will be announced by the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , this week - but said more needed to be done .
An estimated 800,000 of the 5.1 m DNA profiles on the database belong to people in England and Wales who have no criminal conviction or indeed any other judgement against them such as a penalty or fine .
A Home Office consultation paper will also outline plans to delete all physical DNA samples on the database , including mouth swabs , hair and blood .
The move follows widespread concerns that the samples could be shared with third parties .
The campaign group Genewatch , which opposes the DNA database , has warned that health and drug companies want access to the samples to create profiles to predict who is genetically susceptible to different illnesses and diseases .
There have also been fears the samples could one day be used for racial profiling or even to predict criminal behaviour .
The proposal to scale back the database and destroy the samples comes after a landmark judgment by the European court of human rights last December that ruled the government was wrong to hold the DNA profiles - the genetic codes that identify individuals - of innocent people indefinitely .
Yesterday Smith told the Observer that there were genuine concerns over the size and scope of the DNA database .
" It is crucial that we do everything we can to keep the public safe from crime and bring offenders to justice , " she said .
" The DNA database plays a vital role in helping us do that .
However , there has to be a balance between the need to protect the public and respecting their rights .
Based on risks versus benefits , our view is that we can now destroy all samples . "
Legal experts said the government had little choice but to comply with the human rights court ruling .
" This is not a privacy - friendly Home Office , " said Shami Chakrabarti , director of Liberty .
" Any developments in this area are because the Home Office has been dragged here by the European court of human rights . "
But the Home Office insists that in deciding to destroy all samples on the database it has gone much further than it was compelled to by the court 's ruling .
Last night privacy campaigners said the consultation must answer the crucial question of how long the police would be allowed to retain the DNA data of innocent people before being forced to delete them .
There were also claims the proposals did not go far enough .
" The DNA database is already too big , " said Simon Davies , director of the campaign group Privacy International .
" We would argue that the samples of anyone convicted of even minor offences should be removed . "
Despite mounting outrage over the use of the DNA database , the government insists that DNA can play an essential role in fighting crime .
The Home Office says that between April 1998 and September 2008 there were more than 390,000 crimes with DNA matches .
DNA has played an essential part in solving thousands of cases , including finding Mark Dixie guilty of the murder of Sally Ann Bowman , the 18 - year - old model murdered close to her home in Croydon , south London , in 2005 , and the conviction of Steve Wright for the murder of five prostitutes in Ipswich .
It has also played a crucial role in proving innocence and overturning miscarriages of justice .
Earlier this year DNA was a vital factor in proving the innocence of Sean Hodgson , who spent nearly 30 years in prison for the death of a young woman in 1979 .
Through out the past several years of my fandom , I have seen a shift in the anime market from fans getting their video on TV and DVD to the underground world of online piracy and downloading .
After years of ignoring this audience shift and suffering the loss of DVD revenue because of it , the anime industry has finally embraced new technologies and began experimenting with new digital distribution systems over the internet .
That is why I claim that Spring 2009 will always go down as the “ Season of the Simulcast ” for anime .
But anime is not the only medium experimenting this season .
Within the past few weeks , the American manga industry has started claiming its own stake into the digital revolution .
A new series is being released in both Japan and America at the same time , and a new manga anthology is set to be available exclusively online .
And all of these new developments have come much to the surprise of this blogger and industry analyst , because unlike anime , I have not seen the manga industry suffer at the hands of the internet .
That ’s not to say that there is n’t piracy of manga .
In this day and age , everything is pirated on the internet .
But while I witnessed almost all my friends turn to the internet to get their anime fill , I ’ve only seen a few of my fellow fans download illegal “ scanlations ” of manga off of the internet .
And even out of those fans , most of them still turned to legally store - bought manga as their primary source of entertainment .
In an interview from March 2008 with the Anime Today podcast , Del Rey ’s Associate Publisher Dallas Middaugh noticed this difference between the two markets as well .
“ When it comes to watching anime , my experience is that fans are okay with a lower quality version of the anime if they could get it for free .
When it comes to manga , the experience of reading manga on screen is not the same as the experience of reading the book .
While for some people it ’s good enough , I think for the majority of people , it ’s not .
Clearly it ’s just a very different thing from anime . ”
So Dallas was n’t sweating over piracy , and why should he – or anyone in the manga industry – worry about it ?
In March of 2008 , everything was looking pretty good .
According to IC v2 trade reports , the US manga industry has been a hot booming market in the 21st century .
Ever since they started keeping tabs of the market in 2002 , manga sales had been increasing year - after - year .
But there was trouble in paradise in 2008 .
In June , the once leading manga publisher Tokyopop announced major cutbacks and internal restructuring within the company .
At the last New York Comic Con , IC v2 reported that 2008 saw the first ever decline in the manga market .
Sales dropped 17 % to bring the industry back to 2005 numbers .
So what happened ?
The IC v2 analysts cited several reasons for the decline .
They said that Cartoon Network cutting back on anime programing was affecting the manga market .
They claimed that Kurt Hassler leaving his post as head buyer at Borders to jump - start his own Yen Press publishing company lead to manga ’s decline in bookstores .
Hell , they even believed that American teenage girls were too busy swooning over the pretty boys of Twilight in 2008 to be swooning over the pretty boys of manga .
But the one thing that the analysts did n’t cite in their report was that piracy was taking a bite into the market .
While I have controversially come out in saying that piracy is killing the anime industry , I do completely agree with ICv2 and Dallas Middaugh that the manga industry does n’t have to worry about it .
What saves manga from the dreaded monster that has consumed her sister ?
Well , along with Middaugh ’s assessment that reading manga on a computer is a poor substitute to reading it on paper , I believe that the “ scanlation ” process of pirating manga is not as easy or well established as the fansubbing process of anime .
While digitally fansubbing anime is simply the best method of distributing anime globally , scanlating manga is such a pain in the ass to do .
First , the pirate would need to physically remove the binding and then scan each page of the comic one - by - one into the computer .
Then he has to remove the original text , translate it , and then go through the proper lettering procedure to ensure that the new English text will fit within the allowed space .
On the reader ’s side , they ’re not getting a book when they download the scanlation .
They ’re getting a directory of image files that are hopefully organized by file name .
It ’s up to the downloader to find his own method of reading the image files in a legible and chronological way .
It takes more skill and tolerance to pirate manga .
Add this to the fact that there are way more books being published in Japan than there are scanlators volunteering to do it , and you find that there are huge limitations in this underground system of distribution .
This is much like how the hassles of fansubbing on VHS restricted that piracy ’s impact on anime until broadband and digital fansubbing eased up the procedure .
If piracy is not easy to do , it will not overtake the mainstream legal distribution system .
But while analysts are n’t concerning themselves with piracy in manga , the decline in sales from 2008 has apparently caused some concern within the industry .
Viz Media , the largest manga publisher in America , has taken it upon themselves to experiment with some new distribution methods that could best be described as ways to combat piracy .
Viz has already been dealing with digital distribution with many of their Shonen Jump anime titles , most notably with their active simulcast of the very popular Naruto series .
But at the start of April , Viz began the first ever “ manga simulcast ” with Rumiko Takahashi ’s brand - new manga series Rin-ne .
The same day that a new chapter is released in Weekly Sunday magazine in Japan , an English translated version appears on their website for American audiences to read .
I found that the Flash - based manga reader that Viz was using for their weekly Rin-ne chapters to be very easy to use and read on my computer .
Their method of translation and online presentation is far more organized and professional than scanlated manga .
And then last week , Viz announced that it was ceasing publication of its Shojo Beat anthology and replacing it with a new online anthology , Ikki , using the same Flash reader they used with Rin-ne .
Why Viz is doing this is beyond me , but I must say , I am glad to see one company taking some initiative in adapting the medium and embracing new technologies .
That was a lesson that the anime industry failed to accept until companies started dropping like flies .
Viz is taking a preemptive strike , and I ’m glad they are doing it .
Where is this technology heading ?
What role will manga hold in the digital revolution ?
Personally , as a member of the “ internet generation ” , I ’d be okay with giving up paper for electronic manga viewing , especially if it comes at a much lower cost .
My bookshelf has gotten way overfilled with all these comic books , and it ’s a nightmare to move my collection from one location to another .
But I want to still be able to read manga in bed right before going to sleep , or on a long bus ride into the city .
That is why I wish Viz or any manga publisher would seriously consider putting their Japanese titles onto a portable electronic device .
The Amazon Kindle would be an excellent place to start .
The device uses a black - and - white “ e- ink ” screen that does n’t glow like a computer or cell phone , so it is easier on the eyes like real paper .
The blank - and - white nature of manga makes it ideal for the e-ink , and when Sony was showing off its own e-reader device years ago , they used to demo the unit with the Tokyopop OEL manga Peach Fuzz .
And with Amazon introducing the new , extra large Kindle DX unit , it will be even easier to read these comics on the electronic device .
Another feature that Kindle specifically brings to the table is its wireless delivery technology .
The device does n’t require a computer , it uses cell phone signals to download its content from the internet .
Not only does this make it easy to browse and buy books right on the device , but it allows you to “ subscribe ” to any kind of periodical and have it regularly downloaded onto the Kindle .
Hell , even this very blog is currently available for wireless delivery on the device .
I think this new technology is the direction that the industry should be embracing and promoting .
Would n’t it be nice to subscribe to a service that delivers new chapters from Viz ’s Ikki or Yen Press ’s Yen + anthology right into your hand every week ?
It eliminates the cost of printing and physical delivery .
And because the Internet is global , a Japanese company could just translate new manga in house from Japan and sell it in the US without worrying about working with a US team .
But this is all just a dream of a tech - savvy manga fan .
In reality , manga does n’t really need to reinvent itself in the modern era as paper has done quite well for itself so far in the 21st century .
But a hiccup in sales this past year has provoked the leading publisher in the industry to test out the waters of digital distribution .
I believe ( and hope ) that these innovations will bring with it a brand new way for us all to enjoy one of our favorite mediums .
Newfound Moon May Be Source of Outer Saturn Ring

NASA 's Cassini spacecraft has found within Saturn 's G ring an embedded moonlet that appears as a faint , moving pinprick of light .
Scientists believe it is a main source of the G ring and its single ring arc .
Cassini imaging scientists analyzing images acquired over the course of about 600 days found the tiny moonlet , half a kilometer ( about a third of a mile ) across , embedded within a partial ring , or ring arc , previously found by Cassini in Saturn 's tenuous G ring .
The finding is being announced today in an International Astronomical Union circular .
Images can be found at http://www.nasa.gov/cassini
http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov and http://ciclops.org
" Before Cassini , the G ring was the only dusty ring that was not clearly associated with a known moon , which made it odd , " said Matthew Hedman , a Cassini imaging team associate at Cornell University in Ithaca , N.Y .
" The discovery of this moonlet , together with other Cassini data , should help us make sense of this previously mysterious ring .
"
Saturn 's rings were named in the order they were discovered .
Working outward they are : D , C , B , A , F , G and E .
The G ring is one of the outer diffuse rings .
Within the faint G ring there is a relatively bright and narrow , 250 - kilometer - wide ( 150 - miles ) arc of ring material , which extends 150,000 kilometers ( 90,000 miles ) , or one - sixth of the way around the ring 's circumference .
The moonlet moves within this ring arc .
Previous Cassini plasma and dust measurements indicated that this partial ring may be produced from relatively large , icy particles embedded within the arc , such as this moonlet .
Scientists imaged the moonlet on Aug. 15 , 2008 , and then they confirmed its presence by finding it in two earlier images .
They have since seen the moonlet on multiple occasions , most recently on Feb. 20 , 2009 .
The moonlet is too small to be resolved by Cassini 's cameras , so its size cannot be measured directly .
However , Cassini scientists estimated the moonlet 's size by comparing its brightness to another small Saturnian moon , Pallene .
Hedman and his collaborators also have found that the moonlet 's orbit is being disturbed by the larger , nearby moon Mimas , which is responsible for keeping the ring arc together .
This brings the number of Saturnian ring arcs with embedded moonlets found by Cassini to three .
The new moonlet may not be alone in the G ring arc .
Previous measurements with other Cassini instruments implied the existence of a population of particles , possibly ranging in size from 1 to 100 meters ( about three to several hundred feet ) across .
" Meteoroid impacts into , and collisions among , these bodies and the moonlet could liberate dust to form the arc , " said Hedman .
Carl Murray , a Cassini imaging team member and professor at Queen Mary , University of London , said , " The moon 's discovery and the disturbance of its trajectory by the neighboring moon Mimas highlight the close association between moons and rings that we see throughout the Saturn system .
Hopefully , we will learn in the future more about how such arcs form and interact with their parent bodies .
" Early next year , Cassini 's camera will take a closer look at the arc and the moonlet .
The Cassini Equinox mission , an extension of the original four - year mission , is expected to continue until fall of 2010 .
The Cassini -Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the Cassini - Huygens mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed , developed and assembled at JPL .
The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute , Boulder , Colo .
spank me baby , it ’ll bring us closer
BDSM was considered a pathology for many years .
A recent study proves otherwise .
So a chemist , a film and television expert , and a psychologist walk into an S&M club to watch couples play a little rough …
No , that ’s not the beginning of a joke but an actual , honest to goodness study about the relationships of couples which practice a variety of sadomasochistic activities .
And as it turns out , bondage and domination can bring couples closer together provided that both partners enjoyed themselves .
This sounds like a no brainer at first , but we have to consider how S&M play was originally perceived by psychology .
Until the late 1980s , sadomasochism was always viewed as a psychosexual disorder and doctors saw all relationships which included bondage , domination , consensual pain and power exchange as pathological .
The third edition of the Diagnostic Statistical Manual , or the DSM III , labeled pretty much all kinds of sadomasochistic activities as proof that the patient had a sexual dysfunction to be treated .
But a number of research projects started finding that relationships in which S&M play was a form of intimacy , were n’t actually as uncommon or as rough as most early treatises on sexual health had assumed and that sadomasochism was enjoyed by many people in stable partnerships , with good education and perfectly normal childhoods .
As the researchers try to politely note , the original ideas of BDSM in general were based more on the societal opinions of the enthusiasts than factual evidence .
Now , just watching S&M enthusiasts enjoying themselves is more of a fun Friday night than an actual research project which is why the researchers analyzed the production of testosterone and the stress hormone cortisol in those who engaged in bondage , spanking , power exchange and pain and pleasure routines .
Their findings were a little surprising .
Instead of both partners reacting to the stress of the activities with extra testosterone and cortisol , only the submissive men and women registered a hormonal reaction .
The dominant partners maintained the same baseline levels before and after their S&M play .
On the psychological end of the study , the men and women who said that their experience that night went well , reported that they felt closer to their partners and were happier with the relationship than those who were left unsatisfied .
So in other words , a good night of consensual masochism brings a couple closer together says the study ’s conclusion .
And the survey data seems to support this idea .
But I wonder if that ’s really so .
Usually , the main component in S&M play is the trust .
Couples in the lifestyle have a lot of faith in their partners and for that to happen , they generally need to be close and have a good baseline level of relationship happiness before experimenting with S&M , bondage or power exchanges .
If the experience is a letdown , it ’s a disappointment for both the dominant partner ( the top ) and the submissive ( the bottom ) and can be seen as a breach of the trust that got them to agree to the experiment or even suggest it in the first place .
But even though it ’s disappointing , it does n’t mean that it leaves a permanent mark on the relationship .
The disappointment might last a day or two and closeness can come from other activities both partners enjoy .
Provided that this study was a convenience sample of 58 people over one night and recorded their impressions for that one night only , you might not want to rush to the S&M club nearest to you in hopes of repairing wounded relationships with a little rough play just yet .
Unless your partner suggests it of course , and you ’re into the idea …

BY MOST measures , Nicolas Sarkozy ought to be having a good recession .
Long before the crash came , the French president had called for an end to capitalist excess , appeals that were mocked at the time but now seem prescient .
Tighter bank regulation and a more interventionist state à la française are both back in vogue .
The government has not ( yet ) had to rescue any big French bank .
French people are not personally much in debt .
True , France 's economy has been battered , but less so than most of its neighbours ' .
The Paris - based OECD expects GDP to shrink by 3.3 % this year , compared with 3.7 % in Britain and 5.3 % in Germany .
Yet French voters are in a volatile mood and Mr Sarkozy is surprisingly unpopular at home .
Indeed , the president 's ratings slipped by another two points to 36 % in April , according to TNS - Sofres 's monthly poll .
He got only a small boost after the G20 summit in London , even though the French press interpreted it as a Franco - German success .
His numbers are hovering at a level far below the heights of popularity that he enjoyed during his first six months in office in 2007 .
In one recent poll , more respondents expressed confidence in the ability of the trade unions than of Mr Sarkozy to soften the impact of the recession .
More crushing still , a poll this week that showed Mr Sarkozy shedding six further points placed at the top of its popularity list none other than Mr Sarkozy 's predecessor , Jacques Chirac .
How to explain this ?
One reason is absolute economic performance .
With the evening news every day reporting job losses and factory closures , it is little consolation for the French to learn that their economy is not shrinking as fast as Germany's .
People may not have hefty mortgages or huge unpaid credit - card bills .
But the impact of the global downturn is still being keenly felt .
Unemployment is once again the voters ' biggest concern ; the jobless rate reached 8.6 % in February , well above the European Union average .
There is outrage that ordinary workers are paying with their jobs even as France has its own fat - cat pay scandals , such as the 180 % salary rise , to an annual € 1.3 m , enjoyed by Jean - François Cirelli , a former government adviser who is now vice - president of GDF - Suez , an energy giant .
Voters gave Mr Sarkozy some credit for his initial handling of the financial crisis .
But as recession has taken hold , disappointment has set in .
They have trouble reconciling the image of their action - man president with his apparent impotence in the face of a global crisis .
It is not for his want of trying .
The president vowed to save a Caterpillar machinery factory in Grenoble and a Continental tyre plant in Picardy ; the government wants to keep Heuliez , a car - parts maker employing 1,000 workers , in business .
Yet voters have grown wary of promises , partly because Mr Sarkozy makes more than he can keep .
Last year , when Arcelor - Mittal announced the closure of part of a steel factory in Gandrange , in eastern France , he rushed to the scene and promised to keep it open — only for the company to close it anyway , with the loss of 575 jobs at the site .
Another explanation is that Mr Sarkozy no longer dominates international diplomacy in the way he did when France held the European Union presidency in the second half of 2008 .
The French liked the way their hyperactive president was constantly in the thick of diplomatic action , strutting from Georgia to the Middle East and making France count again in the world .
Even now , polls show that voters approve of the way Mr Sarkozy defends French interests abroad , though most remain doubtful that he can do much to save jobs at home .
A further factor is a generally tense mood around the country .
The voters do not blame this entirely on Mr Sarkozy , but it does not help to inspire confidence in him .
That the French like taking to the streets , often being transported to their capital in coaches hired by unions , is hardly new .
There have been two days of massive street protests and strikes this year , one drawing as many as 3 m people across the country .
For the first time on May 1st , Labour Day , all the main trade unions have called for a joint day of action .
The numbers can be impressive .
But the government treats most organised , orderly protests as a normal , even useful , way to vent frustration .
It is the hardening of more sporadic protests that has prompted greater concern .
Examples include an outbreak of kidnapping — or “ bossnapping ” — of company bosses , held by workers in their offices overnight .
Student protests have closed some universities , with lectures cancelled , for weeks on end .
Fishermen this week blockaded the ports of Boulogne , Calais and Dunkirk with boats and barricades of burning tyres .
None of these incidents is related .
But they all seem legitimate in voters ' eyes : 64 % of respondents to one poll say that the perpetrators , including bossnappers , should not be punished .
Above all , there is a worry that the slightest provocation could turn things much nastier .
Henri Guaino , one of Mr Sarkozy 's aides in the Elysée , said on television recently that “ the political risk is very high , the risk of violence , of revolt , is very great ” .
With a nod to the Jacquerie uprising of 1358 , Nicolas Baverez , an economic commentator , calls this the exception française .
France responds badly to economic shocks , he argues , partly because of a lack of civic institutions below the state .
That helps to explain why direct action is so popular , and why protests become radical more quickly than in other countries .
The government is bracing itself for a difficult spring , the traditional season of French discontent .
One consolation for Mr Sarkozy is that voters find the main opposition no more credible .
The Socialists are as divided as ever , even under their new leader , Martine Aubry .
Ségolène Royal , the party 's defeated presidential candidate in 2007 , continues to prance about as if on the campaign trail .
If any opposition party does well in the European elections in June , it will be François Bayrou 's centrists or Olivier Besancenot 's anti-capitalist hard - left group , not the Socialists .
There is perhaps one other crumb of comfort for the president .
Mr Sarkozy may not be popular but he is still far above the depths plumbed by Mr Chirac .
In 2006 , as student protests spread around the country , Mr Chirac 's poll rating collapsed to a pitiful 16 % .
Mr Sarkozy has quite a way to go before he sinks that low .
Nestled in the mountains of Las Sendas in east Mesa , a builder and buyer are collaborating on an 18,000 - square - foot home that will be one of the largest in the Valley to rely almost exclusively on solar energy .
Built with a panoramic view of the Valley , the $ 4 million home is located at the Peaks , a multimillion - dollar neighborhood .
The custom home is expected to be finished by summer and will include nearly 140 solar panels that will provide 70 percent of the home 's power .
The panels will be recessed into the roof so they do not distract from the design , a concern for some homeowners .
" Almost every home we 've done over the past two years relies on solar electricity , " said Tom Fitzgerald , who owns Belmont Homes in Mesa .
His company has built six homes , averaging $ 3 million , and he now is tapping into the solar business with a new company called Solar Energy of Arizona , a solar installation and consulting business for residential and commercial properties .
Chen Liu , who is buying the four - bedroom mansion with a guesthouse , could potentially become Salt River Project 's largest residential applicant to benefit from the utility company 's EarthWise Solar Incentive Program , said Chico Hunter , an SRP engineer .
" Having customers like this is an example of how our program is encouraging the local solar industry and helping our customers who do solar , " he said .
The Liu home will be powered by a 20.16 - kilowatt system .
Currently , the largest home that SRP services is a 20.08 - kilowatt system in Florence , Hunter said .
Most homes with a solar system have a capacity of 4 to 9 kilowatts .
Hunter said if a customer needs more energy than is produced from the solar system , he or she can purchase additional energy from SRP .
But whatever energy that 's not used can be sold back to SRP or used as credit toward the next billing cycle .
Liu 's home could potentially become self - sufficient .
Installing solar panels on roofs is not new , but looking for ways to be energy - efficient has become popular .
" It 's growing very quickly , especially here in the Southwest because of how much sun we have , " said Greg Pitz , a Tempe - based solar architect hired to design the system .
To purchase and install a solar system is costly and could start at $ 28,000 for a 4 - kilowatt system , depending on the usage and size of the home , Hunter said .
Liu , who is buying the home , is looking to receive an estimated $ 120,000 in local and federal incentives for installing the solar system .
He also is considering using geothermal energy to heat the home 's pool .
This will be the second home in Las Sendas for the Liu family , which includes his wife and two children .
Building an energy - efficient home is a natural step for him , considering his line of work , Liu said .
He runs Sunrise Lighting in Gilbert , an 11 - year - old company that manufactures and distributes compact fluorescent light bulbs , which can save up to 75 percent of energy use .
" So anything related to energy savings , I 'm interested , " Liu said .
We 'll dismantle wildcat West Bank settlements - but only if ' legal ' ones can stay , claim Israelis
Israel would dismantle nearly two dozen wildcat outposts in the West Bank if the U.S. drops its objections to existing , government - backed settlements , officials said .
Defence Minister Ehud Barak will bring the new proposal to senior American officials during his visit to Washington next week , according to Israeli sources .
If approved , demolition would begin in the next few weeks .
Palestinian labourers work on a construction site in the West Bank Jewish settlement of Maale Adumim : The Israeli government is determined some developments should stay
The move follows President Barack Obama 's demands that all settlements be stopped during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
But Netanyahu has defied that demand since returning from the States last week , saying his government will continue to build homes in existing settlements .
Under the terms of the U.S. - backed ' road map ' plan for Mideast peace , Israel is to both take down the outposts and halt building in existing settlements .
But it has flouted those obligations since the road map was signed in June 2003 .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is to meet Obama at the White House on Thursday and Ahmed Qureia , the chief Palestinian negotiator , said the demand for a complete settlement freeze will be the main issue .
' Any attempt to manoeuver on the implementation of the road map regarding settlement activities is unacceptable , ' Qureia said .
' What does a peace process mean when settlements are continuing on the Palestinian territories ?
' What we want is to immediately dismantle all settlement outposts and to stop what is called the natural growth in the settlements , and to stop all settlement activities . '
Other settlements , however , would be demolished : At Maoz Esther , a hilltop site northeast of Ramallah , residents retrieve what they can from the rubble after demolition by Israeli troops
Abbas has said there is no point to meeting with Netanyahu unless he freezes settlement construction and agrees to open negotiations on Palestinian independence .
Netanyahu has agreed to renew talks , but has resisted U.S. pressure to voice support for Palestinian statehood .
The U.S. considers the settlements - home to nearly 300,000 Israelis - obstacles to peace because they are built on captured territory the Palestinians claim for a future state .
Israel 's Defence Minister Ehud Barak is expected to make new proposals when he visits Washington
But Netanyahu and Barak both say the 121 existing settlements must be allowed to expand for ' natural growth , ' the ill - defined term Israel uses for population growth in the settlements .
U.S. policy and the road map specifically oppose settlement expansion to account for natural growth .
The wildcat outposts are a peripheral part of Israel 's West Bank settlement enterprise because only a few thousand people live there , generally in tents or mobile homes .
But these communities , set up to extend Israel 's hold on West Bank land , have become a rallying point for settlers and their supporters and a bone of contention for Palestinians .
Several have turned into full - fledged settlements .
Settlers have put up an estimated 100 outposts since the early 1990s without government authorisation but with the knowledge of an array of government officials .
Under the road map , some two dozen are to be torn down .
Netanyahu has clashed with members of his hawkish Cabinet in recent days over dismantling that smaller number of outposts , signaling the internal difficulties he would face if he tries to take stiffer action against settlement construction .
He has said he will not tolerate unauthorised construction , but some of his coalition allies do n't want the outposts knocked down .
Barak , the official authorized to order outpost demolitions , has taken little action against the outposts since becoming defence minister two years ago .
PARIS  A former Guantánamo detainee , an Algerian given a new home in France , is contending that he was interrogated at the Cuban detention center for 16 straight nights in 2003  from midnight until 5 a.m. , at least  and that he was force - fed through a nasal tube for more than two years when he went on a hunger strike .
The Algerian , Lakhdar Boumediene , 43 , is the only Guantánamo detainee that President Nicolas Sarkozy of France has agreed to accept so far to help the Obama administration close the detention center .
Mr. Boumediene was captured in 2001 in Bosnia and handed over to American officials .
He was kept at Guantánamo from January 2002 until May 15 of this year as terrorism suspect No. 10005 , when he was released and put aboard a plane to France .
He was kept under observation in a French military clinic until Monday , when he emerged and told some of the details of his story to The Washington Post and Le Monde , which published them on Tuesday .
No. 10005 “ was my name there , ” he said .
“ That ’s what they called me .
Never Lakhdar or Boumediene , ” he told Le Monde .
Why must your seat be returned to the upright position ?
What happens to all the stuff confiscated by security officials ?
Here are answers to all your burning questions about air travel .
1. Why Must Your Seat Be Returned to the Upright Position ?
" Put your seat in the upright position , make sure any carry - on luggage is placed under the seat , and stow away your tray table . " 
Why does any of this matter ?
Note that these instructions pertain specifically to the period during which the aircraft is either taking off or landing .
Should an emergency occur during either of these times , passengers often have a good chance of survival if they evacuate the plane immediately .
Milliseconds count in these situations , so passengers are naturally in a rush when finding their way to an emergency exit .
Coach passengers know how difficult squeezing out of a seat mid-flight just to get to the lavatory can be ; now imagine that the cabin is filled with smoke and visibility is near zero .
Reclined seats , extended table trays and briefcases in the aisle will cause already panicked folks to stumble and fall and hamper the evacuation process .
2. What Happens to Items Confiscated by Security Officials Prior to Boarding ?
It depends upon individual airline policy .
If there is enough time left before boarding , passengers usually have the option of packing the forbidden item into their checked luggage or running outside to stash it in their car .
If time has run out for that solution , passengers can request that the airline send the item to " lost and found "  so they can claim it upon their return .
However , there are no guarantees that they 'll be reunited with their keepsake .
The majority of confiscated items ultimately end up in an industrial - sized incinerator or trash compactor .
These days , the most common items accidentally left behind at airport screening terminals are personal computers .
Security regulations require that they be removed from their cases for inspection , and many harried travelers simply grab the empty case as they rush to catch a plane .
Denver International Airport once posted " Got Laptop ? "  reminder signs after they collected 95 of the devices in only 30 days .
3. Where Do Airport Codes Come From ?
Some airport codes are easy enough to decipher ; Boston is BOS , Miami is MIA , and Salt Lake City is SLC .
But what about some of the more unusual codes ?
Why is Chicago ORD and New Orleans MSY ?
The names become less mysterious if you know some history about the airports .
For example , before Chicago 's airport was named after Butch O'Hare , it was called Orchard Airport .
New Orleans ' code is derived from the property 's original purpose " “ Moisant Stock Yards .
The FAA began to issue three - letter identifying codes to airports back in the early 1930s .
The oldest airports were simply designated by their official weather station code , with the letter " X "  added to the end .
So the Los Angeles Airport became LAX , Phoenix was PHX , and so on .
Incidentally , that tiny sand dune in Kitty Hawk where the Wright Brothers made their first flight has its own location identifier : FFA , for First Flight Airport .
4. What Are the Hottest Selling Items at Airport Shops ?
Sometimes it 's a regional thing .
Miami International is the nation 's largest airport retailer of Spanish - language books .
Decorative Western saddles ( which sell for upwards of $ 2,000 each ) are very popular with international travelers who pass through Dallas / Ft. Worth International .
But in 2006 one particular item was selling out at airport newsstands across the country : mechanical pencils .
Closer study revealed that the pencil passion was caused by the Sudoku craze .
Passengers liked to fritter away their flying time with the popular number puzzles , and most airplanes do n't come equipped with pencil sharpeners .
5. Are Pilots Allowed to Chat ?
A " sterile cockpit "  has nothing to do with the cleanliness of the flight crew .
Sterile cockpit is an FAA rule that requires pilots to refrain from non-essential conversation during critical phases of flight ( usually any time below 10,000 feet ) .
Airline pilots like to chit - chat while on the job just like anyone else .
It 's only natural that a task they perform thousands of times becomes automatic and a little gossip while breezing through them would make the process less mundane .
However , prior to take - off , the FAA prefers that cockpit personnel have their minds 100 % on the task at hand .
Any extraneous conversation could conceivably distract the crew and ultimately cost lives .
Take , for example , Delta Flight 1141 .
According to the CVR , prior to takeoff , a flight attendant stepped inside the cockpit , and the group proceeded to discuss their favorite cocktails and the dating habits of other employees while simultaneously running the pre-flight checklist .
The NTSB determined that the crew was distracted and failed to properly configure the flaps and slats , which caused the plane to crash shortly after takeoff .
6 . When Did Airports Beef Up Security ?
Airport security was virtually non-existent until a rash of hijackings occurred in the early 1970s .
In December 1972 , the FAA issued an ultimatum : all U.S. airports had one month to install the necessary equipment and procedures to ensure that each and every passenger and bag would be properly screened .
The first metal detectors used at most airports were large , clumsy devices called magnetometers .
These machines were originally designed for the logging industry .
( If a piece of metal is present in a log , it can severely damage the saw , so the magnetometer was devised to prevent saw mill shutdowns . )
Unlike the door - frame design of today 's metal detectors , the original magnetometers were tunnels about five feet long .
Passengers walked up one ramp to enter the device , and down another to exit .
7. What 's So Bad About Living Near an Airport ?
( You Know , Besides the Noise and Traffic . )
Just like prisons and meat processing plants , airports suffer from " Not In My Backyard "  syndrome .
However , it 's not just the noise and traffic that make living near an airport undesirable ; the construction of an airfield can actually change an area 's weather patterns .
Because expansive areas of land have to be flattened out , the surrounding tracts may suddenly become more susceptible to fog .
The miles of pavement necessary for taxiways and runways can also change drainage patterns , which may lead to problems with flooding and soil erosion .

Floods and mudslides from months of heavy rains in northern Brazil have driven more than 186,000 from their homes , killed at least 19 people and cut off shipments from a huge Amazon iron mine , according to officials .
Television footage showed the rooftops of houses poking out of inundated towns and people using boats to move around in their cities .
Mudslides swamped homes and forced residents to move in with relatives and pack into emergency shelters .
Globo TV's G1 website reported that three more people died in a mudslide in Bahia state , south of the main zone of devastation , but authorities did not immediately confirm the deaths .
At least seven states , most in the Amazon region , have been affected by the rains , which have battered the region for several months , regional civil defence departments said .
Worst - hit is the state of Maranhao along the Atlantic coast and south of the mouth of the Amazon river .
Maranhao civil defence official Abner Ferreira said six major highways have been swamped , cutting off thousands of people and leaving lines of stranded cargo trucks .
The rains also prompted the temporary closure of a railway that takes iron ore from the sprawling Carajas mine in the neighbouring jungle state of Para .
Iron ore , the main ingredient in steel , is shipped overseas from Sao Luis , the state capital of Maranhao .
The railway also transports 1,300 people per day , and G1 reported that service should be restored within two days .
Vale is the world 's second largest mining company and the planet 's biggest iron ore producer .
Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva flew over the hardest - hit areas , delivered food baskets to shelters , met with local officials and promised aid to repair infrastructure .
He also voiced concerns that global climate change could be responsible for the unusually heavy rains and destruction .
" We need to look more seriously into the climate situation these days , " said Silva .
" Something is changing and we still have time to fix it . "
Brazil 's health ministry said it would send an emergency shipment of 265,000 doses of medicine to Maranhao to prevent possible outbreaks of intestinal diseases caused by contaminated floodwaters .
Ferreira said meteorologists forecast at least another two more weeks of heavy rains in northern Brazil .
Floods and mudslides late last year in the southern state of Santa Catarina killed more than 100 people , displaced some 80,000 and set off a round of brutal looting in a devastated port city by people desperate for drinking water and food .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Five U.S. soldiers were killed Friday in a suicide bombing in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul -- the single deadliest attack on U.S. troops in more than a year , the U.S. military said .
A suicide truck bomber breached the outer security barrier of Iraqi National Police headquarters in southern Mosul , and detonated his explosives , killing eight people and wounding 60 others , an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said .
A U.S. soldier was also among the wounded , the U.S. military said .
The ministry said those killed include five Americans , two Iraqi policemen and an Iraqi soldier .
At least two individuals suspected of being involved in the attack were detained , the U.S. military said .
It is the deadliest attack on U.S. forces since March 10 , 2008 , when five U.S. soldiers were killed in a suicide attack in Baghdad .
Despite a number of military operations in this volatile city during the past year , Mosul remains one of the most violent places in Iraq .
Last year the U.S. military said Mosul was the last urban stronghold of al Qaeda in Iraq .

U.S. and Iraqi military forces plan to pull out of Mosul to allow Iraqi police to control security in the city .
But police are not quite ready yet , according to an Iraqi general .
" We need to bring the police to the required level .
The deadline is the end of July , and it's not enough time to prepare the police , " said Gen. Hassan Karim , commander of Nineveh operations for the Iraqi army .
" ( That ) means we 'll need U.S. forces to stay in Mosul . "

Advertisement Pakistan's PM says he has ordered the army to " eliminate militants and terrorists " , apparently referring to operations against the Taleban .
Yusuf Raza Gilani made the announcement in an evening TV address to the nation .
Fighting has intensified in recent days in the Swat Valley and other parts of the north - west , and thousands of civilians are leaving the area .
Meanwhile US envoy Richard Holbrooke said there had been progress in getting Pakistan and Afghanistan to co-operate .
" I hope the American public sees that we 're making progress in the question for real cooperation between Afghanistan and Pakistan , because without that cooperation , success is not achievable , " Reuters news agency quoted him as saying .

Mr Holbrooke was speaking after a meeting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai , Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and US senators .
He said another summit would be held between the Afghan and Pakistani leaders and US President Barack Obama after Afghan presidential elections in August .
The three leaders met on Wednesday .
Mr Zardari said the international community was coming to the realisation that the problem of militancy in Pakistan and Afghanistan was a worldwide one .
Earlier US defence secretary Robert Gates said he was satisfied with Pakistan 's anti-Taleban moves .
He said there was " very little chance " of the Taleban achieving the kind of success in Pakistan that they would need to get access to the country 's nuclear weapons .
At least 10 soldiers have been killed and nine wounded in the fighting in the past 24 hours , the Pakistani military says .

At least seven of them were reported to have died when a troop carrier was ambushed near Mingora .
Appeal for help
The time has come when the entire nation should side with the government and the armed forces against those who want to make the entire country hostage and darken our future at gunpoint
Yusuf Raza Gilani
In pictures : Swat exodus Disquiet over ' Af - Pak ' strategy Mr Gilani said efforts by the militants to disrupt peace and security had reached a point where the government had to take " decisive steps " .
" In order to restore honour and dignity of our homeland , and to protect people , the armed forces have been called to eliminate the militants and terrorists , " he said .
" The time has come when the entire nation should side with the government and the armed forces against those who want to make the entire country hostage and darken our future at gunpoint , " he added .
He also appealed to the international community to help Pakistan look after people displaced by the fighting .
A curfew has been lifted to allow civilians to leave Swat , prompting thousands to flee and join those already in camps or staying with relatives further south .
But around half a million people remain in Mingora , the main town of Swat , where there is no water or electricity .
Residents say at least 24 civilians have lost their lives in the past two days .
Some died when their houses were hit by artillery , while others were reportedly shot for defying a curfew .
The BBC Urdu service 's Riffatullah Orakzai says that eyewitnesses in the Kanju area near Mingora have seen militants setting up checkposts on the main roads and not allowing people who want to flee the fighting to pass .
Witnesses say a large number of people , including women and children , are now stranded there .
Resistance to troops The International Committee for the Red Cross ( ICRC ) says the humanitarian crisis in Pakistan is intensifying .
In a statement the ICRC said that it no longer had access to the areas most affected by the conflict and that precise statistics of the displaced were difficult to ascertain .
The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says troops moving into Swat face resistance all along the 40 km ( 25 - mile ) road that heads in a north - easterly direction from Malakand to Mingora .
Our correspondent says that fighting has not only erupted in several areas around Mingora , but there are also reports of more clashes in the neighbouring area of Buner .
In another incident , militants overran a paramilitary fort in the Chakdara area of Lower Dir , officials say .
Three paramilitary soldiers were killed in the attack and 10 policemen were taken away as hostages .

Bill Gates once derided open source advocates with the worst epithet a capitalist can muster .
These folks , he said , were a " new modern - day sort of communists , " a malevolent force bent on destroying the monopolistic incentive that helps support the American dream .
Gates was wrong :
Open source zealots are more likely to be libertarians than commie pinkos .
Yet there is some truth to his allegation .
The frantic global rush to connect everyone to everyone , all the time , is quietly giving rise to a revised version of socialism .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .

Communal aspects of digital culture run deep and wide .
Wikipedia is just one remarkable example of an emerging collectivism — and not just Wikipedia but wikiness at large .
Ward Cunningham , who invented the first collaborative Web page in 1994 , tracks nearly 150 wiki engines today , each powering myriad sites .
Wetpaint , launched just three years ago , hosts more than 1 million communal efforts .
Widespread adoption of the share - friendly Creative Commons alternative copyright license and the rise of ubiquitous file - sharing are two more steps in this shift .
Mushrooming collaborative sites like Digg , StumbleUpon , the Hype Machine , and Twine have added weight to this great upheaval .
Nearly every day another startup proudly heralds a new way to harness community action .
These developments suggest a steady move toward a sort of socialism uniquely tuned for a networked world .
We 're not talking about your grandfather 's socialism .
In fact , there is a long list of past movements this new socialism is not .
It is not class warfare .
It is not anti-American ; indeed , digital socialism may be the newest American innovation .
While old - school socialism was an arm of the state , digital socialism is socialism without the state .
This new brand of socialism currently operates in the realm of culture and economics , rather than government — for now .
The type of communism with which Gates hoped to tar the creators of Linux was born in an era of enforced borders , centralized communications , and top - heavy industrial processes .
Those constraints gave rise to a type of collective ownership that replaced the brilliant chaos of a free market with scientific five - year plans devised by an all - powerful politburo .
This political operating system failed , to put it mildly .
However , unlike those older strains of red- flag socialism , the new socialism runs over a borderless Internet , through a tightly integrated global economy .
It is designed to heighten individual autonomy and thwart centralization .
It is decentralization extreme .
Instead of gathering on collective farms , we gather in collective worlds .
Instead of state factories , we have desktop factories connected to virtual co-ops .
Instead of sharing drill bits , picks , and shovels , we share apps , scripts , and APIs .
Instead of faceless politburos , we have faceless meritocracies , where the only thing that matters is getting things done .
Instead of national production , we have peer production .
Instead of government rations and subsidies , we have a bounty of free goods .
I recognize that the word socialism is bound to make many readers twitch .
It carries tremendous cultural baggage , as do the related terms communal , communitarian , and collective .
I use socialism because technically it is the best word to indicate a range of technologies that rely for their power on social interactions .
Broadly , collective action is what Web sites and Net - connected apps generate when they harness input from the global audience .
Of course , there 's rhetorical danger in lumping so many types of organization under such an inflammatory heading .
But there are no unsoiled terms available , so we might as well redeem this one .
When masses of people who own the means of production work toward a common goal and share their products in common , when they contribute labor without wages and enjoy the fruits free of charge , it 's not unreasonable to call that socialism .
In the late '90s , activist , provocateur , and aging hippy John Barlow began calling this drift , somewhat tongue in cheek , " dot-communism . "
He defined it as a " workforce composed entirely of free agents , " a decentralized gift or barter economy where there is no property and where technological architecture defines the political space .
He was right on the virtual money .
But there is one way in which socialism is the wrong word for what is happening :
It is not an ideology .
It demands no rigid creed .
Rather , it is a spectrum of attitudes , techniques , and tools that promote collaboration , sharing , aggregation , coordination , ad hocracy , and a host of other newly enabled types of social cooperation .
It is a design frontier and a particularly fertile space for innovation .
Socialism : A History Thomas More 's Utopia Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason First US commune Marx & Engels ' The Communist Manifesto International Workingmen 's Association Bolshevik Party elects Lenin Russian Revolution Stalin consolidates power State - run health care in Saskatchewan Cuban Revolution Che Guevara executed Salvador Allende deposed Usenet Mikhail Gorbachev 's glasnost Soviet Union dissolves Linux 1.0 Venezuela elects Hugo Chavez Blogger.com Google : 1 billion indexed pages Wikipedia Brazil elects Lula da Silva Public Library of Science Digg Amazon 's Mechanical Turk Twitter Facebook : 100 million users US allocates $ 700 billion for troubled mortgage assets YouTube : 100 million monthly US users
In his 2008 book , Here Comes Everybody , media theorist Clay Shirky suggests a useful hierarchy for sorting through these new social arrangements .
Groups of people start off simply sharing and then progress to cooperation , collaboration , and finally collectivism .
At each step , the amount of coordination increases .
A survey of the online landscape reveals ample evidence of this phenomenon .
I. SHARING
The online masses have an incredible willingness to share .
The number of personal photos posted on Facebook and MySpace is astronomical , but it 's a safe bet that the overwhelming majority of photos taken with a digital camera are shared in some fashion .
Then there are status updates , map locations , half - thoughts posted online .
Add to this the 6 billion videos served by YouTube each month in the US alone and the millions of fan - created stories deposited on fanfic sites .
The list of sharing organizations is almost endless :
Yelp for reviews , Loopt for locations , Delicious for bookmarks .
Sharing is the mildest form of socialism , but it serves as the foundation for higher levels of communal engagement .
II .
COOPERATION
When individuals work together toward a large - scale goal , it produces results that emerge at the group level .
Not only have amateurs shared more than 3 billion photos on Flickr , but they have tagged them with categories , labels , and keywords .
Others in the community cull the pictures into sets .
The popularity of Creative Commons licensing means that communally , if not outright communistically , your picture is my picture .
Anyone can use a photo , just as a communard might use the community wheelbarrow .
I do n't have to shoot yet another photo of the Eiffel Tower , since the community can provide a better one than I can take myself .
Thousands of aggregator sites employ the same social dynamic for threefold benefit .
First , the technology aids users directly , letting them tag , bookmark , rank , and archive for their own use .
Second , other users benefit from an individual 's tags , bookmarks , and so on .
And this , in turn , often creates additional value that can come only from the group as a whole .
For instance , tagged snapshots of the same scene from different angles can be assembled into a stunning 3 - D rendering of the location .
( Check out Microsoft's Photosynth . )
In a curious way , this proposition exceeds the socialist promise of " from each according to his ability , to each according to his needs " because it betters what you contribute and delivers more than you need .
Community aggregators can unleash astonishing power .
Sites like Digg and Reddit , which let users vote on the Web links they display most prominently , can steer public conversation as much as newspapers or TV networks .
( Full disclosure : Reddit is owned by Wired 's parent company , Condé Nast . )
Serious contributors to these sites put in far more energy than they could ever get in return , but they keep contributing in part because of the cultural power these instruments wield .
A contributor 's influence extends way beyond a lone vote , and the community 's collective influence can be far out of proportion to the number of contributors .
That is the whole point of social institutions — the sum outperforms the parts .
Traditional socialism aimed to ramp up this dynamic via the state .
Now , decoupled from government and hooked into the global digital matrix , this elusive force operates at a larger scale than ever before .
III .
COLLABORATION
Organized collaboration can produce results beyond the achievements of ad hoc cooperation .
Just look at any of hundreds of open source software projects , such as the Apache Web server .
In these endeavors , finely tuned communal tools generate high - quality products from the coordinated work of thousands or tens of thousands of members .
In contrast to casual cooperation , collaboration on large , complex projects tends to bring the participants only indirect benefits , since each member of the group interacts with only a small part of the end product .
An enthusiast may spend months writing code for a subroutine when the program 's full utility is several years away .
In fact , the work - reward ratio is so out of kilter from a free - market perspective — the workers do immense amounts of high - market - value work without being paid — that these collaborative efforts make no sense within capitalism .
Adding to the economic dissonance , we 've become accustomed to enjoying the products of these collaborations free of charge .
Instead of money , the peer producers who create the stuff gain credit , status , reputation , enjoyment , satisfaction , and experience .
Not only is the product free , it can be copied freely and used as the basis for new products .
Alternative schemes for managing intellectual property , including Creative Commons and the GNU licenses , were invented to ensure these " frees . "
Of course , there 's nothing particularly socialistic about collaboration per se .
But the tools of online collaboration support a communal style of production that shuns capitalistic investors and keeps ownership in the hands of the workers , and to some extent those of the consuming masses .
The Old Socialism The New Socialism Authority centralized among elite officials Power distributed among ad hoc participants Limited resources dispensed by the state Unlimited , free cloud computing Forced labor in government factories Volunteer group work a la Wikipedia Property owned in common Sharing protected by Creative Commons Government - controlled information Real - time Twitter and RSS feeds Harsh penalties for criticizing leaders Passionate opinions on the Huffington Post IV .
COLLECTIVISM
While cooperation can write an encyclopedia , no one is held responsible if the community fails to reach consensus , and lack of agreement does n't endanger the enterprise as a whole .
The aim of a collective , however , is to engineer a system where self - directed peers take responsibility for critical processes and where difficult decisions , such as sorting out priorities , are decided by all participants .
Throughout history , hundreds of small - scale collectivist groups have tried this operating system .
The results have not been encouraging , even setting aside Jim Jones and the Manson family .
Indeed , a close examination of the governing kernel of , say , Wikipedia , Linux , or OpenOffice shows that these efforts are further from the collectivist ideal than appears from the outside .
While millions of writers contribute to Wikipedia , a smaller number of editors ( around 1,500 ) are responsible for the majority of the editing .
Ditto for collectives that write code .
A vast army of contributions is managed by a much smaller group of coordinators .
As Mitch Kapor , founding chair of the Mozilla open source code factory , observed , " Inside every working anarchy , there 's an old - boy network . "
This is n't necessarily a bad thing .
Some types of collectives benefit from hierarchy while others are hurt by it .
Platforms like the Internet and Facebook , or democracy — which are intended to serve as a substrate for producing goods and delivering services — benefit from being as nonhierarchical as possible , minimizing barriers to entry and distributing rights and responsibilities equally .
When powerful actors appear , the entire fabric suffers .
On the other hand , organizations built to create products often need strong leaders and hierarchies arranged around time scales :
One level focuses on hourly needs , another on the next five years .
In the past , constructing an organization that exploited hierarchy yet maximized collectivism was nearly impossible .
Now digital networking provides the necessary infrastructure .
The Net empowers product - focused organizations to function collectively while keeping the hierarchy from fully taking over .
The organization behind MySQL , an open source database , is not romantically nonhierarchical , but it is far more collectivist than Oracle .
Likewise , Wikipedia is not a bastion of equality , but it is vastly more collectivist than the Encyclopædia Britannica .
The elite core we find at the heart of online collectives is actually a sign that stateless socialism can work on a grand scale .
Most people in the West , including myself , were indoctrinated with the notion that extending the power of individuals necessarily diminishes the power of the state , and vice versa .
In practice , though , most polities socialize some resources and individualize others .
Most free - market economies have socialized education , and even extremely socialized societies allow some private property .
Rather than viewing technological socialism as one side of a zero - sum trade - off between free - market individualism and centralized authority , it can be seen as a cultural OS that elevates both the individual and the group at once .
The largely unarticulated but intuitively understood goal of communitarian technology is this : to maximize both individual autonomy and the power of people working together .
Thus , digital socialism can be viewed as a third way that renders irrelevant the old debates .
The notion of a third way is echoed by Yochai Benkler , author of The Wealth of Networks , who has probably thought more than anyone else about the politics of networks .
" I see the emergence of social production and peer production as an alternative to both state - based and market - based closed , proprietary systems , " he says , noting that these activities " can enhance creativity , productivity , and freedom . "
The new OS is neither the classic communism of centralized planning without private property nor the undiluted chaos of a free market .
Instead , it is an emerging design space in which decentralized public coordination can solve problems and create things that neither pure communism nor pure capitalism can .
Hybrid systems that blend market and nonmarket mechanisms are not new .
For decades , researchers have studied the decentralized , socialized production methods of northern Italian and Basque industrial co-ops , in which employees are owners , selecting management and limiting profit distribution , independent of state control .
But only since the arrival of low - cost , instantaneous , ubiquitous collaboration has it been possible to migrate the core of those ideas into diverse new realms , like writing enterprise software or reference books .
The dream is to scale up this third way beyond local experiments .
How large ?
Ohloh , a company that tracks the open source industry , lists roughly 250,000 people working on an amazing 275,000 projects .
That 's almost the size of General Motors ' workforce .
That is an awful lot of people working for free , even if they 're not full - time .
Imagine if all the employees of GM were n't paid yet continued to produce automobiles !

ALBUQUERQUE , May 27 ( UPI ) -- New Mexico authorities say a 7 - year - old girl drove her father 's Jeep in an attempt to get help after he was ejected in a rollover crash east of Clovis .
Elizabeth Kazza got about three miles from the crash site when a motorist spotted her trying to drive the wrecked Jeep and stopped to help , the Albuquerque Journal reported Wednesday .

" It 's remarkable anybody could drive after something like that , " State Police Capt .
Jimmy Glascock said .
Authorities say the girl 's father , Guillermo Montes , 40 , was speeding and lost control of his Jeep Cherokee going into a turn Saturday night .
Elizabeth and her 3 - year - old brother were unrestrained in the Jeep at the time of the crash , Glascock said .
They told investigators Montes had driven to Clovis to buy beer and was drinking while heading back to his home in Bovina .
The children were treated for minor bumps and bruises .
Montes was pronounced dead at the scene .
Alan Shearer last night admitted that there are " huge problems " within Newcastle United and called for " big changes " to be made in the wake of yesterday 's relegation to the Championship .
Newcastle 's temporary manager gave no assurances that he plans to remain in charge following the end of his eight - game reign but revealed he will hold talks with Mike Ashley this week when he will discuss his own position and also urge the club 's embattled owner to oversee an extensive overhaul at St James ' Park .
Shearer made no excuses after Damien Duff 's own goal condemned Newcastle to defeat at Aston Villa and a return to ­English football 's second tier , alongside ­Middlesbrough and West Bromwich Albion , for the first time since 1993 .
The former Newcastle striker claimed that ­everyone , from those at involved boardroom level to the players and the four managers who have taken charge at St James '
Park at various stages of this season , had to accept a share of the blame for failure .
With Hull City losing at home to Manchester United on an afternoon when all four relegation - threatened clubs failed to pick up a point , a draw would have been enough to preserve Newcastle 's top - flight status but a toothless second - half ­performance at Villa Park was emblematic of their dreadful season .
" I said to the players that workrate - wise I can't really fault you .
But the simple fact of the matter is that inside the dressing room it has n't been good enough , " said a crestfallen Shearer .
" I include myself in that , Joe [ Kinnear ] , Chris [ Hughton ] , Kevin [ Keegan ] and Mike [ Ashley ] . "
" We have not been relegated today , " Shearer added .
" We have been relegated over the whole season because we have n't been good enough .
We have n't given those magnificent supporters enough to shout about .
We have let them down .
It 's a football club I love .
You 've seen what it means to our fans .
I am hurting .
I am raw inside .
But the simple fact is that big mistakes have been made and we 're now paying the price for that . "
Shearer claimed that he has had little time to consider whether he would like to continue in the job full - time and it appears that much could depend on the responses he receives when he sits down with Ashley and Derek Llambias , the chairman , to discuss a plan to revive Newcastle 's fortunes .
" There are a ­million questions that need to be answered , " he said .
" A hell of a lot needs to change .
Players need to go , players need to come in and those guys [ Ashley and Llambias ] need to decide where the football club is going to go . "
The former England captain made no attempt to paper over the cracks .
" There are huge problems at the football club , " he added .
" It 's not just about today .
It 's gone on this season , last season , four ­seasons ago .
It 's the culmination of ­everything .
Decisions need to be made sooner or later whoever it is [ in charge ] because , forgive the expression , but every day that goes by another room is burned down and ­everyone gets a head start on the football club .
I 'll give my opinion and it's up to [ Ashley and Llambias ] where they want to go . "
There is little doubt that the supporters are behind Shearer , who walked over to applaud the vociferous travelling ­contingent at the final whistle .
It was notable that not every Newcastle player did the same and , without naming individuals , Shearer admitted that some of the squad had underperformed this season .
" I said to them in the dressing room that I 'm not sure that everyone has played to their maximum this year for whatever reason .
But I take my share of the blame .
I accepted the eight - week job thinking that I could get the results . "
The scorelines elsewhere could not have gone better for Newcastle , with Hull , Sunderland and Middlesbrough all losing .
Ricky Sbragia resigned from his post as Sunderland manager immediately after defeat by Chelsea , while Phil Brown , whose side were beaten by a Darron Gibson goal , sympathised with Shearer 's plight .
" Do I have some sympathy for Alan Shearer ?
Of course I do , " said the Hull manager .
" I have empathy for any manager who gets relegated .
It 's gone to the wire .
He 's given it his best shot but unfortunately he has failed . "
Shearer , in truth , was not looking for any words of consolation .
The Newcastle manager admitted that Villa 's goal , which arrived after Duff diverted Gareth Barry 's wayward 30 - yard shot beyond Steve Harper , was " cruel " but said that no one at St James '
Park could feel any grievance with the chastening final outcome .
" In the end , the three worst teams deserve to go down .
We can't complain about today .
I had a sneaky feeling that Manchester United would go to Hull and win but we could n't do our job and that sums the ­season up . "
This view has won support from some people who might be expected to see executive power in more expansive terms .
Earlier this year , Jeffrey Immelt , the beleaguered successor to Jack Welch as CEO of General Electric , rather defensively told a gathering sponsored by the Financial Times that in the 1990s , “ anyone could have run GE and done well . ”
Warming to his theme , he added , “ Not only could anyone have run GE in the 1990s , [ a ] dog could have run GE .
A German shepherd could have run GE . ”
Welch , to his credit , more or less agreed with this assessment .
“ It was an easier time to be a CEO in the 1990s , ” he told the FT .
“ The wind was on our backs . ”
As they say on Wall Street , never confuse brains with a bull market .
One problem with the idea of the transformative CEO , able to reshape corporate culture or inspire workers to new heights , some scholars argue , is that people simply do n’t feel allegiance to large entities like corporations , no matter who ’s at the helm .
Their loyalties are far more localized .
Like infantrymen , their sense of belonging extends to their own platoon but no farther .
And in these postmodern times , employees are mostly scornful of any grandiose rhetoric about higher purposes and the nobility of their cause .
From this perspective , the CEO ’s power to affect performance , while strong within the immediate team of top executives , rapidly diminishes as it extends beyond that team .
J. Richard Hackman , a psychologist at Harvard , has done extensive work on leadership within small teams , and he has found that leaders do exert measurable influence on their team ’s success or failure .
In his 2002 book , Leading Teams : Setting the Stage for Great Performances , he argues that small groups perform best when they operate collaboratively , and not merely as drones subordinated to a leader .
The team leader ’s job is to establish the conditions that enable team members to collaborate competently ; the leader needs to spell out exactly where teams should end up , but not dictate the step - by - step process of getting there .
Leaders who act boldly and intelligently can make significant differences in teams ’ effectiveness — but no matter how the leaders act , teams become less effective as they grow in size .
Ideal team size , Hackman says , is about six people ; performance problems increase exponentially as team size increases beyond that , and the impact of leadership becomes quickly diffused .
The highly localized nature of loyalty , some scholars argue , means that the real power to influence corporate performance resides not with the CEO but with middle management .
In the recently published The Truth About Middle Managers , Paul Osterman , a professor at MIT ’s Sloan School of Management , contends that middle managers are neither “ victims , ” robbed of the ability to act independently by some faceless bureaucracy , nor “ villains ” like Dilbert ’s Bozo - haired boss , too clueless to do anything but gum up the works .
In Osterman ’s view , the middle manager is the secret hero in the large corporation ’s rise to social and economic dominance .
That rise “ depended on middle managers , ” he says , “ because you just could n’t achieve the scale that we have without people doing the kind of planning work that they do . ”
As “ craft workers , ” middle managers value their task , sense its importance to the larger cause , and feel great loyalty to the people they work with .
But their loyalty to the corporation is fraying , largely because they see top management hogging all the rewards and glory .
“ There ’s more cynicism ” in the middle - management ranks now , Osterman says .
“ There ’s less willingness to go the extra mile . ”
Perhaps to ask whether the CEO really matters is to ask the wrong question .
Three Harvard professors — Noam Wasserman , Bharat Anand , and Nitin Nohria — say in a recent paper that the right question is , When does leadership matter ?
Using advanced statistical techniques that go by a wonderfully CSI - style name , “ variance decomposition analysis , ” the authors examine 531 companies in 42 industries and isolate leadership effects from other determinants of corporate performance .
They conclude that leadership matters sometimes .
It does n’t make much difference at electrical - utility companies , which are so constrained by government regulations and the cost of fuel that there ’s very little room for the CEO to exercise any discretion .
The professors used the term “ Titular Figureheads ” for such CEOs .
In addition to utilities , you ’ll find them in stable , old - line industries — paper mills , meat wholesalers — where the pace of change is slow .
Drupal is one of the most popular CMSs out there , and it ’s no surprise considering how extensible it is .
You can customize almost every aspect of it through the use of themes , plugins , and a little custom coding .
Below are more than 150 resources to help you do just that , from themes to plugins to examples of sites running on Drupal .

Blondine Savoie , a fish plant worker in remote Pokemouche , N.B. , starts her first shift of the season this week to sort and clean snow crab .
If the catch is generous this year , Savoie , 48 , will likely work a total of 14 weeks .
The other 38 weeks , she will support herself with Employment Insurance .
Sartaj Teeth spent two years working as a machine operator at the Progressive Moulded Products Ltd. plant in Vaughan .
He was laid off in March when the auto - parts factory unexpectedly shut down .
Despite the thousands of hours the Etobicoke resident had worked , he was awarded only 28 weeks of EI .
His benefits ran out in December .
Both Savoie and Teeth completed the minimum hours needed to qualify for benefits .
They both paid into the weekly insurance premiums on every paycheque .
So why the 10 - week difference in their payout ?
It comes down to geography .
Under the current system , access to EI , how quickly you get it , and how long you have it for , depends on the unemployment rate of the region you live in .
The lower the unemployment rate in your region , the more hours of work needed to qualify .
In Toronto , workers need between 595-700 hours to be eligible .
In areas of high unemployment , the qualifying conditions drop to 420 hours , allowing more people access to EI with fewer hours of work .
Historically , the theory behind the system made sense .
Where there is low unemployment , there should naturally be an abundance of jobs .
But as job losses mount in Toronto and manufacturing jobs become obsolete , this no longer holds true .
Full - time work is being replaced by temporary , contract , part - time , and self - employed work – jobs that normally do n't fit well under the current EI rules .
So , unemployed workers across the GTA , who have contributed into the system for years , are now losing out when they need it the most .
Last month , just 23 per cent of unemployed workers in Toronto received benefits , compared with 31 per cent in Ontario , and 44 per cent nationwide .
In Quebec , New Brunswick and Newfoundland , the numbers were significantly higher – 56 , 90 and 99 per cent coverage , respectively .
" I tried to find out why there is this inconsistency , " said Teeth , when he realized how little he would be getting .
" But after a few months , I stopped asking .
I felt like I was begging for money .
It 's against my principles . "
The biggest problem , said Teeth , is a lack of transparency .
" You do n't know how they calculate your hours , how they process your case .
Why is it different for everyone ? "
Even more maddening for Teeth , was the variation within his company .
One of his co-workers received 38 weeks of benefits when she was laid off last July .
Others , he heard , got 43 weeks .
This regional discrepancy in EI allocation has become a hot - button issue in Ottawa – with opposition parties threatening to make it an election issue .
Calls for reform are getting louder , backed by a national consensus among unions , academics , economists and provincial politicians that the current system is in need of an overhaul .
All three opposition parties are demanding uniform countrywide requirements of 360 hours – around 10 weeks – to qualify , and benefits extending up to 50 weeks for all workers .
That change , Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff has said , would provide coverage to an additional 150,000 unemployed workers .
But last week , Stephen Harper rejected the Liberal proposal , arguing that any changes to EI would come with payroll increases .
Moreover , the Tories say they have already helped address the problem by offering a 5 - week extension of benefits to those on EI .
But that 's a handout 75 per cent of Torontonians can't tap into because they do n't qualify , or have already used up their benefits before the policy came into place March 1 .
It is not going to get better anytime soon , said Michael Mendelson , a senior scholar with the Caledon Institute of Social Policy , as more workers turn to non-traditional jobs to help them through the downturn .
In Pokemouche , work is inconsistent , said Savoie .
Some days , she spent 12 hours at the plant .
Often , weeks go by without a call .
As work dwindles , so has optimism .
" We are a depressed area , " she said .
Savoie moved back from Moncton to live with her mom .
She has no doubt , one day she will be forced to move again .
" To tell you the truth , there are no more fish left in the ocean , " she said .
Savoie spends the year scrounging up enough work between the local snow crab plant and a herring processing plant to make up her best 14 weeks to put toward EI .
Her region is one of 23 across the country , where the Best 14 weeks pilot project was implemented in 2005 , allowing workers to submit the best 14 of 52 weeks .
Elsewhere in the country , EI is calculated using the average earnings over the past 26 weeks – a formula critics say discriminates against workers with irregular jobs , since they often work reduced hours or part - time .
Labour advocates are pushing to see this changed so benefits can be calculated based on the best 12 weeks of earning from the previous 26 weeks .
To Savoie , Toronto seems like the land of opportunity , a place where if one looked hard enough there is always a job available .
" If I was in Toronto , I would work at the local Tim Hortons , " she said .
Carla Chavarria , a laid off sewing machine operator , has tried just that .
She was laid off from Cases Unlimited last June and has been unable to find permanent work since .
She works a month here and there , in hopes of extending her EI as long as she can .
She knows the likelihood of landing full - time work is slim .
So she 's re-training , polishing up her English , and hoping to launch a second career in early childhood education .
But at 44 , she admits it 's not easy to start over .
Teeth is equally frustrated .

He has sent out dozens of resumés to temp agencies since December .
A doctor in India , Teeth landed work as a baker for a few days last month .
Now he is working part time at the PMP Job Action Centre as a peer helper , making $ 160 a week , guiding others just like him through the EI process .
" I have to survive somehow , " he said .
It 's hardly enough , but it is reliable .
He is hopeful by the time he finds a permanent job , Ottawa will have taken action on fixing EI .
" We are the workers of this country , " he said passionately .
" We are willing to work hard .
We have put our money into the system .
It is the government 's turn to pay us back . "

DETROIT 
In better times , many employees of General Motors called their company “ Generous Motors ” because of its rich benefits .
Now G.M. may stand for something else : Government Motors .
The latest plan for the troubled automaker , which is expected to file for bankruptcy by Monday , calls for the Treasury Department to receive about 70 percent of a restructured G.M .
Including the more than $ 20 billion that has already been spent to prop up G.M. , the government will provide G.M. at least $ 50 billion to get the company through Chapter 11 , people with direct knowledge of the situation said Tuesday .
By some estimates in Detroit , tens of billions beyond that amount may be required .
The United Automobile Workers , meanwhile , will hold up to 20 percent through its retiree health care fund , and bondholders and other parties will get the remaining share .
Shareholders would be virtually wiped out .

No details of the soldier detained after the shooting were given A US soldier has shot dead five of his colleagues at a base in the Iraqi capital Baghdad , the Pentagon says .
Two other people were hurt in the shootings and the gunman is in custody , Pentagon officials have said .
An earlier military statement said the incident had happened at Camp Liberty near Baghdad 's international airport at about 1400 ( 1100 GMT ) .
The White House said US President Barack Obama was shocked by news of the " terrible tragedy " .
The president planned to discuss it with Defense Secretary Robert Gates , said spokesman Robert Gibbs .
Any time we lose one of our own , it affects us all
Colonel John Robinson
US army spokesman
The shooting reportedly occurred at a clinic where troops receive help for personal issues or combat stress .
It is not the first time a US soldier has opened fire on comrades in recent years .
One soldier was sentenced to death in 2005 after killing two officers and wounding 14 other personnel with grenades and a rifle at a camp in Kuwait .
' Terrible tragedy '
The BBC's Natalia Antelava , in Baghdad , says troops at Camp Liberty had been enjoying a much more relaxed atmosphere in recent months .
She says there have been few attacks on the base recently , so the timing of the shooting will make it particularly shocking to the soldiers there .
It is the deadliest single incident involving US forces since 10 April , when five soldiers were killed by a truck bomb in the northern city of Mosul .
" Any time we lose one of our own , it affects us all , " said military spokesman Colonel John Robinson .
" Our hearts go out to the families and friends of all the service members involved in this terrible tragedy . "
Earlier this month , a man in an Iraqi army uniform shot dead two US soldiers and injured three others at a base near Mosul .
Iraqi military reports said he was a soldier also working as an imam at a mosque on the base .
US forces are due to withdraw combat troops from Iraq by August 2010 .

NEW DELHI 
The governing coalition led by the Indian National Congress sailed to a surprisingly decisive victory in India ’s grueling parliamentary elections , vaulting Manmohan Singh , a soft - spoken economic reformer , to a second term as prime minister , and sweeping away the prospect of political instability in the world ’s most populous democracy .
Mr. Singh , 77 , called the victory “ a massive mandate ” on Saturday afternoon , hours after the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party conceded defeat .
The victory , in what is apparently a Congress landslide , signals the possibility of a stable and strong government in the face of stiff challenges : a sharp slowdown in economic growth , abiding poverty and instability in the region .
It also sidelines a slew of small , regional party bosses whose influence had steadily grown in Indian national politics , and potentially cuts down the power of Communists who had blocked economic reforms for most of Mr. Singh ’s first five - year term .
The Congress Party ’s showing vindicates the prime minister ’s efforts to deepen a strategic partnership with the United States at a time when the Obama administration is deeply concerned about security in the region , chiefly in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
A stronger government will also be better able to tackle issues of crucial importance to Washington , from economic reforms to climate change , although there is not necessarily agreement with the Americans on how to proceed .
Are you bored with keeping tabs of your carbon emissions ?
NEC and BIGLOBE have developed a system that not only performs this odious task , but makes it " fun " to do so -- if you 're generous as to what constitutes " fun . "
A WiFi-enabled device is attached to your circuit breaker , where it keeps track of your power consumption and later transmits it to your home computer via ZigBee .
The data is then sent to a website , where you can use it to play games against other green households in such thrilling arenas as Carbon Diet ( users score " eco-points " with which they can purchase virtual soil , water , flowers and grass ) and Carbon Ball , in which Dung Beetles compete to see who can travel the farthest , with distance being determined by -- you guessed it -- how well the user reduces power consumption .
But that ain't all -- the system also keeps tabs on daily and hourly energy consumption , your rank in comparison with other households , and more .
A three - month trial service is underway in the homes of 100 NEC employees , after which the companies will analyze the data and develop a business model for unloading this bad boy on local governments and the private sector .
One more pic after the break .

( How else are they gonna be able to ' win ' elections at this point ? )
Brad Friedman Byon 5/9/2009 , 4:35 pm PT
Ca n't tell you how sick I am of the GOP 's ACORN nonsense , having long ago exhausted myself in debunking the entire GOP scam to try and use the group as a stalking horse to support their own insidious efforts at imposing polling place Photo ID restrictions in hopes of doing nothing more than keeping 20 to 30 million legal , largely Democratic - leaning voters from being able to cast their legal votes , because they do n't own the type of ID that would be required to vote under these draconian , unnecessary , Jim Crow disenfranchisement laws .
But , as a quick perusal of recent ' Daily Voting News ' articles will show , efforts are still being doubled , and redoubled , by the GOP in state legislatures across the country in hopes of passing such restrictions into law .
It seems these laws , meant to combat non-existent " voter fraud , " are the Republicans ' last , best hope to be able to actually " win " elections at all these days .
So , with all of that in mind ... here 's the latest AP report on charges filed against ACORN workers in PA on Thursday , for falsifying voter registration forms .
As I replied to the person who sent me the link , please note in the poorly reported story : " There 's no evidence anybody voted illegally or was denied a vote because of the scam . "
Further , " the scam " was carried out by workers , in violation of ACORN 's policies ( akin to workers at Wal - Mart stealing items off the shelf --- you 'd hardly charge Wal - Mart with " theft " in that incident ) , and was discovered , in no small part , because ACORN themselves alerted authorities to " the scam , " and cooperated with law enforcement in helping to bring charges against the fraudsters .
Of course , that has n't stopped Fox " News " from " reporting " the story as if ACORN themselves ( versus their workers ) had been charged .
ACORN workers " registered some 38,000 new voters in southwestern Pennsylvania ... last year " , according to the AP article .
The charges now filed against 6 state workers ( out of the group 's 13,000 employees nationwide ) involve 51 registration cards suspected of having been forged by the workers .
And , again : " There 's no evidence anybody voted illegally or was denied a vote because of the scam . "
The ACORN thing is indeed a " scam , " but not the one that the AP report --- and the GOP and Fox " News " opportunists hoping to use it to disenfranchise voters --- paint it as .
Readers of The BRAD BLOG likely already know all of the above .
And so it bores me no end to have to keep pointing it out and re-reporting the same idiocy over and over again .
But as the democracy - haters have n't given up on their insidious nonsense , I guess I have little choice but to keep pointing it out from time to time .

Sometimes big movie production companies decide that they'd be better off not showing a movie in advance to the critics .
They know that the reviews would probably do more harm than good .
Looking back on the the Darwinius affair , I 'm starting to wonder if the unveiling of this fossil was stage - managed in the same way .
I only started looking into the story after observing all the bizarre publicity around it .
And as I 've probed this strange media event , I 've gotten some interesting information from reporters who were on the Darwinius beat .
It makes for a disturbing timeline : May 10 : The Daily Mailgets wind of the fossil and the show that will be broadcast about it .
Ann Gibbons , a Science correspondent , wants to get her hands on the paper .
" I struggled in vain all last week to get a copy of the article , " she emailed me this morning .
PLOS will not give her the paper , which will not be published until May 19 , the same day as a major press conference on the fossil .
May 15 : The Wall Street Journalgets a fairly long interview with one of the co-authors of the Darwinius paper ( who apparently thought the conversation was off the record ) May 16 : Gibbons , having failed to get the paper from PLOS , convinces the producers of the the documentary on Darwinius , Atlantic Productions , to give it to her .
In order to get it , she signs a non-disclosure form agreeing not to show it to anyone until 10:30 am on May 19 , the day of the press conference .
But she does not get the paper until Monday .
May 18 : Gibbons finally gets the paper Monday afternoon , the day before the press conference .
But she can not show it to any experts due to her non-disclosure agreement .
May 19 : At 10:40 am , I ( and many other reporters ) get a press release from PLOS about Darwinius .
The press release has a link that lets us download the paper , and there is no embargo on it .
In other words , we can start writing about it right away .
But the email arrives right before the press conference at the American Museum of Natural History where Darwinius is unveiled to a swarm of reporters .
The web is almost immediately flooded with reports on Darwinius , based only on the press conference .
As the day progresses , I am puzzled by the lack of outside commentary in articles on Darwinius .
The articles I encounter only have quotes from the co-authors of the paper saying how important it is , and television producers telling us how this is going to change everything .
( On a related note , the sky is still blue today . )
Not realizing the kind of constraints reporters like Gibbons were under , I decide to get in touch with experts myself and see what they think .
Short answer : cool fossil , not a " missing link , " and a paper with some shortcomings .
In the comments section of my own post , AP science reporter Malcolm Ritter had this to say today :
As the reporter who covered this story for The Associated Press , I ’d like to point out two things :
1 . Major journals generally make upcoming papers available to reporters a few days ahead of publication so we can get independent comment for our stories .
But PLoS ONE withheld the Darwinius paper until 10 minutes after the Hurum press conference began ( judging by the time stamp on the PLoS email to me ) .
So reporters had nothing to show outside experts to solicit some perspective before Hurum et al. started talking .
2 . Carl , you said you never found a news story that had comments from independent experts .
I ’m not sure when you checked , but my story quoting both Beard and Fleagle went out at 4:40 p.m .
( It replaced a preliminary version that I ’d written off the press conference .
I ’d contacted both men beforehand an arranged to speak after we ’d all seen the paper ) .
Indeed , by the time Malcolm updated his article , I had given up hope of finding comments from indepentent experts and was doing my own blogging .
I apologize for implicitly kicking dirt on the work of Ritter and other diligent journalists .
So , to recap : it appears that both PLOS and Atlantic Productions did not give journalists any time to consult with outside experts before launching a major press conference with a huge blitz of media attention .
In other words , science writers who were trying to do their job well and responsibly were actively hindered .
Those who declared ridiculous things , such as claiming that human origins were now solved once and for all , were not .
I have a hard time even imagining how this behavior could be justified .
I 've sent emails to the contacts listed in the PLOS press release on Darwinius both at PLOS and Atlantic Productions to ask why they took this course of action .
I 've yet to get a response .
Update # 1 : This article in the Australian was brought to my attention after I published this post , with quite a quote from co-author Phil Gingerich : " There was a TV company involved and time pressure .
We 've been pushed to finish the study .
It 's not how I like to do science . "
Update # 2 : Peter Binfield from PLOS has responded :
I am the Managing Editor of PLoS ONE .
This paper was originally submitted to us on March 19th 2009 and underwent appropriate scrutiny by an Academic Editor ( named on the published article ) and three expert peer reviewers .
Peer review comments were returned to the authors who revised their paper accordingly and the paper was ultimately accepted on May 12th 2009 .
These dates are available on the paper itself .
Once the paper was accepted we made a strenuous effort to publish the article in time for the Press Conference which was happening on May 19th - only a week later .
We were not involved in the Press Conference , but felt it was clearly in the public interest to have the article publicly available in time for that conference .
Our production team managed to get the article published more than two weeks quicker than normal , so that it would be ready for the 19th .
However , it was only on the afternoon of the 18th May that we knew the paper would definitely be available in time and until that point , no final copy of the paper was available .
We do regularly help PLoS ONE authors with the distribution of press releases under an embargo , as do many other journals , but when we do this we only ever issue that information on a date that is acceptable to the authors .
The authors of this paper requested that we did not issue a press release , or reveal any other information about this paper , until 10.30 EST on the 19th May ( the time of the press conference ) .
We respected their wishes , and at the time of publication also issued our own press release about this article .
We are delighted to have published this work , which has clearly captured the imagination and attention of researchers , the media and the public .
The paper has been discussed , scrutinized , praised and criticized , and is a terrific example of why open access to research is so beneficial .
I 'm curious what scientists , journal editors , reporters , and other readers think of Binfield 's response .
Other prominent journals do n't leave these matters up to the scientists ( or their television producer pals ) .
They inform the scientists of which issue a paper is scheduled for , and they put the paper on a press list a few days earlier .
Now , I know that PLoS ONE is unusual in a lot of ways .
For one thing , they do n't reject papers for not being of sufficient importance .
They state , " Judgments about the importance of any particular paper are then made after publication by the readership ( who are the most qualified to determine what is of interest to them ) . "
But does that mean they should also go along with an embargo from their authors that hinders good reporting on the papers ?
In any case , I have yet to hear from the television producers .
Given PLoS
One 's response , I 'm more curious than ever to hear from them .
Update # 3 ( Friday morning ) : Still no word from Atlantic Productions .
But , as a consolation prize , here 's quite a tale from journalist Mark Henderson of the Times of London ( Note : Atlantic Productions is based in Britain ) :
... the PLoS paper WAS made available under embargo to the press — but only to selected individuals and under very unusual restrictions .
I was invited to read it by Atlantic Productions on Tuesday morning ( I ’m Science Editor of The Times in London ) , but I had to go to their offices to read it and was n’t allowed to take a copy away .
I also had to sign a non-disclosure agreement , which meant I was n’t able to approach anyone else for comment until the embargo lifted .
The Guardian also had advance access ( they got to see more in advance than we did , and earlier ) .
So — obviously because they bought the film rights — did the BBC .
But other UK papers ( Independent , Telegraph etc ) got nothing .
This is a very weird ( and in my experience unprecedented ) way to manage the release of published science .
Update # 4 : Ann Gibbons sent in this point of clarification as a comment , but for some reason comments have stopped being posted .
( I 'm on it ...)
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Obama administration has informed a federal judge it will continue to invoke the " state secrets " privilege in a legal battle with an Islamic charity suspected of funding terrorism .
Attorney General Eric Holder has ordered a review of the government 's use of the " state secrets " privilege .
The United States has designated the Oregon - based al - Haramain Islamic Foundation as a terrorist organization .
The group , which has sued the government over alleged warrantless wiretapping , is demanding classified information about the program .
U.S. officials have refused to tell the charity 's lawyers whether the group was subjected to presidentially authorized , warrantless , foreign intelligence surveillance in 2004 and , if so , what information was obtained .
In a court document filed overnight in San Francisco and released early Saturday in Washington , the Justice Department said its case - by - case review of the government 's use of the state secrets defense has not changed its position in the al - Haramain case .
The defense allows courts to block lawsuits against the government on grounds that the litigation could harm national security .
" An additional review was conducted at the highest levels of the Department of Justice to determine whether continued invocation of the privilege was warranted , " the government told the court .
" Based on that review , it is the government 's position that disclosure of classified information ... would create intolerable risks to national security . "
The Obama administration has criticized President Bush 's Justice Department for invoking the state secrets defense too quickly .
Attorney General Eric
Holder has ordered a review to determine whether the government 's use of the state secrets privilege can be sharply narrowed .
The government brief , however , reveals the legal tool will continue to be used despite strong objections from civil liberties groups and their political allies .
" The government does not take this position lightly , " Justice Department lawyers told Judge Vaughn Walker , who has been unsympathetic to the government stance .
" An assertion of the state secrets privilege to preclude further litigation is an extremely significant step that requires in - depth consideration and debate at the highest levels of our government , " the Justice document says .
All sides acknowledge the importance of the case .
" The government recognizes that the underlying dispute in this case raises the fundamental separation of powers question concerning whether the court has the ultimate authority under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) to order the disclosure of state secrets to a private party over the government 's objections , " according to the justice filing .
The immediate issue is Walker 's May 22 order to show cause as to why the government should not be sanctioned for " failing to obey the court 's orders " to turn over classified information .
The government insists it has not yet received a direct court order to do that , and has only refrained from " agreeing " to do so .
The government vowed a swift appeal once it receives such an order .
The Obama administration argument concludes with a direct challenge to the judge " to recognize that the imposition of discovery sanctions is not a lawful , appropriate , or productive alternative . "
In 2007 the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a ruling by Walker in the same case in which he had rejected the government 's state secrets privilege .
The ruling , however , left unanswered whether the FISA law could preempt the state secrets privilege , so al - Haramain went back to court to continue the fight on that issue .

In various occasions I have been asked if " Perl 6 compiles programs into real executables " or so .
The answer so far has always been the same : Perl 6 is a language specification , and it's up to the implementations if they offer that option , it 's not a required feature .
But today I actually compiled a Perl 6 program into an executable , with Rakudo .
It 's not automated , so it takes a few steps , but it would be easy to wrap into a shell script or Makefile .
Here it goes :
$ cat hello.pl say " Hello , Perl people " ; $ ./ perl6 --target=PIR hello.pl > hello.pir $ ./ parrot / parrot -o hello.pbc hello.pir $ ./parrot/pbc_to_exe hello.pbc > hello $ file hello hello : ELF 64 - bit LSB executable , x86 - 64 , version 1 ( SYSV ) , dynamically linked ( uses shared libs ) , for GNU / Linux 2.6.8 , not stripped $./ hello Hello , Perl people
This is what the Parrot folks call a " fake executable " - it contains the byte code as a string , links to libparrot , and has a small main program that initializes parrot .
But hey , it 's an executable ;-)
Free food at work vanishes shortly after it is announced : reason enough not to waste time thinking about it .
The guy running in panel two is going for seconds .
Never forget that 's what you 're up against .
What a settlements freeze means , the likelihood of one being implemented , and the relevant actions that the Government of Israel can and should take .
Settlements in Focus
" How to Freeze Settlements : A Layman 's Guide "
( Vol. 5 , Issue 2 ) A publication of Americans for Peace Now
Q : In a recent op - ed in Haaretz newspaper , you called for a total freeze on settlement construction .
What did you mean ?
A total freeze on settlement construction means : no new construction or planning for construction in existing or new settlements .
It means no new construction contracts and no new construction tenders .
It means a freeze on all plans and contracts that are in the works or have already been approved .
It means the freezing or cancellation of projects that are already proceeding and compensation , as necessary , for third - parties .
It means freezing all policies and actions that enlarge the " footprint " of a settlement ( i.e. expand the amount of space it takes up on the ground ) , that increase the density of construction of a settlement , or that facilitate an increase in the population of a settlement .
Q : Is this actually possible ?
Can the Government of Israel completely freeze settlement activity ?
Yes .
The Government of Israel has the power to freeze all settlement activity .
Whether or not it freezes settlement activity is a question of political will , not legal authority .
Israel has never annexed the West Bank and Israeli law does not consider the West Bank to be part of Israel .
For an example of how Israeli lfaw views the West Bank , a 2004 Israeli High Court of Justice ruling on the legality of land seizures related to the construction of Israel 's separation barrier opened by stating as a given that " Since 1967 , Israel has been holding the areas of Judea and Samaria . in belligerent occupation . . "
As a corollary , Israeli law recognizes that all Israeli planning or construction in the West Bank has particular political , security and international significance .
Given this significance , Israeli planning and construction in the West Bank is not treated as just a technical or bureaucratic matter .
Rather , it requires the direct involvement of the political echelons of the Israeli government - primarily the Minister of Defense and sometimes the entire cabinet - which must sign off on every stage of a project 's progression .
The government thus has the power to stop signing off on new plans at various stages in the process , as well as to prevent implementation of plans that have already been approved .
( For a detailed examination of Israeli planning policy in the West Bank , see Btselem 's excellent report : Land Grab ) .
Q : How can the Government of Israel stop new settlements from being established ?
This is the easiest of all of the elements of a settlement freeze .
Establishing a new settlement in the West Bank requires the approval of the Government of Israel , in the form of a cabinet resolution .
According to an official cabinet decision , adopted by the government of Binyamin Netanyahu in 1996 , Israel will not establish any new settlement , unless officially decided by the cabinet .
However , while no new settlements have been officially approved in almost two decades , on the ground new settlements have proliferated throughout this period .
These have been in the form of :
the approximately 100 " illegal outposts " - each representing a new settlements established without the necessary government approvals , but often with the assistance and collusion of Israeli authorities ( as documented in the 2005 Sasson Report ) ; re-cycled sites in the West Bank - like Maskiyot in the Jordan Valley , where a disused military base is being transformed into a new permanent civilian settlement ; new " neighborhoods " of existing settlements that are actually located far from the original settlement ( and in reality are new , independent settlements ) ; and new tourist sites , agriculture fields and groves cultivated by settlers , and other settler - serving infrastructure , all of which enlarged the territory controlled by Israel and made off - limits to Palestinians in the West Bank .
Each of these " exceptions " to the " no new settlements " policy of successive Israeli governments underscores the critical need for a clear red line that permits no settlement construction of any kind .
Q : How can the Government of Israel stop new construction in existing settlements ?
The Government of Israel has a number of different ways to stop new construction in existing settlements :
stopping / freezing the allocation of land for construction in settlements ; stopping / freezing the approval process necessary for planning new construction in settlements ; and stopping / freezing ongoing and even already marketed construction projects .
Q : How can the Government of Israel stop the allocation of land for new settlement construction ?
The Government of Israel has two ways to stop the allocation of land for new construction in settlements :
Do n't approve any new allocations of lands for settlement projects .
Before a new plan for construction in an existing settlement can be filed , the Civil Administration - the arm of the IDF responsible for all civilian functions in the West Bank - must first allocate the land in question to an approved " settling body . "
Settling bodies are mainly the World Zionist Organization and the Amana Settlement Movement , as well as other organizations approved as " settling bodies " by the Government of Israel .
All such land allocations must be approved by the Minister of Defense .
Freezing such approvals would stop any planning before it even got started .
Do n't renew the approval of old land allocations .
Over the years , successive Israeli Governments have approved contracts for the allocation of many plots of land in settlements across the West Bank to settling bodies .
The majority of settlement construction in recent years is based on these old allocation contracts .
However , each allocation is time - limited .
If the time of the allocation contract has passed , there must be a new allocation , which again requires the approval of the Minister of Defense .
As far as we know , most of the existing allocations are valid for another 20 - 30 years , but for the few cases where the time period has expired , refraining from renewing allocations would immediately halt the construction plans that are in the works .
Q : How can the government of Israel stop settlement projects from proceeding in cases where land has been legally allocated to settlement bodies ?
The Government of Israel has the power to freeze or roll back settlement efforts at this stage as well .
Do n't approve new planning authorizations .
Once land has been allocated to a settling body , planning cannot proceed without first obtaining planning authorization from the Civil Administration , approved by the Minister of Defense .
Freezing such planning approvals would instantly stop projects for which land has already been allocated and at this stage in the planning process .
Q : How can the government of Israel stop settlement projects where the land has been legally allocated and planning authorization has already been granted ?
Plans for settlement - related construction in the West Bank are under the authority of the Civil Administration 's " Supreme Planning Council , " which oversees almost every stage of the planning process .
Moreover , since every stage in such planning has political significance , every stage must be approved by the Minister of Defense .
Do n't allow the debate on deposit .
One of the first stages in the planning process is the debate at the Supreme Planning Council ( SPC ) on whether the plan can be deposited for public review - public review ( offering the public the opportunity to see the plan and lodge complaints ) being one of the key steps in the planning process .
In order for the SPC to convene to discuss whether a plan can be deposited for public review , the Minister of Defense has to approve the debate .
Refraining from approving this debate will mean a plan cannot move forward .
Do n't approve the publication of the deposit .
If the SPC has already discussed and approved a plan for deposit , the Minister of Defense still has to approve the publication of the plan in the daily newspapers ( to notify the public about the plan and offer the opportunity for objections to it ) .
If the Minister of Defense refuses to authorize the publication of the plan , the plan cannot move forward .
Do n't approve the debate on validation .
If the plan has already been deposited for review , objections have already been lodged , and any necessary adjustments have already been made , the SPC must convene again to approve the plan for validation , based on the approval of the Minister of Defense .
If the Minister of Defense declines to approve the debate on validation of the plan , the plan cannot move forward .
Do n't approve the publication of validation .
If the plan has already been approved for validation by the SPC , it is still not valid until it is published in two daily newspapers .
This publication is under the authority of the Defense Minister .
If the Minister of Defense refrains from authorizing the publication of the plan for validation , the plan cannot move forward .
Only if all those stages are completed and the validation of a plan is published , is it possible to talk about a plan being truly " approved " for implementation .
Cancel pre-approvals and blanket approvals .
The Israeli daily Haaretz recently published parts of a list of approvals given by Minister of Defense Ehud Barak for new settlement construction .
From the documents published at Haaretz , Peace Now realized that the Minister of Defense has through a single decision granted blanket approval , in advance , to all or many of the various stages of a large number of settlement projects .
For instance , Barak gave approval to plans " from debate on deposit through publication for validation . "
This blanket approval appears to be a blatant attempt by Barak to bypass the normal legally - required approval process and in doing so , create legal facts - and new facts on the ground in terms of settlements projects in the works - that the next Minister of Defense will be forced to accept .
This effort to circumvent normal government oversight of the planning process and undermine the government 's ability to intervene in that process for the sake of clear national interests is legally dubious and the next Minister of Defense clearly has the power to cancel these pre-emptive approvals .
Absent the cancellation of such approvals , a settlement freeze will have little meaning .
Q : How can the government of Israel stop settlement projects that have been fully approved for implementation ?
Here again , the Government of Israel has all the authority it needs to stop settlement projects from being implemented .
Do n't approve the publication of tenders .
When the construction initiator is a public body ( such as the Ministry of Housing or the Local Authority ) the Defense Minister must approve the marketing of a project .
Once approved , the Housing Ministry draws up and issues a tender for which building contractors are invited to bid - offering a price for the acquisition of the right to build and sell the housing units .
If the Defense Minister refrains from issuing such tenders , a project cannot move forward .
Do n't approve a development contract .
Before any implementation of a plan - even when it is initiated by members of the private sector and there is no need for a tender - the Minister of Defense must approve a development contract for the body that wishes to build .
If the Defense Minister refrains from approving the development contract , a project cannot move forward .
Q : How can the government of Israel stop settlement projects for which tenders have been published and / or development contracts approved ?
Once a tender is published ( for government initiated construction ) and a development contract is signed and approved ( for any construction ) , third - party financial interests come into play : contractors who have already invested money , buyers who have already paid for homes , banks , etc .
At this stage the Government of Israel can still intervene to stop a project , but doing so will be somewhat more difficult and probably involve financial costs for the government .
Once a development contract has been signed , the builder needs to obtain a construction permit from the local authority .
( Local authorities are part of the settlers ' own bureaucracy , but they are still public bodies that must obey the law and they are under the responsibility of the Israeli Minister of Interior . )
To obtain this permit , the builder needs to present the local authority with the construction program [ blueprint ] .
The local authority 's licensing subcommittee needs to make sure that the program matches the approved plan and that it meets all safety and environmental standards in order to issue the permit .
At this stage , there is no legal obligation to obtain the political echelon 's approval .
However , although legally there is no need for a ministerial approval for issuing those construction permits , the government can still use its political power to prevent the construction .
For example , at the beginning of 2008 some developers wanted to renew the construction of the " Agan Ha'ayalot " project in the Givat Ze 'ev settlement .
They wanted to do so based on a plan approved in 1999 and tenders they won in 2000 .
Then - Prime Minister Olmert ordered the municipality not to issue the construction permits , because of political pressure Israel was facing post - Annapolis to freeze settlement activity .
Based on his order , the permits were temporarily frozen ( in the end , following political pressure put on Olmert , mainly by the Ultra - Orthodox parties , he approved the construction permit and the construction started shortly thereafter , in April 2008 ) .
If Olmert had been serious about the freeze on settlement construction , he would have ordered the cancellation of the tenders and the reimbursement of money paid by the developers / contractors ( as well as some compensation for their investments in preparing the project ) .
He had the legal authority to do so .
Q : How can the government of Israel stop settlement projects that are already fully approved and under construction ?
The Government of Israel can stop settlement projects that are already underway , and this is not simply a theoretical observation : there is the Rabin precedent here .
Following the threats of then - Secretary of State , James Baker , to cancel / stop the loan guarantees given by the US to Israel unless settlements were frozen , the Israeli government in 1992 , led by Yitzhak Rabin , approved a cabinet resolution to freeze construction in settlements .
This resolution included a total freeze of all planning procedures for plans that were yet to be finally validated ( as discussed above ) , unless specifically approved by an exceptions committee .
It also included the freeze of any construction activity in settlements .
This clause also included a compensation mechanism for those who had already invested in the construction , based on previous governmental decisions and approvals .
The cabinet resolution did allow private housing construction , based on approved and validated plans , but only when the construction and the infrastructure do not involve any public funds from the State 's budget .
This final caveat was critical , since the government funds much of the development costs in most settlements .
According to numerous cabinet resolutions through the years , the latest from July 17 , 2008 , the government funds half of the development costs for construction in areas designated " preferred zone A " - a designation which includes all of the settlements ( except for those in East Jerusalem ) .
Q : How can the Government of Israel stop illegal construction ?
One of the greatest failings of the Israeli governments has long been the lack of law enforcement on settlers .
The illegal settlement construction in the West Bank - and this includes not only the so - called illegal outposts but also illegal expansion in " approved " settlements - is something that is well - known to Israeli authorities , and something Israeli authorities have not shown any real interest in addressing .
Indeed , the great irony of this story is the fact that the details of the illegal outpost scandal are so widely known in large part due to the Sasson Report - a report commissioned by then - Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to review the issue of law enforcement and illegal outposts .
The fact that this report prompted no real change in policy from the government of Israel - serving as little more than a smokescreen to allow Israeli officials to tell the world that they were taking the issue of outposts seriously , even when most of the recommendations of the report remain unimplemented - is a national disgrace .
Enforcing the law is not only about evacuation of existing illegal construction , but also stopping the current illegal construction .
Peace
Now knows of a number of permanent construction projects ( and a number of other projects consisting of temporary structures / caravans ) in existing settlements that are clearly illegal , and despite the fact that the authorities know about them , nothing is being done to stop them or go after the people responsible .
In the context of a discussion of what the government can do to stop settlement construction , the question of how to stop illegal construction seems almost surreal .
How do you stop illegal construct ?
Simple : enforce the law .
This is especially important , and in many ways easy , because a very large part of the illegal construction is done directly by governmental bodies ( mainly the municipal councils of the settlements ) .
In this category of settlement construction , no excuse - making or rationalizing is possible .
Q : Why would n't it be enough for the government to simply stop implementation of plans through stopping all new tenders and contracts and by canceling existing tenders and contracts ?
Why should the government also freeze the planning stages from going forward ?
Experience has shown that each new house , new plan , and new approval is seen by Palestinians as a clear sign that Israel is not serious about a viable , negotiated agreement to end the conflict .
Each deals another body blow to the credibility of peace efforts and undermines the viability of pro-peace Palestinian leaders .
And each further complicates the situation on the ground , making it even more difficult to " unscramble " the egg and come to a mutually - agreeable solution to establish a viable state of Palestine that can live side - by - side with Israel . '
Furthermore , every plan , even if it is not yet fully approved , reflects aspirations and creates expectations .
Each planning stage involves the investment of time , money and efforts by the State and individuals - time , money , and efforts that are spent in the expectation that a plan will eventually be implemented .
These investments , and these expectations , should also be prevented .
And lastly , in the Israeli political system , where every few years new elections bring new policies , the mere existence of a plan is significant , because even if under current political conditions it is little more than a pipe dream , it is only a matter of time before these political conditions shift and then it will be there , " shovel - ready " for implementation .
This has happened many times in the past , where plans have lain dormant for many years and suddenly , with a change of government or a change in political conditions , they are brought out of the drawer and swiftly implemented .

Chelsea ’s Didier Drogba Swears At The Camera & Referee After Champions League Loss : Video
Chelsea was dumped from the Champions League in controversial fashion against Barcelona , and nobody was more angry than Didier Drogba .
Following the match , an incensed Drogba went after the referees , getting in their faces while yelling at them .
Drogba was given a card by referee Tom Henning Ovrebo and will undoubtedly face more punishment , especially for what happened as he was leaving the field .
He found one of the UEFA feed cameras and shouted into it repeatedly , saying “ It ’s a disgrace !
It ’s a disgrace !
It ’s a fucking disgrace ! ”
Maybe so , but a player should n’t be acting like that on the field & swearing live on the air .
More video of Didier Drogba ’s outburst can be seen below :

TEHRAN / WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Wednesday Iran had ready proposals to end a standoff with six world powers as Washington insisted it would not drop a demand that Tehran suspend uranium enrichment work .

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said major powers had not had a response yet from Tehran for talks over its nuclear program and she had not seen “ any kind of proposal ” from Iran to resolve the stalemate over its nuclear plans .
“ We have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve Iran ’s nuclear problem .
It will be offered to the West soon , ” Ahmadinejad said in a televised speech in Iran ’s southeastern province of Kerman .
The United States , Russia , China , France , Germany and Britain said last week they would ask European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana to invite Iran to a meeting to find “ a diplomatic solution to this critical issue . ”
It marked a significant shift in U.S. policy under President Barack Obama , whose predecessor , George W. Bush , shunned direct talks with Tehran as long as it pressed ahead with uranium enrichment that the West believes is aimed at building a bomb but Iran says is for peaceful purposes .
The Obama administration has said it will meet Iran “ without preconditions ” but Clinton , who met Solana in Washington on Wednesday , made clear the United States had not given up pushing for Tehran to suspend uranium enrichment .
“ We have not dropped or added any conditions , ” she said , without elaborating .
SANCTIONS TALK
While seeking to engage Iran , the Obama administration has also warned of moves to impose tougher sanctions if Tehran keeps defying U.N. demands to halt sensitive nuclear work .
“ We will stand behind the sanctions that have already been implemented and we will look for new ways to extend collective action vis a vis Iran ’s nuclear program , ” said Clinton .
“ We will continue to work with our allies to make it clear that Iran cannot continue to pursue nuclear weapons . ”
On Monday , Iran welcomed a “ constructive ” dialogue with the six world powers , in its clearest signal that yet it would accept an invitation for talks on its nuclear activity .
It was unclear whether Iran ’s counter - offer would be essentially different from previous ill - fated exchanges .
Ahmadinejad did not give details of the new package , but said the world could not be ruled by “ using force . ”
“ This new package will ensure peace and justice for the world .
It respects rights of all nations , ” he said .
The six world powers originally offered Iran economic and political incentives in 2006 to suspend enrichment .
Iran ’s response hinted at some flexibility but ruled out suspension as a precondition for talks as stipulated by the powers .
Last June the six improved the offer while retaining the precondition .
In reply , Iran said it wanted to negotiate a broader peace and security deal and rejected any “ condescending ” formula to shelve its nuclear program .
Western officials said Iran ’s second response endorsed talks for talks ’ sake and was useless because it again sidestepped the suspension issue .
“ OUT OF THE QUESTION ”
They felt Iran was trying to buy time to expand and make irreversible its nuclear program .
An Iranian official , who asked not to be named , told Reuters that “ suspension is out of the question ” but that Iran did want to get talks rolling with major powers .
“ Eventually Iran may agree to accept the ( U.N. nuclear watchdog ’s ) Additional Protocol , ” the official said .
The protocol , which expands on the basic nuclear safeguards accords many countries have with the International Atomic Energy Agency , permits short - notice IAEA inspections beyond declared nuclear sites , to help verify no covert activity is going on .
Iran stopped voluntarily implementing the Additional Protocol in 2006 in retaliation for initial U.N. sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic .
Underlining Iran ’s intention to continue with its nuclear drive despite Western pressure , Ahmadinejad on April 9 inaugurated its first nuclear fuel fabrication plant and said the country had now mastered the entire fuel cycle .

In February the Dubai Chamber of Commerce gave its permission to develop a free zone that will be called Food City .
The project was offered by Green Concepts Landscape Architects ( GCLA ) , a firm of landscape architects .
Its plan is to turn the city sector into a unique , self - sufficient metropolis .
The firm 's futuristic urban quarter will include a variety of eco-friendly urban planning ideas such as vertically stacked landscape surfaces , synthetic roof landscapes , renewable energy systems , aquatic farms , as well as thermal conditioning .
The entire project was enriched with a lot of ideas to decrease energy use .
Some of the proposals include the use of concentrated solar collectors , the construction of towers covered in thin - film photovoltaic cells , piezoelectric pads installed in pedestrian regions , and methane harvesting with the help of sewage percolation tanks .
In addition , the firm offers water preservation measures that are very important in water - starved Dubai .
Some of the measures include atmospheric water harvesting , solar desalination via concentrated solar collectors , grey water recycling , as well as the use of hydroponic sand in order to reduce water loss .
GCLA is composed of professional landscape architects that work on master planning , design and supervision .
At the moment the firm has divisions in Dubai , Abu Dhabi , Riyadh , Singapore and Sydney .

MIDVALE -- Police identified the man shot and killed during the home invasion at the Spring of Country Woods Apartment complex at 6995 S. 1030 East .
They say the Metro Gang Unit was able to identify him through the tattoos on his body .
They are waiting to release his name pending family notification .
Sgt. John Salazar , with the Midvale Police Department , said , " On the deceased we found a weapon , a handgun and two knives .
So , they were loaded . "
Why he and the others targeted the apartment is still a mystery .
" We do n't know what was said , we do n't know what they were here for , " Salazar said .
A man and his nephew were visiting his girlfriend and her sister Tuesday morning when they heard a knock at the door .
When one opened the door , the suspects pushed open the door .
One of the men tried to close it but was stabbed .
Once inside , the suspects held the victims at gunpoint and forced them into a back room .
Nicole Hulett said , " I heard screaming , and then I heard three shots and then flashes that happened with the triggers . "
Another neighbor , Brian Lee , said , " I heard consistent gun fire , I thought maybe someone was getting murdered . "
He added , " I heard gunfire .
I heard people screaming . "
Police say at one point one of the male victims , trying to protect his girlfriend , grabbed a gun from a suspect and opened fire , killing him .
More shots were then fired , and the other suspects took off .
David Sandford was watching TV in his apartment nearby when he heard the shots .
He ran to his porch just in time to see the suspects coming down the stairs .
" It was kind of a free - for - all , everyone was going , getting the heck out of there , " Sandford said .
Sandford said one of the suspects , an injured female , ran right past his porch , leaving a blood trail for police .
He said , " I saw one of them fairly clearly because , like I say , the way he had his hands held indicated to me he was carrying a rifle or shotgun . "
The SWAT team blasted a garage where another suspect may have been hiding , but it was empty .
Police also found a jacket and gun on a street near the complex .
It was all too much for neighbors .
Lee said , " It kinda makes me have second thoughts about living here . "
" It scared me , " said Hulett .
" I wanna move .
I do n't want to be here any longer . "
Police are still looking for six to eight suspects .

Suburban violence ... a man lies injured on the road , directly opposite where the gunman opened fire .
Credit : Eva Bradley / stuff.co.nz TV3 said sources told them Molenaar turned a weapon on himself as police closed in on him .
Two other policeman and a civilian , who reportedly tried to wrest a rifle away from Molenaar when he fired at them , remained in a critical condition in hospital with gunshot wounds .
The gunman at the centre of the siege has been described as a " one-man army " who has accepted he 's going to die .
A spate of fresh gunfire was heard this afternoon .
Up to 20 shots were heard just after 5 pm local time ( 3 pm AEDT ) .
There was an initial volley of around 10 shots followed by a number of separate shots .
Molenaar fatally shot one policeman and seriously wounded two others and a civilian during what was supposed to be a low - risk cannabis raid on Thursday morning in the quiet central North Island town of Napier .
The body of the dead officer , Senior Constable Len Snee , is still lying next to his police car in view of the fully - armed gunman .
At a press conference today , Eastern District Commander Superintendent Sam Hoyle said police were prepared to wait it out .
" This could be over in five minutes or it could be another five days . "
Police were continuing " tense " negotiations , Superintendent Hoyle said .
But he would not elaborate on whether any demands had been made .
" We are dealing with a very complex character and as you may expect in negotiations that go on for this length of time he goes through various mood swings . "
Molenaar was believed to be heavily armed .
" We understand he has a lot of ammunition available to him , " he said .
Friends of Molenaar told the newspaper he had been a territorial soldier attached to the armoured corps from 1982 to 1988 .
They described him as a " one-man army " and a " nightmare waiting to happen " .
" The guy is a total Rambo , OK ?
I 've never met another person that 's fitter than him , " said a man described as his business partner .
" He 's a very good marksman , he 's just the wrong person .
Wrong person , wrong place , wrong time , the police should have ... known .
That 's their business . "
Others told journalists he had known police had been watching the place and was likely to have wired it with explosives .
" There 's enough there to take that house off the face of the planet , " his friend Tony Moore told the newspaper .
Police Superintendent Sam Hoyle said on Friday that police " remain hopeful that the gunman will talk with us and give himself up " .
But Moore said Molenaar had acted as if he intended to die when saying goodbye to his partner , who left the property a short time after the siege began .
" He said ' Goodbye , hon ' , had a good blubber about it , and then : ' Best you go . '
So he 's already accepted his fate . "
The raid was over Molenaar 's alleged involvement in a marijuana operation but friends said he was only an " occasional " pot smoker and not into pure methamphetamine or P , a drug linked to psychotic episodes and paranoia .
His mother , Anna , went on national television on Thursday night to apologise and question how it had come to this .
" I do n't know why they grow up and become vicious , " she told TV One .
" What are they trying to protect ... a silly marijuana plant ?
What a thing to protect , take someone 's life .
Loading " Now someone has been shot and two others .
I can't quite believe it really . "

Harman ' lining up to take over if Brown loses next election '
Harriet Harman is positioning herself for a leadership contest in the event of Gordon Brown losing the next election , it was claimed yesterday .
One senior Labour figure claimed she was out of control and ' sucking up ' to trades unions and party members .
Another said Miss Harman , who is the party 's deputy leader , was playing to the gallery on issues such as a third runway at Heathrow , bank bonuses and class war .
Next in line ?
Gordon Brown with Harriet Harman
The row came as a devastating poll suggested that the Conservatives have opened up a 20 - point lead over Labour .
The Ipsos / MORI survey put the Tories on 48 per cent , Labour on 28 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 17 per cent .
It also showed a decline in the Prime Minister 's personal ratings .
Lord Mandelson yesterday made an extraordinary appeal for calm , apparently directed at restive Labour MPs .
He insisted there were ' no manuals , no blueprints , no precedents to tell us what to do ' in such a deep economic crisis .
Business secretary Peter Mandelson has appealed for calm after claims Harriet Harman is positioning herself for a leadership contest
Speaking in New York , the Business Secretary warned against frenzy and highlighted the need for nerve and judgment .
That was seen as a coded rebuke to Miss Harman , who triggered a fierce row in Cabinet over bonuses at bailed - out banks .
One senior Labour insider said : ' There is a pattern of behaviour developing with Harriet that is entirely about what happens after a Labour defeat .
You can see
it in much of what she is doing at the moment .
It is all about sucking up to the Labour party and the unions . '
The source accused Miss Harman of hijacking an announcement on social mobility by Cabinet Office minister Liam Byrne .
The source added : ' There is a sense that she is out of control and no one can stop her .
She thinks she can do what she likes because she has a mandate from the party . '
There is also surprise that Miss Harman appears to be preparing to try to grab the limelight at April 's G20 summit in London .
She has let it be known that she plans to hold her own meetings with businesswomen in the run-up to the meeting of world leaders .
Miss Harman also wants a statement inserted into the final diplomatic communique agreed by world leaders promising special safeguards for women 's jobs during the economic downturn .
Colleagues fear that her unexpected triumph in 2007 's deputy leadership race gives her a formidable base of support among union activists and party members , who would help determine a future leadership contest .
One of Gordon Brown 's allies said : ' We are aware of what she is up to but this is very very low on the Richter scale .
It 's the equivalent of a minor earth rumble in Chile .
' Harriet 's chatterings to her friends over canapes are not causing us any excitement . '
Frank Field , meanwhile , has delivered what appeared to be an ultimatum to the Prime Minister over compensation for the remaining losers from the scrapping of the 10 p tax rate .
The former welfare minister demanded the implementation of a ' more progressive ' tax system in April 's Budget .
He also said it was time for the Government to admit the need for tax rises for the wealthy as well as public spending cuts .
Rats are becoming resistant to existing poisons , according to pest control experts who warn that the government must allow the use of more powerful pesticides if the burgeoning rodent population is to be contained .
Amid concerns that the number of rats is soaring out of control , the British Pest Control Association says it has identified two unnamed towns in Berkshire where it claims the local rat population is now almost completely immune to existing poisons .
Oliver Madge , chief executive of the association , said : " We are very concerned about this from a public health point of view . "
The trade body will hold urgent talks with the Department of Health this week about introducing measures that it claims are needed to halt the spread of the rodents , thriving after years of mild winters and wet summers .
Britain 's rat - catchers want the law changed so that two powerful rodenticides , brodifacoum and flocoumafen , which the law only allows to be used indoors , can be applied outdoors .
Other EU countries let pest controllers use the more powerful poisons outdoors but the UK believes this could endanger birds and pets .
In the worst - hit cities , such as York , reported infestations have more than doubled in the past 12 months .
Exeter council reported a 66 % rise in vermin call - outs last year , while there was a 40 % rise in Salford .
There are concerns that some water companies have dispensed with putting poison down sewers .
Madge said that recycling food and water was also playing a part .
" We are encouraged to recycle , but the rats tunnel under compost and they find it 's nice and warm and they have food . "
MIAMI ( Reuters ) - A Florida woman has been indicted for keeping her dead mother ’s body in a bedroom for six years while collecting more than $ 200,000 in pension benefits , U.S. prosecutors said on Thursday .
Penelope Sharon Jordan of Sebastian , Florida , was charged by a federal grand jury last week with Social Security fraud and theft , the U.S. Attorney ’s Office in Miami said .
Police found the decaying body of her mother , Timmie Jordan , on a bed in a spare bedroom at the mother ’s home in late March , when they were called to investigate a report of nuisance cats .
Penelope Jordan told police her mother had died in 2003 .
The indictment alleged Jordan concealed her mother ’s death in order to receive both her U.S. Social Security benefits and her military survivor ’s benefit .
Jordan collected $ 61,415 from Social Security and $ 176,461 from the military pension during the six years , prosecutors said .
She could face up to 15 years in prison .
Local media reported that the 61 - year - old woman told police her mother died of old age and she kept the remains because she could n’t afford burial expenses .
An autopsy found no signs of foul play .
According to a local paper , police found many cats on Jordan ’s property but she denied they were hers .
tmpfs is a virtual , RAM - backed filesystem .
It ’s lightning - fast , but since it ’s RAM - backed , any file written to tmpfs uses precious memory while it ’s there , and the entire contents of the virtual partition are lost on shutdown or crash .
The good news is that these detriments can be minimized , making tmpfs a viable choice for your profile directory .
This document gives some tips on how to mount your Firefox profile in a tmpfs partition while minimizing the downsides of tmpfs .
To reduce the size of your Firefox profile ( so less RAM is used ) , enter " about : config " in the Firefox addrss bar and make the following changes :
set browser.cache.disk.capacity to 20000 or thereabouts set browser .
safebrowsing .enabled to false set browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled to false
2. Create an initial archive of your Firefox profile and create the fstab entry
cd ~/.mozilla / firefox tar cpf packed .
tar abcd1234.default
Replace abcd1234.default with your profile folder name in the command above and all of the following where you 'll see this .
gksu gedit /etc/fstab
firefox /home / andrei/.mozilla/firefox/abcd1234.default tmpfs size=300M,noauto,user,exec,uid=1000 ,gid=100 0 0
Make sure you replace the path with the correct path to your profile .
You can also change the size from 300 M if you have enough RAM .
Since the Firefox profile is loaded in the RAM , you need to copy it from time to time ( we 'll cover the technicalities further below ) to the hard disk and for this we 'll use a script .
Create a new empty file called " .pack_ffox.sh " in your home folder and paste the following :
#!/bin/bash #
Change this to match your correct profile PROFILE = " abcd1234.default " cd " $ { HOME}/.mozilla / firefox " if test - z " $( mount | grep -F " $ {HOME}/.mozilla/firefox /${PROFILE} " ) " then mount " $ {HOME}/.mozilla/firefox /${PROFILE} " fi if test -f " $ { PROFILE}/.unpacked " then tar -- exclude '.unpacked ' - cpf packed.tmp.tar " $ PROFILE " mv packed .
tar packed .
tar.old mv packed .tmp.tar packed .
tar else tar xpf packed .
tar &&\ touch " $ { PROFILE}/.unpacked " fi
chmod +x ~/.pack_ffox.sh
After this , you 'll need to quit Firefox so open this guide in another browser or copy it to a text editor so you can follow the next steps without having Firefox open .
Make sure Firefox is closed , then empty your Firefox profile folder .
You can either remove the folder contents or move the files somewhere else .
We have an archive of your Firefox profile created under step 2 .
~/.pack_ffox.sh
In my test , the first time running the script , it might not work so if you get an error , run it again .
Now , verify that the Firefox profile has been successfully mounted in the RAM and if an " .unpacked " ( hidden ) file exists in your Firefox profile directory .
You can run :
mount
which should list all the mount points , including the newly added Firefox profile .
Now you have to run the script again , but this tile check your ~/.mozilla / firefox folder and see if there 's a new " packed.tar " file and an " packed.old.tar " file as well .
If both of those things checked out , you 're clear to start Firefox again .
Since the Firefox profile is now using tmpfs , you 'll need to copy it periodically to the hard disk , so the changes are n't lost .
There are various ways of doing this , but the best way is probably to add a cron job that runs our script above every 5 minutes or so .
To do this , run the following command :
crontab -e
And add this line ( assuming you 've used the script name which we 've recommended above and placed it in your home folder ) :
*/5 * * * * $ HOME/.pack_ffox.sh
Wait for 5 minutes , then check the " packed.tar " creation time , to see if it has changed ( right click it , select Properties and see there ) - it should have changed !

Let 's see how to mount your Firefox profile to RAM to speed things up !
Firstly , let 's create an archive of your Firefox profile : Now let 's editAnd add the following line :
Then , make it executable : Now , run the script : That 's it !
Apologists for what is euphemistically called “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” who claim that the use of harsh , coercive physical and mental tactics — i.e. , torture — induced high - value detainees to give up valuable information , prevented terrorist attacks , and made us safer , are wrong .
They are flat - out wrong .
The evidence that they are wrong has come from many sources in the past few months .
David Rose ’s December , 2008 , Vanity Fair article is one :
… In researching this article , I spoke to numerous counterterrorist officials from agencies on both sides of the Atlantic .
Their conclusion is unanimous : not only have coercive methods failed to generate significant and actionable intelligence , they have also caused the squandering of resources on a massive scale through false leads , chimerical plots , and unnecessary safety alerts — with Abu Zubaydah ’s case one of the most glaring examples .
Here , they say , far from exposing a deadly plot , all torture did was lead to more torture of his supposed accomplices while also providing some misleading “ information ” that boosted the administration ’s argument for invading Iraq .
“ Matthew Alexander , ” a former military interrogator who uses a pseudonym for security reasons , is another such source .
His team ’s non-coercive interrogation techniques led to the finding and killing of Abu Musab al - Zarqawi .
Today , a former FBI special agent named Ali Soufan becomes another interrogation expert to go on record about the utter ineffectiveness of torture at producing actionable intelligence :
For seven years I have remained silent about the false claims magnifying the effectiveness of the so - called enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding .
I have spoken only in closed government hearings , as these matters were classified .
But the release last week of four Justice Department memos on interrogations allows me to shed light on the story , and on some of the lessons to be learned .
One of the most striking parts of the memos is the false premises on which they are based .
The first , dated August 2002 , grants authorization to use harsh interrogation techniques on a high - ranking terrorist , Abu Zubaydah , on the grounds that previous methods had n’t been working .
The next three memos cite the successes of those methods as a justification for their continued use .
It is inaccurate , however , to say that Abu Zubaydah had been uncooperative .
Along with another F.B.I. agent , and with several C.I.A. officers present , I questioned him from March to June 2002 , before the harsh techniques were introduced later in August .
Under traditional interrogation methods , he provided us with important actionable intelligence .
We discovered , for example , that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks .
Abu Zubaydah also told us about Jose Padilla , the so - called dirty bomber .
This experience fit what I had found throughout my counterterrorism career : traditional interrogation techniques are successful in identifying operatives , uncovering plots and saving lives .
There was no actionable intelligence gained from using enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah that was n’t , or could n’t have been , gained from regular tactics .
In addition , I saw that using these alternative methods on other terrorists backfired on more than a few occasions — all of which are still classified .
The short sightedness behind the use of these techniques ignored the unreliability of the methods , the nature of the threat , the mentality and modus operandi of the terrorists , and due process .
Defenders of these techniques have claimed that they got Abu Zubaydah to give up information leading to the capture of Ramzi bin al - Shibh , a top aide to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , and Mr. Padilla .
This is false .
The information that led to Mr. Shibh ’s capture came primarily from a different terrorist operative who was interviewed using traditional methods .
As for Mr. Padilla , the dates just do n’t add up : the harsh techniques were approved in the memo of August 2002 , Mr. Padilla had been arrested that May .
As Greg Sargent reminds us , even former FBI director Robert Mueller acknowledged ( in that Vanity Fair article linked to above ) that he does not know of any terror plots that were foiled by the use of torture .
It is often said that two things bind a country as diverse as Pakistan : Urdu and cricket .
After yesterday 's shootout on the streets of Lahore , the list has shortened further .
The attack on the coach carrying the visiting Sri Lankan team spelled not just the suspension of international cricket - or indeed any international sport in Pakistan .
Pakistan has also just lost its last great link with the outside world .
A link that had survived military dictators , a nuclear standoff and the decades of conflict with India has just fallen victim to an audacious commando - style raid outside a stadium in one of Lahore 's leafier suburbs .
Analysts are not exaggerating when they say that the attack poses existential questions for the Pakistani state .
If the state can not protect a visiting cricket team from well - aimed and well - prepared terrorism , what can it do ?
Not since the Munich Olympics have athletes been specifically targeted - and the ramifications of yesterday 's attack spread just as wide .
No group has claimed responsibility for the actions of 14 masked and heavily armed men who arrived in rickshaws and all escaped .
But the similarities with the attack in Mumbai which claimed 170 lives are evident and legion , and the possibility that the second major headline - grabbing hit could be the work of a hardline Islamist organisation like Lashkar - e - Taiba , on which Pakistan has only just started to crack down , is obvious .
India lost no time yesterday in saying so .
If this shooting does not galvanise Islamabad to take action nothing will .
Asif Zardari has made an inauspicious start as president .
He has locked himself into the otherwordly luxury of his official residence with a handful of advisers , while mayhem reigns in the country outside .
If there is a government in power , it is not obvious to its citizens .
Barely 100 miles away from Islamabad , he has just surrendered a large swath of territory in the Swat valley to the Taliban .
Pakistan 's foreign minister pleaded in Washington this week that the deal was not as bad as it sounded .
The sharia law that Swat will now be subject to is said to be milder than the traditional kind .
But acceptance of sharia by the residents who remain in the valley ( half have left ) should not be viewed as the triumph of Islamist clerics , but rather as a sign of their lack of faith in the state 's ability to protect them .
Closer to home , all bets are off with Mr Zardari 's former coalition partner and opposition leader Nawaz Sharif , after the decision by the supreme court to uphold a ban on Mr Sharif 's contesting elections due to a past criminal conviction .
Was the supreme court right to uphold the judgment ?
Its ruling was legally consistent .
But was the unreformed court acting independently of the president ?
Probably not .
But by refusing to work with the president , Mr Sharif is also responsible for the fallout .
All he will achieve is more popularity in a state which his party already controls , but not in Sindh , Baluchistan or the North - West Frontier Province .
Mr Sharif 's political ascendancy bodes ill for the unity of the federation .
All of which makes the job of Richard Holbrooke , Barack Obama 's envoy to the region , a whole lot more complicated .
It is hard enough to devise a multinational plan which involves three nations acting in concert to dampen a growing insurgency .
It is harder still when two of the nations , Pakistan and India , are regional rivals and rarely far from conflict .
It is next to impossible if one key player , Pakistan , starts to fissure into parallel states .
Washington and its previous satrap in the region , the ousted president Pervez Musharraf , are far from blameless .
But if a flawed but still democratic ruler in Pakistan cannot seize control - if he cannot be seen to be acting in Pakistan 's own interest - then other forces will move into the vacuum .
The alternative is oft foretold : regime change scripted or enacted by the army .
In between all the wildflower images I captured this year I was able to gather quite a few of these tasty little morsels , or should I say Morels , this little guy is the Black Morel one of the best edible mushrooms that grow anywhere .
You can usually find them in a lot of the same places that I get most of my wildflower images , deep humus rich hardwood forest with an abundance of Poplar or Black Cherry trees .
If you can find the “ right ” place in the woods ( a very closely kept secret ) and the conditions are right you can definitely pick a great harvest of this fungus .
I usually find my biggest crops after a few nights of 50 degree or higher temps and couple good soaking rains , finding them by the hundreds is not unheard of , but to be quite honest I could n’t possible eat that many so I now leave plenty to propagate for the next years crop .
I also like to make sure I pinch them off at the stem as not to disturb the underground system that keeps them coming back , and when picking them I always carry a potato bag so that the spoors can fall from the bag and reseed the population .
There is also the Yellow and White Morels in this area as well , but not nearly as many as the Black , that are just as edible .
Just be very sure of what you are eating because there is just not that many mushrooms that you can go out and pick and bring home to eat , it is always better to go with someone who has hunted them for a while to make sure you know what you are doing .
Personal information on more than 80,000 current and retired New York police officers was stolen from a supposedly secure data warehouse that stored NYPD pension fund data .
The stolen data , stored on computer bakup tapes in a facility managed by the Port Authority , included names , addresses , Social Security numbers names , bank account numbers and medical records of officers .
The thief , who worked at a different location as a communications director for the pension fund , entered the guarded warehouse on Staten Island on a Saturday morning using an expired ID badge and and disabled a surveillance camera before making off with eight tapes of data .
Authorities discovered that data had been stolen only after the employee made suspicious comments at work .
One point worthy of note in this breach – the Port Authority facility where the police backup records were stolen also houses backup servers for Google and Yahoo .

Williams described the decision as " regrettable but understandable " Williams have been suspended from the Formula 1 Teams ' Association ( Fota ) after signing up for the 2010 season .
The teams are in talks over planned budgetary curbs for next year and several teams including Ferrari say they will quit if a deal is not agreed .
" Fota 's decision , although regrettable , is understandable , " said team principal Frank Williams .
" As a company whose only business is F1 with obligations to our partners and employees entering was unquestionable . "
Team chiefs met in Monaco at the weekend to discuss the proposals put forward by International Motorsport Federation ( FIA ) chief Max Mosley , and further talks are planned for London on Wednesday .
606 : DEBATE
To suggest they are united and want the same thing is pointless
ManuelRC Ferrari , Renault , Red Bull and Toyota have all threatened to pull out of the sport if the budgetary restrictions are forced through , but on Monday , the day after the Monaco Grand Prix , Williams broke ranks and confirmed they were signing up for next season .
At the time , Williams chief executive Adam Parr said they felt " morally and legally obliged " to make it clear the team would continue to take part in F1 .
" We owe it to our employees , sponsors and fans who are affected by statements that teams may not enter next year , " he added .
Teams have until this Friday to submit their entries for 2010 season .
It is not clear how long Williams ' suspension from Fota will be in operation .

An opponent of Chechnya ’s Moscow - backed president , Ramzan Kadyrov , has been shot dead in Dubai .
The murder of Sulim Yamadayev is the latest in a line of killings of Chechens who opposed the rule of Mr Kadyrov and again raises questions about the nature of his rule .
Mr Yamadayev , like Mr Kadyrov , was a former rebel who fought against Russia during the 1990s and then switched sides .
He had been awarded Russia ’s top military medal , and until recently was the commander of Vostok , a federal army battalion made up of Chechens that had a fearsome reputation .
He led Vostok into South Ossetia during last summer ’s war , and the battalion played a major part in the Russian invasion of Georgia .
But despite this success , relations with Mr Kadyrov had already soured .
The Yamadayev brothers – Sulim , Ruslan and Badrudi – headed a powerful clan that had a long - running feud with Mr Kadyrov , exacerbated when a convoy led by Badrudi Yamadayev refused to make way for Mr Kadyrov ’s cortege in Chechnya last April , leading to a shootout .

In September , Ruslan Yamadayev was assassinated in central Moscow .
Many pointed the finger at Chechnya ’s President , though Sulim Yamadayev at the time said he did not want to believe that Mr Kadyrov was behind the killing .
He then disappeared from public view ; according to reports in the Russian press , he had been living in an upmarket area of Dubai for the past four months .
He was reported to have been fatally wounded while getting into his car in an underground car park on Saturday afternoon .
There were unconfirmed reports that a Russian citizen had been apprehended as a suspect .
In 2004 , two Russian intelligence agents were convicted of assassinating a former Chechen separatist president ,
Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev , in Qatar .
Recently , a new spate of murders has started , with the Yamadayev brothers just two of several Chechens to meet sticky ends far from the Caucasus Mountains .
Chechen exile groups claim that three Chechens have been murdered in Istanbul in recent months , while in January Umar Israilov was murdered in Vienna .
Mr Israilov , a former bodyguard of Mr Kadyrov , had claimed to have witnessed acts of torture carried out by the Chechen President himself .
Mr Kadyrov , who has also been mentioned as a possible suspect in the murder of the investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya , rejected those accusations with the unsettling defence that he did not kill women .
Chechen officials denied that Mr Yamadayev ’s killing was related to Mr Kadyrov and suggested that it was a provocation designed to implicate the Chechen President falsely , and cause friction ahead of a visit of the Dubai ruler , Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum , to Moscow .
The number of .ie registrations has reached a record high despite the recession , it was revealed today .
The IE Domain Registry ( IEDR ) , the managed registry for the State 's internet address .ie , today reported the first quarter of 2009 saw a record level of domain registrations .
The registry found a total of 9,781 .ie domains were registered in the first quarter of 2009 , and that registrations that period were up 28 per cent over the final quarter of 2008 .
The previous highest number of registrations was recorded the first quarter of 2008 - at 9,092 .
Over 80 per cent of the new .ie website addresses were registered by sole traders or limited companies , with the rest registered by clubs , societies and charities .
A total of 98 per cent of the growth in registrations was generated by .ie resellers .
According to the IEDR , the increasing number of companies and sole traders moving their business online with a .ie website is one of the main reasons for the increase .
The association also pointed to six consecutive years of price cuts by the IEDR and said the cost of registering a .ie domain has fallen by more than 60 per cent since 2003 .
Commenting on the levels of .ie registrations , David Curtin , IEDR chief executive , said : " .
It is encouraging to see that despite the economic downturn , businesses are still seeing opportunities for growth online , with over 7,500 domain names registered by businesses in the first three months of the year . "
The IEDR is the independent not - for - profit registry and database for .ie domain names and manages the .ie country code in the public interest of the Irish and global Internet communities .
Video of the car chase and police striking the suspect .

The soundless video shows several police cars trying to pull over Anthony Shannon Warren 's van .
It shows him putting innocent people at risk –including police .
Was Mr. Warren trying to run down the officer he swerved toward and struck while the officer was placing spike strips on the road ?
As a former police officer and prosecutor , I believe the evidence shows he was .
The pursuing officers were close and had a clear view of him apparently trying to kill a uniformed colleague .
It would be interesting to hear the police radio transmissions to understand the limits of what the cops knew and what was in their minds .
Whether captured on audio tape or not , the cops are probably wondering why this man seems so desperate to avoid capture .
Is he wanted ?
Armed ?
The driver 's utter disregard for the safety of innocent motorists and pedestrians suggests that if they catch up with him , he will not acquiesce .
How much force will they need to use on him ?
At significant risk to themselves , the cops manage to bump him off the road causing his vehicle to overturn and Mr. Warren to be ejected .
At that moment , Mr. Warren appears almost lifeless .
Is he ?
Are there any other situations the cops deal with in which a seemingly lifeless person ends up killing or injuring someone ?
Absolutely .
A crucial police academy training exercise involves teaching cops how to approach someone they 've just shot .
After a careful approach the suspect , though grievously wounded , should be handcuffed .
This is based on previous scenarios in which wounded people , sometimes in their dying moments , harm or even mortally wound officers .
Officers strike Mr. Warren over approximately 10 seconds .
Then , almost in unison , the cops retreat , seemingly satisfied that he is in fact not a danger to them .
Did the officers strike the injured Mr. Warren believing he could be a threat or was this a punishment beating ?
Perhaps they are the only ones who know for sure .
But based on police pursuit history , officers - and police supervisors - have to do everything they can to limit the amount of force used to arrest the offender and defend themselves , particularly when a colleague has been injured or the chase itself has put the officers at great risk .
Emotions run high at such times .
The cops have to try to control themselves .
The greatest complicating factor is that , at the end of the day , though the cops get a bunch of tools and training to help them do their job , they cannot ditch the imperfections and passions of their humanity , and they do not enjoy extra-human abilities to divine the exact moment when a resistant suspect decides to comply .
Three quick points :
- The Birmingham police department should indicate whether this chase accords with department policy .
In most American cities , police will not pursue for all but the most serious crimes .
There is just too much at stake and too many examples of chases ending with lethal results for the chased , the cops and innocent folks .
- Then there is the reality that more and more police work is being brought into American living rooms thanks to ubiquitous surveillance equipment .
Hopefully , people will have a better understanding that using force on people is a core function of police work that differentiates their jobs from civilian occupations .
Perhaps this will make Americans leery about involving the police in so many areas of domestic life .
And policing too often continues to be a hot button topic that allows us to glimpse larger issues of race relations .
- Finally , will police chiefs and mayor 's have the stomach needed to defend police operational judgments even when the actions of officers " look bad " ?
We are starting to see police chiefs quickly weigh in on controversial police videotapes even before officers have a chance to defend themselves .
The nation as a whole seems to be driven more by the visceral , and less by the contextual , with snap judgments being offered up about the good guys , the bad guys and the victims .
We will all ultimately be in deep trouble if the first question at police headquarters and city halls becomes , " What are the political implications for the chief and the mayor ? "
These events have to be looked at through the eyes of the officers on the ground and it would be nice for some public officials to take responsibility for their police while acknowledging that the cops are out there often doing our dirty work for us .

Back on April 27th I wrote an article , The scope of IT ’s responsibility when businesses go bad , that was inspired by a thread that Patrick Gray had started on the LinkedIn.com Chief Information Officer ( CIO ) Network group .
This was entitled Is IT partially to blame for the financial crisis ?
( as ever you need to be a member of LinkedIn.com and the group to view these links ) .
Since then , there have been nearly 80 comments made by a wide variety of people , with an equally wide range of opinions .
As can often happen in on - line discussions , positions were taken , attitudes were hardened and eventually some sort of stalemate was reached ; probably as the protagonists were too weary to fight any more .
In this respect seasoned IT professionals can be no different to teenagers discussing the merits of different genres of music !
I certainly employed my method acting approach at a new level on this thread .
As a result of the overall feedback , Patrick has now composed a blog article on TechRepublic.com , an outlet that has also featured one of my favourite technology writers , Ilya Bogorad ( see this earlier blog post ) .
Patrick ’s piece is titled
Why taking a few punches on the financial crisis just might save IT and takes a thought - provoking stance with respect to the comments that his thread engendered .
Here are the introductory remarks :
Patrick Gray believes that IT leaders still looking to find a seat at the C - level table might gain that influential position by taking a share of the responsibility for the failures that led to financial crisis .
It is certainly worth reading this article , but I recommend that you do so with an open mind .

CONCORD , N.H. ( AP ) � A New Hampshire Senate committee has voted 4 - 1 to recommend passage of a bill that would allow people with crippling ailments to grow and use small amounts of marijuana .
The bill now goes to the full Senate for a vote .
The bill , already passed the House , would allow severely ill patients or their caregivers to grow and possess six marijuana plants , six seeds and two ounces of the drug .
It requires doctors to certify a patient has a debilitating medical condition and would benefit from the therapeutic or palliative benefit from using marijuana .

WHEN the tanks departed Beijing after the crackdown of June 1989 , no one with an interest in China thought the matter ended .
The Chinese Communist Party had won its battle for survival , but the war seemed unwinnable .
All the more so after communism collapsed in Eastern Europe later that year , followed by the Soviet Union .
Even China 's lunge for breakneck growth from 1992 looked set to accelerate forces the party might not control .
As the party 's ideological and moral foundations crumbled , it was no longer clear what on earth it stood for .
China - watchers ' scenarios ran from party collapse to a democratising path .
As late as 1998 Bill Clinton was able to tell his Chinese host , President Jiang Zemin , that suppressing dissent put China “ on the wrong side of history ” .
Banyan was in the audience that day , his Flying Pigeon ( state - made bicycle ) outside .
Mr Clinton 's words seemed self - evident .
But with hindsight , much of where the West said China was going was wishful thinking .
What nearly no one predicted has transpired .
Today , the party is as strong at home as at any time since it seized power in 1949 .
Though still authoritarian , it rules largely by consent , preferring persuasion to violence and intimidation — though these remain handy , as during the crushing of Tibetan riots last year .
Abroad , its prestige is as high : some believe China 's economy is about to save the world .
Mr Jiang 's successor , Hu Jintao , has been welcomed at the top table of world leaders .
On her first trip to Beijing as secretary of state , Hillary Clinton was as blunt as her husband had been a decade earlier , but with a different message : the United States would not let China 's human - rights abuses obstruct the history being made between these two great states .
It is a commonplace that the party 's legitimacy is built on economic growth .
Yet China 's leaders have long considered that to be merely the ( simplistic ) half of it .
After the massacre , the Communist Party set about transforming itself .
It launched a vast historical investigation into how political parties fall , and how they stay in power .
Everyone was scrutinised , from Saddam Hussein to Scandinavian social democrats .
The conclusion : adapt or die .
The outcome is a wholesale reinvention of the party , a process accelerated after Mr Hu stepped up as paramount leader in 2004 .
Shortcomings that were identified included corruption ( a chief complaint of the Tiananmen students ) , lack of accountability in decision - making , no convincing ideology , and an ossified structure .
In a recent book ( “ China 's Communist Party : Atrophy and Adaptation ” ) , David Shambaugh describes how the 74m - strong party has fired whole armies of time - servers .
Bright technocrats and entrepreneurs have been recruited .
Retirement rules have been revamped ( the Soviet Union 's gerontocracy was noted ) .
Party members have gone back to school : three weeks a year and three months for every three years of mid-career training .
More appointments are open to peer scrutiny before they are filled .
The Communist Party is vastly more able to govern .
Some in the wishful West will see this as a proto- democratisation of a Leninist state .
The opposite is the case .
Staying in power is the party 's only credo now that revolution has been jettisoned .
It is the sole reason for revamping the mechanisms of power .
China 's other manufacturing industry
A case in point is the Communists ' approach since 1989 to the crucial field of propaganda .
With the end of Maoist mobilisation , the party turned to Western techniques of public relations and mass media , manufacturing consent by guiding public opinion in certain directions while barring it from others .
In “ Marketing Dictatorship ” , Anne-Marie Brady sums up the party 's approach as emphasising achievements , not allowing bad news during holiday periods or around sensitive dates ( including June 4th ) , and not raising problems that can't be solved ( unemployment , inequality ) .
It talks up the economy , regularly demonises the United States and uses Orwellian newspeak to shape the debate about certain subjects ( “ party - state ” is banned in public discourse in favour of “ the political party in power ” ) .
It presents stories in ways that encourage people to take sides .
It turns natural disasters into quasi-religious occasions of national solidarity .
And always , always repeat after me : “ Taiwan is an inalienable part of China . ”
With this approach , the proliferation of channels for media , information and entertainment offers unbounded scope for the party to get its messages across , abetted by commercial operators .
The internet has proven a particular boon , since its users are predominantly young , educated males from the cities — just the kind of groups , the party has noted , behind the colour revolutions in Serbia , Georgia and Ukraine .
Shaping the online debate while using controls and surveillance to block most of what it does not want surfers to see , the internet is an example of how the party has corralled mainland Chinese into what Ms Brady calls “ a virtual mind prison ” — though one with plenty of fun and games to keep people entertained .
In 2000 Mr Clinton said that trying to control the internet in China was “ like trying to nail Jell - O to a wall ” .
The Communist Party seems to have managed it .
This is little comfort to Westerners projecting their hopes for democratic change on to China .
Nor is there any sign that Chinese intellectuals identify with the myriad grievances of their poor countrymen , as they did during the Tiananmen protests .
And the growing middle class appears more fearful of the great unwashed than of the depredations of a party that once was at war with the bourgeoisie .
So no national movement challenges the party 's monopoly .
The state might yet prove unable to meet growing demands for health care and schooling .
Leadership splits might threaten the party , as they did in 1989 , with China now facing its biggest economic test since then .
But for now , the Communist Party glides smoothly upon the tide of history .

Sometimes the epitome of efficiency is using whatever tools are available to accomplish the job at hand .
No one understands this better than William Kamkwamba , a teenager from rural Malawi whose ingenuity provided his family and neighbors with electricity from a most unlikely source .
William Kamkwamba is now an engineering student in Johannesburg , South Africa .
But in 2002 , when William was 14 , his farming family could no longer afford to send him to school when Malawi was hit with its worst famine in decades .
He decided to continue studying on his own , however , and chanced upon a library book about wind power .
Much to the amusement of his friends and neighbors , William began constructing a homemade wind turbine from wood scraps , plastic , and old bicycle parts .
But their skepticism quickly turned to wonder when William demonstrated that his contraption could provide enough energy to power lights and radios in his family ’s home , when only 2 % of Malawi ’s residents enjoyed household electricity .
Kamkwamba continued to modify and improve his homespun turbine , which he eventually linked to a series of car batteries to store electricity for his family and their neighbors .
When word of his design reached the organizers of the TED Global Conference in Tanzania , they invited him to appear as a guest speaker , which subsequently led to a wealth of attention .
Besides continuing his studies , Kamkwamba has traveled extensively to explore renewable power sources in other parts of the world , and he hopes to bring large - scale wind power to Africa one day .
His windmill is the subject of an exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago , and he has co-written a book that will be published this fall .
Aside from a remarkable aptitude for learning and applying technology , William Kamkwamba has demonstrated the power of creativity , and the impact of his project is evident far beyond the lights of his family home .
His upcoming book , The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind : Creating Currents Of Electricity And Hope , will be available in September at Amazon .

The study looked at genetic material from across the African continent
A group of scientists have unveiled what they say is the most comprehensive study ever of African genes .
Published following a decade of study , the researchers say their findings give new insight into the origins of humans .
The first humans probably evolved near the South Africa - Namibia border before migrating north , the study says .
Published in the US journal Science , it aims to teach Africans on population history and aid research into why diseases hit particular groups .
The scientists examined genetic material from 121 African populations , as well as four African - American populations and 60 non-African populations .
' Benefit Africans '
The results provided " novel insights about levels and patterns of genetic diversity in Africa , a region that has been under - represented in human genetic studies " , said Sarah Tishkoff , a geneticist from the University of Pennsylvania .
The first humans most likely evolved near the South Africa - Namibia border , the team said , and migrated north out of the continent via the Red Sea .
Researchers had identified 14 ancestral population clusters " that correlated with ethnicity and shared cultural and / or linguistic properties " , they said .
They found high levels of mixed ancestry in most populations , as well as evidence showing common ancestry in geographically diverse groups .
The study also looked at African - American populations , finding that almost three - quarters could trace their ancestry to West Africa .
This knowledge could help experts better understand why certain diseases impact on African - American populations , researchers said .
Dr Tishkoff said that the goal was to " benefit Africans , both by learning more about their population history and by setting the stage for future genetic studies , including studies of genetic and environmental risk factors for disease and drug response " .
Bill Clinton gives , to use David Leonhardt 's term , an " impressively honest " analysis of his role in bringing about the financial crisis , particularly the failure to adequately regulate derivative markets :
Bill Clinton , on His Economic Legacy , by David Leonhardt : Given the range of issues Peter Baker covers in his article about Bill Clinton for the coming New York Times Magazine , there was not room for anything close to Mr. Clinton ’s entire comments on his economic record .
...
So we ’re going to post , below , the transcript of that portion of the discussion between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Baker .
...
NEW YORK TIMES : Speaking of banks and toxic assets ...
You know that Time magazine named you and said you should have done this , that or the other thing .
What do you say to that ?
Is there anything you would have done differently ? ...
Mr. CLINTON : Now , there basically have been three charges , ... one , because I enforced the Community Reinvestment
Act for the first time and over 90 percent of all lending done under that law was done when I was president , $ 300 billion , that part of that was a lot of little banks made loans to people they had no business making loans to to buy houses so they could check the box for the Community Reinvestment Act .
That ’s the right - wing argument .
Then there ’s the argument from the left that I should n’t have signed the bill that got rid of the Glass - Steagall law because that enabled banks and investment banks in effect to merge their functions .
And then there ’s the argument that I make , which is that I should have raised more hell about derivatives being unregulated .
I believe the last one is by far the most valid … although I do n’t think that the Congress would have permitted anything to be done because Alan Greenspan was against it .
So let ’s take them in reverse order .
The argument against regulating derivatives , which Greenspan urged — and this is one of the few things I think — I think Bob Rubin and Larry Summers and those guys have gotten a little bit of a bum rap on this lately ...
But I do believe on the derivatives they made the argument , the people who were against regulating it , that people like you were n’t buying derivatives .
It was n’t like you were investing your 401 ( k ) in derivatives .
You were investing your 401 ( k ) in mutual funds , which were subject at least under normal times to the jurisdiction of the S.E.C. , which was supposed to be minding the store .
And so because we had a hostile Republican Congress which threatened not to fund ... the S.E.C. because of what Arthur Levitt was doing to try to protect the American economy from meltdowns .
They said , “ Oh , he ’s interfering with a free market ” and all that .
This is what he ’s supposed to do .
They argued that nobody ’s going to buy these derivatives , we ’ll do it without transparency , they ’ll get the information they need .
And it turned out to be just wrong ; it just was n’t true .
...
That rested on a lot of assumptions , including the fact that the ratings agencies would do a good job , which did n’t happen , in evaluating risk .
So I very much wish now that I had demanded that we put derivatives under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that transparency rules had been observed ...
That I think is a legitimate criticism of what we did n’t do .
On the Glass - Steagall , I ’ve really thought about that because No. 1 , nonbank banking was already a major part of American life at that time .
Letting banks take investment positions I do n’t think had much to do with this meltdown .
And the more diversified institutions in general were better able to handle what happened .
...
I believe if you look at the blurring of the lines which already existed before that bill was signed — the bill arguably gave us a framework , at least , for which this process , which was happening anyway , could be regulated .
So I do n’t think that ’s such a good criticism .
I think actually , if you want to make a criticism on that , it would be an indirect one ; you could say that the signing of that legislation sped up what was happening anyway and maybe led some of these institutions to be bigger than they otherwise would have been and the very bigness of some of these groups caused some of this problem ...
And the first argument , I think it ’s totally without merit .
If you look at the community banks in this country — actually I never believed I ’d cite her as an authority , but Arianna Huffington had a great piece on the success of community banks yesterday in the Huffington Post .
You ought to get it —
NEW YORK TIMES : Do you read the Huffington Post ?
Mr. CLINTON : A lot .
I read a lot of the blogs .
...
That ’s my take on it .
The Time magazine thing , ... if you actually read what they said , they kind of hedged .
They said “ Well , here are some of the things people say . ”
But if you ask me to write the indictment , I ’d say , “ I wish Bill Clinton had said more about derivatives .
The Republicans probably would have stopped him from doing it but at least he should have sounded the alarm bell . ” ...
But you got to understand , again , we were living in a different world .
We had a lot of confidence in the S.E.C .
We had a lot of confidence in the broad - based nature of our economic growth .
We never dreamed there ’d be a time like in the first five years of this decade where literally the whole growth of the country would be in the housing , finance and consumer spending because we had no other investment strategy .
...
I made the best call I could .
But I do wish — I always felt a little queasy about the derivative issue .
Otherwise , I think we did a good job and I do not believe — when anybody asks me that , I ask them , I look at them and ask them , “ Do you think this would have happened if we had been there ?
Look me in the face and say yes . ”
I have n’t found any takers yet .
That 's the part I 'm not so sure about .
If a Clinton clone had been in charge rather than Bush , would this have still happened ?
I can't be sure , of course , and maybe the clone administration would have stepped in before things got out of hand , but little cues like the deference to Greenspan he indicates above ( who would have opposed trying to prick the bubble if he had admitted a bubble was inflating ) makes me wonder .
So I think it probably would have happened anyway .
But , and this is important , perhaps the Treasury would n't have dragged its feet for months and months only to turn the problem over to the next administration if there had been more continuity , and I believe that acting faster to solve the toxic asset problem could have made a big difference in limiting the severity of the resulting downturn .
In addition , without Republicans standing in the way with veto power , the shape of the initial and subsequent stimulus packages would have been different as well .
So while I 'm not so sure that the outcome would have been different in terms of the bubble , I do believe the response would have been quite a bit different , and much better than what actually occurred .
In this post , I want to discuss to what extent a group ’s character table determines it up to isomorphism .
First , let ’s do the easy case of Abelian groups .
The set of characters of an Abelian group G is itself a group called given by pointwise multiplication .
In fact , G is isomorphic to ( though not canonically ) as follows : we can write where the are prime powers .
Fix generators for each cyclic summand .
For each j , the function given by sending the generator of to gives an element of order in , and the map given by is injective .
Since the number of characters of G is equal to the order of G , we conclude that it is an isomorphism .
To do this canonically ( without picking the direct sum decomposition ) , we can just do it twice ( picking the decomposition twice ends up cancelling the fact that we made a choice ) , and we get an isomorphism by sending x to the character of defined by evaluation : .
This is a special instance of Pontryagin duality , which holds more generally for any locally compact Abelian group .
So we know that the characters determine the group up to isomorphism in this case .
Now let ’s look at the noncommutative case .
The first value of n for which there exist two nonisomorphic noncommutative groups of order n is 8 , in which case we have the dihedral group which is the symmetries of the square , and the quaternion group .
The group has the presentation .
For a character , we need to pick a fourth root of unity for a , along with a sign for b , and the relation becomes .
Hence we see the four characters : assign to a and b in all possible ways .
The other representation can be defined by sending a and b to the matrices and .
The conjugacy classes are , so we get the following character table :
For the quaternions , we use the presentation .
Comparing with the usual definition as , we can take a=i and b=j .
This presentation shows that images of ( a , b ) under the 4 characters must be .
For the 2 - dimensional representation , we can use the standard matrix representation of the quaternions : .
The conjugacy classes are .
This looks familiar , and in fact , the character table is exactly the same as that of .
So there is no hope of recovering the group from its character table , but in fact , one can reconstruct the group from its representations .
More precisely , we need to look at the category of its representations Rep ( G ) .
So far it still looks bad because the dimensions of the hom spaces are given by inner product of characters , and the tensor product is given by multiplication , so there must be some additional information in there somewhere .
In fact there is , as Tannaka pointed out .
We consider not just Rep ( G ) , but also its forgetful functor F to Vect , the category of finite - dimensional complex vector spaces .
First we note that an element x of G gives a natural transformation from F to itself by defining to be multiplication by x whenever V is a representation .
This association realizes G as a subgroup of the monoid of natural transformations from F to itself .
Is there a way to intrinsically characterize this subgroup ?
We notice two more properties of .
First , it ’s the identity map on the trivial representation of G , and it preserves tensor products in the sense that as maps ( we ’ll call both of these properties tensor - preserving ) .
It is also self - conjugate : Given a vector space V , we define a conjugate space by and for .
Then if V is a representation , then so is by saying that where as a matrix is g with its entries conjugated .
We can conjugate a natural transformation u by defining for V a representation and x in V .
In fact , these two properties are enough : Tannaka ’s theorem says that all tensor - preserving self - conjugate natural transformations from F to itself are of the form for some x in G. Just as in the case of Pontryagin duality , Tannaka ’s theorem holds more generally for arbitrary compact groups ( one can define a topology on the set of endomorphisms of F ) .
So where ’s the Krein and where ’s the duality ?
Given the above information , one should think of Rep( G ) as a sort of dual to G , and Krein classified the categories which are of the form Rep ( G ) .
Given a category C of vector spaces with a tensor product and an involution ( the conjugation above ) , then C is dual to a compact group G if and only if the following three properties hold :
( Identity axoim )
There exists I , which is unique up to isomorphism , such that for all A. ( Krull–Schmidt axoim ) Every V can has a minimal direct sum decomposition ( the summands are not isomorphic to nontrivial direct sums ) .
( Schur ’s lemma axiom ) If A and B are minimal ( with respect to direct sum ) , then Hom ( A , B ) is 1 - dimensional if A and B are isomorphic , and is 0 otherwise .
Then C = Rep( G ) where G is the tensor - preserving self - conjugate endomorphisms of the forgetful functor F .
Things do n’t end here of course , there ’s extensions to quantum groups and algebraic groups ( Grothendieck ’s Galois theory ) , and other things .
If I ever learn this stuff , I ’ll try to write a sequel to this post .

WASHINGTON  A federal judge ruled on Thursday that some prisoners held by the United States military in Afghanistan have a right to challenge their imprisonment , dealing a blow to government efforts to detain terrorism suspects for extended periods without court oversight .
In a 53 - page ruling that rejected a claim of unfettered executive power advanced by both the Bush and Obama administrations , United States District Judge John D. Bates said that three detainees at the United States ’ Bagram Air Base had the same legal rights that the Supreme Court last year granted to prisoners held at the American naval base in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
The three detainees  two Yemenis and a Tunisian  say that they were captured outside Afghanistan and taken to Bagram , and that they have been imprisoned for more than six years without trials .
Arguing that they were not enemy combatants , the detainees want a civilian judge to review the evidence against them and order their release , under the constitutional right of habeas corpus .
The importance of Bagram as a holding site for terrorism suspects captured outside Afghanistan and Iraq has increased under the Obama administration , which prohibited the Central Intelligence Agency from using its secret prisons for long - term detention and ordered the military prison at Guantánamo closed within a year .
The administration had sought to preserve Bagram as a haven where it could detain terrorism suspects beyond the reach of American courts , telling Judge Bates in February that it agreed with the Bush administration ’s view that courts had no jurisdiction over detainees there .
The morning before the hurricane I cheated on my husband for the third time .
I suppose it had been a mistake for us to move here .
“ But , Dosy , sweetheart , I thought you loved the ocean ! ” my husband Jackson had spluttered .
“ You always said it was your favorite place growing up . ”
Actually , I had said that exactly once , on our honeymoon in Barbados right before I cheated on him for the first time with a floppy - haired BC college student who was on summer vacation with his lawyer parents and two little sisters .
But the ocean where my father had moved us for no more than ten months while I was still a girl was off the coast of Maine — a quiet , lonesome place haunted by morning fog and the shrieks of gulls from outside my bedroom window .
Sometimes , if you listened hard , you could even hear the slow , soft singing of whales in the distance .
It was the saddest , most desperate sound I have ever heard , and yet I always ached to hear it once more .
Everything there was colored a chill gray and smelled like wet fish and cold .
My husband moved us to a very different kind of ocean off the gulf of Southern Florida where he was accepted for the year as a high school music teacher .
He is a jazz pianist though , and figured he could also find work in one of the myriad of pirate - themed crab shack bars strung out along the beach for Christmas - to - Memorial - Day snowbirds .
“ It ’s either that or keep bummin ’ around here , ” he told me .
“ Not that there are n’t Ruby Tuesdays that need you to waitress down in Florida . ”
He popped the cork off a bottle of champagne that we usually saved for New Year ’s and birthdays , his cheeks flushed , eyes bright behind rimmed rectangular glasses .
“ Can you believe it , baby ?
A job offer on the ocean ! ”
He kept shaking his head , over and over again .
I swear that man was almost going to cry .
We lived in Kansas City at the time .
I ’m not an ocean girl ; that ’s not my problem .
I ’m not a city girl or a country girl or a desert girl or a mountain girl either .
And I did n’t cheat on my husband with three different men because I ’m a barfly or a black heart or a lifelong fling .
All I know is that every time it ’s happened - first in Barbados , second in a cabin by Lake Huron when we were visiting his parents , and third here , today - I ’ve been by the water .
It does something to me .
It gets under my skin through my veins into my bones and fills me with a restlessness I ca n’t explain .
That , and there was Chase the assistant marine biologist who worked bi-weekly at the local resort ’s sea life exhibition .
I first met Chase when we moved down here in late August , back when the air seemed to crinkle it was so hot and the sand crusted over and burned the soft skin of your bare toes .
I was waitressing five nights a week , my husband beginning his teaching job during the day .
It seemed as though none of the pirate crab shack bars were in any dire need of a jazz pianist for now .
For those first few weeks I spent most of my days lying out on the shore , occasionally wading into the tide to splash my neck and arms with lukewarm saltwater , and trying to avoid getting sand kicked in my face by the bronzed , boozy vacationers playing Frisbee nearby .
As evening set in I would then sneak into the local resort ’s women ’s locker room to shower and change before catching the bus to work .
The fourth day into this routine I found myself halting before entering the locker room to wander around the little touristy marine life exhibit they had set up next to the tiki - inspired , conch shell - bedazzled seaside bar .
A pinch - faced woman with lank blonde hair was standing behind the help desk counter , pointing out a brochure to a couple who looked as though they had just escaped from Pleasantville , USA .
I deliberately avoided her gaze ; I always afraid she was going to rat me out for using the locker room and not actually belonging to the resort .
With my hair damp and sand - ruffled down my arms and shoulder blades , a fraying towel wrapped around my dripping torso , and flip - flops smacking loudly against the puddled concrete floor , I skimmed the wall posters detailing the local seashells , mollusks , and water birds , ran my fingertips along the display coral , and slapped my way to the center of the arena to peer into the topless saltwater tank that seemed to be a watery cross-cut of everything squirming , swimming , and crawling in the entire Florida gulf .
I leaned over on my tip -toes .
There were fat , pale starfish suctioned to the tank ’s sides , pulsating slowly ; spindly - legged hermit crabs scuttling underneath rocks and across the sandy tank bottom ; long , dark blobs that looked like slugs on steroids ; some clam shells that were clamped shut at the bottom , others that looked like they were chattering away on barnacled rocks near the surface , and others still that zoomed backward underwater at the slightest touch .
There were violet - colored spike - balls that I assumed were what sea urchins looked like when they were still alive ; chunks of coral like yellow , wrinkled brains ; and even what appeared to be a tiny , colorless octopus clinging to the glass side of the tank , its eight squiggly little legs splayed out as if it alone should be the sea star .
“ You can touch them if you like , you know . ”
I glanced up to see this young guy in a vibrant turquoise polo , white visor , and glinting name plate grinning at me from across the tank with a kind of slanted smirk , almost as if he knew something I did n’t .
“ What ? ”
He made his way around to my side of the tank .
“ You can touch the stuff in there , ” he repeated .
“ Nothing could possibly hurt you . ”
He dunked his hand into the tank and scooped up a scurrying hermit crab , which immediately zipped back inside its minuscule butterscotch - speckled conch shell .
With his thumb and forefinger he delicately turned the shell upside down and slowly stroked the slimy crab - pad until once again a tiny leg emerged .
His skin was sun-cooked in the way of lifeguards and beach volleyball players , the hair on his arms light blonde , nearly gold .
“ I was n’t so much worried about anything in there hurting me , ” I said , reaching up and tracing the hermit crab ’s shell with the curve of my fingernail .
“ I just did n’t want to hurt them . ”
“ Ah. I see . ”
He carefully set the crab back into the tank , flicked the water droplets off his fingertips and turned back to me , grinning now with his whole face , like a little boy .
His eyes were green and his teeth were white , white .
He even had dimples .
“ Want to see a trick ? ”
I did n’t mean to I swear , but at once I found myself twisting a wet - tangled lock of hair around one finger , bending slightly forward and doing that little pop thing with my shoulder that I ’ve learned to finesse since high school when around men .
The second guy I cheated with , the one from Lake Huron , had practically drooled over it .
“ Girl , that thing you do with your shoulder is breaking my heart , ” he told me .
“ Breaking my heart . ”
“ Sure . ”
“ All right then . ”
He dipped his hand into the tank again but this time pulled up one of the clam shells .
“ Watch this . ”
He held it towards me flat in his palm , and as I leaned forward it suddenly squirted a cold stream of saltwater directly into my face .
“ Hey ! ” I squealed , burying my face into my towel .
But I was laughing , and he was laughing , and in that moment there it was , and I knew .
He set the clam back into the tank , wiped his hand on his pant leg , and held it out for me to shake .
“ Chase . ”
I shook it , hoisting up my towel underneath my arms .
“ Dosinda . ” Little shoulder pop .
He raised his eyebrows .
“ Dosinda ... that ’s a pretty name .
It sounds Spanish . ”
I nodded .
“ My mom ’s Mexican . ”
He raised his eyebrows even higher and tilted his head slightly .
I get that a lot : my hair , red , my eyes , blue , my skin , freckled and rose - pale .
Not a trace of a Hispanic trill in my voice .
I do n’t even like tacos .
But that ’s what happens when you grow up as an army brat with an Irish Catholic father from the Midwest with the last name of McGinty and a firm belief that English is the only language that should be spoken in the entire world , much less in central Illinois .
You ’re Dosinda Maria McGinty for the first twenty - three years of your life , and then you ’re dropping out of community college to marry Jackson Hall , a music teacher from Missouri who you convince yourself that you love .
And then you ’re moving to Florida with him and flirting with a marine biologist until you realize with a start that here you are and you ’re already late for tonight ’s shift at Jolly Blackbeard ’s Crab Shack Bar .
The second time I saw Chase was a week later on a day so hot it felt like I was trying to breathe through a sodden rag .
I was walking along the shore , absentmindedly picking through sea shells , when I came across the most bizarre - looking , dried - up little thing I had ever seen .
It was the same color and feel as a sand dollar and could almost be labeled as starfish except that , emerging from its tiny circular center , were five spindly limbs twisted into the curl of a pinwheel .
I gently picked up the thing by its center between my thumb and forefinger and placed it flat in my palm .
It almost looked as though five crusted - dried earthworms were smashed together by their ends , like an alien washed up on shore .
“ Brittle star . ”
Chase bounced it lightly in his hand .
Today he was wearing a sherbet orange polo and the same crisp white visor .
“ You ’re right to think it ’s some kind of starfish , though .
Brittle stars are very rare .
It ’s the second class of starfish , called Ophiuridea .
The first is Asteroidea , which includes your basic sea stars , you know , the Beaded , the Netted , the Spiny Beaded , the Sugar ... ”
He grinned sheepishly and handed it back to me .
“ Sorry , that ’s probably a little more than you needed to know . ”
I laughed a little as I took back the brittle star .
“ That ’s all right ; I actually think it ’s all fascinating . ”
I shifted in my flip - flops .
“ It was just so strange that I had to ask you . ”
He grinned in that knowing way again .
“ I tend to come across a lot of strange things . ”
I felt myself coloring slightly , and although I could n’t be entirely sure , I thought I saw him wink .
“ I like strange . ”
My father , when he was home , yelled a lot .
Not so much at me , or at least when I was still small , but mostly at my mother .
When he was gone she was a real sass , a spitfire , out all night and lounging about the house by day , chain - smoking in only her long silk nightgown with cigarette burns and her flashy turquoise jewelry , necklaces , earrings , bracelets , rings .
She said what she wanted .
She did as she pleased .
She told me stories of Mexico and of the wailing ghost - lady La llorona , an Indian peasant girl who slept with a rich man and drowned her two children when he left her for a noblewoman .
She was doomed to roam the river banks and ocean shores of Mexico forever , shrouded in black , weeping and wailing for what she had done .
My mother would tell me this story , take a long drag on her cigarette , and then grab me suddenly by the shoulders so that I would scream .
“ La llorona ! ” she would shriek with wild laughter .
“ She ’s got you ! ”
But when my father was home my mother would shrink into her own black shroud , cowering behind the kitchen counter or beside the living room sofa or even at his feet , on the floor .
He would call her names I did n’t understand but knew were barbed with meanness and hate .
Barricaded behind my bedroom door by my mother in Springfield , Atlanta , Denver , Lexington , St. Louis , the wet - gray coast of Maine , I curled myself tight so that I was small and pressed my palms to my earlobes , screwing shut my eyes .
I could n’t figure out why my father was so angry and why he would call my mother a horse .
Was he trying to say that she was horse - faced , as ugly as an animal ?
She was n’t - she was beautiful : dark - skinned with eyes like liquid bright and a diamond collarbone and long black hair thick as a pony ’s mane .
It was n’t until many years later that I understood why my father was yelling .
The third time I saw Chase was several weeks after I had discovered my strange little brittle star , the morning before Hurricane Grace was supposed to hit the Florida gulf .
I awoke that morning to the rustle of wind outside the window and an unnatural jostling coming from the kitchen .
Sleep - tousled and yawning , I rose from the empty bed and padded into the kitchen to find Jackson , my husband , rummaging around in the kitchen drawers .
“ Should n’t you be at work ? ” I asked blearily .
He stood upright and flashed a grin at me , a wide - bottomed candle in one hand and an industrial - strength flashlight in the other .
“ I just got up early to stock up on some stuff , you know , for tomorrow . ”
Since we lived a bus - ride away from the shore we were n’t really supposed to be in a lot of danger from the hurricane , but The Weather Channel did advise to keep some candles , flashlights , and jugs of water on hand just in case the power went out .
He just looked so excited about it though , as if it were going to be this great adventure .
As he put the things away , grabbed his satchel from the counter , and kissed my forehead goodbye , a part of me wanted to hit him hard and not stop .
I wanted to yell in his face that life was n’t Boy Scouts anymore and that I did n’t need saving or protection from anyone .
I took the Metro to the beach that morning , ignored the boarded - up windows from the shops all around , the clouded sky , the rushing wind , and the entirely deserted shore .
Inside the marine life exhibition , the saltwater tank and all of its little sea creatures had been taken away , the walls stripped of its charts and posters , the display coral gone .
But , in his lime green polo shirt , bright white visor , and khakis , Chase was there , stuffing a stack of brochures into a small cardboard box .
He looked up at me when I entered , grinned .
I went back to his place with him that morning .
Just this once , I told myself .
That had been my rule for the other two times : only once with the college boy in Barbados and only once with the man at Lake Huron .
Only at their place , and then we ’d never see each other again .
My husband would never have to know .
Afterwards , we lay quiet for a while , tangled in his bed sheets , listening to the sounds of the wind outside the window .
The walls creaked and the branches tapped against the windowpane , showering petals of crepe myrtle every time .
He rolled over .
“ Did you know , ” he said , tracing the curve behind my ear and down my neckline to the points of my collarbone , “ that starfish are actually violent predators ? ”
I smiled , sighing at his touch .
“ Mhmm ... I thought they just kind of floated around , actually , or sucked in algae or something . ”
“ Nope . ” He leaned down and nibbled on my earlobe , pulling the skin almost enough for it to hurt .
I gave a tiny squeal .
“ They eat mollusks and all kinds of other stuff .
Vicious and beautiful . ”
He lifted my chin and kissed the delicate skin there .
“ Like you . ”
I sat up on my elbows , my stomach twisting uncomfortably .
“ What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
He shrugged .
“ I mean , you ’re a beautiful woman , but , damn ... you ’re married . ”
My heart began to jack - hammer against my ribs .
I was n’t wearing my wedding ring , and I had n’t told Chase that I was married .
The other two had known , and it had n’t mattered to them , but I did n’t want to tell Chase .
In a moment of sheer panic , I decided to play innocent .
“ What ? ”
He cleared his throat .
“ Julie , that woman who works the help desk with me , you know ?
She knows your husband .
Her kid is in his music class or something and I guess she met him at a parent ’s conference .
Told her all about his gorgeous little red-head Mexican wife Dosinda and that she goes to the beach nearly every day .
Said she should look out for her . ”
He would n’t quite meet my eye .
“ She ’s not an easy one to miss . ”
I suddenly felt like a knife had just been thrust into my lungs .
I could n’t think of what to say .
I just sat there on my elbows , in someone else ’s bed , wearing nothing but a sheet , my mouth gaping like a stupid , hooked fish on a line .
I thought of my husband popping the champagne bottle before our big move here , rummaging around our kitchen with fresh candles and flashlights , rambling on and on to this random woman about me .
This morning when we lay in bed before we both awoke , his breath rising and falling against the nape of my neck , his hand resting on the curve of my side , so soft that I almost could n’t feel it there .
And I thought of how he could never , and would never , be able to make me happy .
We did n’t speak , the silence rising between us like a monsoon .
I found that I also could n’t meet his eye .
Finally , I swallowed hard .
“ I should go . ”
I caught a Metro on his street corner ; he had n’t offered to drive me home .
My husband would n’t be back from work for several hours , but instead of getting off at our stop I waited until the bus drove past the ocean .
The wind was much stronger now , the clouds bunched and gathered like blanket rumples , and as I rolled up my jeans and walked along the shore , my sandals dangling from one hand , there was even a cold spattering of rain .
The sea was a dark , brewing gray , the waves frothy and hurling , and above me seagulls careened and shrieked their calls .
I longed to hear those childhood whales .
My foot clamped down on something hard but soft , something still alive .
I quickly stepped back and glanced down : a sea star .
Swiftly I bent to my haunches and scooped it up in my hand .
Against my palm I could feel a twitch , its tiny feelers , searching .
It did n’t look so vicious to me .
In fact , it was probably dying , out of water , far from its home .
I did n’t care how wet I got my jeans .
Wading into the gray , tumbling water up to my knees , I dunked my arm into the waves and let go .
As I sloshed my way back to shore , my hair whipping around my face and my skin trembling with the chill of salt - spray , I knew that what I had just done was worthless and that the little sea star would probably just wash up to shore again within minutes .
Actually , by the time the hurricane had blown through this beach would probably be littered with starfish , mollusks , crabs , and gaping fish , all either bone - dry or scale - slimy and long dead .
But still , I could n’t bear not to do it .
I just could n’t let it be alone .
Part of the Ruby language was influenced by functional programming techniques .
Ruby programmers then adopted techniques from Erlang or Haskell with , or created bridges to these languages , eg. Erlectricity .
Larry Diehl brings a declarative concurrent model to Ruby by importing the concept of unification from Oz Language .
Oz is a multiparadigm programming language .
It is mainly known as a functional ( lazy and eager evaluation ) , distributed , and concurrent programming language , but also supports constraint , logic , imperative and object - oriented programming .
In light of the rising number of processor cores , Larry wanted to take advantage of the declarative concurrency model in Ruby .
The advantages are :
It is easy to reason about what the program does
Simple but powerful concurrency is possible
To accomplish this , Larry uses the concept of Dataflow threading behavior as described in Concepts , Techniques , and Models of Computer Programming :
What happens if an operation tries to use a variable that is not yet bound ?
From a purely aesthetic point of view , it would be nice if the operation would simply wait .
Perhaps some other thread will bind the variable , and then the operationcan continue .
This civilized behavior is known as dataflow .
And to realize this the Oz - way , he uses unification :
The idea of unification is to describe values by logical equations which can be resolved automatically by some unification algorithm
Practically this will be transcribed this way ( from the project site ) :
# Local variables include Dataflow local do |x , y , z| # notice how the order automatically gets resolved Thread .
new { unify y , x + 2 } Thread .new { unify z , y + 3 } Thread .new { unify x , 1 } z #= > 6 end
You create new variables with local or declare ( for Instance variable ) , and use unify to bind variables .
Examples of Oz Ports ( nondeterministic behavior ) , or Erlang - ish Actors is provided .
Brian Morearty adresses some interesting debugging , performance , and memory concerns of Dataflow usage .
Larry Diehl points out on Brian 's blog :
One thing to note is that this library makes JRuby shine over MRI due to its green threads + native thread pool implementation .
Limbaugh says that if Powell is going to keep criticizing the GOP , he may as well become a Democrat .
Rush to Powell : Go be a Democrat
Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh Wednesday that if former Secretary of State Colin Powell is going to keep criticizing the GOP , he may as well leave the party and become a Democrat — adding that Powell ’s endorsement of Barack Obama was “ purely and solely based on race . ”
“ He 's just mad at me because I ’m the one person in the country that had the guts to explain his endorsement of Obama , ” Limbaugh said on his radio show .
“ There can be no other explanation for it . ”

“ What Colin Powell needs to do is close the loop and become a Democrat , instead of claiming to be a Republican interested in reforming the Republican Party .
He 's not .
He 's a full - fledged Democrat , ” Limbaugh said .
“ He 's out there saying I am killing the Republican Party while he endorsed and voted for Obama , ” Limbaugh added .
“ The Republican Party nominated the exact kind of candidate Colin Powell thinks the Republican Party should have and he still endorsed Obama . ”
Speaking Sunday to CNN host Fareed Zakaria asked Powell if Republicans can “ continue to listen to Rush Limbaugh ? "
“ Is this really the kind of party that we want to be when these kinds of spokespersons seem to appeal to our lesser instincts rather than our better instincts ? "
Powell replied .

Oracle 's recent move to acquire Sun has placed the responsibility for advancing MySQL development into the hands of the project 's most prominent competitor .
The move is of deep concern to MySQL stakeholders and has created some uncertainty about the future of the popular open source database system .
Some key developers in the MySQL community are launching a new coalition called the Open Database Alliance which intends to coordinate collaborative MySQL development .
The alliance — which currently consists of Monty Program Ab , Percona , and OpenQuery — aims to provide an inclusive , vendor - neutral environment for moving forward MySQL development .
Their efforts will attempt to insulate MySQL from Oracle 's competitive interests by giving the collective MySQL community enough leverage to control the project 's destiny .
Sun acquired MySQL
Ab — the company behind MySQL development — last year as part of a broader strategy to make its own technologies look more compelling as an alterantive to the conventional Linux / Apache / MySQL / PHP ( LAMP ) stack .
Sun 's stewardship of the project was controversial and led to some friction .
MySQL cofounders David Axmark and Monty Widenius both left Sun after the acquisition , citing frustration with management and dissatisfaction with the direction of MySQL development under Sun .
Widenius was particularly unhappy with new release management practices that were instated following the acquisition .
After leaving Sun , Widenius launched Monty Program Ab , a company that provides MySQL engineering services and focuses heavily on developing the Maria MySQL storage engine .
The company also develops MariaDB , a compatible " drop - in " replacement for MySQL , based on the original source code .
When Sun was acquired by Oracle last month , Widenius said that Monty Program Ab could play a vital role in building a new community - driven development model for MySQL by moving MariaDB forward , making the project more independent and participatory .
The Open Database Alliance appears to be an impressive first step in that direction .
Ars discussed the Open Database Alliance with Kurt von Finck , the Chief Community and Communications Officer of Monty Program Ab .
He explained some of the details of the alliance 's plans and how the group will serve the MySQL community .
At the present time , the organization has no clearly defined formal structure or governance model .
According to von Finck , the first participants hope to build more momentum around the concept before they decide how the group should operate .
This will allow incoming members to have a voice in the process as the alliance expands .
Organic growth is important at this stage , von Finck says , and it will be easier to determine what kind of organizational structure works best after the group achieves critical mass .
The alliance 's relationship with Oracle is also not yet clearly defined .
Monty Program
Ab characterizes its work on MariaDB as a MySQL fork .
After Oracle completes its acquisition of Sun , Oracle could adopt Monty Program Ab 's fork , accept patches from it , or simply ignore it and allow the codebases to further diverge .
Monty Program
Ab and the alliance are prepared to serve as the primary upstream source of MySQL derivative source code in the form of MariaDB , says von Finck .
If Oracle ceases development entirely or maintains its version in a manner that is unpalatable to the broader MySQL community , the alliance provides a crucial safety net for users , guaranteeing that MySQL ( as MariaDB ) will continue to be developed in an open fashion , regardless of what Oracle does with the project .
The alliance will serve other roles , too .
The member companies will share work and refer customers to each other in order to make sure that MySQL users always have access to the specific kind of commercial support that they require .
Sun tried to be a one - stop shop for every kind of MySQL support , an approach that von Finck believes is not always conducive to providing uniformly high - quality service .
Specialized companies , he says , are often better equipped to address the unique technical needs of individual MySQL users .
Through the alliance , MySQL users will be able to find the support companies that are best - suited to deliver the kind of service that they require , whether it 's custom engineering , scalability expertise , training , or any number of other areas .
The alliance will make it easier for these support companies to work together effectively .
Widenius wants to keep the headcount at Monty Program Ab under 40 people , says von Finck , which means that it wo n't be able to do everything by itself .
The growth of the alliance will help boost diversity and competition , turning MariaDB support into a vibrant industry that is n't controlled by any single dominant vendor .
Although diversity has a lot of value , the risk is that it could lead to further forking and diminish overall compatibility between versions of the software that are maintained by various companies .
We have seen this happen in the Linux distribution space , where variance between distros has detracted from interoperability and created significant portability challenges .
von
Finck believes that such problems can largely be averted — or at least reduced — - in the MySQL community by offering a high level of transparency and inclusiveness in the upstream environment .
He contends that Sun did n't always maintain good relations with the development community outside of the company , forcing third - party developers to make changes downstream .
The alliance will strive to make sure that third - parties have direct access to the people building relevant parts of MariaDB 's architecture so that their needs can be accommodated and compatibility can be maintained .
Offering a more transparent and accessible upstream environment will reduce the barriers to entry that often compel people to create forks , von Finck explains .
The MySQL relational database system is arguably one of the most important pieces of open source server software in existence .
There are millions of active deployments , and it used to power some of the most popular websites on the Internet .
The Open Database Alliance has the potential to take MySQL to the next level by making MariaDB more open and community - driven .
The group will also provide much - needed leadership and a unified front for moving the project forward and into independence , ending the doubt created by Oracle 's pending acquisition of Sun .

It was the best line in her Observer article that clinched it .
" You Tube if you want to , " wrote Hazel Blears on Sunday .
" But it 's no substitute for knocking on doors or setting up a stall in the town centre . "
The echo was intended .
And it was completely unmissable .
On October 10 1980 , Margaret Thatcher had made a defiant speech to the Tory conference in Brighton .
It contained a line that still defines her nearly three decades later .
" You turn if you want to , " she said .
" The lady 's not for turning . "
As a piece of explicit , self - aware political homage , Blears 's line could hardly have been more obvious or – given
Thatcher 's massive political achievements and iconic status – more audacious .
It emboldens me to suggest an idea I have been mulling for some time .
Here it is .
Hazel Blears may just have it in her to be Labour 's Margaret Thatcher .
The parallel is not as crazy as it sounds .
Think about the comparisons .
First and most obviously there 's the gender issue .
Yes , they are both women .
Like most successful women in a predominantly male political culture , they have spent their early ministerial careers being mercilessly patronised – Thatcher for being a Tory housewife , Blears for being a Labour cheerleader .
But because Thatcher was both so readily patronised , she was also seriously underestimated .
The same is true of Blears – as George Monbiot is the latest to discover .
Thatcher , a woman from a Methodist upbringing who qualified as a lawyer before becoming an MP , was always a much smarter and braver politician than the men in her party ever realised – until it was too late .
Blears has not run for the Labour leadership yet , and maybe she never will , but she too is a woman with a Methodist background who is also a qualified lawyer and now an MP .
And she is certainly much smarter than she is given credit for .
She may prove to be a brave politician too – if the Observer article is anything to go by .
The comparisons go further .
Thatcher always prided herself on having a gut feeling about " our people " , by which she meant hard - working , law - abiding , aspirational Tory voters from the London suburbs .
Blears has an almost uncannily comparable sense of connection with her own voters .
Except that in her case she means hard - working , law - abiding , aspirational Labour voters from industrial Lancashire .
Thatcher always had a profound sense of being an outsider , about not being a member of the London establishment .
Blears has a very similar sense of being rooted in Salford and not being part of the metropolitan elite either .
( It is one of the things that in turn distinguishes Blears from that other Labour woman solicitor turned minister , Harriet Harman – it is no secret that the two Labour women , the one northern and working - class , the other southern and middle - class , are not political sisters ) .
After some dire performances early on , Thatcher managed to fuse her ambition with her other formidable qualities into a potent populist mix which most of her own party adored and which her opponents loathed .
It was a combative brew that enabled Thatcher to blast through every political glass ceiling .
At 53 she became Britain 's first woman prime minister , 30 years ago this week .
Blears has made some people cringe on her way up – just as Thatcher did .
But could Blears , 53 this month , do for Labour what Thatcher did for the Tories ?
I would n't rule it out at all .
Labour 's and Blears ''s situations today are , of course , very different from that of the Tories when Thatcher ousted Ted Heath in 1975 .
Most obviously of all , the Tories were in opposition while Labour is still , just about , in government .
And Blears will never simply be some inverted image of Thatcher .
Politics is n't like that .
Nor are people .
Yet if you look at the Labour party today and try to imagine a current minister of either sex with unchallengeably authentic political roots , an aspirational life story that image makers dream of , a clear sense of where she 's coming from , an irresistible confidence in her own instincts , a clear set of convictions , and the potential to turn herself into an iconic political figurehead , you do n't find many better candidates than Blears .
I doubt if many people have considered Blears as a truly major political figure .
She is n't even mentioned in those lists of odds from Ladbrokes about Gordon Brown 's successor .
But that was true of Thatcher too .
When Thatcher challenged Heath , she was mocked and underestimated .
British politics in the 1970s did n't know it at the time , but it was ready for a good woman leader .
No one laughs at Thatcher now .
Something similar may be true today – and that good woman leader , if she plays her hand well and audaciously , could just be Hazel Blears .

The governor and Democratic lawmakers in New York will attempt to patch an $ 18 billion budget deficit by imposing much higher taxes on the richest residents , joining several states considering such a move this year .
Under a proposal by Gov. David Paterson , New York would follow California and Maryland in pushing its top earners into higher tax brackets that are several percentage points more than what most earners pay .
And New Jersey is considering raising its top - tier income taxes even higher , to more than 10 % compared with ...
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New York wants to install up to 100 megawatts of solar photovoltaic power at public and private facilities to help meet the state ’s aggressive renewable mandate , the governor said in a release Friday .
Solar photovoltaic panels are seen at Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas , Nevada in this picture taken August 1 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Steve Marcus
Specifically , the state - owned power generating company , the New York Power Authority ( NYPA ) , will seek parties interested in entering into public - private partnerships with the state to install the solar arrays .
The solar power generated by the arrays would power about 15,000 homes , according to NYPA .
Proposals are due by July 7 .
The state said any proposals it selects would likely start in 2010 .
The solar power would help the state meet the governor ’s 45 - by - 15 program .
By 2015 , the governor wants New York to receive 45 percent of its electricity through energy efficiency and renewable power .
The state has estimated the 45 - by - 15 program would create about 50,000 new jobs .
Officials at the governor ’s office were not immediately available for comment .
The state did not estimate how much it would cost to build 100 MW of solar power .
Solar photovoltaic power is one of the most expensive types of generation .
A kilowatt costs an estimated $ 6,000 , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
It could cost about $ 600 million to build 100 MW of solar photovoltaic power .
Wind power , meanwhile , costs about $ 1,900 per kilowatt to build onshore and $ 3,800 per kilowatt offshore , while combined cycle natural gas - fired generation costs about $ 1,000 per kilowatt and coal - fired generation costs about $ 2,000 per kilowatt .
Unlike natural gas and coal - fired generation , wind and solar power are only available about a third of the time .

Low - cost process produces natural gas from algae
DOE lab licenses high - yield gasification technology
News Release
May 06 , 2009
RICHLAND , Wash . —
A new method for converting algae into renewable natural gas for use in pipelines and power generation has been transferred from the Department of Energy ’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to the marketplace under a license between Genifuel Corporation and Battelle .
The method , called catalytic hydrothermal gasification , creates natural gas out of algae – more quickly , more efficiently and at higher yields than other biofuel processes .
Genifuel expects the process also requires less capital investment .
The license agreement moves this technology for renewable energy production a step closer to commercial reality .
Battelle operates PNNL for DOE .
“ Algae and other aquatic biomass hold significant promise for our country ’s ability to produce renewable energy domestically , ” said Genifuel President Jim Oyler .
“ At Genifuel we have developed efficient growth and harvesting techniques for the aquatic biomass .
With this gasification process , we can convert the biomass to a clean fuel that is almost completely carbon - neutral . ”
He calls the PNNL process an “ elegant system , ” noting that more than 99 percent of the biomass is gasified to produce renewable natural gas and byproducts such as carbon dioxide which can be recycled and reused in the algae growth ponds .
PNNL originally developed the catalytic gasification process to clean up industrial and food processing waste as an alternative to incineration .
Over the past 10 years , PNNL scientists advanced the technology to include a more stable catalyst that enables it to also convert wet biomass , such as algae .
PNNL has tested the gasifier with terrestrial plants , kelp and water hyacinths .
It works especially well for aquatic biomass such as algae , because the feedstock does n’t require drying before fuel production .
Battelle granted Genifuel an exclusive license for the technology .
As a national laboratory , one of PNNL ’s missions is to advance science and technology toward solutions that industry can take to the marketplace .
“ Electricity produced from this natural gas can help electric utilities meet Renewable Portfolio Standards that require renewable energy sources , ” Oyler said .
“ Existing natural gas pipelines can deliver the fuel , or it can be used to produce electricity onsite in conventional natural - gas turbine generators . ”
The PNNL gasifier runs at relatively low temperatures – 350 - degrees Celsius compared with 700 - degrees or more for other systems – in a small stainless steel reactor .
According to Doug Elliott , the PNNL scientist who invented the gasification process , “ It is simple – we put wet biomass like algae in the gasifier , where it is catalytically converted , and we collect fuel gas and byproducts .
“ It ’s serendipity that our system creates carbon dioxide as a byproduct that Genifuel needs naturally to grow the algae , ” he said .
“ It ’s a completely green process . ”
Compared with other methods of gasifying biomass , such as anaerobic digestion , PNNL ’s process works 400 times faster and gives higher yields .
While simple in concept , the science behind the gasification process is actually quite complex .
The technology has been under development for a number of years .
PNNL scientists have achieved significant advances in the chemistry of catalysts and the selection of the optimum temperatures and pressures for the process , as well as improving the systems to protect the catalyst from impurities in the biomass .
PNNL scientists have extensive expertise in catalysis and reaction engineering , with particular focus on solutions for efficient use of bioproducts , converting biomass and renewable feedstocks to fuels and chemicals , and reducing environmental emissions .
Genifuel grows aquatic biomass , such as algae , in shallow ponds or troughs , then harvests and processes the biomass for conversion using the PNNL technology .
Water used in the growth ponds does n’t have to be high - quality fresh water , and can be treated wastewater , brackish or alkaline water , or even salt water , Oyler said .
Non-crop land can be used , so the process does n’t compete with food production .

The United Nations ( UN ) has sent open letters criticizing two major non governmental organizations ( ngo ) for not accurately describing recent events in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
An official from the United Nations ’ Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( MONUC ) says recent reports released by Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) and Oxfam failed to correctly condemn major atrocities within Congo .
Alan Dosses ’ letter to Oxfam stated that the ngo had failed to condemn the atrocities relayed by the survivors it interviewed .
In his open letter to Human Rights Watch the special representative pointed to several reporting errors in the organizations literature .
And concluding by saying he had hoped HRW would share the ambition to end instability and poverty which has continued to ravage provinces in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
On a map of Baghdad , the US Army 's Forward Operating Base Falcon is clearly within city limits .
Except that Iraqi and American military officials have decided it 's not .
As the June 30 deadline for US soldiers to be out of Iraqi cities approaches , there are no plans to relocate the roughly 3,000 American troops who help maintain security in south Baghdad along what were the fault lines in the sectarian war .
" We and the Iraqis decided it was n't in the city , " says a US military official .
The base on the southern outskirts of Baghdad 's Rasheed district is an example of the fluidity of the Status of Forces Agreement ( SOFA ) agreed to late last year , which orders all US combat forces out of Iraqi cities , towns , and villages by June 30 .
" We consider the security agreement a living document , " says a senior US commander .
With six weeks to go , US and Iraqi commanders are sitting down in joint security committees to determine how they can comply with the decree that all US combat forces withdraw from populated areas by the end of June and still maintain the requirement to assist Iraq in fighting the insurgency and maintaining security and stability .
" [ The Iraqis are ] clear in their intention , less clear in their implementation , " says the senior military official , who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the subject .
Complexity of operating under SOFA
The security agreement , which took effect five months ago and charts the US - Iraqi relationship for years to come , is also being tested in murkier waters , such as the US right to self - defense .
A US - led raid in the southern Iraqi city of Kut last month , in which an Iraqi woman was killed in the crossfire , prompted protests in the streets .
Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki called the operation a crime and demanded that the American soldiers involved be turned over to Iraqi courts , saying the raid violated the terms of the security agreement .
US officials say they had valid warrants for the operation targeting suspected members of Iranian - funded Shiite militias involved in weapons smuggling .
One suspect was killed in the raid and six others detained before Iraqi authorities ordered their release .
One US military official said that although Iraqi authorities had been notified of the raid in advance , those authorities maintained they had not approved it .
He said the US side believed it was exercising its right to self - defense under the agreement when the raid turned violent .
The US military offered condolences and was believed to have paid compensation to the family of the woman killed .
" Kut shone a brighter light on the complexity of what we are facing , " says the senior US commander .
US extension in volatile areas ?
A major question ahead of the June 30 deadline – whether US troops will be asked to stay in the volatile cities of Mosul and those in Diyala Province – is still unanswered .
Senior Iraqi military officials are expected to recommend to Mr. Maliki that US combat forces remain in those areas to help fight an ongoing insurgency .
Maliki publicly has said he will not extend the deadline but privately is believed to be willing to consider it .
As commander in chief of the Iraqi Security Forces , Maliki has the final decision on whether to ask US forces to stay .
Some US and Iraqi officials suspect that his hard - line rhetoric is almost purely for political purposes in a country where people are widely opposed to the continued presence of US forces .
The Iraqi parliament voted to approve the SOFA late last year only after linking it to a referendum this summer which would allow Iraqis to vote on whether US troops should leave sooner than the end of 2011 .
With Maliki 's public insistence that there will be no extension for US forces , plans for the promised referendum appear to have quietly disappeared .
" We promise a lot of things we do n't deliver , " says one Iraqi member of parliament when asked about the poll .
' We 've never known how to be guests '
Apart from the issue of designating US bases as inside or outside cities , Iraqi authorities are also approving the existence of combat troops within select joint security stations in and around Baghdad to be able to maintain security in places that have been key to the reduction in violence , a US military official says .
Although the mission for most brigades and battalions is not expected to substantially change after June 30 , US military officials have stopped using the term forward operating base in favor of the more benign - sounding contingency operating site .
The SOFA and a wider strategic framework agreement set out a relationship between the US and Iraq very different from that of the military occupation of the past six years .
" We have acknowledged that the government of Iraq leads the nation .
We are their guests , " says the senior US commander .
" We 've never known how to be guests , " says a US military official in the field .
US - Iraqi partnership : ' A delicate choreography '
One of the challenges of that new relationship is how the US can continue to wield influence on key decisions without being seen to do so .
" For so long we have been one of the driving forces here ... it is such a hard habit to break , " says a senior US State Department official .
" I think we need to do everything we can not to make ourselves an issue . "
As well as security , he says , the United States still has a role to play in promoting Sunni - Shiite reconciliation , tamping down Arab - Kurdish tensions , and fostering effective governance and economic growth – all of which have an impact on security .
" It has to be seen here as doing it quietly ... so that you are not doing things for the Iraqis , the Iraqis are doing things for themselves but with your help and we remain in the shadows ....
It 's a very delicate choreography , " adds the State Department official .
US concern : Political turmoil after 2010 elections
All of that is being worked out against the backdrop of two crucial deadlines : August 2010 for all combat troops to be out of Iraq and the end of 2011 for US forces to withdraw completely .
In between , there are key Iraqi events that will likely lead to increased tensions , including national elections planned for January .
" We are planning against a finite end and a finite timeline from a US perspective , " says the senior commander , saying that a potential security vacuum amid the political turmoil of a new Iraqi government next year is one of the coalition 's biggest concerns .
Despite Maliki's hard - line statements rejecting a continued US troop presence here , many US and Iraqi officials say they continue to believe the two sides will come up with a new arrangement after the current agreement expires .
" If our long - term goal is strategic partnership in Iraq , I would suspect beyond 2011 we would have some kind of long - term presence here , " says the senior US commander .
OXFORD , Mississippi ( CNN ) --
The average potency of marijuana , which has risen steadily for three decades , has exceeded 10 percent for the first time , the U.S. government will report on Thursday .
Mahmoud ElSohly says marijuana 's potency will continue to rise before tailing off in the next five years .
Scientists working for the government predict that potency , as measured by the drug 's concentration of the psychoactive ingredient THC , will continue to rise .
At the University of Mississippi's Potency Monitoring Project , where thousands of samples of seized marijuana are tested every year , project director Mahmoud ElSohly said some samples have THC levels exceeding 30 percent .
Average THC concentrations will continue to climb before leveling off at 15 percent or 16 percent in five to 10 years , ElSohly predicted .
The stronger marijuana is of particular concern because high concentrations of THC have the opposite effect of low concentrations , officials say .
In addition , while experienced marijuana users may limit their intake of potent marijuana , young and inexperienced users may not moderate their intake and possibly suffer from dysphoria , paranoia , irritability and other negative effects .

Potent marijuana also poses significant risk to the developing adolescent brain , said Edward Jurith , acting director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy .

Increasing potency is leading to higher admissions to emergency rooms and drug treatment programs , officials say .
The average THC for tested marijuana during 2008 was 10.1 percent , according to the government , compared to 1983 when it was reportedly under 4 percent .
Even drugs seized at the United States ' southwest border are showing increasing potency , the Office of National Drug Control Policy says .
The median potency increased from 4.8 percent in 2003 to 7.3 percent in 2007 .
Marijuana from Mexico and other southern sources traditionally had lower THC content than other sources ' .
" The children I 'm most worried about are children who are heavy users ... people who use it on a daily basis , " said Dr. Lawrence Brain , a child psychiatrist in Maryland .
Lloyd D. Johnston , a University of Michigan professor who has spent 35 years studying youth drug use , said youth marijuana use has fluctuated dramatically over that period .
" One of the driving forces of that ... is the degree to which young people think that marijuana is dangerous , " he said .
" Perceived risk has usually been a leading indicator of changes . "
News about potency is not likely to change adolescents ' behavior , Brain said .
" I 'm not advocating the use of marijuana at all , " he said .
" But in some ways , it is out there .
...
Telling them it's 10 percent -- three times more potent than what their parents smoked -- is not an argument they are likely to buy into or to even utilize in any constructive sort of way .
" I think they do what they do today .
I do n't think they consider or reflect on what it might have been like 30 years ago . "

ABCs of Web 2.0 ABCs of Web 2.0
By Sharon Housley Web 2.0 is a perceived transition of the Web to web - based applications .
Web 2.0 is the next generation of technology solutions where interactive content is the norm .
There is no agreement on exactly what Web 2.0 means .
Depending on who you are speaking with , you may receive different explanations .
At it 's heart , Web 2.0 is about the maturity of the Web .
While many refer to Web 2.0 as companies that employ powerful web technologies , the key components of Web 2.0 are said to include : the Web as a platform , collaboration , and syndication .
Here are the ABC's of Web 2.0 ...
A - Ajax Ajax is an abbreviation for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML , and is a web development technique for creative interactive web applications .
Many Web 2.0 websites use Ajax to interact with website visitors .
B - Blog Blogs are web logs that are updated regularly , usually on a daily basis .
They contain information related to a specific topic .
In many cases , blogs are used simply as daily diaries about people 's personal lives , political views , or even as social commentaries .
The truth of the matter is that blogs can be shaped into whatever you , the author , want them to be .
C - Collaboration Collaboration is a hallmark of Web 2.0 .
Building communities and developing content from multiple contributors is part of what is unique about these second - generation websites .
D - Dynamic Content Dynamic content refers to content which is obtained from another source , and which is automatically updated whenever the source content changes .
E - ECommerce Ecommerce comes from the phrase Electronic Commerce , which basically means selling things over the Internet .
Many websites now conduct financial transactions over the Internet .
Ecommerce is simply a vehicle for collecting payments online .
F - Folksonomy Folksonomy is a means of classifying and categorizing data on the web through collaborative efforts from the online community .
While not strictly synonymous to the term , this is more commonly known as tagging , where keywords are associated with items or links .
The keywords are used to classify the items .
G - Global Navigation Global navigation refers to a somewhat standardized navigational menu structure that encompasses all the main pages on the website .
Regardless of the particular web page you are on , you can navigate to any other part of the website using the global navigation system .
H - Hosted Application Hosted applications are typically interactive programs that reside on the Internet , and are designed to run on the Internet rather than being downloaded and installed on the user 's computer .
I - Information Architecture Information architecture describes the structure and methodology by which information ( such as website content ) is organized .
J - JavaScript JavaScript is a cross-platform , object - based scripting language developed by Netscape for client and server applications .
It is commonly used in web pages to add interactivity and to dynamically update content .
K - Knowledgebase
A knowledgebase is a collection of facts , rules , and procedures that are organized into a searchable format .
In Web 2.0 , website knowledgebases are usually interactive .
L - Long Tail
The phrase long tail pertains to search engine results .
The long tail of search follows the thinking that the combined total results of multiple less - popular terms will exceed the results of a single more - popular term .
Many webmasters have given up their hope of ranking well for the extremely popular terms , and instead are focused on ranking well for the less - popular but more abundant terms or phrases .
M - Mashups Mashups are the result of merging content from a variety of different sources , and thus creating new content based on the merging and filtering of the resulting content .
N - Newsreader
A newsreader is a software tool or web application that is used to read and manage RSS feeds .
O - OPML OPML stands for Outline Processor Markup Language , and is a standard for people wishing to import or export their RSS feed subscriptions .
P - Podcasting Podcasting is online audio content that is delivered via an RSS feed .
Many people equate podcasting to radio on demand .
However , in reality , podcasting offers far more options in terms of content and programming than radio does .
In addition , podcast listeners can determine the time and the place of their listening , meaning that they decide what programming they want to receive and when they want to listen to it .
Listeners can retain audio archives to listen to at their leisure .
While blogs have turned many bloggers into journalists , podcasting has the potential to turn podcasters into radio personalities .
Q - Query
A query is a phrase or a group of words , possibly combined with other syntax , used to pass instructions to a search engine or a directory in order to locate web pages .
R - RSS RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication , and is a standard for syndicating content online .
RSS feeds are used to provide real - time information to interested parties .
S - Social Bookmarking Social bookmarking and social networks are collaborative efforts that use democracy and voting to influence the importance of items that are bookmarked .
T - Tags
Tags are descriptive keywords that are used to classify and categorize items or URLs on social networks .
U - User - Generated Content User - generated content refers to website content that is created by the users themselves .
It can be in the form of message posts on discussion groups , blogs , comments on blog postings , wiki entries , etc. V - Vlog Vlog comes from the phrase video blog .
This is a blog that mainly publishes video content rather than audio content .
Video podcasting is sometimes called vodcasting .
W - Wiki Wikis are a collaborative environment that is built around input from community users .
X - XML XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language .
XML is often used to update dynamic web content .

The importance of typography in design ca n’t be underestimated , said that before I guess .
Typography is a key element of design and communicating a message and in some cases designers use typography in a way that makes it support the overall design or in some case becomes the design itself .
In this article a large number of inspiring and beautiful Typographic designs have been put together for you .
Hope you enjoy it ![ exec ] $ filestr = file_get_contents ( ‘ https://www.tripwiremagazine.com/googleadsensebelowmoretag.inc’);

Introduction
In this article you will find pure typo inspiration .
In the first section I have put together a large compilation of designs that use Typographic elements to create images .
The technique may be useful in some situations but I think is normally seen on posters and different types of printed ads .
In the second section you ’ll find Typographically overloaded websites .
A smart and well aligned use of typography on websites can really make a difference and here is plenty of inspiration on how it can be done .

< a href= " http://warehouse.carlh.com/article_157 ">theWAREHOUSE : Baconpig</a>
What was your pigskin pick for the Superbowl ?
Mine was bacon .
Err , long drawn out and ludicrous analogy here : Superbowl ~ football ~ pigskin ~ bacon - wrapped pork loaf .
It 'll become clear later .
Here 's the thought .
People have been building all sorts of crazy stuff out of the wonder that is bacon , from the lowly bacon - wrapped scallops to the mighty meat house .
But has anyone tried to restore a Frankenstein 's Monster - like dignity to the pig from which the bacon hails ?
Probably not , because most people are n't this crazy .
I made the above diagram a while ago to help figure out what parts might be useful in reconstituting my baconpig .
Hmm .
Yes .
All of them .
Bacon . Ground Pork .
And a hot dog .
Why not ?
Due to popular demand ( really , you wonderful people ! ) the above design is now available in the shop as a variety of tshirts , aprons and bags !
Oh and you can select the colors of the items you want , too ( want that printed on a black tshirt , emo kid ?
go for it .
Now it 's a statement about the government ! )
Hey if any of you want to send me a picture of yourself wearing the shirt / apron / whatever , I can post it here for everyone to enjoy !
Anyway .
On with the Baconpig !
There you go .
Oh , yeah , the hot dog is in a jar of hot water , thawing .
As pointed out at the Superbowl party , this is going to be like a turducken of pork !
A pork - pork - porken , if you will ( I will ) .
Meat is neat .
I do n't eat much meat , but when I do I make it count .
Heck yeah .
I took the pork hot dog , encased it in ground pork , and wrapped it in bacon .
I crafted an amount for the head and even made little pork feet too !
Here 's the completed , unbaked bacon pig .
Those are whole garlic cloves for the ears , and hot chili pepper pieces for the tail and eyes ( did n't have anything curly on hand ) .
Ohhh dang that looks dangerously delicious yet somehow cute .
Actually , you know what ?
He kind of looks like Piglet from Winnie the Poog. Poog ?
Winnie the Pooh .
After about 40 minutes in a 400ish degree oven ( give or take ; started at 350 and ending at 450 because we were running late ) this is the result .
Lovely !
The browned garlic cloves kind of look like bull 's horns now , but the bacon crisped up beautifully .
The pork is cooked all the way through and the hot dog is nice and hot .
It 's perfect .
Oh the smell is amazing - my car smells like bacon , now , by the way .
Here 's the first interior shot .
Is n't that gorgeous ?
Bacon forms a perfect shell .
A skin ?
A... pig skin ?
( football , pigskin , get it ? )
Of course it 's greasy but no more than a big slice of breakfast sausage .
Slicing it was really easy because of the crisp bacon and firm pork , and it was actually really good on rye bread .
Here 's the whole little fellow sliced and plated .
The ears were delicious .
I 'm pleased at how well it went over at the party .
Pretty cool looking huh ?
Actually if you wanted to make this but do it a little less creepy you could easily just make it a log - leave off the head and legs , and bake it on a tray so it drained a little better .
The bacon wraps so well and it holds together perfectly .
The pork slices clean , too .
Oh yeah , all of this stuff was going on , too .
Do n't forget to check out the shop for the pig butchering guide tshirts , aprons and bags !

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The recession has taken its toll on Social Security .
The officials who oversee the program forecast Tuesday that the Social Security trust fund will be exhausted by 2037 -- four years earlier than estimated last year .
The trust fund reflects a $ 2.4 trillion surplus paid into Social Security over 20 years that Uncle Sam has borrowed , spent and promised to pay back .
Trust fund exhaustion represents the point at which only 76 % of benefits could be paid out .
The main reason for the change in forecast : Demand for benefits has grown while money paid in has fallen because of growing unemployment and new tax breaks in the economic stimulus package passed in February .
Since the start of 2008 , 5.7 million payroll tax jobs have disappeared .
And another 4.3 million jobs are being filled on a part - time basis .
In the nearer term , the trustees estimate that Social Security will take in fewer taxes than the benefits that will be paid out by 2016 .
Last year , they estimated the near - term shortfall would occur in 2017 .
Those who describe Social Security 's situation as a crisis point to the 2016 date as the most important , because that 's when the government has to start paying the system back with interest .
" When Social Security needs to draw down the ' surplus , ' the Treasury will have to borrow money , raise taxes or cut other spending in order to redeem the IOUs , " said Charles Konigsberg , a federal budget expert at deficit watchdog group the Concord Coalition .
Others , however , say that benefits can be paid out in full for the next few decades , and that the Social Security surplus has helped the government avoid borrowing more than $ 2 trillion over the past 20 years .
Regardless , everyone agrees it will be easier to address the long - term solvency problems sooner rather than later .
In the meantime , there is no threat to current and soon - to - be retirees ' benefits .
" Despite projections that Social Security can continue to pay full benefits for nearly 30 years , the sooner action is taken the more options for reform will be available and the fairer reforms will be to our children and grandchildren , " said Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , a managing trustee of the program .
Social Security benefits represented 4.4 % of gross domestic product in 2008 , but that share is projected to rise to 6.2 % in 2034 .
One way to understand the extent of Social Security 's shortfalls is to consider how much more payroll tax would be needed today for the system to achieve actuarial balance over 75 years .
The trustees estimate the current 12.4 % payroll tax on the first $ 106,800 of a worker 's wages would need to be raised to 14.4 % .
Or it could be done by reducing benefits by 13 % .
But no one is suggesting such abrupt changes be made .
Rather , a combination of measures phased - in over time is the path lawmakers are considering .
One of the factors causing the long - term shortfall : Americans are living longer .
That 's why the American Academy of Actuaries is advocating that lawmakers gradually increase the age at which a person can start collecting full Social Security benefits .
And during the 2005 Social Security reform debate , the notion of progressive indexing gained some political traction .
Progressive indexing means that benefits of future high - income retirees would be indexed to inflation rather than to wages , as is currently the case .
That would have the effect of reducing benefits from their current promised levels because inflation tends to grow more slowly than wages .
Medicare : No easy solutions
The recession also hit Medicare , which is in far worse shape than Social Security .
The Medicare hospital insurance trust fund - which funds Part A of Medicare - is forecast to be tapped out by 2017 , or 2 years earlier than the trustees ' estimate last year .
At that point the system would only be taking in enough in payroll taxes to pay 81 % of hospital insurance costs .
The trustees characterized the exhaustion date as " an urgent concern . "
They said congressional action will be needed to " ensure uninterrupted " benefits .
Starting last year , the fund -- which covers hospital stays and related care -- had already begun taking in less than the system paid out in benefits .
Last year , Medicare 's costs were equal to 3.2 % of GDP .
But they 're projected to soar to 11.4 % by 2083 .
The trustees estimate that the 2.9 % of worker 's wages dedicated to Medicare today would have to rise to 6.78 % .
Or Medicare 's outlays would need to be reduced by 53 % .
Kathleen Sebelius , Health and Human Services Secretary and a trustee , said financial stability for Medicare is ultimately tied to health care reform .
" We know that success ... depends on our ability to fix what 's broken with the rest of the system , " she said at a briefing , noting that when an uninsured person goes on Medicare , the costs to care for that person are higher than for someone who has had health insurance throughout his adult life .
Fixing Medicare " is more of a process , " said Cori Uccello , the senior health fellow for the American Academy of Actuaries .
She noted that the burden will likely need to be shared by taxpayers , those in the health industry and Medicare beneficiaries alike .
Part of that burden will be relieved once the growth of health care costs is slowed .
But , Uccello said , " [ That ] is not going to happen overnight .
It will take many years to see results . "
Forget the thousands of school and university students running Linux on their desktops .
Forget the nonprofit and charitable institutions worldwide using Linux to power their systems .
Forget Google , NASA , the US Department of Defense and dozens of global government agencies that use Linux for their day - to - day operations .
Why should you run Linux on your computer ?
The netbook factor
Until relatively recently , Moore 's law was in full control of personal computing .
Chips were shrinking and single - core processors were a thing of the past .
Any new desktop was bound to have more RAM and a bigger disk than the previous top model .
Nowadays , though , things have changed , and most people use regular - muscle PCs for heavy - duty desktop tasks such as editing videos and playing 3D games over the Internet .
In such an environment , what makes Linux believe it can compete in the one - size - fits all OS market any more successfully than Microsoft ?
One reason is the emerging netbook sector .
With versatile online apps and cheaper access to the web , many people are opting for a lightweight PC that 's got just enough juice to help them do common desktop tasks like play DVDs and music , do homework , socialise online and serve presentations .
Linux has been riding on – if not driving – this great shift in the market .
The new way of computing is n't just restricted to netbooks , either ; it extends to other mobility - oriented devices such as mobile phones .
All of these devices are often powered by the open - source OS .
If you trace the origins of the netbook to the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project , you 'll find that there 's a close Linux connection .
The OLPC units run a modified version of the Fedora Linux distribution .
Paul Frields , the Community Manager of Fedora , told us that the work they 've done with the OLPC project has been a big help in making Linux work well on netbooks .
In fact , they 've actually made a lot of advances for users of standard laptops as well .
Most netbook vendors work closely with various distributions to offer Linux on their products .
Asus , Dell , Lenovo , HP , Acer and Intel all offer netbooks that run Linux .
If you do n't like the distribution that came with yours , there 's no dearth of customised netbook distros to choose from .
Fedora , Ubuntu , OpenSUSE , Mandriva , Foresight , CrunchBang and more all offer versions optimised to squeeze the most out of your netbook 's minimal resources .
This situation will only improve thanks to the proactive involvement of various distribution vendors .
Canonical , the company behind the popular Ubuntu distro , recently announced a port for the ARM v7 architecture .
This is being developed in conjunction with the processor design firm .
Joe Brockmeier , Community Manager of OpenSUSE , said that his company is also assisting with work on ARM , which is the most widely used 32 - bit processor architecture in the world .
Contrast this with Microsoft 's retail plan for Windows 7 , which includes the low - priced ' Starter Edition ' for netbooks that restricts users to running only three apps concurrently .
When you buy a netbook , would you prefer a low - cost restricted OS or a no-cost , no -holds - barred OS with a proven pedigree on the platform ?
It 's clear that in this area at least , Linux holds most of the cards .

Harvard political scientist Stephen Walt , who blogs for Foreign Policy takes on the critics of Chas Freeman ’s possible appointment as chair of the National Intelligence Council , and critics of Walt for defending him .
Freeman is a man of enormous diplomatic experience , both a China expert and a Middle East hand , and is the former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia .
He is also a clear - sighted analyst who is not afraid to say that the US mission in Afghanistan has become quixotic , and that Israel ’s expansionist policies are bad for all concerned , including the US .
As soon as his appointment was bruited , the well - connected coterie of right - Zionist pundits went after him , and it is pretty obvious that he was being smeared and punished for having dared publicly criticize Israel , which the Revisionists have tried for years to make a hanging offense .
Walt pointed out that these pundits were just deploying ad hominems and that for them it is all about Israel , and then they accused him of being hysterical , paranoid , etc .
What Walt is too polite to say is that these guys are just ultra-nationalist bullyboys .
A bully is a bully , it does n’t matter whether a Zimbabwe nationalist or a Zionist , and it does n’t matter whether it is John Hagee or Jonathan Chait .
In accordance with the principle that you learned most things worth knowing in kindergarten , here is what one author says about school bullying ;
‘ What Is Bullying ?
Most kids have been teased by a sibling or a friend at some point .
And it ’s not usually harmful when done in a playful , friendly , and mutual way , and both kids find it funny .
But when teasing becomes hurtful , unkind , and constant , it crosses the line into bullying and needs to stop .
Bullying is intentional tormenting in physical , verbal , or psychological ways .
It can range from hitting , shoving , name - calling , threats , and mocking to extorting money and treasured possessions .
Some kids bully by shunning others and spreading rumors about them .
Others use email , chat rooms , instant messages , social networking websites , and text messages to taunt others or hurt their feelings .
It ’s important to take bullying seriously and not just brush it off as something that kids have to “ tough out . ”
The effects can be serious and affect kids ’ sense of self - worth and future relationships .
In severe cases , bullying has contributed to tragedies , such as school shootings . ’
Zionism is a form of nationalism centered on the necessity of turning Judaism into a base for a nation - state .
Probably a majority of Jews , and virtually all American Jews , were offended by this notion before WW II .
And although Zionists think they were vindicated by the events of the 1930s and 1940s , it is not at all clear in the 21st century that having a state makes you safe ( my state has nuclear missiles aimed at it ) , or , just as important , adds to your wellbeing .
Moreover , having an ethnically - based state is invidious ( Jim Crow in the US was a form of white Protestant ethnic nationalism ) .
But in any case , Zionist nationalism is n’t any different from any other nationalism ( all nationalisms fetishize some marker or markers of identity , whether language , religion , folkways , etc. ) and it does n’t deserve to be privileged in any way .
Nationalism where healthy can be a sane form of patriotism and pride in the achievements of a people , and many Zionists fit that description ( though more Jewish Zionists than Christian Zionists are humane in my experience ) .
But nationalism can also easily turn pathological .
You saw the way Christian Zionism becomes pathological when John Hagee said God had been angry with the Jews for not forming a state or going to Palestine , and so sent Hitler as their divinely appointed hunter .
When nationalism turns pathological , it becomes a 00 , a license to kill .
The pundits who tried to smear Freeman and then Walt think they are 00’s .
For a person engaged in reasoned public discourse , ultra-nationalists are pains in the ass .
Whenever I point to Milosevic ’s war crimes , I get some fanatic defending him .
It is disgusting .
The Sudanese ultra-nationalists even rallied in Khartoum for Omar Bashir , just indicted for crimes against humanity .
But , well , you are a little unlikely to be denied a high government post in the US because you once criticized Milosevic or Bashir .
But if we leave aside the question of how many people , exactly , they have killed , and just examine the mindset and the shape of the policy they advocate , Binyamin Netanyahu and Avigdor Lieberman are also ultra-nationalists .
Why in the world should they be above criticism .
Because their ancestors were harmed by other peoples ’ ultra-nationalism ?
What sense does that make ?
The ultra-nationalist bullyboys set up Campus Watch to intimidate university administrations and to cow vulnerable assistant professors , which they have been doing with the utmost viciousness .
They also bully congress , threatening to fund their rivals if they step out of line and decline to give Israel more cluster bombs to drop on innocent civilians .
Most American Jews are social liberals and voted for Obama .
They were the group , along with African - Americans , most likely to oppose the Iraq War in 2003 .
But the far - right Zionists among them have the big megaphones .
Most major metropolitan newspapers have an ultra-nationalist Zionist columnist .
Why ?
They are like 10 percent of the American Jewish community , which is 2 percent of the American population .
But they are n’t correct in their analyses .
They are n’t good writers .
They do n’t represent any significant population .
They are just ultra-nationalists .
And their main activity is to try to smear and intimidate people .
A military strategist once said that in order to dominate a population , you must put out its eyes .
That is , you have to shut up the people who can see what is really going on .
The ultra-nationalist bullyboys are trying to shut up Freeman and Walt , with character assassination and ad hominems and , in Freeman ’s case , blackballing .
They have gotten away with this shameful behavior for so long , despite the enormous harm it has wrought to the United States , that one hesitates to short them .
They may well succeed in derailing Freeman ’s appointment .
But remember , these same pundits kept quoting to us the completely flawed 2002 National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq , which was just wrong .
Freeman would be in charge of the writing of NIEs , and the ultra-nationalist pundits are afraid that he will get in the way of their plans for mayhem .
If people do n’t stand up for Freeman , it is hard to see how they can escape some of the blame when things go pear - shaped because of future bad National Intelligence Estimates .

South Africa 's decision to deny a visa to the Dalai Lama – spiritual leader of the Tibetan people – appears to have backfired .
Officials hoped that turning away Tibet 's most famous monk would keep the " focus " on its upcoming 2010 World Cup soccer tournament and keep the games from being overshadowed by politics .
But instead South Africa has kicked up a firestorm over its commitment to human rights and its increasingly close ties with China .
A nation that freed itself from an apartheid government , South Africa would seem to have much in common with leading liberation figures like the Dalai Lama , who speaks for about 5.4 million Tibetans , who live under Chinese rule .
But as a nation that depends heavily on Chinese markets for buying its rich natural resources , South Africa has given the appearance of having chosen commerce over principle .
It 's a decision that could cost South Africa its moral voice on the global stage .
" Because of the role of the ANC during the liberal struggle against apartheid , South Africa was seen as a beacon of all things moral , a beacon of human rights , " says Aubrey Matshiqi , a senior political analyst ( and former member of the ANC , the ruling African National Congress ) at the Center for Policy Studies in Johannesburg .
" Unfortunately , the reality is that when the South African government was tested on its principles , it has fallen short . "
Like China 's own 2008 Summer Olympics , South Africa views its coming 2010 World Cup as a kind of coming - out party , and thus , not something to be messed up with politics .
Officials insist their decision to deny a visa to the Dalai Lama – technically , they add , he was never invited – was made without Chinese influence , but it has incurred damaging political criticism because of China 's human rights record in Tibet – which it has occupied since 1959 .
A scheduled peace conference in Cape Town , called by the support committee of the 2010 World Cup and intended to show the bridge between peace and sport , has now been postponed .
Two of the three South African Nobel laureates , Archbishop Desmond Tutu and former President Frederik De Klerk , canceled their own attendance at the peace conference in protest , and the third laureate , Nelson Mandela , is thought to be close to making the same decision .
Even members of the South African government lambasted the decision .
" Just the very fact that this government has refused entry to the Dalai Lama is an example of a government who is dismissive of human rights , " said Health Minister Barbara Hogan .
" I believe [ the government ] needs to apologize to the citizens of this country , because it is in your name that this great man who has struggled for the rights of his country ... has been denied access . "
Mr. Matshiqi says the South African government clearly put its economic and political interests ahead of its moral principles , although he admits , " foreign policy is an exercise in double standards . "
" There 's only one explanation , it must be linked to South Africa 's perceived geopolitical and economic interests , as it pertains to China , " says Matshiqi .
" Either China communicated their displeasure at the possible invitation of the Dalai Lama , or alternatively , the South Africans came to the conclusion on [ their ] own . "
South African spokesman Thabo Masebe said Monday that the decision was in the best interest of the games , and not the result of Chinese pressure .
" We want the focus to remain on South Africa , " he said .
" A visit by the Dalai Lama would move the focus from South Africa onto issues in Tibet . "
But in Beijing , Chinese officials expressed their appreciation for countries , like South Africa , that had turned away from the Tibetan monk .
" All countries should respect China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity ... and oppose Tibetan independence , " said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang .
" We appreciate the relevant countries ' measures . "
In Germany , losing his factory job did n't stop Alfred Butt from taking a Mediterranean vacation this winter .
Thanks to generous jobless benefits , being out of work " has n't changed my life that much , " Mr. Butt says .
In the U.S. , Dylan DeRoberts lost similar work -- but there 's no seaside getaway for him .
Instead , he 's giving up life 's little pleasures , like riding his snowmobile , because he lost his insurance , too .
" I 've learned to live at a new level , " Mr. DeRoberts says .

Will the growing demand for cheap , ample supplies of cellulose create powerful incentives to convert diverse , native grasslands into sterile " energy lawns " and to chop down vast swaths of wild forests , asks David Malakoff .
From Conservation Magazine , part of the Guardian Environment Network
These days , Jason Clay walks around with an eerie sense of déjà vu .
Over the past few years , the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) anthropologist has become deeply entangled in the tortuous struggle to ensure that supposedly " green " biofuels — such as ethanol brewed from corn and biodiesel wrung from palm nuts — do n't decimate biodiversity in an attempt to save the planet .
It 's been a dizzying and sometimes disorienting experience .
For instance , Clay watched as biofuels , once hailed as the savior of the climate , became an environmental sinner almost overnight — blamed for everything from food riots to trashed tropical forests .
" The backlash has been pretty ferocious — ethanol and biodiesel have lost a lot of their green image , " he says .
Now Clay is bracing for what could be an even more jarring roller - coaster ride .
Some scientists , executives and political leaders — including President Barak Obama 's energy team — are touting a new breed of " cellulosic " biofuels .
They argue that these second - generation fuels — created by breaking down cellulose , the molecule that gives trees and grasses their toughness — could deliver more help with less harm .
Some even paint the picture of a future powered by waste sawdust , grass clippings and corn husks .
And they are dreaming big : by 2022 , the United States alone could brew more than 75 billion liters of cellulosic ethanol a year .
Experts say that will require spending tens of billions of dollars on research and corporate subsidies and dedicating tens of millions of hectares of land to producing biomass , from hay bales to whole logs .
The dream of cellulosic ethanol , however , is causing nightmares for many ecologists .
They fear that growing demand for cheap , ample supplies of cellulose will create powerful incentives to convert diverse , native grasslands into sterile " energy lawns " and to simply chop down vast swaths of wild forests .
Even if these environmental costs are mitigated , it 's getting harder to identify the upside of cellulosic fuels — a recent MIT study suggests that , despite the hype , the new fuels may not reduce overall greenhouse - gas emissions .
Which raises an unsettling question : can the pursuit of clean , " green " fuels lead to a true ecological solution , or is it just a detour from traditional conservation strategies that , although less futuristic , might be far more effective ?
New research is crystallizing fears that cellulosic fuels might wreak havoc on the world 's landscapes .
Forecasting what will happen if the fuels take off is a tricky enterprise because biofuels can have indirect effects that ripple around the globe .
If a farmer in Europe , for instance , replaces the soybean crop she sells to China with an energy crop such as switchgrass , it could create an incentive for a farmer in South America to clear a new chunk of forest or grassland to replace the European soybeans .
Similarly , a move to log a forest in Siberia for energy cellulose could put added pressure on Asian or African forests to produce plywood or lumber for the housing market .
In January , a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) released one of the most ambitious efforts yet to make sense of it all .
Led by climate specialist Jerry Mellilo of MIT and the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole , the team used a complex computer model to produce a vision of the global landscape in 2050 .
After assuming that cellulosic fuels provide at least 10 percent of the world 's energy supply , the study concludes that " large tracts of natural forests , woodlands , and grasslands will be converted to either food or cellulosic biofuels production . "
By 2050 , the land devoted to cellulosic crops mushrooms to about 11 percent of the earth 's total ( between 13.9 and 14.8 million square kilometers ) .
Many areas would lose from 20 to 70 percent of their natural habitats , with tropical and semitropical ecosystems able to produce high levels of biomass the hardest hit .
On the lengthy danger list : biodiversity " hotspots " in Mesoamerica , the cerrado of Brazil , Guinea / West Africa , Madagascar , Indo - Burma , and the cluster of Philippines , Malaysia , and Indonesia .
In part , that list reflects the expectation that " forests in the tropics could get hit particularly hard by cellulosic ethanol , " says James Bowyer , a forestry industry expert with Dovetail Partners , a nonprofit environmental consulting group in Minneapolis , Minnesota .
That 's because natural forests would provide a relatively cheap , easy - to - exploit supply of cellulose .
And unlike grasses that must be harvested and carefully stored , " trees are easy biomass to store when they are n't needed , " says Bowyer .
" You just leave them standing in the forest when the market dips , and wait for ethanol prices to rebound . "
Ironically , the MIT team concludes it's not clear that the profound transformation in land use spurred by cellulosic ethanol would actually reduce greenhouse - gas emissions .
In part , that 's because clearing new land can release carbon stored in soil and plants , negating the benefits of using the biofuels to replace fossil fuels .
In fact , the land - use changes wreaked by use of cellulosic biofuels would add carbon to the atmosphere in the first half of the twenty - first century .
Even under the most optimistic scenario , it would take some 50 years for the use of cellulosic biofuels to offset that added carbon .
Cellulosic fuels advocates say such problems can at least be reduced by planting biofuel crops on so - called marginal lands that have already been plowed , grazed , or logged .
But here , too , scale is an issue .
A February 2009 study by the Department of Energy 's Sandia National Laboratory and General Motors ' R&D Center , for instance , suggests it could take at least 20 million hectares of currently " idle " or " marginal " U.S. farmlands and forests to grow the biomass needed to produce 170 billion liters of cellulosic fuel a year by 2030 .
That means putting an area the size of Kansas into cultivation , a feat that could exact a stiff toll on biodiversity .
" You hear a lot about using ' marginal lands ' and ' waste wood , ' but that land and debris is still somebody 's habitat , " says Doug Landis , an ecological entomologist at Michigan State University .
And in grasslands , " even a degraded prairie or hayfield can be better for biodiversity than planting a switchgrass monoculture , " notes grassland ecologist Mike Palmer of Oklahoma State University .
Still , to gain standing in the biofuels policy debate , ecologists are ramping up an array of studies that , in the words of one , " once again will prove the obvious " : that prairies and other multispecies ecosystems requiring few inputs such as irrigation and fertilizer are often better for biodiversity and overall environmental functioning than high - input , low - diversity systems such as corn fields .
For instance , Mary Gardiner , a post - doc with Landis , has started intensively studying 30 sites across southern Michigan that might produce biofuel crops .
They range from low - diversity corn fields to switchgrass plots to remnant prairies .
Not surprisingly , Landis says , preliminary results suggest that the corn mono - cultures support less insect diversity than the lower - input switchgrass and prairie plots .
Other researchers are documenting similar trends in birdlife , with the prairies providing more nesting and feeding habitat .
Overall , it appears " prairie gives you the most diversity — and it may be able to produce just as much usable biomass too , " he says .
Indeed , some scientists say " energy prairies " could be one way to both fight climate change and promote biodiversity .
Other researchers , such as plant ecologist Linda Wallace of the University of Oklahoma in Norman , are pondering the implications of replacing even degraded grasslands with switchgrass and other fast - growing plants .
One problem , Wallace says , is that studies show switchgrass or other perennial grasses can become highly invasive in some places , " so the ecological footprint is much larger than the field . "
The problems with cellulosic fuels seem depressingly familiar to WWF's Jason Clay and other veterans of the first biofuel war .
" It seems like the same arguments are coming up , just in a new context , " Clay says .
And until it is clear exactly how cellulosic technologies will play out — and whether any will become economically viable — he predicts the discussions will be frustrating and sometimes baffling .
To help unmuddy the waters , WWF and other groups have been contributing to efforts to measure the impacts of cellulosic fuels and develop guidelines for " sustainable " production .
But the closer you look at the debate , the harder it becomes to ignore a conclusion reached by many analysts of the bioenergy conundrum : to make biofuels — or any fuels — truly environmentally friendly , we may simply have to use them in smaller quantities .
Which means it might be time to further embrace age - old solutions such as developing fuel - efficient vehicles , switching to a diet that substitutes vegetables for meat , building a highly efficient distribution infrastructure .
The list goes on — and , like the latest biofuels controversy , it 's all too familiar . ❧

If youâ€™re anything like me you like to create fine furniture for your home and for your friends using woods like mahogany and walnut but in todayâ€™s tight economy using luxury woods can really strain oneâ€™s woodworking budget .
When my wife approached me with the idea of building a new suite of furniture for our master bedroom that included a Queen Size bed , dresser w/ mirror , chest of drawers , and armoire , I saw my yearâ€™s woodworking budget going out the door like a runaway train .
Enough mahogany or walnut to complete all those pieces was going to cost me mucho dinero but we did need a new bedroom suite .
Well I had read on some blog where a woodworker had used dyes to make relatively inexpensive woods imitate the appearance very expensive woods and I decided to experiment with the idea .
The results were amazing .
I had a hard time telling the difference between dyed Willow and genuine Walnut .
I even offer it as an option to my customerâ€™s who order custom furniture to save them money .
When I started experimenting with the various wood dyes I needed a good variety of the genuine samples to compare my dyed woods against .
Rockler offers a 20 pound box of assorted species of hardwoods that includes Oak , Maple , Birch , Cherry , Walnut and Mahogany for less than $ 25 plus shipping and handling .
I had bought these assortments in the past from Rockler because the pieces were the ideal size for making small projects like jewelry boxes , music boxes , clocks , etc .
There are a wide variety of wood stains available today from many different sources and I experimented with hundreds before settling on a line of dyes produced by W.D. Lockwood .
Lockwood dyes are somewhat more expensive than many of the alternatives but the quality results that I achieved using them made the additional cost worthwhile .
Iâ€™m going to give you detailed instruction on how to copy several of my relatively inexpensive wood conversions into luxury woods in this tutorial but they are meant as a starting point for your own experimentations .
Itâ€™s a great way to wile away the hours between projects .
Turning Willow into Walnut
Willow lacks the density and durability of genuine Walnut but the heartwood , grain patterns and coloration closely approaches that of Walnut with little or no dying .
The less dense Willow soaks up liquid stains several times faster than Walnut so it important to experiment with both species ahead of time with the dyes / stains that you will be using if you intend to mix the two species together in one project .
Gel stains produce a less blotchy effect when applied to Willow .
I often mix species when making projects like coffee tables , dining room tables , etc because I want the added density and durability of the genuine Walnut for the table tops .
Lockwood actually offers nine different Walnut stains so itâ€™s easy to match the genuine with the imitation with a little trial and error .
Turning Birch into Maple
Birch lumber and Birch veneered sheet goods is one of the most commonly available materials available at home centers and lumber yards .
Birchâ€™s creamy colored and dense grain closely approaches that of Maple with little or no staining required .
All you need to do is take your genuine Maple sample with you and select those pieces Birch that closely matches it .
If you do what to make it an even closer match Lockwood offer nine different Maple stains to help you accomplish that .
Turning Luan veneer plywood into Mahogany veneer plywood
Luan or Philippine mahogany has long been a substitute for the expensive Honduran Mahogany because of its close color and grain pattern .
The only thing that sets the two apart is that the Philippine mahogany has a slightly grey cast compared the Honduran Mahoganyâ€™s reddish cast .
I found that using a 50 - 50 mix of natural antique cherry dye ( Lockwood # 911 ) for reddish tones and golden amber maple dye ( Lockwood # 144 ) yields a near - perfect color match without highlighting the pores of the wood .
Turning Ash into Oak
Few woods have a grain pattern that matches flat sawn oak but ash comes close .
Staining the ash with Minwax red oak ( # 215 ) makes the match even closer .
The pores of the ash will absorb more pigment from a liquid ( not gel ) stain than will oak .
For an even darker finish , sand ash to 150 - grit , leaving a slightly rougher surface where the particles of stain pigments can collect .
Use a dye if you want minimal grain contrast .
Turning Maple into Ebony
Maple with it dense grain imitates the exotic , very expensive , Ebony almost perfectly .
To make the conversion all you need is India ink .
The fine pigments in India ink produce a deep , dark , and consistent black , even on the dense surface of maple .
Before coloring the wood , cut and shape parts to size .
Then finish - sand all surfaces , taking the end grain to at least 320 - grit prior to staining .
Turning Popular into Cherry
Widespread availability and low prices make poplar a prime substitute for more expensive woods .
Avoid poplar boards with a greenish cast or strong color contrasts between the heartwood and sapwood .
Turning Popular into imitation Cherry is relatively easy with dye .
Dye will provide consistent color and , because itâ€™s water - based , a damp rag can extract some of the excess if you use too much .
( I used Lockwood # 911 natural antique cherry dye for this sample . )
Allow a little extra shading for the light sanding needed to remove wood fibers raised by water - based dyes .
Like cherry , poplar tends to blotch .
To make spot adjustments to the color , lightly rub darkened areas with 320 - grit sandpaper .
Well this should get you started .

Advertisement All Gurkha veterans who retired before 1997 with at least four years ' service will be allowed to settle in the UK , Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has said .
Ms Smith told MPs she was " proud to offer this country 's welcome to all who have served in the brigade of Gurkhas " .
It comes after a high - profile campaign by Joanna Lumley and other supporters of Gurkha rights - and an embarrassing Commons defeat for the government .
Some 36,000 Gurkhas who left before 1997 had been denied UK residency .
Ms Lumley , the actress who has been the public face of the campaign on behalf of the Gurkhas , said : " This is the welcome we have always longed to give . "
She called Prime Minister Gordon Brown , who she had met earlier , a " brave man who has made today a brave decision on behalf of the bravest of the brave " .
Gurkhas , who are recruited from Nepal , have been part of the British Army for almost 200 years .
' Sacrifice and distinction '
Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said the U - turn by the government was a " great victory for a well - run campaign , that has publicly embarrassed ministers " .
He said it was a shame that the government had had to be dragged " kicking and screaming " to the decision .
Ms Smith 's statement was greeted by cheers from MPs .
The prime minister and the minister have finally listened to the will of this House and the will of the British public
Chris Huhne MP Star behind Ab Fab victory
She told the Commons : " I 'm delighted that we have now been able to agree - across government , across the House and with the Gurkhas ' representatives - new settlement rights that all those who have served us so well , so highly deserve . "
Under the measures outlined in the House , Gurkhas will be allowed to settle in the UK with their spouses and dependent children under 18 .
Ms Smith said she expected to welcome 10,000 to 15,000 applications from Gurkhas over the next two years .
She added that some 1,400 outstanding applications for settlement currently before the UK Border Agency would be processed on the basis of the new policy " as a matter of urgency " before 11 June .
Ms Smith added that the Gurkhas had served the UK " with great courage , sacrifice and distinction and they continue to make a vital and valued contribution to our operations around the world " .
Chris Huhne , the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman , welcomed the statement .
" The prime minister and the minister have finally listened to the will of this House and the will of the British public , " he said .
Keith Vaz , chairman of the home affairs select committee , said it was a " historic " day for British democracy and said 21 May will be " remembered as Gurkha Rights Day " .
' Sympathy and support '
After the vote , Gurkha veterans and campaigners met the prime minister at Downing Street for what Ms Lumley called an " impromptu garden party " .
Gurkha Justice Campaign lawyer David Enright said there was still work to be done to ensure that veterans received pensions in the UK , but said " that is for tomorrow " .
He added : " The people wanting to come here are not coming for pensions .
They are coming here , on the whole , because they want to work . "
The prime minister suffered a shock Commons defeat on the issue , forcing ministers to reconsider existing rules on how many Gurkhas can settle in the UK .
It was followed by an extraordinary piece of Westminster theatre when Ms Lumley - whose father was an officer with the 6th Gukha Rifles - came face - to - face with minister Phil Woolas in BBC studios and quickly won public assurances over future policy at an impromptu joint press conference .
Speaking after Thursday 's vote , Mr Woolas acknowledged that the actress had " given a focus " to the campaign , and that she had " campaigned tirelessly " for the Gurkhas .
At Prime Minister 's Questions on Wednesday , Mr Brown told the House of Commons that he had a " great deal of sympathy and support " for the Gurkhas .
He added : " I believe it is possible for us to honour our commitments to the Gurkhas and to do so in a way that protects the public finances . "

Walk in the Spirit — Greek , “ By ( the rule of ) the ( Holy ) Spirit . ”

The best way to keep tares out of a bushel is to fill it with wheat .
– Jamieson - Fausset - Brown Bible Commentary
You , my brothers and sisters , were called to be free .
But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh ; rather , serve one another humbly in love .
For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command : “ Love your neighbor as yourself . ”
If you bite and devour each other , watch out or you will be destroyed by each other .

By definition , fruit ( 2590 / karpós ) results from two life - streams – the Lord living His life through ours – to yield what is eternal ( cf. 1 Jn 4:17 ) .
The more someone yields to the Holy Spirit in their life , the more their life will be characterized by the “ Fruit of the Spirit . ”
The more someone works to establish their own religious righteousness , the more their life will be characterized by the “ Works of the Flesh . ”
What is motivating you ?
Are you sure ?
What is the result ?
So I say , walk by the Spirit , and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh .
For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit , and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh .
They are in conflict with each other , so that you are not to do whatever you want .
But if you are led by the Spirit , you are not under the law .
( Galatians 5:16 - 18 )
If there 's one fact of life for large companies , it 's that small companies and individuals are going to sue to try to get a piece of your much bigger pie .
As corporate pies come , Google has a pretty big one , and they 've had no shortage of suits over the years from those looking to get their knife in the company 's pie-pan .
Such is the case again , as according to reports the search giant has been served with a lawsuit over its use of the name " Android " for its popular mobile phone platform .
Android Data Corporation and its ringmaster Erich Specht are the holders of a U.S. Patent & Trademark Office - registered trademark on the name " Android Data . "
The mark was applied for in 2000 , and issued in 2002 .
In 2007 , Google applied for a trademark on the name " Android " for its mobile operating system , was denied the mark because the PTO felt it was too close to Mr. Specht 's mark , appealed , and lost on appeal .
Nothing too unusual — companies file for trademarks all the time , and the Patent & Trademark Office is somewhat known for being fond of the big red stamp .
Where things take an interesting turn is with the lawsuit filed by Mr. Specht alleging that Google is violating his trademark , and has been doing so for the better part of two years — a questionable time period Mr. Specht says he waited because he thought Google 's Android was a device , not an operating system .
His attorney , Martin Murphy , says Specht feels Google is taking Android away from him , after he " put a lot of thought into that name . "
He admits that anyone with any sense can tell the difference between something that powers a mobile phone , made by a household name and e-commerce software made by a company nobody 's ever heard of but says it makes Android Data appear to be copying Google , and that 's hurting its business .
One is left to wonder what is really hurting that business , given that Mr. Murphy 's client , who is supposedly capable of creating an e-commerce package , needs two years to work out the difference between an operating system and a telephone .
Speaking of Mr. Specht 's business , it 's history is as spotty as the logic behind his lawsuit .
Android Data Corporation is an Illinois corporation , but according to reports , it was voluntarily dissolved in 2004 only to be resurrected later on .
The company 's website — something one might expect a company selling e-commerce software to put a little attention into — was lost to a link farm and only recently was itself resurrected just days before the lawsuit was filed , and now serves a parked page filled with ads for , you guessed it , cell phones .
Perhaps someone should fill the dynamic duo in on the business secret that not having a website for your web - based product might be hurting your business a tad bit more than a completely unrelated mobile phone OS .
Google , for its part , is n't sweating the suit in the least .
A company spokesman gave the standard Google - as - Defendant response : " We believe the complaint has no merit .
We plan to defend against them vigorously . "
We assume the other forty - five defendants will too — that 's right , Specht did n't just sue Google , he sued T - Mobile , HTC , and every member of the Open Handset Alliance , including Motorola , Sprint , Samsung , Toshiba , Vodafone , and Texas Instruments , and wants each one of them to cough up a cool $ 2 million .
Murphy says he 'll be filing for a temporary restraining order on Specht 's behalf , asking that the defendants be permanently barred from marketing Android products and forcing them to withdraw existing products from the market in order to be re-branded .
Of course , the idea that a federal judge would agree to such a farce — causing an untold number of companies harm that we suspect would total over the billion dollar mark — is ludicrous and is even less likely to happen than Specht winning the case .
Of note in the matter , and the sort of technicalities that courts eat for breakfast , is that Specht 's mark is " Android Data , " not " Android . "
There are reportedly dozens of other Android trademarks , all of which are sufficiently distinct from Specht 's mark as to allow them a mark of their own .
Google had to expect likewise — a search of existing marks is Law School 101 , so Google 's legal team had to be operating under the expectation that a mobile operating system would be judged sufficiently distinct from e-commerce software .
Murphy argues that , because the PTO noted that nobody could have a trademark on the word " data " itself when approving Specht 's trademark , that his trademark is really for " Android " not " Android Data " — the word " Data " just falls away in his happy little world .
A few things to consider , however , about Mr. Specht and his mark may well make his case a lot harder to win .
First , trademarks are not like copyrights — one can hold copyright to a work and lock it away , never to be seen again without doing any damage to the validity of that copyright .
Not so for trademarks , which must be actively used in commerce in order to remain valid .
Unless Mr. Specht can come up with some proof he 's been doing something — and right now , that 's the $ 94,000,000 question — he stands to have his trademark — and , if Google is on their game , his financial future — flushed down the toilet .
Second , the paperwork involved with a trademark does n't end with issuance ; trademark holders are required to file an " affidavit of use " between the fifth and sixth year after the trademark 's issuance , and a renewal application within the year before the trademark expires , if they wish to renew it .
By our calculations , that affidavit would have been due between 2007 and 2008 , with a six - month grace period after the end of the sixth year .
By any accounting the sixth year is up , but depending on when in 2002 the application was granted , the six - month grace period may be up as well — meaning that if Mr. Specht was as thorough about his PTO filings as he was about those for his website and the Illinois Secretary of State , his trademark may well have already gone circling the plumbing .
In the end , what Specht really wants is a settlement and , more than likely , a flat - out purchase of the trademark by Google for an exorbitant sum .
Indeed , Murphy even went so far as to admit it flat out to Forbes : " No judge will want to be flooded with that much paperwork .
We 'll probably be asked to sit down and work this out . "
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news , Marty , but judges are responsible for judgments , not settlements — if Google does n't want to play ball , the judge and everyone else will drown in a sea of paperwork a thousand times over .
Were we Google , that 's exactly what we'd do — bury Specht & Co. in wave after wave of interrogatories and subpoenas ducas tecum , months of depositions , and enough motions to make a Supreme Court clerk cry .
The phrase " flesh eating lawyers " has meaning for good reason , and if anybody has them , Google does .
At the end , we predict one of two outcomes :
Either the judge laughs the whole matter out the door before Specht can get a " but I put so much thought into it " out , or Google flexes its barristers , scares the daylights out of Martin Murphy , and gives Specht just enough to go away and never think of trademark trolling again .

The space shuttle Atlantis has landed in California , where it was diverted after continuing stormy weather prevented a Florida touchdown .
Atlantis landed at 1539 GMT at Edwards Air Force Base .
Officials had aborted Saturday 's planned landing at the Kennedy Space Center for the second consecutive day .
The seven astronauts on board Atlantis have taken part in an ambitious and risky mission to service and re-fit the Hubble telescope .
Nasa said that weather conditions over Florida forced flight controllers to give up on Sunday 's first landing opportunity at Kennedy Space Center .
Hubble revamped
Atlantis 's mission was intended to give a new lease of life to Hubble .
The orbiting observatory is regarded as one of the most important scientific tools ever built .
The fifth and final mission to service Hubble has been hailed as a great success .
Over five spacewalks , astronauts installed new instruments and thermal blankets , repaired two existing instruments , replaced gyroscopes and batteries .
The only disappointment was the failure to restore the high resolution channel ( one of three ) on the Advanced Camera for Surveys , which has been responsible for many of Hubble 's most impressive images of deep space .
" This is not the end of the story but the beginning of another chapter of discovery by Hubble , " said Ed Weiler , associate administrator for Science at Nasa Headquarters .
" Hubble will be more powerful than ever , continue to surprise , enlighten , and inspire us all and pave the way for the next generation of observatories . "
Perfect for a sunny day - but leaving money on the seat is not a great idea
A man in Germany discovered the dangers of driving an open - top car when an envelope containing 23,000 euros ( £ 20,600 ) blew off the back seat .
The notes rained down on the fast - moving motorway traffic behind him .
Police closed the road in both directions for half an hour to search for the missing money .
All but 3,000 euros was recovered .
The man , 23 , was test - driving an Audi convertible near Hanover , and the money was intended to pay for the car .
The police have warned the public against scavenging along the motorway for the missing notes , pointing out that it would be illegal to keep them .
And things could get even more expensive for the German test - driver .
The police are considering charging him for the cost of the search .
The motorway closure caused long tailbacks in both directions .
14 Year Old Beat and Choked by Police - Caught On Tape

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Time Warner Inc said on Thursday its bondholders had agreed to change the terms of their debt contracts , removing restrictions on a sale or spin - off of its beleaguered Internet unit AOL .
The media giant asked bondholders earlier this month to change terms on around $ 12.3 billion in outstanding debt , paving the way for a potential separation of the Internet unit .
In exchange for the new agreement Time Warner will pay the bondholders around a total of $ 61.5 million .
Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes has said he is examining options for the future structure of AOL .
Last month he lured former Google Inc executive Tim Armstrong to head AOL with the possibility of leading a spin- off .
AOL has long been one of the weakest units at Time Warner , taking a series of writedowns reflecting the declining value of the assets and a slowing online advertising market .
Time Warner ’s portfolio includes HBO , Warner Bros film studios and the Time publishing unit .

SEOUL ( Reuters ) -
The mayors of some of the world ’s richest cities have a message on climate change for the ever - growing urban areas of the developing world : “ Do n’t repeat our mistakes . ”

That means keeping the growth of gasoline - powered vehicles in check and developing land use strategies that cut down on urban sprawl and allow for efficient transport , city leaders said on the sidelines of a climate change meeting this week in Seoul .
But advice is about all these cities can offer because their limited budgets and pressing demands make it difficult for them to offer any monetary help , even though they are at the front - line of the climate change battle .
“ Cities are capable of moving further and faster .
If mayors work together and cities work together , they can move even faster , ” Boris Johnson , mayor of London , told Reuters at the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit in Seoul .
Urban areas , home to just over half of the world ’s population , are key to attacking global warming because they account directly for 50 - 60 percent of human greenhouse gas emissions , according to U.N. Habitat .
According to a U.N. report , the urban areas of the world are expected to absorb all the population growth expected over the next four decades .
Most of the population growth expected in urban areas will be concentrated in cities and towns of the less developed regions .
Asia , in particular , is projected to see its urban population increase by 1.8 billion , Africa by 0.9 billion , and Latin America and the Caribbean by 0.2 billion .
Among the world ’s cities , Tokyo is expected to be the world ’s most densely populated with 36 million inhabitants in 2025 , followed by Mumbai with 26 million people and Delhi with 23 million people .
Johnson , who has pushed to make the streets of London more friendly to hybrid and electric vehicles , said his city could share its experience on implementing low - carbon initiatives .
“ I want cities from around the world to get together to reduce the costs of these technologies , ” he said .
“ They ( developing cities ) have to learn the lessons of the many failures that modern cities made over the past 40 or 50 years in areas such as transportation systems and land use planning , ” Toshi Noda , a director for U.N. Habitat , told Reuters .
The U.N agency that helps manage housing has launched projects in four developing cities including Kampala in Uganda to import green technologies used in developed cities such as less polluting transport and drainage systems to halt urban flooding .
Delhi Mayor Kanwar
Sain wants more global assistance to help his city tackle a global problem .
“ Developed nations ... should come forward for collaborative projects , ” Sain said .
Roads jammed with hybrid cars with an efficient subway system underneath are a world away from cities in the developing world such as Addis Ababa , where a sizable percentage of the population uses charcoal , wood and cow dung for fuel .
Addis Ababa , with few resources of it own , has worked with international agencies to replant and protect forests as a way to battle climate change .
Representatives from these cities said they are protecting forests to benefit in carbon trading schemes and win support from global donors but they would not mind receiving technology abandoned by richer cities as they become more climate friendly .
“ Every city must find its own way , ” said Katrin Lompscher , a senator from the city of Berlin .
“ And not make the same mistakes . ”
She also said at a conference in 2005 that a “ court of appeals is where policy is made , ” a statement she seemed to understand at the time would be controversial , because she added , “ I know this is on tape and I should never say that , because we do n’t make law . ”
The White House said she meant that appeals courts play a greater role in interpreting laws than district courts , but Republicans pointed to the comment as another sign that she would try to impose her values in rendering decisions .
“ Judge Sotomayor is a liberal activist of the first order who thinks her own personal political agenda is more important than the law as written , ” said Wendy E. Long , counsel to the Judicial Confirmation Network , a conservative group .
“ She thinks that judges should dictate policy and that one ’s sex , race and ethnicity ought to affect the decisions one renders from the bench . ”
Other conservatives said they would focus on her ruling in a New Haven affirmative action case or on how she might rule on same - sex marriage .
“ Abortion is in some sense a stale issue that has been fought over many times , but gay marriage is very much up for grabs , ” said Curt Levey , executive director of the Committee for Justice , a legal group .
“ Gay marriage will be bigger than abortion . ”
As she was nominated on Tuesday , Judge Sotomayor did not retreat from her view that judges ought to look at the impact of their rulings .
“ I strive never to forget the real - world consequences of my decisions on individuals , businesses and government , ” she said .
While conservative groups took aim , Republican senators responded more cautiously , weighing how aggressively they want to fight her confirmation .
Twenty - nine Senate Republicans voted against her confirmation to the appellate bench in 1998 , including Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , now the party ’s Senate leader , while 25 voted for her .
Of those still in the Senate , 11 voted against her and 9 for her .
Mr. McConnell said on Tuesday that the Senate would not be a “ rubber stamp ” and promised that Republicans would “ examine her record to ensure she understands that the role of a jurist in our democracy is to apply the law even - handedly , despite their own feelings or personal or political preferences . ”

April 9 , 2009 - Jeremy Bennett
Hello .
My name is Jeremy Bennett , and I 'm an artist at Valve .
Most gamers only ever get to see the finished product of a game cover , so we thought some of you might find it interesting to hear the process that led to Left 4 Dead 's final art .
As you 'll see , there were quite a few attempts along the way , all of them eventually abandoned .
Our first designs focused on Bill , Louis , Francis and Zoey , the four lead characters that players would be guiding through Left 4 Dead 's post - apocalyptic zombie wasteland .
Right away this presented problems .
Typically , for a video game ( or DVD or book ) cover to be eye - catching , there 'll be a single prominent element front and centerour " hero " character , for example , with ancillary characters standing around in the background :
As a multiplayer game with an emphasis on teamwork , though , Left 4 Dead did n't reallya central character .
Pretending otherwise , we decided , was just misleading if the box art is selling a different game than the one in the box , it 's not doing its job .
So a lead character filling up the front of a game box was out .
Next we tried spacing the four characters out at equal size .
On the plus side , this avoided any confusion about one character being more prominently featured ( and thus more " important " ) than the others :
On the minus side , giving four characters equal space made them all quite small , wasting a lot of valuable box real estate without doing the one thing good box art is supposed to do : catch the eye .
Magnifying the problem was the fact that there was n't much point to having our four heroes standing around in a void .
To give the box art any sort of context to the game inside , we needed zombies .
So we were faced with the unpopular idea of shrinking our heroes down evento cram some zombies into the picture :
These attempts did a good job of capturing the multiplayer aspect of L4D , not to mention the intensity of the gameplay experience .
But when viewed from a distance by someone walking through a game store and spotting it on a shelf , for instance it just looked like cluttered noise .
The individual elements were too small and varied to communicate anything visually interesting .
Box art featuring the title of the game as the prominent feature ended up in the same category .
The idea behind this typographic approach was that if the characters had to be small , we should make sure the game 's title was as prominent as possible :
Unfortunately , this ran up against the same problems .
Box art that 's all text does n't grab the eye , no matter how stylishly it 's laid out .
More importantly , it did n't feel like it was in the right " world " put simply , it just did n't look like a game box .
After a visit to a local GameStop , it did n't take us long to realize the black , red and white color palette was n't helping us much either .
Red on black is a very attention - grabbing color scheme , and this fact was n't lost on our competition .
Scanning the shelves , we noticed a large number of game boxes already using similar color schemes in an attempt to draw the eye .
But the effect , ironically , when viewed from a step back , was the opposite of the one intended it was overwhelming .
That meant red was out now , too .
Experiments with different colors , as well as research into classic zombie posters , eventually led us to green , which was n't getting used a lot , and moreover suggested something rotting and gangrenous .
This seemed perfectly in line with the " zombie panic " messaging we were hoping to get across .
We had further success once got away from the clutter of our various " Survivors vs. Zombies " attempts , focusing on the simple idea of selling the idea of " four " itself in an iconic , visually compelling way .
At some point the idea sprung up of a handits thumb chewed off by zombies , with only four fingers left and it stuck .
All of the noise instantly evaporated .
Suddenly we had this horrific , easily graspable image , visible from far away , that managed to get across the core concepts of the game all in one go : Zombies .
Four .
Danger .
We had a cover we were happy with .
Now it was time to put it to the test .
The same local - area GameStop kindly let us conduct a few impromptu tests , printing out some of the above samples onto game boxes and placing them in various strategic positions .
Then we simply hung out in the store for an afternoon , watching customers , and seeing which of the boxes grabbed people 's eyes .
Our instincts were on the money :
The green hand art won hands - down .
But as it turned out , itwas n't perfect the final piece of the puzzle would actually arrive from a helpful fan .
We had by this point shown off the new branding at E3 , and it had only taken one fan about three seconds to point out that if we used a four - fingered left hand instead of a right hand , we could get a nice pun , with all three words of the game 's title presented visually .
Happy to admit our mistake if it meant making it better , the game box was again retooled , arriving at the design on the box you see today :
Revised February 2011 *
Becoming Unaffiliated
The biggest gains due to change in religious affiliation have been among those who say they are not affiliated with any particular faith .
Overall , the 2007 “ U.S. Religious Landscape Survey ” found that 16 % of the adult population is unaffiliated , with the vast majority of this group ( 79 % ) reporting that they were raised in a religion as children .
In total , more than one - in - ten American adults and more than a quarter of all those who have changed religions have become unaffiliated after having been raised as part of a religious group .
Religious Change Over the Life Cycle
The majority of both former Catholics ( 64 % ) and former Protestants ( 58 % ) who have become unaffiliated report having done so as adults .
Among those who became unaffiliated as minors , most say it was mainly their own decision to do so rather than their parents ’ choice .
Among the currently unaffiliated , large majorities of both former Catholics and former Protestants report attending worship services at least once a week as children ( 74 % and 64 % , respectively ) .
However , regular church attendance drops dramatically by adolescence for both groups , and very few unaffiliated people report regularly attending worship services now , as adults .
Unaffiliated former Catholics and former Protestants are equally unlikely to say they regularly attend worship services as adults .
Only 30 % of former Catholics and 18 % of former Protestants who are now unaffiliated report that they had very strong faith as a child .
All three unaffiliated groups ( former Catholics , former Protestants and those who were raised unaffiliated ) continue to express low levels of religious faith as adults .
Former Catholics who are now unaffiliated are just as likely as lifelong Catholics to have participated in religious institutions and practices such as religious education classes ( 68 % and 71 % , respectively ) and religious youth groups ( 32 % for both groups ) .
By contrast , just more than half of former Protestants who have become unaffiliated say they attended Sunday school , compared with roughly two - thirds of lifelong Protestants .
And only about one - third of former Protestants who are now unaffiliated say they participated in religious youth groups ( 36 % ) , compared with roughly half of lifelong Protestants .
Reasons for Becoming Unaffiliated
When asked whether a list of specific reasons were important factors in their decision to become unaffiliated , a significant proportion of those who have become unaffiliated after being raised in a religion say they simply do not believe in God or the religious teachings of most religions .
About four - in - ten former Catholics and former Protestants who are now unaffiliated say this is an important reason they became unaffiliated .
Many of those who have become unaffiliated , however , remain open to the possibility that they could someday find a religion that suits them ; roughly one - in - three agree they just have not yet found the right religion .
Very few people say they have become unaffiliated with religion in response to events going on in their lives , such as moving to a new community , getting married , losing a loved one or getting separated or divorced .
Instead , strong majorities of those who have become unaffiliated say there are certain problems with religion , and most of those who identify these problems say they were important reasons they became unaffiliated .
For instance , across all religious upbringings , roughly three - quarters of those who have become unaffiliated say religious people tend to be hypocritical and judgmental rather than sincere and forgiving .
And most of these , including 55 % of those raised Catholic and 53 % of those raised Protestant , cite this as one of the reasons they became unaffiliated .
Three - in - four former Catholics ( 75 % ) and former Protestants ( 76 % ) who have become unaffiliated say that many religions are partly true but no religion is completely true .
Most of those who agree with this statement say this is an important reason they became unaffiliated , including 48 % of former Catholics and 43 % of former Protestants .
About seven - in - ten ( 73 % of former Catholics and 71 % of former Protestants ) say that religious organizations focus too much on rules and not enough on spirituality , with nearly half saying this is an important reason they became unaffiliated .
A slightly smaller fraction of those who have become unaffiliated say that religious leaders are more concerned with money and power than they are with truth and spirituality , and about four - in - ten say this is an important reason they decided to become unaffiliated .
In contrast to opinions on these questions , majorities of those who have become unaffiliated disagree with the idea that science proves religion is just superstition .
Only 32 % of former Catholics and the same percentage of former Protestants agree that science proves religion to be superstition , and fewer still ( less than a quarter ) say it was important in their conversion .
When asked to explain in their own words the main reason they chose to become unaffiliated , both former Catholics and former Protestants provide very similar answers .
Among both groups , religious and moral beliefs are the reason most often cited for becoming unaffiliated ; 45 % of former Catholics and 42 % of former Protestants say this .
For example , one - fifth of former Catholics ( 20 % ) and more than one - in - ten former Protestants ( 12 % ) say they became unaffiliated because they do not believe in their former religion ( or in any religion ) .
Criticisms of particular religious institutions , practices and people were somewhat less common ( 30 % for former Catholics and 25 % for former Protestants ) .
Only 4 % of former Catholics and 6 % of former Protestants say they became unaffiliated mainly in response to things going on in their lives , such as marriage and family or relocation to a new community .
Reasons for Leaving Childhood Religion
When asked a separate series of yes - or - no questions about why they left their childhood faith , more than seven - in - ten former Catholics and former Protestants ( 71 % each ) who are now unaffiliated say they just gradually drifted away from the faith , making this the most commonly offered reason by both groups .
Many also say they left their former religion because they stopped believing in its teachings , with nearly two - thirds of unaffiliated former Catholics ( 65 % ) and half of unaffiliated former Protestants ( 50 % ) saying they left their childhood religion for this reason .
Among both groups , roughly four - in - ten say they departed their former faith because their spiritual needs were not being met .
Roughly three - in - ten former Catholics ( 29 % ) and more than one - third of former Protestants ( 36 % ) were unhappy with their former religion ’s teachings about the Bible .
Most of those who express concerns about the religion ’s teachings on the Bible say their former religion interpreted the Bible too literally , with only a few saying their former faith did not follow the Bible literally enough .
Most unaffiliated former Catholics ( 56 % ) say dissatisfaction with the Catholic Church ’s teachings about abortion and homosexuality contributed to their decision to leave , and about half ( 48 % ) say the same about the Catholic Church ’s position on birth control .
Additionally , nearly four - in - ten say they left Catholicism because they were unhappy with the Catholic Church ’s treatment of women , and nearly as many ( 33 % ) express discontent with its teachings on divorce and remarriage .
Roughly one - quarter of unaffiliated former Catholics name the clergy sexual abuse scandal , discontent with the Catholic Church ’s rule that priests cannot marry and dissatisfaction with church teachings on poverty , war and the death penalty as motivating factors for having left their childhood faith .
One - in - five unaffiliated former Catholics ( 19 % ) and former Protestants ( 20 % ) say they left their childhood religion because they were uncomfortable with the sense of community at their congregation .
Interestingly , most former Protestants who take this view say their congregation was too close ( 13 % ) , with too many people involved in other people ’s business , while fewer ( 4 % ) say there was not enough sense of community at their congregation .
Among former Catholics , 10 % say there was not enough feeling of community and 5 % say their former parishes were too close , with too many people involved in others ’ private lives .
Leaving the Ranks of the Unaffiliated
Paradoxically , the unaffiliated have gained the most members in the process of religious change despite having one of the lowest retention rates of all religious groups .
Indeed , most people who were raised unaffiliated now belong to a religious group .
Nearly four - in - ten of those raised unaffiliated have become Protestant ( including 22 % who now belong to evangelical denominations ) , 6 % have become Catholic and 9 % are now associated with other faiths .
Overall , 4 % of the total U.S. adult population now belongs to a religious group after having been raised unaffiliated .
Almost one - third ( 32 % ) of those who have become religiously affiliated after an unaffiliated childhood joined their current faith as a minor , including 19 % who did so before reaching age 13 .
But only 10 % of those who have become affiliated with a religion after an unaffiliated childhood say it was mostly their parents ’ decision .
Compared with those who have remained unaffiliated , the formerly unaffiliated attended religious services more regularly as children and teenagers .
Those raised unaffiliated who joined a faith are more than twice as likely as those who have remained unaffiliated to say they attended worship services at least once a week as a child ( 23 % for those who have joined a religion vs. 10 % for those who remain unaffiliated ) , and almost four times as likely to say they attended religious services regularly as a teenager ( 23 % vs. 6 % ) .
While worship service attendance stayed very low into adulthood for those who remained unaffiliated , it more than doubled among those who joined a faith , up 28 percentage points from childhood and teenage years to 51 % as adults .
Those raised in no religion who converted to a faith also experienced a great strengthening of faith from childhood to adulthood .
Only 10 % say they had very strong faith as a child ( the same as those who stayed unaffiliated ) , but this grew 53 percentage points for those who are now affiliated , to 63 % as adults , the largest increase for any group of converts or nonconverts .
When asked whether a series of specific reasons helped lead to their first becoming affiliated with a religious group , most ( 51 % ) say they did so because their spiritual needs were not being met .
Nearly as many ( 46 % ) say they found a religion they liked more than being unaffiliated .
Far fewer cite life cycle reasons such as marriage ( 23 % ) , moving to a new community ( 15 % ) , losing a loved one ( 10 % ) or becoming separated or divorced ( 6 % ) as a reason for beginning to associate with a religion .
As with other groups of converts , enjoying the services and style of worship of a new faith stands out as the reason most commonly cited for joining their current faith by those who were raised without any religious affiliation .
Nearly three - quarters ( 74 % ) cite this as an important reason for their conversion .
A majority of those raised unaffiliated ( 55 % ) say they felt called by God to join their current faith .
Just over a quarter ( 29 % ) say they were attracted by a particular minister or pastor , and the same proportion say they were asked to join by a member of the religion .
When asked about the main reason they joined their current faith , many ( 30 % ) of those raised unaffiliated mention liking things about religious institutions , organizations and people , such as feeling a connection with a particular church .
Roughly one - in - four ( 24 % ) joined their faith because they agreed with its religious and moral teachings , with nearly as many ( 22 % ) volunteering that they joined their current religious group because something in their lives changed , such as marriage or other family reasons .
One - fifth ( 19 % ) say they joined their current religion for personal spiritual reasons .
* Revised February 2011 to correct minor reporting errors in responses to Q.3 and Q.16 , the open - ended questions that asked respondents why they left their childhood religion and joined their current religion .
Due to double - counting , some reasons for leaving and joining religions were overstated in the previous version .

Apple has made no more than $ 20 - 45 m in revenue from the app store May 13 , 2009
Posted by jeremyliew in apps
About a month ago Apple announced that one billion iphone apps have been downloaded in the first nine months .
That ’s an amazing number .
I wondered how much money Apple was making from the app store .
Although it ’s hard to come by the definitive ratio of free to paid paid to free apps , talking to industry participants I got estimates in the 1:15 to 1:40 range .
So that suggests that between 25 - 60 m paid apps have been sold .
O’Reilly recent did a survey of iphone apps and noted that the mean price for paid apps is $ 2.65 :
The weighted average price for paid apps is probably lower than this as the median is $ 1.99 and there is significant price elasticity for iphone apps , but let ’s go with the $ 2.65 .
Multiplying this by 25 - 50 m paid apps , that suggests that the cumulative revenue from iphone apps is around $ 70 - $ 160 m .
Apple gets 30 % of this so Apple has probably made around $ 20 - 45 m from the billion iPhone apps downloaded .
( Note that if you use an assumption closer to $ 1.50 for weighted average app price , then this estimate drops to around $ 12 - 27 m ) .
Now it ’s worth noting that it took 6 months to hit 500 m app downloads , and only three months for the next 500 m app downloads , so Apple ’s revenue run rate is higher than this .
Given that Apple sold 13.7 m iPhones in 2008 , the app store is not a meaningful direct contributor to their overall revenue .
Much like iTunes , Apple is using the App Store to drive demand for their hardware .
The biggest assumption here is the ratio of free to paid apps , so if any readers have better data on this , please comment .

For fashion blogger Jessica Morgan , finding the right jeans is almost a religious experience .
Morgan just bought a pair of $ 100 Madewell jeans , but her denim nirvana comes from True Religion Apparel Inc. of Vernon .
Even at $ 170 to more than $ 300 , the designer dungarees represent a sacrifice she ’s willing to make despite the fraying economy .
“ They make my butt look perky , ” said Morgan , 33 , who owns five pairs of True Religion Brand jeans .
“ That is the Holy Grail of jeans . ”
“ For women in Los Angeles , who wear jeans almost all of the time , it ’s an investment , ” said Morgan , half of the duo responsible for the popular “ Go Fug Yourself ” blog devoted to outing celebrity fashion victims .
“ If I wear them every day , they really are not that expensive . ”

While consumer spending remains woefully depressed , expensive designer jeans have been one of the few bright spots for manufacturers and retailers , according to NPD Group Inc. , a market research company .
Sales of premium brand jeans grew by 17 % during 2008 and eked out a 2.3 % increase in the most recent three - month period that ended in February , making premium denim one of a few “ pockets of growth in an otherwise fizzling fashion market , ” NPD Group said .
“ That is the time period that was the most challenging in terms of consumer spending , so any growth during that time is significant , ” said Marshal Cohen , NPD Group ’s chief industry analyst .
“ With the newfound focus on fit by some of the commodity brands coupled with women ’s never - ending quest for the perfect pair of jeans , the passion for denim is alive and well . ”
Denim is one area in which some of the most fundamental rules of the global economy do n’t appear to apply .
Other industries turn to the least expensive foreign labor pools for production .
Jeans makers have found that the high cost of manufacturing in the U.S. is actually a selling point .

“ In the U.S. , people care that their jeans are manufactured here , ” said Eric Beder , an analyst for Brean Murray , Carret & Co . “ To consumers outside the U.S. , it ’s crucial .
Jeans are considered an American tradition .
To be considered a real premium brand , you need to have the ‘ made in the USA ’ label on it . ”
Adriano Goldschmied , the Italian designer of European jeans brands Diesel , Replay , Goldie and Rivet , agrees .
In 2007 , Goldschmied ’s luxury denim label GoldSign merged with Paris - born Jerome Dahan ’s Citizens of Humanity , based in Huntington Park .
“ Nothing more than jeans represent the spirit of America , ” Goldschmied said .
“ It ’s about going to the mall , driving , having fun at the beach .
Jeans still represent the life . ”
Denim buyers are n’t going to pull the U.S. economy out of recession , but “ it does show that there are people out there who are willing to pay for this sort of thing , ” Beder said .
“ It ’s a relative bargain .
The most you are going to pay is $ 200 to $ 300 .
It ’s affordable luxury .
It lasts , and it has a lot of versatility that other clothing items do not have . ”

Karen Short , an analyst with Friedman , Billings , Ramsey , said that this year has been tough for even the most resilient brands .
Short noted that it is difficult to maintain sales at boutique clothing stores when the boutiques are folding .
Recent financial results show that the few publicly held premium jeans manufacturers are holding up fairly well .
True Religion beat analysts ’ expectations with first - quarter net income that increased 10 % to $ 7.6 million and net sales that rose 19 % to $ 63.6 million , year over year .
Joe ’s Jeans Inc. , a Commerce company whose pants retail for $ 120 and up , saw net income more than double to $ 800,000 and sales increase 8 % to $ 16.5 million .
Guess Inc. posted a 12 % boost in adjusted net earnings of $ 55.3 million , excluding a $ 22.3 - million non-cash impairment charge , and a 9 % increase in revenue to $ 561.1 million in its most recent quarter .
But VF Corp. , which owns brands such as low - cost Wrangler and high - cost 7 for All Mankind , said first - quarter profit fell 32 % to $ 100.9 million and revenue slipped 7 % to $ 1.73 billion as shoppers shied away from its upscale denim .
Advertisement
Some companies are trying to combat faltering consumer spending , in part by opening more of their own stores .
Joe ’s Jeans and True Religion made up for weakness at department stores and boutiques by going directly to customers with their own stores and websites .
True Religion ’s direct sales increased 96 % to $ 23.1 million .
The company had 49 of its own stores by the end of the first quarter , up from 18 stores in March 2008 .
“ The most important thing about my jeans is the fit , ” said True Religion chief Jeffrey Lubell , whose products are made in L.A .
“ I try to make your jeans feel like they have been in your closet for 30 years . ”
At the recent opening of the True Religion store at the Westfield Century City Shopping Center , the retailer ’s 51st , Scott Icenogle , a marketing director at MGM , bought a pair of straight - leg Ricky jeans .
Icenogle , 39 , said he was treating himself after getting a break on his 2008 taxes .

“ They fit me well and I know they are going to last a long time , ” the Hancock Park resident said .
Joelle Forte Casady of Castle Heights is another true believer in quality denim .
The wardrobe stylist recently added to her collection of about 30 pairs , which includes five by Hudson Brand and 12 by Frankie B .
“ I wear jeans five out of the seven days of the week .
If I ’m spending $ 150 to $ 250 a pair , I feel I ’m getting my money out of it if I wear them 10 times , and I wear them a lot more than that , ” Casady said .
“ That ’s instead of some sexy heel shoes I might wear six times a year . ”
“ When you think it looks nice and feels right on you , ” she said , “ then it is worth every penny . ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. economy appears destined for several years of weak growth and high unemployment that leave it vulnerable to a recession relapse after the massive dose of government stimulus wears off .

While tepid growth looks likely to resume late this year and build modestly into 2010 , the credit bust has left households and businesses unable or unwilling to borrow and spend as freely as they did before the crisis .
The U.S. government has stepped in as lender and spender of last resort , but its deep pockets are not bottomless .
Waning political and investor appetite for taking on more debt could stand in the way of any additional big spending plans .
“ When you remove the government stimulus , what the private sector can generate in terms of growth feels like a recession , ” said Jeffrey Rosenberg , head of global credit strategy at Banc of America Securities Merrill Lynch in New York .
Rosenberg thinks the U.S. economy may trudge along at a sluggish growth rate somewhere in the range of 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent while banks recover from the credit crisis , which could take another three years .
“ If that ’s what you ’re able to generate , that economy is not generating the job growth required to bring the unemployment rate down , ” Rosenberg said .
This is a much darker outlook than the one put forward by President Barack Obama ’s administration in its latest budget projections , which show economic growth bouncing back to 3.2 percent next year and hitting 4.6 percent by 2012 .
It also calls into question the staying power of a recent stock market rally .
The Standard & Poor ’s 500 is up more than 30 percent from an early March low .
The gloomier scenario assumes that banks take years to recover from losses that some economists think could reach $ 4 trillion ; consumers curb borrowing and spending as they repair the $ 11.2 trillion hole blown through their savings last year ; and the explosion in government debt drives up interest rates .
If the forecast proves accurate , it would leave the economy susceptible to a shock , such as a big jump in oil prices , and could force the United States to issue even more debt than investors expect .
That would likely increase borrowing costs , both for the government and the private sector .
NEVER SAY NEVER
Typically , deep recessions are followed by powerful recoveries because when demand finally returns , companies quickly ramp up production .
That helps explain why Wall Street has been feeling optimistic about recovery prospects .
However , recessions caused by financial crises have a history of being long , deep and difficult to fully escape .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Thursday that the current crisis was “ caused in large part by too much borrowing and too much lending .
And the adjustment process of that will be difficult . ”
How difficult that adjustment will be depends to a large degree on how dramatically consumers alter their behavior .
The saying , “ Never bet against the U.S. consumer ” has been a profitable one for many years .
But if this crisis has permanently altered consumer attitudes toward debt , it would put a considerable drag on growth because consumer spending accounts for more than two - thirds of U.S. economic activity .
The other anchor is interest rates .
Christian Broda , an economist with Barclays Capital , said higher borrowing costs “ are an inescapable feature of the post - recovery world ” as public deficits and spending grow .
Already , huge government debt issuance is raising questions about long - term U.S. fiscal stability .
Concerns grew last week that the country could be stripped of its top - tier AAA credit rating after Standard & Poor ’s said it was considering downgrading Britain ’s sovereign rating .
This week marks a big test of investor appetite for U.S. debt .
The government plans to issue a massive $ 101 billion in notes and bonds , matching the weekly record set in April .
Broda thinks the yield on 10 - year U.S. government paper may reach 6 percent by 2011 , compared with 3.4 percent now .
Because so many other loans are based on that rate , that could make it costlier to buy a house or expand a business .
NO WAY OUT
It all adds up to a sluggish economy with less cushion to cope with a shock .
What form that shock might take remains to be seen , but a jump in oil prices is one likely suspect .
Oil has nearly doubled since the start of the year , topping $ 60 per barrel on Tuesday , and futures prices suggest it will edge higher at least through the peak summer driving season .
“ You start firing up demand and guess which price goes up first ?
Oil , ” said James Galbraith , an economist who teaches at the University of Texas ’ LBJ School of Public Affairs .
“ If I were in a position to be talking strategy to the ( Obama ) administration , I would be saying you ’ve got to take the energy business seriously .
You ’re going to end up in a stagflation trap . ”
If the economy climbs out of one recession and into another , it would n’t be the first time .
It happened most recently in the early 1980s , when the United States endured two recessions in less than three years .
Regardless of what triggers a relapse , the Obama administration wo n’t stand idly by , Banc of America ’s Rosenberg said .
There will be pressure for even more stimulus spending , particularly if the economy is faltering when midterm congressional elections approach in 2010 .
“ The problem is whether or not ( stimulus ) can work without itself creating other problems , ” Rosenberg said .
“ The most likely ‘ other problem ’ is a rise in interest rates .
“ What one hand giveth , the other hand taketh away . ”

I wonder if Bill Gates released any of his pet flying syringes into the room ?
( See him practicing his antics at TED . )
Via : Times Online :
SOME of America ’s leading billionaires have met secretly to consider how their wealth could be used to slow the growth of the world ’s population and speed up improvements in health and education .
The philanthropists who attended a summit convened on the initiative of Bill Gates , the Microsoft co-founder , discussed joining forces to overcome political and religious obstacles to change .
Described as the Good Club by one insider it included David Rockefeller Jr , the patriarch of America ’s wealthiest dynasty , Warren Buffett and George Soros , the financiers , Michael Bloomberg , the mayor of New York , and the media moguls Ted Turner and Oprah Winfrey .
These members , along with Gates , have given away more than £ 45 billion since 1996 to causes ranging from health programmes in developing countries to ghetto schools nearer to home .
They gathered at the home of Sir Paul Nurse , a British Nobel prize biochemist and president of the private Rockefeller University , in Manhattan on May 5 .
The informal afternoon session was so discreet that some of the billionaires ’ aides were told they were at “ security briefings ” .
Stacy Palmer , editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy , said the summit was unprecedented .
“ We only learnt about it afterwards , by accident .
Normally these people are happy to talk good causes , but this is different – maybe because they do n’t want to be seen as a global cabal , ” he said .
Some details were emerging this weekend , however .
The billionaires were each given 15 minutes to present their favourite cause .
Over dinner they discussed how they might settle on an “ umbrella cause ” that could harness their interests .
The issues debated included reforming the supervision of overseas aid spending to setting up rural schools and water systems in developing countries .
Taking their cue from Gates they agreed that overpopulation was a priority .
This could result in a challenge to some Third World politicians who believe contraception and female education weaken traditional values .
Gates , 53 , who is giving away most of his fortune , argued that healthier families , freed from malaria and extreme poverty , would change their habits and have fewer children within half a generation .
At a conference in Long Beach , California , last February , he had made similar points .
“ Official projections say the world ’s population will peak at 9.3 billion [ up from 6.6 billion today ] but with charitable initiatives , such as better reproductive healthcare , we think we can cap that at 8.3 billion , ” Gates said then .
Patricia Stonesifer , former chief executive of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , which gives more than £ 2 billion a year to good causes , attended the Rockefeller summit .
She said the billionaires met to “ discuss how to increase giving ” and they intended to “ continue the dialogue ” over the next few months .
Another guest said there was “ nothing as crude as a vote ” but a consensus emerged that they would back a strategy in which population growth would be tackled as a potentially disastrous environmental , social and industrial threat .
“ This is something so nightmarish that everyone in this group agreed it needs big - brain answers , ” said the guest .
“ They need to be independent of government agencies , which are unable to head off the disaster we all see looming . ”
Why all the secrecy ?
“ They wanted to speak rich to rich without worrying anything they said would end up in the newspapers , painting them as an alternative world government , ” he said .

Anyone who knows me knows I ca n’t cook .
Never really tried .
Did n’t get the gene .
But after enjoying a delicious meal at the home of Kim and Bryan , the bloggers I met last weekend , I decided I might like to try my hand at it .
You see , Kim made homemade manicotti , including making the pasta shells from scratch !
I thought it would make a nice birthday dinner for my husband , Dave , and so I slaved away in the kitchen making my own pasta .
You do it by pouring a thin mixture of eggs , flour , water and oil in a saute pan and swirling it around like you would a crepe .
When the top dries , you simply pop it out on a plate and instant pasta !
I made 15 of those beauties and confidently went on to make the cheese filling and meatballs .
Did n’t they turn out nice ?
Thanks for the recipe , Kim !
I basked in the glow of knowing that if I apply myself , I can pull off a decent meal and no one even has to go to the emergency room to get their stomach pumped .
And then God said " Get over yourself .
It was a fluke . "
The very next day I made a grilled cheese sandwich in the brand new saute pan I ’d bought to make the pasta in , but did n’t wind up using .
When the pan heated , I started smelling something .
I chastised my husband for not cleaning some burned food off the stovetop .
But the smell was n’t exactly burnt food .
Oh , no .
It was the smell of stupid .
We had a good chuckle over it , took this picture for proof a moron lives here and I ate my grilled cheese sandwich .
The very next day I was making an omelette in the very same pan .
Hmmmm .
What ’s that smell ?
That ’d be the smell of short term memory loss .
You ’ll be happy to know I finally took the paper off the bottom of the pan and my house does n’t smell like burning barcode anymore .
Is this universe ’s way of telling me to get the hell out of the kitchen and leave it to the experts ?
Scientists have traced the genetic lineage of the new H1N1 swine flu to a strain that emerged in 1998 in U.S. factory farms , where it spread and mutated at an alarming rate .
Experts warned then that a pocket of the virus would someday evolve to infect humans , perhaps setting off a global pandemic .
The new findings challenge recent protests by pork industry leaders and U.S. , Mexican and United Nations agriculture officials that industrial farms should n't be implicated in the new swine flu , which has killed up to 176 people and on Thursday was declared an imminent pandemic by the World Health Organization .
" Industrial farms are super - incubators for viruses , " said Bob Martin , former executive director of the Pew Commission on Industrial Animal Farm Production , and a long - time critic of the so - called " contained animal feeding operations . "
As Wired.com reported on Tuesday , geneticists studying the composition of viruses taken from swine flu victims described it as the product of a DNA swap between North American and Eurasian swine flu strains .
On Wednesday , Columbia University biomedical informaticist Raul Rabadan added new information on the virus ' family history in a posting to ProMed , a public health mailing list .
His description paralleled that of other researchers who had analyzed the new strains , but with an extra bit of detail .
Six of the genes in swine flu looked to be descended from " H1N2 and H3N2 swine viruses isolated since 1998 . "
Experts contacted by Wired.com agreed with Rabadan 's analysis .
For researchers who track the evolution of influenza viruses , the news was chilling .
H3N2 — the letters denote specific gene variants that code for replication - enhancing enzymes — is the name of a hybrid first identified in North Carolina in 1998 , the tail end of a decade which saw the state 's hog production rise from two million to 10 million , even as the number of farms dropped .
H3N2 originated in a relatively benign swine flu strain first identified in 1918 , but had absorbed new genes from bird and human flus .
These new genes provided replication advantages that allowed the hybrid to permeate densely packed pig farms whose inhabitants were routinely shipped across the United States .
That rapid replication rate also increased the chances of strains evolving in ways that allowed them to evade hog immune systems .
Within a year , exposures topped 90 percent in several heartland states .
A retrospective news account in Science said that " after years of stability , the North American swine flu virus had jumped on an evolutionary fast track . "
At the genetic level , the years that followed remain a mystery — hog flus are poorly monitored , compared to human influenza .
But eventually an H3N2 spawn merged with a strain of Eurasian pig flu , producing the swine flu variant that 's now infecting humans .
At an environmental level , the conditions which shaped H3N2 and H1N2 evolution , and increased the variants ' chances of taking a human - contagious form , are well understood .
High - density animal production facilities came to dominate the U.S. pork industry during the late 20th century , and have been adopted around the world .
Inside them , pigs are packed so tightly that they cannot turn , and literally stand in their own waste .
Diseases travel rapidly through such immunologically stressed populations , and travel with the animals as they are shuttled throughout the United States between birth and slaughter .
That provides ample opportunity for strains to mingle and recombine .
An ever - escalating array of industry - developed vaccines confer short - term protection , but at the expense of provoking flu to evolve in unpredictable ways .
The Pew commission concluded that this system created an " increased chance for a strain to emerge that can infect and spread in humans . "
Scientists and public health experts have said the same thing for years , in even starker terms .
In 2003 , the American Public Health Association called for a ban on contained animal feeding operations .
One year later , St. Jude 's Children 's Hospital virologist Richard Webby , one of the original chroniclers of H3N2's emergence , called the U.S. swine population " an increasingly important reservoir of viruses with human pandemic potential . "
United States Department of Agriculture researcher Amy Vincent reportedly said that vaccine - driven evolution created a " potential for pandemic influenza emergence in North America . "
Officials and the pork industry argued this week that a direct link had n't been found to pigs , and that the new flu strain had yet to be found in farm animals or workers , both in the United States and at a giant hog factory near the outbreak 's epicenter in La Gloria , Mexico .
Owned by a subsidiary of Smithfield Foods , the largest U.S. pork producer and a notorious polluter , the factory processes one million hogs each year .
As of now , neither swine flu nor its close relatives have been found anywhere .
But " that probably says more about the lack of sampling in pig flu than anything else , " said Andrew Rambaut , a University of Edinburgh viral geneticist who has studied swine flu .
" We do n't sample nearly the complete diversity of pig flu around the world .
Most outbreaks go unstudied . "
On Thursday , Reuters called concern with " evil factory farms in Mexico " one of many " wild theories , " on a par with a conspiracy between Al Qaeda and Mexican drug cartels .
Indeed , the location may yet prove coincidental .
But absence of evidence at the factory and elsewhere is not evidence of absence .
The new swine flu could have emerged in a myriad number of ways , passing between any number of birds and pigs and people , at locations across North America , during its evolutionary journey .
It may well prove impossible to pinpoint exactly where it first emerged or became infectious to people .
But most of its genes are almost certainly part of a North American industrial virus lineage long expected to produce pandemic variants like this one .
" We have n't found evidence of infected pigs , " said Ian Lipkin , a Columbia University epidemiologist and member of the World Health Organization 's surveillance network .
" But even if we never find that smoking pig , we can surmise that this is probably where it came from . "
The circumstances " are certainly enough to warrant asking questions , " said Lipkin .
" The question , then , is how deeply do you want to look to try to find the evidence ? "

I was reading Jay Kuri 's article about CGI alternatives the other day , and I got thinking .
How much memory does these various modules for simple ( or advanced ) web serving use ?
After having looked through Mark Stosberg 's article on startup penalties I was even more bewildered .
It was hard to track the actual cost of each module , because the perl interpreter footprint was also in there ( and that we can not do anything with ) .
I wrote a small script called perlbloat.pl to check how each of the mentioned modules come out .
It uses the GTop module , which is Gnome 's cross - platform way of counting things such as memory .
The results was from this command :
$ for name in $ ( echo CGI HTTP :: Engine FCGI :: Engine Catalyst CGI :: Application Squatting Continuity Mojo Mojolicious Titanium HTML :: Mason CGI :: Simple ) ; do perlbloat.pl $ name ; done
Module Memory CGI :: Application 135 168 CGI :: Simple 536 576 Squatting 540 672 CGI 602 112 Continuity 1 163 264 HTTP :: Engine 2 072 576 Mojo 2 719 744 HTML :: Mason 2 916 352 Mojolicious 3 526 656 Titanium 3 559 424 FCGI :: Engine 10 280 960 Catalyst 11 046 912
Version numbers are as follows ( running on perl 5.10.0 on Ubuntu 8.10 ) :
Catalyst 5.80004
CGI 3.29
CGI :: Application 4.21
CGI :: Simple 1.110
Continuity 1.0
FCGI :: Engine 0.08
HTML :: Mason 1.42
HTTP :: Engine 0.1.8
Mojo 0.9002
Mojolicious 0.9002
Squatting 0.60
Titanium 1.01
What is interesting to notice here is that CGI :: Application actually comes out with a lower footprint than CGI :: Simple .
Considering CGI :: Application has a somewhat bigger API this is surprising .
There is of course no surprise that Catalyst is the most memory hungry module of them all .
What seems surprising , though , is that FCGI :: Engine eats so much .
It would be nice to know why .
If you consider these numbers I would like to know good reasons for using Catalyst in a high - performing environment .
To me it seems like the application servers will take a trashing because of the increased memory usage of each process if you compare it to e.g.
CGI :: Application .
Even Titanium which is pretty feature packed comes out at almost three times less memory used .
What is interesting to notice is that if you consider the typical deployment scenario for a Catalyst - based app you get these numbers :
$ perlbloat.pl Moose DBIx : : Class Catalyst
Moose added 4.8M
DBIx :: Class added 392k
Catalyst added 5.7M
Moose DBIx :: Class Catalyst added 10.9 M in total
If you consider a similar app based on HTTP :: Engine you will have this overhead :
$ perlbloat.pl Moose DBIx : : Class HTTP :: Engine
Moose added 4.8M
DBIx :: Class added 396k
HTTP :: Engine added 1.4M
Moose DBIx :: Class HTTP :: Engine added 6.7 M in total
If you turn the loading order around a little bit you get this :
$ perlbloat.pl DBIx : : Class Moose HTTP :: Engine
DBIx :: Class added 528k
Moose added 4.7M
HTTP :: Engine added 1.4M
DBIx :: Class Moose HTTP :: Engine added 6.7 M in total
What you can see from this last dump is that Moose and DBIx :: Class shares some code ( 132 k ) , but it is mostly irrelevant when you consider the cost of the rest .
Another package that is getting wildly popular these days is MooseX : : Declare ( 0.22 tested ) , and as you can see , it has pretty large footprint aswell :
$ perlbloat.pl MooseX :: Declare
MooseX :: Declare added 10.3M
If you separate Moose and MooseX : : Declare you can see that it adds up by itself ( it 's not only Moose that costs ) :
$ perlbloat.pl Moose MooseX :: Declare
Moose added 4.8M
MooseX :: Declare added 5.4M
Moose MooseX :: Declare added 10.2 M in total
If you have something to say about the numbers I 've collected here I would love to hear them .

What ’s more shocking : that Brian came out as an atheist onthis week , or thatadded a even more subversive humor in amongst its typical irreverence ?
The list of non believers on television is moderate , but they do exist .
The issue is that atheism is never really endorsed .is an equal opportunity offender and never really comes down definitively on either side of the issue .
Lisa Simpson was an early TV non-believer , but when challenged she came to accept that she may not understand everything .
Even a modern day non-believer like Dr. Gregory
House is not really an atheist .
He ’s a non-believer , a term that is far easier for the mass market to swallow .
But the truth is that around 16 % of our nation identifies itself as non-religious .
That ’s a sizable chunk of the population , and I ’m interested in how people will react to Sunday night ’sepisode .
It should also be noted that the episode was touted as the reuniting of thecast , and that turned out to be a “ B ” story with only a brief moment or two of chuckles .
Fans may want to defend , but the show has never really delved deep into a hot topic such as atheism .
Any push button moments are offset by a cut to Conway Twitty or Peter holding his scraped knee for two minutes .
What was interesting about the Brian as atheist story is that while played up for the humor , there 's a level of truth in his plight .
Sure Brian fakes loving god in order to get booze , and that 's verymoment , but much of the episode that felt more likemixed with Bill Maher .
The notion that an atheist is " Worse Than Hitler " did not originate with Seth McFarlane
It will be interesting to see how people perceive the episode .
Often the vocal hardened Christians immediately exclaim that it ’s Christians who are the most derided , especially by atheists .
But that ’s like saying more white kids made the football team in my hometown in Western New York .
Of course that ’s true , there are far more of them .
There are more Christians in the world than atheists , and Christianity is not a taboo .
When feeling subversive any creative artist can take pot shots at Christians to add some shock value .
Even atheists prefer that when Christians are made fun of it be done with some intelligence .
I ’m not sure what I expected out of Brian ’s story , but what I did n’t expect is that he would still be an atheist by the end of the episode .
It ’s a ballsy move to out a character so explicitly , and then keep them in the same frame of mind at the end .
Most of the time , as was the case with Lisa Simpson , there ’s a nice middle ground that all can agree on .
Then everyone agrees and the non-believers and Christians hug in an embrace of tolerance .
Buthas cut right to the heart of something important . , and it 's upsetting that as a society we so ready to accept atheists as evil , and then act accordingly .
But when called on this there ’s usually a rise that turns the argument into the tried and true , “ but atheists are far meaner to Christians . ”
That does n’t explain why the 16 % of people who would identify themselves as non-religious never check the “ other ” box and fill in “ atheist ” on a job application .
You might as well write that you ’re a serial rapist .
Yet talk to the average man on the street and it's hard to find anyone willing to vocalize hatred towards atheists .
Or maybe I 'm just be so damn charming that no one can hate me .
My general perception is that society ’s derision for the atheist is a mob mentality .
Forto not only take this issue on , but to remain stoic in the stance of its character , feels like a significant moment .
I doubt anyone is going to take note though .
may have been subsequently cancelled , but the show is still heralded as a watershed moment for homosexuals on television .
Sure the episode was funny , but I have to wonder what the mob reaction to ’s out and atheist tale will be .

ProPublica has been reporting for months about how natural gas drilling is affecting the environment , but of all the causes for concern we 've reported , here 's a doozy .
Sixteen cattle dropped dead in a northwestern Louisiana field this week after apparently drinking from a mysterious fluid adjacent to a natural gas drilling rig , according to Louisiana 's Department of Environmental Quality and a report in the Shreveport Times .
At least one worker told the newspaper that the fluids , which witnesses described as green and spewing into the air near the drilling derrick , were used for a drilling process called hydraulic fracturing .
But the company , Chesapeake Energy , has not identified exactly what chemicals are in those fluids and is insisting to state regulators that no spill occurred .
The problem is that both Chesapeake and its contractor doing the work Schlumberger , say that a lot of these fluids are proprietary , said Otis Randle , regional manager for the DEQ .
" It can be an obstacle , but we try to be fair to everybody , " he said .
" We try to remember that the products they use are theirs and they need them to make a living . "
Hydraulic fracturing -- a process in which water , sand and chemicals are pumped deep underground at high pressure to break rock and release natural gas -- is controversial because of the secrecy surrounding the fluids and because the process is exempted from protections of the Safe Drinking Water Act and thus from regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency .
Congress is currently considering legislation to address these issues out of concern that fracturing , and the fluids and waste that are part of the process , may be contaminating drinking water in several states .
Hydraulic fracturing has made drilling more efficient and economical and has helped make vast new reserves of natural gas available across the country , including in New York , Pennsylvania , Texas , Wyoming , Colorado and Louisiana .
Scientists at the EPA and the U.S. Geological Survey have told ProPublica that it 's difficult for them to assess the environmental risks posed by hydraulic fracturing chemicals because the companies that use them wo n't release the exact names and amounts of the chemicals .
The energy service companies , including Halliburton and Schlumberger , say that disclosing that information would put them at a competitive disadvantage , and they insist the fluids are safe .
Some information about the materials is made available through Material Safety Data Sheets , which can provide cursory medical advice for workers exposed to the chemicals .
The drilling companies have given Louisiana 's DEQ a large stack of these sheets .
Randle said they contain some helpful information , but it will take the agency some time to weed through them .
In the field where the cattle died on Tuesday , the DEQ reports finding a white milky substance on the ground , with cattle tracks leading away to the dead animals .
Randle said he is almost certain the substance is a drill fluid or fracturing fluid .
A Chesapeake Energy spokesman told ProPublica that the company is cooperating with the state and is waiting for test results to determine how the cows died .
Schlumberger did not immediately return calls for comment .
If we hear from the company , we 'll let you know .
A senior enlisted Army soldier was convicted on Wednesday of killing four handcuffed and blindfolded Iraqi men with pistol shots to the backs of their heads shortly after arresting them in Baghdad two years ago , The Associated Press reported .
A military jury in Germany , where his unit is deployed , found the soldier , Master Sgt. John E. Hatley , guilty of premeditated murder in the deaths of the men , whom he and several other members of his unit had detained after a firefight with insurgents in Baghdad in spring 2007 , according to testimony in the case .
Sergeant Hatley , 40 , who was a first sergeant at the time  the senior noncommissioned officer in his company  is the highest - ranking American service member to be convicted of murder in the war .
He faces a minimum sentence of life in prison .
Two other senior members of his unit  Company A , First Battalion , First Infantry Division  were also convicted of killing some of the men .
Top five landing spots for Jake Peavy
The White Sox thought they had added an ace last week when they worked out a deal with the Padres that would have sent ( among others ) their top two pitching prospects – Clayton Richard and Aaron Poreda – to San Diego in exchange for starting pitcher Jake Peavy .
But with his desire to stay in the National League at the forefront of his decision , Peavy exercised his no - trade option and nixed the deal before it was completed .
Now that that deal has been squashed , where will Peavy wind up when the curtain closes on the 2009 baseball season ?
Or will he even be traded at all ?
I ’ve ranked the top 5 landing spots for Peavy and why each club will and wo n’t land the San Diego ace .
1. Milwaukee Brewers
Why they ’ll land Peavy :
If the Cubs ’ offense continues to struggle , then Chicago will more than likely trade for a bat instead of adding another arm to its starting rotation .
With the Cubs seemingly focused on their offense , a path could clear for the Brewers to make the Padres an offer for Peavy .
Do n’t forget that the Brewers surprised a lot of baseball pundits who believed they would never trade top prospect Matt LaPorta for ace CC Sabathia last season , but Milwaukee did just that .
So while the Brewers do n’t have the young pitching prospects that San Diego might covet , they certainly have a ton of young position talent that they could offer to pull off a deal .
Plus , even though they lost Sabathia to free agency in 2009 , Peavy would be under contract through the 2013 season , so at least the Brewers would n’t have to worry about giving up more top prospects for a pitcher that ’ll walk again at the end of the year .
Why they wo n’t : After almost acquiring the White Sox ’s top two pitching prospects , indications are that San Diego is looking for young arms in exchange for Peavy – which Milwaukee simply does n’t have .
The Brewers have a slew of young position talent , but outside of Jeremy Jeffress they do n’t have many top arms in their farm system .
If the Padres have their heart set on acquiring starting pitching , they ’ll have to look elsewhere , because the Brewers just do n’t have enough to make a worthwhile offer .
Plus , a small market team like Milwaukee might eventually be scared away by the $ 63 million ( $ 11 million is still owed to him in 2009 ) that remains on Peavy ’s contract .
2. Chicago Cubs
Why they ’ll land Peavy : Because outside of the White Sox , they ’ve come the closest to landing Peavy to date .
During baseball ’s winter meetings in December , a rumored deal involving the Cubs , Padres and Phillies was reportedly on the table , with Chicago landing Peavy , Philadelphia acquiring Mark DeRosa and San Diego getting Jason Marquis and two pitching prospects from the Phillies .
But the Cubs eventually walked away from the negotiation table because the Padres ’ and GM Kevin Towers were asking for too much in return .
But after their cross - town rivals the White Sox almost landed him , the Cubs might have been awoken to the possibility of once again pursuing Peavy .
And considering they ’ve lost seven in a row and just placed Rich Harden on the 15 - day disabled list , the Cubs could use a shot in the arm like Peavy , because they ’re certainly built to win now , not later .
Why they wo n’t :
The Cubs current seven - game losing streak has nothing to do with their pitching staff – it ’s their offense that has recently let them down .
They ’ve averaged less than 1.5 runs per contest over their last seven games and if they were to make a trade soon , it would probably be for a bat – not another arm .
Plus , Harden ’s injury is n’t considered to be serious and the club just got Carlos Zambrano back from the DL .
Throw in the fact that Ted Lilly , Ryan Dempster and even Randy Wells ( who had been filling in for Zambrano and will remain a starter now that Harden has been placed on the DL ) have been very good so far this season , and one would get the impression that the Cubs ’ starting rotation is set this year .
3. San Diego Padres
Why they ’ll hang onto Peavy : Everyone is assuming that GM Kevin Towers is desperate to trade Peavy , but that ’s not necessarily the case .
Remember , Peavy is already under contract through 2013 , so it ’s not like he ’s a soon - to - be free agent and the Padres are scrambling to get something for him before he hits the open market .
Plus , he ’s pitching well this season and San Diego is currently one of the hottest teams in baseball .
The Padres are not expected to be competitive for an entire season , but if they continue to win , Towers might not feel as inclined to deal his ace this year .
( Or at least not before the trade deadline . )
Why they wo n’t :
They might not be completely desperate to trade Peavy , but they are desperate to get the rest of his $ 63 million salary off their books .
Peavy is still owed $ 11 million this season and another $ 52 million through 2013 and San Diego would rather free that money up as they try to rebuild through youth .
If Towers could get two top pitching prospects and free up some salary , he ’s going to jump at the opportunity just as he did when the White Sox offered Clayton Richard and Aaron Poreda before Peavy exercised his no -trade option .
4. Los Angeles Dodgers
Why they ’ll land Peavy : Considering they ’re up against mostly Triple A teams in their division , it ’s probably safe to assume that the Dodgers will win the NL West walking away .
But pitching wins in the postseason and while the Dodgers ’ starters have been absolutely phenomenal ( they have a staff ERA of 3.74 , which is the lowest in baseball ) , Peavy could put L.A. over the top .
GM
Ned Colletti at least has to kick the tires on a trade with San Diego , because a starting four of Peavy , Chad Billingsley , Randy Wolf and either Clayton Kershaw or Eric Stults would be deadly in the postseason .
Why they wo n’t : The Padres and Dodgers both play in the NL West and you just do n’t trade within your division .
Chances are , Padres GM Kevin
Towers would ask for a small fortune in a deal with the Dodgers and therefore Peavy might not be worth the money and prospects for L.A. in the end .
5. Chicago White Sox
Why they ’ll land Peavy :
While rumors persist that he wants to stay in the National League , Peavy admitted that he and his agent are n’t closing the door on the White Sox , who were willing to give up two top prospects to acquire his services .
If the Padres start to sink to the bottom of the NL West , maybe Peavy will get anxious to play for a contender and accept Chicago ’s deal , which still stands assuming the White Sox are in contention themselves later in the season .
Why they wo n’t :
Peavy seems pretty steadfast that he wants to remain in the NL and has already rejected the opportunity to join the White Sox .
While it ’s not completely unfathomable , it would be surprising if he changes his mind and accepted a deal to play for the Sox and in the AL .
Other possibilities : Braves , Astros and Cardinals .
Peavy mentioned these three clubs ( along with the Dodgers and Cubs ) as possible teams that he would like to play for if he ’s traded , although the Astros and Cardinals would probably balk at the idea of taking on Peavy ’s salary .
The Braves could be a potential dark horse team considering they were already engaged in talks with the Padres over Peavy last winter .
The RAF policed no - fly zones over Iraq for 12 years during peacetime
The RAF has ended its involvement in Iraq , after 19 years of operations that began with the 1990 Gulf War .
From today , most British air personnel remaining in the country will return to the UK .
The RAF Ensign - flown at Basra Airport in southern Iraq since 2003 - has been lowered at a ceremony for 903 Expeditionary Air Wing .
A total of 22 RAF personnel died in Operation Telic , the name given to the UK military mission in Iraq since 2003 .
The RAF was deployed on operations in the Gulf in August 1990 , when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait .
' Justifiably proud '
It enforced the northern and southern zones for 12 years before playing a key role in the invasion of Iraq and the subsequent six - year British military mission .
Combat operations officially drew to a close at the end of April , with UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown hailing their " success story " .
On Friday , Wing Commander Ian Richardson , officer commanding 903 EAW , took the salute as the ensign was lowered .
Basra airfield had officially been handed over to Iraqi control in January as part of moves to wind down Britain 's commitments in the country .
Chief of the Air Staff , Air Chief Marshal Sir Glenn Torpy , said : " The RAF can be justifiably proud of what it has achieved over many years in Iraq and I would like to express my sincere thanks to all the personnel who have been involved in the various phases of this long campaign . "
Republicans are up in arms over the insinuation that their historical reenactments of acts of violent vandalism are somehow extremist .
So they are comparing themselves — favorably !— to the guy in Fight Club who blows up banks .
Today 's meme on the right is that Obama 's storm troopers are deliberately painting law - abiding , peaceful tax protesters as dangerous right - wing terrorists .
This fantasy is based on the confluence of two events :
The scheduled " tea party " events wherein white rich people can vent their rage at having to concede power to a nonwhite rich people , and the release this week of a Department of Homeland Security bulletin warning local authorities to be on the look - out for right - wing nutjobs .
When Michelle Malkin hears " violent right - wing extremism , " her ears naturally start burning .
She thinks DHS was talking about her , and she 's outraged .
OK , so if the Tea Baggers are n't violent extremists seeking the overthrow of the federal government , what are they , then ?
Over to you , Matt Mackowiak , Republican operative and former press secretary to Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison , writing in the Austin - American Statesman :
The coming revolution is akin to " Fight Club , " the 1999 film that follows the struggles of day to day life for a regular guy who starts an underground fight club as radical and not terribly productive psychotherapy .
As Brad Pitt 's character , Tyler Durden , says in the movie , " Fight Club was the beginning , now it 's moved out of the basement , it 's called Project Mayhem . "
Tyler Durden , you may remember , was the imaginary friend a boring guy in a suit created during his descent into psychosis .
And Project Mayhem , you will recall , was a plot to destroy the nation 's financial system by blowing up credit card companies .
Which is a fair approximation of what the Republican Party accomplished during its eight years in the White House .
So get it straight , Obamatards : Tea Baggers are not violent madmen .
They just aspire to be like characters in movies who murder people and plant truck bombs in buildings in a coordinated effort to overthrow the existing power structure , with which they disagree .
There are some other ways the Republican Party is like Fight Club :
They are both comically and deeply homoerotic .
They are both always fighting among themselves for no reason .
They are both fucking insane .
They both have shitty endings .

It 's almost St. Patrick 's day -- when even non -beer - drinkers usually get into the spirit and hoist a Guinness , or at the very least don some Guinness memorabilia .
Let 's take a nontraditional approach to honoring the brew that will be so popular tomorrow by looking at someone behind the scenes who helped create Guinness ' high - quality and consistent signature brew , and who revolutionized the world of quantitative research : a statistician .
Beer and statistics ?
That 's right ...
Imagine my delight as I stumbled upon the great beer - statistics connection when doing some reading a few weeks ago for my Quantitative Analysis communication class , and in my reading I learned about the t-test , which , in the simplest of terms , allows a researcher to compare small sample means ( mathematical averages ) to learn more about a population as a whole .
The original t- test was developed by William Sealy Gosset , a biochemist who worked for Guinness in the early 20th century .
At this time , the Guinness brewery was taking the progressive step of hiring statisticians , chemists and other scientists to improve the quality and consistency of their ingredients and their beer .
Gosset could only test small samples out of the entire quantity of beer brewed by Guinness while he worked there .
He also tested samples of barley grown by the brewery .
He came up with a statistical formula that would let him prove whether or not the very small samples reflected a much larger population ( in this case , the ' population ' would be all of the beer or barley used in Guinness ' operations ) .
Previously , statistical research had focused only on testing with large samples .
In addition , Gosset independently discovered another statistical distribution rule while observing the distribution of yeast cells during the brewing process .
Gosset 's work founded the concept of quality control , which is used in all types of industries today , and his t distribution proved fundamental to the use of statistics in the 20th century .
According to this biography of Gosset , " It is difficult to overestimate the importance of this achievement .
It has proven fundamental to statistical inference as it exists today , not only in the realm of estimation , but also in hypothesis testing and the analysis of variance . "
When Gosset published his work on the t-test in 1908 in the journal Biometrika , his writings had to be published under the pseudonym " Student , " because Guinness did not want competitors to know their scientific trade secrets and forbade employees from publishing work under their own names .
So , the t statistic is still known today as " Student 's t- test . "
The wonderfully - named Web site " Tales of Statisticians " includes another good quote about Gosset from a fellow statistician , Egon Pearson :
This St. Paddy 's day , raise a glass to Mr. Gosset and give him the proper credit he deserves !
We might not be celebrating with so many delicious glasses of Guinness in hand without all of his hard work and revolutionary ideas .

European astronomers said Tuesday that they had discovered the smallest planet yet found orbiting another star .
The planet could be as little as only 1.9 times as massive as the Earth and belongs to a dim red star known as Gliese 581 , which lies about 20 light - years from Earth in the constellation Libra .
The star was already know to harbor at least three more massive planets .
The new planet , known as Gliese 581e , is probably rocky like the Earth , but it lies in such a close orbit  only three million miles from its star  that it is surely blasted with too much radiation and heat to be livable .
Michel Mayor , of Geneva Observatory , and his colleagues announced their results at a conference at the University of Hertfordshire in Britain and in a paper submitted to the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics .
Astronomers said the discovery was more encouragement that the galaxy was full of small - mass planets and that with more time and improved instruments like the Kepler satellite , recently launched by NASA , they would eventually find Earth - like planets in orbits suitable for life around other stars .
PADUCAH , Kentucky ( CNN ) --
" You probably think I 'm a monster . "
Former U.S. soldier Steven Green has been convicted of raping and killing a 14 - year - old Iraqi girl .
That 's what FBI agents said former U.S. soldier Steven Green told them nearly three years ago about accusations that he had raped a 14 - year - old Iraqi girl and killed her and her family .
Green was found guilty Thursday in U.S. District Court in Paducah of the crimes and could face the death penalty .
Green spoke as the agents and he drove from his grandmother 's home in Nebo , North Carolina , where he'd been arrested , to a detention center 45 minutes away in Asheville , North Carolina , authorities said .
According to court documents :
Green had taken his grandmother to dinner , and the two had plans for a movie .
Agents asked the former Army private whether they could tell her the reason for his arrest .
Green initially said yes , but changed his mind , not wanting to upset her .
Agents let him smoke a few cigarettes before putting him in the car for the drive .
Without prompting , Green spoke .
" Knew you guys were coming , " he said .
It was June 30 , 2006 , a month and a half after his discharge from the military .
Green was a former member of the 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division , based in Fort Campbell , Kentucky .
The agents asked no questions .
They listened as Green talked during the drive .
" All of my buddies were getting killed over there .
My lieutenant got his face blown off .
... George Bush and Dick Cheney ought to be the ones that are arrested . "
Green , a high school dropout , was a product of Bush 's hometown of Midland , Texas .
He had enlisted in 2005 , leaving the hot , dry , oil - rich land of the Permian Basin for another hot , dry , oil - rich land .
" Joining the Army was the worst decision I ever made , " he said .
Now , Green stands convicted for crimes he committed as a soldier .
Prosecutors said he and others in his unit plotted an attack on an Iraqi family .
Green herded the parents and younger sister of 14 - year - old Abeer al - Janabi into another room of a house while two accomplices raped her .
He then gunned down her parents and her 6 - year - old sister , before joining in the rape and killing the teenager .
The crimes happened in the Mahmoudiya area of Iraq , south of Baghdad , in 2006 .
Last week , a federal jury in McCracken County , Kentucky , deliberated for more than 10 hours before convicting Green for murder , rape , conspiracy and obstruction of justice , according to the court 's Web site .
Guilty on all 17 counts .
Four other former soldiers are in prison for their roles in the crime and the cover - up that followed .
Pvt. 1st Class James Barker , Sgt. Paul Cortez , Pvt. 1st Class Jesse Spielman and Pvt. 1st Class Bryan Howard received sentences ranging from 27 months to 110 years , with the possibility of parole in 10 years in the most severe cases .
They were convicted and sentenced in a military court .
On Monday , as the penalty phase of his trial begins , Green might become the first former U.S. soldier to face the death penalty for war crimes before a civilian court .
The reason for the distinction : Green was discharged from the military before his crimes came to light .
When the killings became public in 2006 , the Iraqi public was enraged and some Iraqi officials demanded that American soldiers accused of crimes against civilians face prosecution in Iraqi courts .
U.S. military and civilian officials condemned the attack and vowed to bring those responsible to justice .

Earlier today , the FBI and Conroe Police Department announced that 20 - plus year Conroe PD veteran Sgt. Michael Tindall has been charged in federal court withfor allegedly stealing $ 28,672 from the bank where he worked as a security guard in his off time .
Tindall “ has been a friend and part of the Conroe Police Department family and I ’ve enjoyed my relationship with him , ” Conroe police Chief Charlie Ray said today during a press conference .
“ We ’ve had no reason to think bad things about him and it ’s just sad . ”
According to court documents , Tindall entered the 1st Bank of Conroe on August 11 , 2008 wearing gloves , a white motorcycle helmet and aviator sunglasses , vaulted over the teller ’s counter and demanded money located in the tellers ’ bottom drawer .
Apparently , this branch only kept bait money in its top drawers , a practice that is not industry - wide .
Once the robber had the money , he jumped back over the counter and went outside , where he drove off in a silver Chevy Malibu .
The FBI says no one saw the robber use a weapon .
The very next day , a bank official contacted the FBI , which investigates all bank robberies , saying that after watching the security tape , he believed the robber was a Conroe police officer who sometimes worked security at the bank .
The bank official said the robber both looked like Tindall and that he seemed to know the bank ’s layout and in which drawer the money was kept .
A teller told the FBI that the robber ’s voice sounded like Tindall .
For months , the investigation continued .
Then in late November 2008 , Chief Charlie Ray contacted the FBI to say that after watching the security tape , he too believed the robber was Tindall based on the robber ’s hand gestures and the way he walked .
Additionally , another member of law enforcement said he thought the helmet the robber wore looked the same as the one Tindall had worn while go - karting at a children festival event years earlier .
The indictment , which was unsealed today , caps off a seven - month long investigation .
Authorities would not comment on what the motive may have been but Ray did say that Tindall will be , at least for now , suspended without pay .
Tindall is expected to appear in federal court for his initial appearance on Wednesday .
“ This has been a difficult thing to do , ” said Ray .
“ This is not just a betrayal of the public ’s trust but also of the hard working , honest officers in our office . ”
My name is Kenneth and I write cool Mac and iPhone software .
This is my personal weblog where I post about stuff I find interesting .
I usually write about Mac development , the business of shareware and the Mac community in general .
When one hears stories from iPhone developers , they ’re either from the lucky ones who made insane amounts of money and laugh all the way to the bank , or rather from disappointed developers who consider their efforts a failure .
The latter tend to blame the App Store for the failure of their application (s ) .
Granted , the App Store is a harsh market which has both its advantages and its flaws .
But , in my humble opinion , a good craftsman never blames his tools .
The App Store has trends that can be analyzed , and if you ’re going to be developing for the iPhone , you need to learn how to adapt .
I have learnt this first - hand through experimentation , and have learnt many valuable lessons along the way .
Last September , while working on a much bigger iPhone game , I thought it would be cool to create a quick one - trick application for viewing jokes .
I never envisioned that iLaugh would become my most lucrative app that would keep me going while I develop the aforementioned game .
The Y - Axis shows daily revenue in US dollars .
Let ’s leave the end of the graph ( Feb - Apr ) aside for a minute , we ’ll get back to it .
You can see the initial release spikes , typical of the App Store , and then a very depressing downwards trend right after release .
For the second release , 1.1 , I upped the price from $ 0.99 to $ 1.99 .
Which slightly lowered the initial spike revenue .
But at that stage , I had a much more mature app which unfortunately , due to lack of effective marketing stagnated at a sub - $ 20 daily revenue .
But in February , I made pretty much the best decision I have ever made .
That , of course , was to release a Lite version .
I initially thought it would be a nearly cost - free way to get some free advertising for the premium version .
The main reason I put ads inside the Lite version was actually not to create revenue , but rather to give users a reason to upgrade .
But , other than that , the Lite version was an identical , fully functional copy of the premium version .
As you can see , it did a pretty decent job of advertising the premium version .
Since the mid-Feb release of iLaugh Lite , daily revenue for iLaugh has been much higher than it previously was .
Fortunately , iLaugh Lite became quite popular on the iTunes App Store , and while never entering the global top 100 , it has charted as high as # 29 on the Entertainment chart , and has been in the top 40 entertainment apps nearly since its release .
While this did have some unexpected consequences , like bringing my entire server down due to excessive traffic which brought the iLaugh service down and forced me to upgrade to a better server , the benefits were pretty clear .
This graph shows daily iLaugh Lite downloads .
This equates to about 100,000 monthly downloads .
Here ’s a graph that shows the web - service traffic this generates ( since each joke is fetched from my server , this gives me a pretty good overview of the actual usage of the app ) .
Unfortunately , I only started using this particular analytics package on March 2nd , so that ’s when the graph starts .
To date , iLaugh has served over 6 million jokes , and it ’s going at about one million per week .
So far I left out one pretty important thing : ad revenue .
But one always leaves the best for last , right ?
So here goes :
As the installed user - base for iLaugh Lite grows , so does daily ad revenue .
Currently , I ’m seeing pretty good numbers .
I have around 6 million monthly ad impressions , and as you can see in the above graph , I ’m seeing around $ 100 daily ad revenue .
While these are n’t mind - shattering numbers , I think they give a pretty good overview of what one can achieve as an average developer for the iPhone platform .

Across the private sector , workers are swallowing hard as their employers freeze salaries , cancel bonuses , and institute longer work days .
America 's employees can see for themselves how steeply business has fallen off , which is why many are accepting cost - saving measures with equanimity -- especially compared to workers in France , where riots and plant takeovers have become regular news .
But then there is the U.S. public sector , where the mood seems very European these days .
In New Jersey , which faces a $ 3.3 billion budget ...
Ambitious , legally binding plans ' set an example for the rest of the world to follow ' , says Jonathan Porritt
This article is more than 11 years old

Wales today laid out radical plans to make it one of the most energy - and resource - efficient countries in the world within a generation .
The government development plans , which are legally binding , are far in advance of anything planned for England or Scotland and would see it become energy self - sufficient in using renewable electricity within 20 years and reduce waste to zero by 2050 .
The proposals would make Wales one of only three countries in the world legally bound to develop " sustainably " .
" We intend to reduce by 80 - 90 % our use of carbon - based energy , resulting in a similar reduction in our greenhouse gas generation , " said Jane Davidson , the Welsh environment minister , launching the sustainable development scheme at the Guardian 's Hay festival .
" We are committed to making annual 3 % cuts in greenhouse gas emissions from 2011 , " she added .
" This is about living within our resources while improving people 's well being .
It will require radical changes in Welsh society , " said Rhodri Morgan , first minister for Wales , which is currently celebrating 10 years of devolution .
The report sets out a series of ambitious goals :
• to produce more electricity from renewables than the nation consumes within 20 years
• increase recycling rates from 36 % today to over 70 % by 2025
• send just 5 % of Welsh waste to landfill sites by 2025
• phasing out free plastic bags
• developing new marine and biomass energy plants
" Waste will be taboo .
Heavy industry and power generation will greatly improve their energy efficiency , " says the report , " there will be a consistent drop in energy and water demand . "
Jonathan Porritt , the chair of the UK Sustainable development commission , said : " Wales will set an example for the rest of the world to follow .
[ Its ] government is showing a serious commitment to making Wales a truly sustainable country . "
Communities in south Wales will become part of one of Europe 's few " low carbon regions " , with 40,000 social housing homes equipped with solar , wind and heat - saving equipment .
Davidson said that £ 623 m was expected to be spent in the next three years on improving energy efficiency in homes in Wales , which has some of the highest rates of fuel poverty rates .
Most of the money will come from energy companies .
Plans for a 3 % annual cut in greenhouse emissions from 2011 were questioned as being below the 6 % needed to hold climate change emissions to just a 2 % rise .
" The figures were adopted before the latest estimates of what was needed , " said Morgan .
Some of the plans are likely to run into opposition in rural areas , where there are fears that large swathes of mid and north Wales will be turned to wind farms .
Davidson said that roughly 2 % of Welsh land would be devoted to wind farms , mostly in areas currently forested .
The plan commits Wales to becoming possibly the only " one planet " country in the world , ie a nation whose use of resources could be sustained for the entire global population .
The Welsh ecological footprint has been estimated to be over 5.2 ha per person today .
The intention is to reduce it to under 1.9 ha within 25 years .
Forgive me if a lot of this is repeated on the show tonight , some of it word - for - word .
It 's a little much to try to write this twice .
My mother never knew she had terminal cancer .
After a lifetime of doctors ' visits , she gave up on them three years ago and would not listen to arguments .
Late in March , she fell getting out of bed , was taken to the hospital , and , when x-rayed , was found to have a large mass in her chest .
Later examinations showed five lesions in her brain .
There was nothing to be done but try to reduce her pain .
Though it was inevitable and though in many respects it was a release for her , it still was exactly the kind of shock one would expect when she died , barely two weeks after she fell .
I did what a lot of us do in such circumstances : full speed ahead , with occasional hours or days off to go see her and my family .
We had the Memorial on the 9th , with a plan to bring my sister and nephew down from their home upstate so he could see his first games at the new Yankee Stadium when his spring vacation began on the 18th .
I put in for a long weekend so I could take him to the games on Saturday , Sunday , Monday night , Tuesday night , and Wednesday .
I went to the opener of the ballpark on the preceding Thursday ( the 16th ) and then went downtown to do the show .
And somewhere during the day I hit an emotional wall about my mother 's passing .
So on short notice I asked my bosses to extend my long weekend from Saturday - Tuesday , to Friday - Tuesday , and they generously agreed .
The 17th proved very therapeutic - saw the Yankees in the afternoon and the Mets at night .
Some people meditate ; I go watch baseball .
I hit another kind of wall over the weekend and by Monday I was in bed with flu or something like it .
Monday 's game was rained out , much to my nephew 's dismay , but the next night was the game in which a player 's bat flew into the stands and he got to keep it ( a player wearing the same number , oddly enough , that Chuck Knoblauch wore when his throw hit my mother in our seats at the ballpark back in 2000 ) .
By Wednesday morning I felt well enough to take him up for a matinee on a rainy day in the Bronx , and then return to the show .
I 've gone into this in such excruciating detail because this afternoon I discovered this :
If you regularly tune in to Countdown with Keith Olbermann on MSNBC , you may remember that Olbermann was mysteriously absent from the show for three days at the end of April .
But Olbermann did n't just " have the night off , " as David Shuster , his fill - in , said on the air three evenings in a row .
According to a source inside MSNBC , it was a bizarre temper tantrum on Olbermann 's part that led him to storm off the set in protest ...
Olbermann was not scheduled to take a vacation at the end of April .
But he ended up missing three shows : Friday , April 17 ; Monday ; April 20 , and Tuesday , April 21 .
This message from a parallel universe , posted by somebody named Remy Stern , went on to explain that I had had a fight with Rachel Maddow over the booking of Ben Affleck as a guest .
In fact , Affleck had been tentatively booked for Countdown , then wound up on Rachel 's show due to some really shoddy work by a fill - in publicist for his latest movie .
This double - booking stuff happens ; it was resolved internally and quickly , and the only thing it had to do with my weekend of mourning was that it happened more or less contemporaneously , if I remember correctly .
The irony in this is even the gossip guy recognizes that the story he 's printing does n't hold together .
The biggest question — and one no one can really answer except for Olbermann himself — is why having Ben Affleck on his show meant so much to him in the first place .
The two have a past : Affleck spoofed the MSNBC host late last year , although Olbermann seemed to find the imitation flattering as you can see in this clip .
It 's much more likely that Affleck 's role in this latest bit of drama did n't matter all that much , and this was just Olbermann attempting to once again force MSNBC to give in to his demands and satiate his ego .
In which case , it was just another day at MSNBC .
Yeah , there 's the problem with your pretend - reporting right there .
It was n't about Ben Affleck .
My mother died .
Mr. Stern claims a reliable source , yet published before he could receive a denial which would have deflated most of his delusions , which are pretty standard stuff about me circa 2003 .
He also brings Dan Abrams into his epic , which from Mr. Stern 's point of view is rather unfortunate because considering Mr. Abrams ' irrelevance to the rest of the story , and indeed now to MSNBC , it does rather point a finger towards a small group that could be the " sources " of this sad , and sadly out - of - touch , gossip .
The site refused to remove the false story , refused to apologize for trodding on a weekend of mourning , refused to recognize its extraordinary failure and irresponsibility .
It merely printed my protest , and then this really sad retort :
Our Response :
We were saddened to hear of Olbermann 's loss and found his tribute to his mother deeply moving .
But if that was the reason Olbermann took time off two weeks later , we can't imagine why Olbermann would n't have simply said as much .
Furthermore , we find it hard to believe one of his colleagues at MSNBC — a respected journalist , no less — would have attributed his absence to the " flu / allergy season " if Olbermann had made the perfectly understandable decision take ( sic ) a few days to mourn his mother 's passing .
When did n't I say as much - and to whom ?
To " Cityfile " ?
The journalist referred to , David Shuster , was told why I was out , and told I was also under the weather and my return might be Wednesday , might be Thursday , so he was on stand - by .
He had to clear this with a gossip website before it decided whether or not it was believable ?
This website has now called me a liar because I also went to ballgames after my mother died .
The first site to link off this crap and swallow it whole was , sadly , Wonkette .
Advised of its mistake , its editor Ken Layne , who apparently does not understand that laughing all the time about everything is not wit , but more likely a serious medical condition , wrote :
Keith Olbermann Denies This One Particular Instance of Jackassery !...
Whoo hoo , does this mean Wonkette is now " beneath contempt " in Keith Olbermann ’s mind ?
Self - important much ?
Yeah .
My dead mother is , in fact , more important than your website .
Again , I 'm sorry this has been in such detail .
But I think it serves a purpose in reminding us about both the internet and ( I know how strange this will sound ) remembering the human equation , even in the heat of public discourse , which is why I objected on - air to Wanda Sykes ' two jokes about Rush Limbaugh at the White House Correspondents ' Dinner .
Political dispute is one thing .
Let 's leave everybody 's kidneys , possible roles as the 20th 9/11 hijacker , and mothers out of it .
In an irony of timing I was going to do the new WTF segment tonight on John McCain 's mother 's comments on The Tonight Show about Limbaugh and Steele and me , but as this nonsense broke around me this afternoon it struck me just how absurd that idea was .
She was just a mother sticking up for her son .
Good for you , Roberta .
My Mom would 've appreciated that
Finally , and just for the record , I also mysteriously took off on Monday May 4th , and was seen at the Yankees game that night with my friends Jason Bateman and David Cross .
Stay tuned to " Cityfile " or " Wonkette " : maybe I had had a fistfight with Brian Williams earlier in the day .
Or , maybe I had gone to Westchester to place the urn containing my mother 's ashes in her final resting place .
You know what they say : we report , you decide .
What the heck is going on in Boston ?
Apologies to any Bostonians in the audience , but something is in the water , at least in the education and law enforcement districts .
Once again , the " Cradle of Liberty " is in the news as the Defenders of the Fourth are forced to rush in to defend the baby against the hand that rocks the cradle .
Last August , Boston made big news , at least in tech circles , when representatives of the city 's transportation system rushed into federal court at the last moment — on a Saturday , no less — an made an ex parte petition for an injunction to prevent three MIT students from presenting their research into flaws in the city 's Charlie Card system at DefCon 2008 .
As it usually goes in these cases , the judge on weekend duty at the federal courthouse opted to exercise prior restraint in blatant disregard of the First Amendment rather than electing for something more temperate — and legally justified — like holding a hearing where the accused could present a defense and cross-examine their accusers — you know , the general American adversarial system that has worked for more than two hundred years now .
A second federal judge — after waffling like an Eggo salesman — eventually vacated the injunction , finding that the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 's petition lacked legal merit , and — though professional courtesy prevents saying so unless you 're an appellate court — that the injunction never should have been issued in the first place .
Obviously , someone was n't paying attention , because the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other civil liberties organizations are now rushing to the assistance of a Boston College student whose dormitory room was raided by campus police , who seized a number of computers and other technology , including his iPod and cell phone .
They 've now turned the items over to the Massachusetts State Police , who are performing forensic analysis on the items .
So , what horrible crime led police to conduct this imitation Inquisition ?
Someone sent an anonymous email to a campus email list saying — wait for it — that another student was gay .
Oh .
Good .
God .
Now , first off , being gay is n't a crime , and neither is saying someone else is .
Even if it 's untrue — and we have no clue , we 're not in the social scene at BC — it is , at the very worst , a slanderous ( or libelous ) utterance , a civil offense over which the police have no jurisdiction and into which they are prohibited from intervening .
How , then , have they justified — as though anybody bothers to justify anything before they do it anymore — their actions ?
The same way the MBTA did , of course : the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act , the catch - all law for anyone who wants to concoct a computer crime without the trouble of contacting Congress .
Apparently this young man — who was a computer science student , no less — is guilty of " obtaining computer services by fraud or misrepresentation " and obtaining " unauthorized access to a computer system " — by sending an email .
Now , this either says something incredibly bad about the police — and it does — or about the IT department at Boston College .
Either the police are so poorly educated in the laws they are supposed to have sworn to uphold that they can't tell the difference between cracking boxes at the DOD and sending an email , or , if sending an anonymous email to the campus listserv is really " unauthorized access " obtained by " misrepresentation , " then the IT Department at Boston College is so utterly inept that they can't figure out how to moderate a simple email list .
Just what did these valiant enforcers of the law list as probable cause for seizing this equipment ?
The student was observed with a number of laptops he was supposedly repairing for others , he has multiple logins for his computers , and he uses a strange operating system with a black screen and white text , and when using this operating system , which is n't the " regular B.C. operating system , " he types bizarre " prompt commands " into it .
Good God , if that 's all it takes to be guilty of violating the CFAA , then they 'd better start building more prisons , because there 's a heck of a lot of us to lock away .
So now , the student 's computers are sitting in the police crime lab , presumably to be forensically analyzed by the same people who can't tell a cracker from Grandma sending her holiday snaps , the student has been suspended from his job , and he no longer has access to the equipment necessary to do his coursework .
The poor kid does n't even have his iPod or cell phone — which have what to do with the non-criminal act of sending an email ?
Thankfully , the EFF have filed a motion to quash the search warrant [ PDF ] , as beautifully worded as it was , petitioning to have his property immediately returned to him and to enjoin the police from making any further searches or undertaking additional analysis of his data .
With any luck , as soon as the court has granted the motion — and they will , eventually , even if it has to be done by order of the federal courts — the EFF will turn around and bring suit on the young man 's behalf , seeking damages against the college , the campus police , the Massachusetts State Police , and anybody else who assisted in this Constitutional clusterbuster .
Perhaps then , eventually , these " Guardians of Liberty " will begin to remember what Boston used to be about — and what happens when you run roughshod over the people 's rights .
Really dangerous and Crazy race !! in United kingdom .
This race attracts many people from around the world , and has been run in the same spot for 200 years .

At least 23 people , including three US soldiers , have been killed in a series of deadly bombings in the Iraqi cities of Baghdad and Kirkuk .
In the deadliest attack , a suicide bomber struck at a market in Baghdad 's Dora district , killing 12 people , including three US soldiers .
The Kirkuk blast targeted members of the Awakening Council , a US - allied Sunni militia , killing eight people .
A third bombing inside a Baghdad police station killed three recruits .
Concerns over violence
The attacks come a day after at least 40 people were killed in a car bomb attack in north - western Baghdad .
The blast in Kirkuk injured several people , in addition to killing eight Both the Iraqi government and the US say recent attacks are isolated incidents that do not undermine security gains .
They say the attacks are not as sophisticated as they once were .
April was the bloodiest month in Iraq this year , with a 40 % rise in the number of people killed over March - but the toll for May had been lower .
However the BBC's Natalia Antelava , in Baghdad , says many people in the capital feel the situation is deteriorating and could get worse once US troops withdraw from Iraqi cities at the end of June .
Three blasts
The US military said it could not immediately confirm Iraqi police reports of the deaths of three US soldiers in the attack in Dora , a district that was one of the city 's most dangerous areas until a year ago .
The Kirkuk blast earlier on Thursday targeted members of the so - called Awakening Councils - a movement of former militias and insurgents who have turned against al - Qaeda in Iraq and allied themselves with the US and Iraqi militaries .
Families mourn at the funeral of a victim of Wednesday 's bombing
The attacker , dressed in the group 's uniform , joined a group of men waiting to receive their pay and then detonated explosives , officials said .
The attack at Baghdad 's Al - Mamoun police station , in the west of the city , claimed the lives of three policemen and injured 19 people , including eight civilians .
Police said the bomb was planted inside a garbage container - the first time an explosive had gone off inside a police station .

Not coming to U.S. – wedgie arena seats .
Handball .
Now there is a sport we do n’t dabble in very often .
Then FHM Hungary stuck model Labancz Lilla in some basketball / handball arena and gave her some pom poms and high heels .
The result is a photoshoot that makes us pay attention to handball for the first time in our lives .
Old wooden benches in handball arenas ?
We do n’t think so !
Those are some nice plastic ass molded seats without backs .
What about my padded flip up seat I carry to college football stadiums .
So American .
There is a reason seats like these have n’t made it to U.S. arenas .
Our asses would take up at least two making ticketing a huge f-ing problem .
These seats look like some kind of McDonald ’s kid ’s chair from the 80’s .
Those things sucked .
That ridge rides right up the crack of your ass .
Imagine sitting in one of those for 2 - 3 hours or however long handball lasts with a huge wedgie .
Not us .
Anyway , Ms. Lilla even has a video to accompany this shoot where you can see her go through multiple clothing changes and use a handball goal as her own personal swingset .
Soccer has been put on notice .
Sex it up or you ’re out of our lives .
My Stupidest Gardening Mistake - or- We Were Once All Newbies

We need to remember that everyone makes mistakes .

My Stupidest Garden Mistake ......
Posted by NymphaeaRosa Z5/6 NJ ( My Page ) on Sat , Feb 9 , 02 at 1:30
I 'm an " intermediate " gardener I would say .
I 've been spending a LOT of time physically participating in gardening for about three years now ( since I bought my home ) and I spent ....uh... more years than I care to mention watching my grandmother and father garden .
I thought a good way to make " newbies " really comfy would be for other gardeners to share some stories about dumb mistakes they 've made over the years ( stop me if this has been done !
PERISH I should be passe ! )
MY STORY :
I could not LIVE without crocus !
Just when winter grey is really getting to me ... ta dah ... there they are all perky and colorful !
Just two years ago I planted about 350 of them ( I 'm not kidding ... I mean I NEED crocus !) in my small front lawn .
Well , my lawn was full of OPEN holes the next day since the squirrels ate nearly every one of them .
I asked everyone I knew WHAT kept squirrels away .
I was told kitty litter , dried blood , fox urine and mothballs .
So ...overdoing it again ... I bought ALL FOUR things and mixed up a BIIIIIG batch of this foul smelling concoction .
Then I replanted a few hundred MORE crocus but ... duhhhh ... I did n't know I was supposed to put all this vile stuff ON TOP of the ground to keep away the squirrels so I planted the crocus WITH heaps of the mothballs , etc. right on TOP of them ...
I think about 12 crocus came up this year in my lawn .
PS Dried blood can be used as a fertilizer ... hadda be the mothballs .

Humorous now , but not then .
I had a salad ready for company but had forgotten to pull up green onions earlier in the day .
I knew where they were in the dark and in the kitchen began slicing - hmmm , do n't look quite right - a taste confirmed they were not onions !
I 'd pulled up young Dutch iris .
The 2 are not planted in proximity now .

A friend of mine had her son - in - law plant several hundred tulips for her one year .
That next spring none of them came up .
Miffed she was gonna return them to the nusery where she buys all of her plants .
After she started digging them up she notice he had planted them all up side down .
lol

the very first year I started gardening was when I bought my first house .
The previous owner had a 3 ' by 3 ' bed where she started seeds .
I decided I was going to make it into a herb garden .
I bought $ 50 worth of herb plants , chives , basil , tarragon , thyme , oregano , sage , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc .
I planted them ALL in that little tiny 3 ' X 3 ' bed .
Needless to say they crowded each other out and only the strongest few survived .
I still laugh when I think about it .

What a great post !!
I make many many mistakes , so now I feel a little better .
I tried digging up tulip bulbs one year , speared every one but two .
I do n't bother with them anymore !!
Planted a wildflower bed , then heavily mulched it .
Tried starting some seeds in flats , forgot the drainholes .
Planted some huge flowers at the front of my border .
Just a few examples .
Unfortunately that is just scratching the surface .
ha ha .

I admired Carpet Rose in my favorite nursery for 2 summers .
Finally last summer I bought one and put it in a flower bed in front of my house .
What a mistake .
It was too sprawling , the thorns are killers and flowering was less than spectacular .
I plan to yank it this spring .

Was cleaning up the seeds shed by my Dutch Elm tree off the sidewalk .
Thinks I to myself , " We do n't throw away things that can decompose and turn to dirt . "
So I throw hundreds and thousands of seed pods onto my rock garden .
Spent the entire remainder of the summer pulling little elm tree sproutings out of the garden .
Doh !

I have made MANY mistakes but the biggest is ....
I have sandy soil and when I bought this lot ( blank slate ) I was thrilled to get a beautiful yard started .
I immediately laid out the beds , went to all the nurseries and started planting like an obsessed woman .
After two years of poor growth , gallons of fertilizer , and humongous waterbills , I took a step back .
I had to rip out all of my plantings , took a good soil analysis , hauled in truck loads of compost , added greensand and soil conditioner .
I 've replanted but made a wonderous discovery .
Originally I only found an occasional earthworm , during the replanting I found wonderful colonies of big earthworms .

I am only and advanced beginner , Been gardening for a tad over 1/2 century .
IE
There are over 50 diseases that can infect a tomato plant , I can name a doz , there are over 100,000 species of bugs on this plant , 20,000 have been named , Aphids have 4,000 subspecies , I can name about 10 .
I think the biggest mistake that new gardeners make is not asking about problems when they find it .
The net makes it a lot easier than the days of no net , no county agents , no plant problem books in the library .
If the local nursery did n't know it , you were out of luck .

I remembered another salad one .
Loving fresh ingredients , I picked the curly parsley at the last moment ( no pesticides in that garden ) and began snipping it over the company salad .
It began moving ?
Baby green aphids !
Aughh !
The most stupid thing I 've done though , is to plant a shrub at the south end of an east facing rose bed - in three years it cast so much shade that 2 roses had trouble blooming .
That was really stupid , especially because I 'd had a tall Juniper removed for that very reason !

Planting a 50 foot photinia hedge in partial shade .
It has gotten very leggy which kind of defeats the purpose of a hedge .
Moral : for big projects be dead sure about your plant choice .

1 . Not amending my hard , clay soil and planting a bunch of expensive perennials in it .
2. Buying plants that do n't do well in my region .

I 've been gardening for about 20 years now .
Sometimes I 'm still really dumb .
My MIL gave me a beautiful German Statice one season , dug from her garden .
I rushed right home and planted it ... too deep !
I do n't know what I was thinking !
I planted it so deep that I covered up all the lower leaves and I snuffed the poor little thing .
Duh !
And also , planting a few things in the wrong places , and making the mistake of planting mint !
What the heck was I thinking ?
LOL !
It 's going this spring ... if I can get rid of it , that is .

Planted GIANT marigolds that I started from seeds .
The bed included many other wonderful flowers that I too had started from seed .
They were quickly mauled by the amazon marigold .
Finally found the original seed packet and read that it could get up to 4 feet tall !
It looked so bad all summer right smack dab in front of my house .
YUCK .
Moved to a new house this year and I 'm just waiting to see what my next mistakes will be .
They 're always good for a laugh !

The first year I got the planting bug , I bought some seed starter kit greenhouses , with BIG BIG plans of how I was going to have HUNDREDS of plants to plant in my yard when I was done !
I started them in ...oh... let 's see , April ?
And they were all perennials !
And I had no idea what I was doing , so I only stuck them in the window , and when they came up I roasted the poor little things .
Plus , no matter what , we all know that grow lights are usually needed .
Of course they got fried , or leggy , and most died .
The sweetpeas I planted looked great , except everyday when I came home from work I would find another flat nibbled down by my cats !
Terrified that they would get sick ( and angry that they were eating my best crop ) , I put them up on my fireplace ledge .
They just jumped up , knocked them down and ate them all up .
Never got sick once , but I had a huge mess to clean up .
The few plants that managed to live , well , I planted them out in the garden one day ... without hardening them off ... in the middle of the afternoon ... under a blazing sun ! lol Needless to say I got ONE plant out of all that .
Brave little sucker .
I also made the huge mistake of planting two Lilacs way too close to each other .
They were so little when I bought them , that it seemed just fine to put them THREE FEET apart .
Now they are growing into each other , and it 's only been 2 years .
Plus I planted another large shrub next to them , again , a few feet away .
It is going to be a mess .
I have some digging to do !
One summer I babied a poppy plant , only to be informed that it was a weed !
I pulled it up and there was the poppy , much smaller , behind it .
I fertilized my ' hansa ' rose the minute I planted it in the ground .
The poor thing was so lush and happy when I bought it .
Then all the leaves crisped and I realized what I had done .
luckily it is a tough rose , and recovered nicely , even blooming for me !
Whew !

I bought a caladium from Home Depot the first year I started gardening .
It was truly beautiful .
Every time I looked at it I thought of the Caribbean !!!
I replanted it in a terra cotta pot and that plant was the star of my garden -- not too many things were working that first year !!!!
Well , as fall came and the leaves fell off completely I thought it died .
I decided to reuse the pot for another plant and used a sharp trowel to dig out the dirt out .
To my surprise , I dug right through the heart of the bulb , which was still very much alive .
That was the year I added the word " dormant " to my vocabulary !!!
Gosh , I miss that plant ! to this day my heart is broken .

I just started gardening about 1 1/ 2 years ago , and thinking how much I loved Zuccinni , planted over 50 plants .
Oh my god , they were everywhere and my family was getting tired of eating it that year .
Got cuttings and put them in the potting soil up - side - down .
To date , I am constantly learning everyday from the Gardenweb ..
Thanks to everyone here .

One year my husband brought home a truckload of grass clippings from work , in big plastic bags .
Oh , thrill !
We could use them for mulch in the vegetable garden ...... little did we know how many dandelion seeds were hidden in all those grass clippings ... until the next spring when they all bloomed !

Last year another gardener told me if I wanted my plants to get really huge , go to the feed store and get a big bag of nitrogen .
So i did .
Put it all over my garden .
On the leaves , everywhere .
Killed about half of everything , particularly some expensive perennials that I started the year before .
Wo n't take advice from this gardener again .

My MIL had a big , beautiful garden on the side of a hill , and as her family was getting smaller , she offered me all the space I wanted .
I planted a lot of vegetables , but the mistake I made was that I planted the whole packet of turnip ( rutabaga ) seeds .
I had a row of turnip 50 feet long .
I had the nicest crop of turnip you could imagine .
There was only my husband and myself to eat them , but I know lots of people that like them , I could give some away .
When it came time to harvest them , I worked my heart out .
I 'd cut off the root and leaves , and fill the wheelbarrow , trot the wheelbarrow down the row and pile the turnips on the grass .
I worked for hours !
Finally , I was done , I took the knife into the house and washed it off , and went back out to the garden to admire my turnips .
I had a pile of turnips as tall as I am .
I was almost up to this great pile when a few turnips at the bottom of the pile moved , the whole lot of them started rolling down the hill .
I was chasing after them , I 'd gather a few in my arms and when I 'd reach for another the ones in my arms would get away and continue down the hill .
I must have made quite a sight , because my brother - in - law was laughing at me .
" You 'd better catch them , " he called , " They 're going to wipe out the neighbor 's house " !
I eventually got them rounded up , but it turns out everyone does n't like turnip the way I do ! :-)
I wound up serving turnip at least once a week in every way you can imagine .
I served them boiled , fried , in stew , I cooked them up and added pumpkin pie spice and made fake pumpkin pie !
I thought it was rather inventive of me , but it was the turnip fritters that finally did me in .
My husband took one bite and gasped .
He had thought that he was biting into an apple fritter .
He said he did n't care if he NEVER ate another turnip !
I was NOT to grow them ever again !
I guess he just does n't have a sense of humor !
LOL

I tried to grow daisies in full shade .
They died after several months , never came back again .
I now read every plant tag carefully and look for those little sun and shade circles .

Mrs Beasly ,
I 'm sorry to say , I was laughing so hard I had tears !
My whole career in the U.S. Navy I dreamed of a veggie garden , when my husband and I retired and went to South Dakota I dug right in .
The Corn on the Cob had a bug and the cucumbers were overwhelming , there were not enough hours in the day to keep them from rotting .
No more cukes for me !

My first year of gardening I had a " cow weed " , the tall ones you see growing in cow pastures in Tn. , come up in my new bed .
I did n't know what the stuff I had planted was supposed to look like , and I feed and watered that plant faithfully .
I could not get that sucker to bloom .
I literally fell out when a friend of mine told me what had come up in the middle of my flowers .
It was almost 12 feet then .
Needless to say I got on line that winter and the following spring I did n't plant it unless I could identify it .

Some of these stories remind me of my first days as a gardener , but I continue to make mistakes now and then , only now I refer to them as my little " experiments ! "
I do n't believe there 's any such thing as a " stupid " garden mistake .
Mistakes can be your best teacher and what makes you a better gardener .

I think Mrs. Beasley ?s turnip story is one of the funniest
Ive ever heard .
You really should submit to OG or some other gardening magazine .
In my 30 years of gardening have made so many mistakes that I 'd be hard pressed to name the stupidest .
I once nurtured a burdock thinking it was rhubarb .
That was about the hardest to erradicate .
In my current new house , I ?ve planted all these small shrubs and trees too close together .
Some of us never learn !

I fell in love with chocolate mint the first time I smelled it and decided to buy a couple of dozen of them to fill our bay window bed so it would smell incredible every time it was brushed walking by .
I never knew how invasive it was and how far even a couple of plants spread .
We decided to take it out because it was even growing throw those interlocking bricks you can buy that were lining the bay window :)
It was taking too long pulling it .
Strong little plants !
So , I rotatilled them .
HUGE MISTAKE !
No one told me they can divide by the roots also .

Laughed so -o hard at the turnip story ....
My cheeks are still hurting !!
One year I planted 30 foxgloves and anxiously awaited their blooming in the following year and not one was to be found .
DH had pulled them all up thinking they were weeds .
I lost a lot of perennials that year and now DH is only allowed to weed dandelions !!

I will never forget the time I killed almost ALL of my 2 " - 3 " tomato , pepper , eggplant and herb seedlings - nearly 300 of them .
I watered them and sprayed the leaves with a concentrated fertilizer w/ sea kelp 5 - 9 - 5 .
Did n't follow the directions properly !
For the seedlings I was supposed to dilute the previously diluted solution again .
Gave it to them full strength and woke up to little stems with burned , wilted leaves .
Ohhhh ! , I had to start all over again , more seeds , more Jiffy - mix , more WORK , more TIME , more MONEY and more aggravation .
Planting all those seeds is hard work !
My garden was a little later than I planned .
Of course I felt stupid , because following directions is something I was supposed to have learned a long time ago !

I 'm still renting but the yard here has so much potential !! ) .
I 've already learnt soooo much and had so many good laughs !!
The silliest thing I 've done so far was planting sunflowers in the back yard - my 6 y.o son begged me to !
Only thing is , the sun spends most of the day shining on ... yes ... the BACK of my house !
Oh well , at least the neighbors have a nice view of them over the fence ...

Great stories , everyone .... but I betcha I can beat ?em .
Spring - flowering bulbs ... plant ?em in spring , right ?
Late summer , about 7 years ago , I moved into my first house .
It came complete with an overgrown garden ?
of course , at the time I did n?t realize it was overgrown .
That ?s another story .
I also became the beneficiary of the previous occupant ?s subscription to the late , lamented Cruickshank ?s bulb & perennial catalogue .
Put those two facts together with someone who had never so much as pulled a weed before and you would have found me trotting off Cruickshank ?s tiny retail operation in early April of the following year .
Although the staff tried very hard to explain the rudiments of gardening to me , and even though virtually all of their operation was dedicated to mail - order service , I was so pig - headedly determined to have the bulbs I coveted that they let me buy a few gazillion daffodils and lilies , a bunch of glads , and , oh yes , a bare - root clematis ?
Bluebird .?
By the time I got home , the sun had sunk low in the sky and it seemed too cold to plant my goodies .
They sat in their bags in the enclosed and dark and unheated back porch for , oh , say , 3 weeks .
The bulbs were eventually planted in the ground , in standard - issue Toronto clay , and the clematis got bunged in , what at the time I believed was a LARGE , terra cotta pot .
It ?s a testament to the quality of Cruickshank ?s products ( Heather R and Indigo be damned ! ) that about half the glads appeared as did most of the lillies ( in fact a few followed me to my new house last February ) and the daffs showed up the following spring .
But what about the clematis ?
Well , the ?
Bluebird ?
variety had been chosen ?
cause the catalogue said it did well in pots and there was lovely photo to prove it .
My poor little clem actually grew quite well for several weeks , despite it ? s southern exposure in a baking hot terra cotta pot that was really only about 10 inches deep & maybe the same wide .
I ?ve been apologizing indiscrimately to clematises ( clematisii ? clematisoi ? ) ever since .

Reading about the turnips reminded me of my husband , the tomato king .
Our first vegetable garden , he planted a whole row of about 25 tomato plants .
When it came time to harvest , I was wild with trying to come up with ways to use them all up .
Juicing , canning , soups , and even made homemade ketchup which the kids refused to eat because it was n't Heinz .
I could n't give them away because everybody else grew them also .
I was completely overwhelmed to say the least .
The following year he insisted on planting even more .
One day when he was at work , I went to the garden with a kitchen knife and explored the root zone of quite a few plants .
He decided that the cutworms were having a field day and proceeded to collar and spray like a mad man .
It was a sad thing that he never defeated those cut worms that year or for years thereafter .

You may have to think about this one .

We busted up the concrete and put in a mulched flower bed with stepping stones leading to the door .

I spent all last Spring digging and planting and coddling all of my new little plants at my new home .
Then we decided to have a pool put in .
I did n't realize until afterwards that pool installers are n't sympathethic to flowerbeds or the lawn ; most of my babies in the front of the house were destroyed .
Then there was the tree at the rear of the house that needed to come out - a huge tree .
With the equipment coming in and out on that job the hydrangeas and azaleas on the other side of the house got crushed .
The wood got stacked in the backyard on top of lilies and glads .
So I 'm starting over , hoping that I wo n't have to have any more non-gardening workman here .
I guess the moral of the story is to plan ahead and get your plants out of any potential paths that workmen or equipment might have to use .

One day while leaving my office I noticed a 7 '
Ficus ( Ben ) sitting on the dock .
I asked why it was there and they said they were dumping it , and if I wanted it ... I could have it .
Well sure ... I had never had one and figured the sucker was 7 ' tall it was surely healthy and would survive !
As I was carrying it into the house my aunt ( green thumb aunt ) saw me and came to check it out .
She found slugs in the plant .
Well my mom heard " slugs " and banned the poor thing to the basement ( right next to a So. facing window though ) .
Aunt Gin gave me slug instructions - use so many parts water to so many parts dishwashing liquid and water it .
Because I had taken the plant home in the Winter she also suggested that I tent it to reduce shock , and told me to put a large plastic garbage bag over the top after watering to give it a greenhouse effect .
I found the biggest plastic garbage bag I could find , tented it , watered it with the soap solution , and waited .
Little by little the thing started to shrivel and die .
In a little over a week this seemingly healthy ( and now slug free ) tree was shriveled into firewood .
Why oh why did n't she tell me to choose a CLEAR plastic bag instead of the black one I had chosen ????

When my husband and I bought our first house , we were very excited about being able to have a garden .
We went out and bought a ton of perennials and got ready to plant them .
After much discussion , we decided that the planting holes should be EXACTLY the same size as the pot the plant came in and that we should try not to disturb the plant 's rootball in any way when planting .
We carefully chiseled out the correct sized holes and squeezed the plants into them .
Needless to say , we had a lot of unhappy , sad looking , rootbound plants ...

I decided i was going to grow parsley this year , not having heard any of the issues around parsley growing .
I used earth that had come from my grandmother 's garden to start the seedlings .
Planted them in a clear plastic dome container and waited .
My grandmother told me in the mean time that she never had any luck with parsley and that i should make sure it's in a warm place .
I put it on top of the fridge and I waited some more and voila !
a week and a half later i had ... parsley !
I was so ecstatic , thinking that i had actually grown something that my grandmother could n't !
As the little sprouts grew , I realized that I recognized those leaves but it was not parsley .
I had cultivated two beautiful little morning glory seedlings .
humph .
I have since done a little research ( it did n't say so on the package ! ) and found out that parsley takes between 4 - 5 weeks to germinate ( all of those trips to see the devil and back ! ) .
There 's still hope ; maybe ...

Trying to grow hybrid tea roses in humid NC is about the dumbest thing I 've ever done .
You can't win , between the black spot and Japanese beetles I had tiny moving shiny green " buds " on top of naked sticks all year .
I was lucky and never had aphids .
Got rid of them this spring and planting cannas , ginger , and an assortment of other " tropicals . "
Oh , every year I take out all my overwintering tropicals approximately 6 weeks before the last frost date , then complain profusely about having to either drag them all back inside ( a 4 - 5 hour ordeal ) , or cover them with blankets and / or pots .
Of course this year everything is so big , I can only choose to drag them all inside .
So you all know how I 'll be spending my Thursday evening .

Well , I live at the historic site of THE WORLD'S TALLEST PRINCESS PINE !
That 's right ...
I thought I 'd transplant a little pine tree from the back to the front of the house .
Absent - mindedly dug up a cute little fluff of a tree and planted it boldly out by the road 's edge , and to be sure no one drove over it , gave it a tall , red- reflector marker .
My neighbor thought it was quite amusing .
She broke it to me gently that , yes , that was a very nice little tree , but ... not a tree .
Princess pine only grows to about 6 " tall and is used in making wreathes .
Now I know ...

First spring in brand new home , hubby got tired of helping me edge and mulch the beautiful snowball bushes in the back yard and decided he would get " fancy " with it .
Goes to the local hardware store and buys about 5 gallons of round - up and some new pruning shears .
I was in the house and not paying attention ... big mistake ... went to tell him dinner was ready and found that he had trimmed the snowballs to look like cute little trees with a big " pouf " on top .. !!
Ok , that was n't so bad ..
He also however , had taken the round - up and sprayed all around the mulched bed area underneath .. from the trunks out to about a 6 foot circumference around , with the idea that it would be forever grass & weed free !!
I grabbed a garden hose and tried drowning the things to keep them from dying and biting my tongue to keep from losing my garden helper .
Well the snow balls went through a period of about two weeks and a half of curling dried up leaves but they lived !!
Unfortunately , the grass back to the house where DH had walked back with the round up on the bottom of his shoes did n't ..
We had a human foot print path of dead grass that the neighbor kids all loved to play along that summer till it grew back !
My Stupidest Garden Mistake was using Cheap Labor !!

Hope it 's not too late to post a followup to this - when I lived in Missouri years ago , we bought a home on five acres which came with an old tractor and cultivator , etc .
My husband got all excited about using the tractor to plant a huge one acre garden , which he would weed with the tractor attachments .
Unfortunately , he did n't realize that the attachments did n't match , in terms of row width , so we had to do all the weeding by hand !
Finally , the kids and I picked out a patch to weed and let the rest go .
That part produced the nicest tomatoes I 've ever seen , but the rest was a one acre disaster !

Well , mine was in trying to grow the potato vine , some call it air potato .
My Mother grows them along her front porch every summer for shade and they get very full .
Well , the 1st year , I planted mine when she did and waited and waited ... nothing .
So she said dig them up - maybe you planted them upside down .
Sure enuff they had been to china and were on there way back up .
So , this year , determined not to get them upside down , I took some of the potatoes that were already sprouting roots on the shelf in her shed .
Ca n't go wrong , right ?
Everyone knows , the roots go DOWN , right !?
Well , same thing - her 's were sprouting , mine were n't So I dug up a small one in her garden and what a surprise !
The roots AND plant grow out of the TOP !
Weird .
So back home I go , to dig them up AGAIN .
Finally they are growing and I might just get what I 'm after .
Needless to say the DH laughed his head off when I once again planted them upside down !

When I got married and we bought our first house I was going to be the perfect house wife .
Can veggies , etc. SO ..
I picked out a spot to grow our garden .
I had heard you could put newspaper over the grass and after awhile it would kill the grass and I could start my garden .
So , I gathered all our newspapers , layed them down and put a few rocks on them so they would n't blow away .
We were both in the AF reserves and had to go out of town for the weekend .
Well , we got back Sun afternoon and newspapers were ALL OVER the place .
All over my 5 acres and against the fence of the neighbors pasture .
Took me hours to gather all that paper .
I was so proud of myself for remembering that tip , but apparently they said water the paper , and put lots of mulch on it which I neglected to do .
My new husband just stood there laughing at me and shaking his head .
( probably wondering how he ended up with such an idiot )

About 22 years ago my husband and I bought our first house in the country and decided to plant a HUGE vegetable garden .
We had the garden spot plowed up and my husband did the rotatilling .
Well , the time came for us to plant the corn .
I brought out my little bag of seed corn and placed it by the first row and waited for my husband to finish the tilling .
He got to close to the bag and rotatilled over it .
I was devastated , so I sat down ( wearing short shorts ) to pick up the little seeds .
I did n't think anything of it until a few days later while sitting at work and I was getting very uncomfortable .
Well , needless to say I ended up at the Doctor 's office and was diagnosed with a major case of poison ivy - ugh .
I still get into poison ivy ( where I am not sure ) but I sure watch where I sit now .

I saw new growth coming and was so excited .
My cleomes grew great .
I noticed some of my cleomes looked different from the others .
Confused I took a leaf off of each and went to my favorite nursery .

NEVER let a younger family member ( he was 20 , I was 23 ) help in your garden .
We laugh about it now , but ...
Anyway , I was busy moving small peppers and veggies from a seeding bed to growing beds and he noticed a few big caterpillars munching on some larger blackberry canes and wanted to help .
I told him where the insecticidal soap was , he got it , and sprayed most of the flowering canes .
Helpful right ?
Well two weeks later we found out he picked up the Round Up instead of the soap .
Got rid of the bugs though :)

25 HUGE tomato plants that are all indeterminate !
These babies will be bearing fruit past Thanksgiving and I 'm scheduled for back surgery this summer !!

What a great thread , just look here if you need a good laugh !
The turnip story wins for me .
A relative would not touch turnips for years and years because she had to eat them almost exclusively during the war .
Apparently , one can also get sick of turnips in a rather short time . :) )
I have made many of the above mistakes and then some .
These days I am a very experienced gardener as well as a ( ahem ) ? professional ?
to boot ; and still , I keep making mistakes .
Most of these come under the , not following my own advice category such as planting things too close , because I don?t like bare ground ; subsequently having to move tons of plants while killing a few in the process .
The other mistake I constantly make is that my greedy little garden coveting brain won ?t let me purchase within bounds .
I always buy too much .
Imelda coveted shoes ; I covet plants .
As a consequence , I have scores of little plants or bulbs that are never planted due to a lack of time or energy .
At this writing , there is a whole box of winter and summer bulbs in the garage ? all have sprouted .
Everyday I look at them and say , ?
Yes , yes , tomorrow , I ?ll get to you .?
I see them sadly beckoning to me , like marooned sailors on a raft without water .
These days , swallowing my pride , I use ?
little helpers ? to ease the hard work .
I am learning that no matter how well I think I have explained a procedure it frequently is done incorrectly .
Recently I enlisted my young , teen helper to transplant some Vincas into our little wooded area .
I suggested he water them first , told him which spade to use , etc. and went to the front garden to dead - head the roses .
After a while , I returned to find him sitting on the ground with a hand trowel , scraping out a fist size hole in the hard clay with his bare hands .
I then watched in horror as he forced a bare - root Vinca into the hard , unwatered hole and pulled mulch over it .
?
Where is the soil that you dug up with the plant ?? ?
Oh , ?
he said , ? I shook it all off .?
I turned around and sure enough , there was a stack of poor little Vinca plants with their bare roots exposed to the afternoon sun , waiting for ?
planting .?
Good thing they are tough plants .
After further instructions on how to properly transplant , my helper did a nice job .
They all looked fine the next day .
I just hope it will not be yet another mistake , because Vinca can be invasive . :->
One day I casually mentioned to my husband that I needed to prune the beautiful Virburnum plicatum tomentosum Marisii , which was blocking the front window , ( another ? mistake ? ) before transplanting it .
I began to prepare dinner and did not notice that my husband had disappeared .
After about 20 minutes he came back in , a triumphant look on his face and loppers in hand .
?
Where have you been ??
Proudly he announced , ? I pruned the Viburnum for you .?
I rushed outside , fearing the worst .
Gasp !
There was the fully - grown Viburnum , its arm size branches lying on the ground , neatly stacked .
He had ? pruned ?
the massive plant completely to the ground .
I cried ; my hapless husband looked devastated .
We nevertheless transplanted it ?
not without great difficulty , because the roots were huge ? and prayed .
Miraculously , that Viburnum ( after about 4 years ) is again fully - grown and had the best horizontal display ever , this year .

I may have made a mistake ...
I have just bought a new house complete with overgrown yard and a terraced hillside with LOTS of landscaping .
Right away , I noticed tall purple flowers ( weeds ? ) growing right from the tree ?s lawn , down the terraces and halfway into the yard .
I pulled every single one out by the roots ( they came out pretty easy , but had kind of a " creeping " root , especially round the rocky areas ) .
Now I think these might have been phlox .
My question is , is phlox a flower or a weed ?
Is it desirable to have in the garden ?
This could be my first mistake , but surely wo n't be my stupidest yet !

Hmmmm .
This is a toughie .
ROFL !
I also plant too close together , but I am well aware that I have to move things when I do that - so it 's not a mistake .
Just because the lavender has been moved four times does NOT mean I did anything wrong .
It just has n't found it 's home yet :) .
It is probably planting lemon balm and chinese lanterns .
They are ugly , smell bad , and come up everywhere no matter what I do .
DH still wo n't forgive me for that .
The rampant chives he forgives because people line up for blocks in the spring to dig up a clump for themselves , so the problem fixes itself - tee hee .

My biggest mistake was weed whacking weeds that were growing around the trees in the backyard .
The line of trees is about 500 feet .
It was a hot summer day and I wore shorts and a tank top .
Whacked down all the weeds cleaned everything up .
It sure looked good .
Later now I had a nasty itching rash all over my legs , arms and neck .
the weeds that I weed whacked was poison ivy .
That was last summer and I still have a few scares on my legs .

Perhaps not my stupidest garden mistake but certainly my grossest ...
I was weeding my Emerald and Gold Euonymus that had taken over the front bed .
I was doing this bare - handed so that I could feel what I was doing since the plant was so dense .
I reached in and realized I had stuck my thumb into something cold and wet .
Yuck ... bird doo ... or so I thought .
Well , shades of Little Jack Horner .
I had skewered a large slug !
It took forever to get the goo out from under my nail .

Anyway , I ?m new to gardening ( just moved into our house 2 years ago ) and it seems everything I do is a mistake , but I ?m having fun .
Two of the most recent are :
1 . Our yard is mostly sun so we don?t get a lot of leaves in the fall and the few we get I run over with the mower and rake into the yard .
So to amend my compost I decided to pick up bags of leaves off the side of the road .
Felt like thief in the night as I hefted three huge bags into my trunk .
Got them home and dumped one whole bag into the compost .
Started working it in when I realized that it was full of gumballs .
Then had to lug the other two bags to the curb .
DH was kinda curious as to why I would transfer someone else ?s garbage to our curb .
2 . This was not really my mistake , but I joined a gardening magazine and got some free seeds with it .
They were red poppies and I thought they would be great under my roses .
I had never grown poppies before so did not know what to expect .
They just grew and grew .
The anticipation of seeing them bloom was intense .
DH rarely comes out to check out the flowers but one afternoon with a glass of wine , we walk over to where they were and he exclaims , ?
Yea , you decided to put in some tomatoes !?
They had given me the wrong seeds .
I got all cut up by the roses trying to move those things .
Then I moved them , planted them right beside each other , and staked them with little 10 - inch stakes .
Grew huge in a matter of weeks .
Were sprawling all out in the yard .
Turned out they were cherry tomatoes .
I finally got so frustrated with the whole lot of them ( about 25 in a 2 x 12 ? bed ) that they are now compost .
Lot ?s and lots of tomato compost .
That will probably be my mistake for next year .
The PH will probably be WAY off .
Oh well , live and learn .

Well , it 's not my stupidest mistake , just the most recent one ...
I planted sunflowers this year for the first time .
When they got to be about a foot high , I staked them .
I used that green training wire stuff to tie them to the stakes - all 30 or so plants .
Fast forward about 2 months later ... the sunflower plants are huge , over six feet tall , with great big flower heads getting ready to open .
I can barely contain my excitement , running outside to look at them every day as soon as I come home from work .
One day I went out and found that several plants were wilted and dying .
WHAT could be the problem ?
Remember that green training wire ?
Well ... it does n't stretch !
The stems of the plants are now about 5 times wider than they were when I first staked them up , and that little green wire is cutting right into the stem .
I was able to untwist the wire and save most of the plants , but I did lose quite a few , because the wire had cut in so deeply that the stem was damaged beyond help .
So - next year I will use the green stretchy tape stuff instead of the wire .
Doh !

My stupidest mistake was thinking that I can move my plants from one location to another when I bought my house .
I have lost almost everything I brought with me .
Even my cannas are n't doing too well this year .
My agapanthus are turning yellow , and did n't bloom this year .
They are west facing and are getting very HOT sun in the afternoon alot of wind too .
I 'm thinking of moving them to the east side of the house this fall .
Anyone have any suggestions ?

When I bought my house it had two old perennial beds , which to me , a never - been - a - gardener , looked like Eden .
But as I began to learn , I could see the dandelions and a few other weeds , and other symptoms of neglect , so I began to clear out the weeds .
Several sections had a lovely , fine , long grass and I thought " Ah !
This must be some of that stuff called " ornamental grasses " so in the fall , I carefully left it in , pulled weeds around it and began the long process of amending the soil in these neglected beds .
Fast forward through the next summer and the " ornamental grasses " had tripled in size to 6 - foot - wide swaths -- and I then learned that what I had was fescue lawn grass that had escaped into the flower beds -- and I 'd given it the green light to turn the bed into a new lawn !
We 're talking 12 - inch deep roots here , and backbreaking spade work to rogue it out .
oy ......
To Plam Springs : Agapanthus getting too hot ?
Hard to believe !
It 's the only thing I used to be able to grow in a concrete and swimming pool back yard !
You might want to let them stay for one more season , cutting back the yellowed foliage , and see if they just need a year to recover .
Also might want to take some and move them to the east side and see what works .
They do want good watering until well - established , after which they 'll handle some drought .

WE have lived in our home just under a year .
This is my first experience with gardening besides containers on various apt decks .
There was a small area around our new patio that needed some serious landscaping .
Well -- we thought we killed all the grass -- but NOPE !
The bed looked beautiful for a month of so -- from then on it has been hard to control the grass in the bed .
It 's everywhere .
We are at a loss .
I can't believe that we will have to dig all those bushes and trees up just to kill that grass .
Any other advice ??
Thanks !
* Posted by : dijoy 8 b ( My Page ) on Mon , Aug 5 , 02 at 20:56
Shines4U , try placing several layers of newspaper or maybe some cardboard on the ground around your bushes and plants , and then cover that with mulch .
That should kill out the grass while not harming your bushes and plants .
You might want to water the area before you put down your paper or cardboard and mulch .

This is my first year of gardening , as well as my first year on the Garden Web .
I 've made way too many mistakes so far , but this is the one that I 'm still feeling guilty about .
I went to my first plant swap earlier this spring in San Marcos , TX .
Wonderful people with wonderful plants ... and I wanted a little bit of everything .
Luckily everyone seemed to have a bumper crop , so someone like me with very little to trade was able to fill up the back up my truck ( between two of us ) with all kinds of green goodies .
What I did n't think about , was that I did n't have many beds prepared for planting , and I did n't know where the heck most of it was going to go anyway .
So even with most of my Saturdays and Sundays being spent working in the yard , many of the plants died before I could get them into the ground .
However , I do n't regret attending .
Some of the plants that are not only coping in the Texas sun , but are blooming like mad are plants that were given to me at the swap meet .
So I 'll be attending the fall plant swap , but I 'll just be a little more careful about how much I bring home this time ( and thanks to the people who were so generous , I now have some plants of my own to trade ) .

This has to do with a vegetable garden but here goes ...
My husband is a distributor for a bread company & I work for him ( & yes , it 's never a good idea to be married to someone who " thinks " he 's your boss ! ) .
Anyway , because it's in the contract that the 2 days that we do n't deliver to major stores , we still have to go in them & " pull up " - which is just getting bread from the back & making the shelves look full .
So basically we work 7 days a week .
My point in saying that is that I told hubby not to do the same thing he had done the year before : let the man we pay to disk & bush hog our garden area decide what & how much he would plant in OUR garden .
Well , hubby ignored me .
So we got our whole garden except for 2 rows that we had already planted tomatoes , peppers , okra , squash , & onions planted with purplehull peas .
So , everything got ready to be picked but we could n't keep them picked because of the 7 - day a week job .
So lots dried on the bush .
My husband leaves the house at 4 a.m. & I leave after I take the kids to school so I would get up with him , & be completely dressed waiting for it to get light enough outside for me to go pick peas .
There are snakes - some poisonous & there 's no way in hell I go to the garden or anywhere else in the dark !
Anyway , I managed to get several rows picked but would n't have time to shell them .
So they got left in baskets or on trash bags in the floor until I had time to shell them .
Well , you 're not supposed to do that I learned .
Spread out on a sheet or newspaper or they 'll mold .
So , out of probably 1/2 - 1 acre of purplehull peas , we may have put up 1 or 2 rows .
This year the fool was going to do it again until I went crazy on him & he had to listen to me gripe every day .
But the guy with the tractor managed to get 9 rows of purplehulls planted before I told him that was enough .
My plans now are to start taking what I have extra every year to the farmer 's market to sell .
With whatever money I make I 'll put back until I have enough money to buy a used tractor .
Then , I 'll do the disking & bushhogging myself !
Maybe even plant stuff hubby does n't like !

This was my first year of gardening , so I 've done my fair share of stupid mistakes .
Flowers are supposed to die - that does n't mean the plant is dead - which means that I spent the last few years throwing out plants from my deck that I thought were dead .
I also learned to put my contacts in BEFORE I plant .
Artichokes are planted 4 - 6 feet ( NOT , I stress , inches ) apart .

I lent my brother my lopping shears to cute down a very sick rose bush he had in his back yard .
When he returned them , it was just in time for fall pruning of my container roses .
The following spring as they began to produce foliage , I noticed yellow leaves that dropped from the slightest breeze and black spot that could not be controlled .
The cause ?
I never cleaned my shears after my brother used them .
His rose spread its disease to mine via the lopping shears .
I eventually had to burn my roses .
The disease was incurable .
Now , I clean all my gardening tools regularly in a bleach water solution .

I thought it was a good idea to really " work " the soil on a hillside outside the kitchen .
I double - dug the dirt and added organic compost and spread wildflower seeds -- ignoring , of course , the seed - sellers advice to merely spread the seeds and rake lightly .
By digging , I managed to reawaken and germinate years and years of dormant weed seeds .
And I chopped up bindweed in tiny little pieces , thus distributing it everywhere .
Thistle sprang up .
Crappy grasses of all ilks burst to life .
My " wildflower hill " was choked with the hardiest , thickest weeds imaginable .

I 'm somewhat new to gardening , but I 've made more than my share of entertaining mistakes :)
The most recent was finding two small , interesting little plants growing through the mulch near my tub containers .
I potted one and left the other to grow up a nearby fence .
Both took off and in three weeks I had healthy 6ft tall plants with tendrils attaching itself to anything it could grab .
Now I can recognize poison ivy easily , but I 've never seen poison oak before .
The nursery people I brought a two foot cutting to for identification were petrified and must have thought I am crazy .
The problem is I do n't react to poison ivy or poison oak so I never know when its around :)
Hope me neighbors did n't look to close at what I was growing .

After watching Paul James show for almost a year and finally buying my first house , I order 50 maiden grasses online .
I figured I would plant these instead of a privacy fence on one side of our yard .
Took me a whole weekend to plant .
After weeks of watering they reached a height of about 6 - 10 inches .
Me and my wife went away for 1 weekend and came back and all the grasses were gone !
Since it was on the border of our neighbors yard , they thought it was a weed and " weeded " them for us .
I can laugh now but next time I will plant poison ivy there I think .

My first garden was full of donations .
Someone had given me some of their mint .
I loved the smell and leaf texture .
Not knowing it was extremely invasive , I put it in the middle of my garden .
It took me a long time to clear it all out .
Some of the root pieces that were left in kept growing .
I believe it 's all out .
I now know to read up on any plant I put in .

Most of you are new gardeners , but do not feel so bad .
I 've been gardening over 30 yrs .
This year again I decided to grow my own vegetable plants from seeds .
Especially tomatoes .
I was careful I thought to label each variety .
My bounty of plants provided many neighbors & friends with vigorous plants .
I grew Big Boy , Ace , Romas & 100 cherries .
Everyone got their share .
Everyone has their bounty .
HOWEVER , my garden is overrun with cherry tomatoes !!
I pick 7 lbs a day !!
I guess my seedlings looked good , but not the ones I wanted .
Be aware , tomato seedlings look the same .
Oh well , we will have lots of juice etc .
I goofed and will remember this one next year !

This is a great post .
I am a newbie to gardening .
2nd spring in our new house , I decided that I wanted sunflowers growing up at the end of the yard , near my fence so I can stake it .
I spent two weekends digging beds , dug too deep , got all the weeds coming up later ... Returning to my story - Sowed sunflower seeds right before we had a terrible Kansas storm .
Waited for two weeks , when I did n't see any seedlings emerged .
I guessed the rain had washed the seeds away .
So I sow again .
Can see the seedling emerge .
Now its hot and the temperatures are rising , so I thought , well let me mulch the bed .
I put cut grass clippings on the bed ... completely smothering all the seedlings .
Never saw a single sunflower .
I guess I should have put down DRIED grass clippings .
Oh anyway , my husband never stops teasing me about my sunflowers but I do have a perennial bed starting up there this Fall .

I broke off a relationship , left my gardens behind and started new in a rental house .
I decided my first project , while still getting over the grief of leaving my beloved plants behind , would be something I 've never tried before - poppies - bright , colorful , glorious poppies .
I hand dug a spot for them , spread the seeds and proceeded to water and care for the spot daily .
I had something to look forward to !
I pointed the first sprouts out to friends and family , proclaiming them brand - spanking - new seedlings and " just watch them grow ! "
I fertilized and watched over them , rushing to look at them every day after work ....
When it all was said and done - I ended up with a great big spot of carefully grown crab grass !!
Talk about feeling stupid !!

Whatever you do , do n't try digging up whatever is on the ground underneath .

This is a great post - let 's keep it going as we 're all learning a thing or two still .
Hands down to Mrs. Beasley and her turnip story , and second goes to Shirley B. with her tomatoes .
Very very funny and so true .
Anyways , my " mistake " has a bit of a different twist to it , ( although I have lots of " oops " that I can relate to on this forum ) .
A bit of background : I had a lovely cross lab / shepherd dog that loved to go across to the bush and bring us home her findings - dead / rotting carcasses of dear , skunk , raccoon , etc - you get the picture .
She would normally just leave them in the yard for us to find them ( and dispose of ) .
Well , it was a beautiful spring day for clean up and I was in one of my gardens transplanting a few of my gems from one place to another .
( Yup , you know where this is going ... )
I was working in my bare hands , ( no gloves ) and was digging up some iris bulbs to move elsewhere .
These iris bulbs were creamy white and long - when I dug in I found that they were n't coming out near as easily as I initially thought - therefore I got in there with my hands to help loosen the soil , so 's not to damage any of the root / bulb .
Needless to say , I got the shock of my life and totally - I mean totally - grossed out when I pulled up a hoof / leg of a deer !! -
Yuk , yuk , & yuk -- I freaked just a " wee " bit , and had everyone running over to see what the commotion was about .
Of course the guys were killing themselves laughing , I cursed the dog over & over , and had the heepee jeepies for a while trying to figure out what else she had " left " for me to discover .
To this day , I am very careful about how and what I dig up - lesson learned - you just do n't know sometimes .
Keep writing your stories folks ,

We had just purchased a house and having weeded vegetable gardens for years I thought I knew a weed from a flower .
I weeded the shrubbery and later found out I had pulled up all the Lantanas except for one .
The one I have left is 6 or 7 feet in diameter .
I am sick because I pulled up the others !

My dh was complianing that my butterfly bushes and 2 most favorite rose bushes , and 2 weeping pines , were to tall for where they were .
I got sick of listening to him complain so I transplanted them in the middle of the 90 degree summer , in the middle of a drought !!!
Needless to say only the 2 butterfly bushes made it .

People walk past Yahoo ! offices in Santa Monica , California in this May 19 , 2008 file photo .
REUTERS / Lucy Nicholson
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Yahoo
Inc is preparing to lay off several hundred workers in the first round of cuts since Carol Bartz became chief executive in January , a source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters .
The layoffs could be announced next Tuesday , when Yahoo reports its first - quarter financial results , according to the source , who wished to remain anonymous because of the issue ’s sensitivity .
Yahoo ’s last round of layoffs was in December , under former CEO and co-founder Jerry Yang .
The company , which is the No. 2 U.S. Internet search provider , finished 2008 with roughly 13,600 employees , down by more than 1,600 employees from the third quarter of 2008 .
Yahoo declined to comment on the planned layoffs , first reported by the New York Times on Tuesday .
The cuts would come almost two months after Bartz implemented a broad internal management reorganization and as Yahoo explores partnerships to help revive its growth .
Yahoo and Microsoft Corp met recently to discuss a deal involving the company ’s search business , according to a source familiar with the matter who wished to remain anonymous .
The search company has projected that sales in the first quarter could be down as much as 16 percent at $ 1.53 billion .
Shares of Yahoo were up 3 cents at $ 14.10 in after hours trade .
VoIP Hopper is a security tool , written in C , that rapidly runs a VLAN Hop into the Voice VLAN on specific Ethernet switches .
VoIP Hopper does this by mimicking the behavior of an IP Phone , in Cisco , Avaya , and Nortel environments .
VoIP Hopper is a VLAN Hop test tool but also a tool to test VoIP infrastructure security .
In Cisco IP Phone networks , it first dissects either IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet II for Cisco Discovery Protocol ( CDP ) packets .
If CDP is enabled on the switch port and the Voice VLAN feature is enabled , it will determine the Voice VLAN ID ( VVID ) .
This will allow the tool to create a new Ethernet interface on the PC that tags the 802.1q VLAN header in the Ethernet packet .
After VoIP Hopper has created the new Ethernet device , it will send a DHCP client request .
It can also generate CDP messages just as an IP Phone based on CDP would do .
It will send two CDP packets , requesting the Voice VLAN ID .
After creating the new interface , it will then iterate between sleeping for 60 seconds , and sending a CDP packet .
In Avaya IP Phone environments , it sends an Option 55 parameter request list , requesting Option 176 .
When the DHCP server sends Option 176 , it decodes the L2QVLAN reply field for the Voice VLAN ID .
It then creates a new voice interface and sends a DHCP request .
In Nortel IP Phone networks , VoIP Hopper sends an Option 55 parameter request list , requesting Option 191 .
When the DHCP Server sends Option 191 data , it decodes the VLAN - A : string for the Voice VLAN ID .
It then creates a new voice interface and sends a DHCP request .

Here is a dose of reality for Republicans .
As Geraldo Rivera pointed out last night on FNC ’s Hannity the 2006 Great American Boycott drew more people in Chicago , than the entire Tea Party movement did across the country .
400,000 people attended the 2006 Chicago rally compared to roughly 200,000 for tea parties around the country .
Here is Geraldo Rivera making the point on last night ’s Hannity show courtesy of Media Matters :
Advertisements
Rivera put the number for the 2006 Chicago rally at between 300,000 - 500,000 , which is right on because other news estimates placed the number at 400,000 .
Consider that this was just in Chicago Around the country , 2,500 people turned out in Atlanta , 20,000 in Indianapolis , 10,000 in Las Vegas , 3,000 - 5,000 in Madison , WI , 70,000 in Milwaukee , 200,000 in New York City , and 1 - 2 million in Los Angeles .
It is no coincidence that Democrats took back Congress in 2006 , and Barack Obama won the White House in 2008 with help from the Republican Party ’s anti-immigrant rhetoric .
Hispanic voters have left the Republican Party in droves .
Instead of learning from their mistake , and coming up with a sensible immigration policy that would lure Hispanics back to the GOP , they instead appealed to their base by holding staged protests .
The Great American Boycott did n’t have a cable news network promoting .
It had people who cared about an issue .
For those critics who claim that the marchers were all illegal immigrants , once again look at the returns from the past two elections , and notice how Hispanic voters have fled away from the GOP .
The tea parties were another sign that the Republican Party is still on the wrong track .
They have to move more to the middle , not further to the right , if they want to win national elections .
When the tea parties are compared to a popular protest , it becomes clear what a failure they were .
The tea parties mobilized likeminded people .
They did n’t reveal any base of popular support that would pressure lawmakers .
You know that you have failed when Geraldo Rivera becomes the voice of reason on an issue .

An increased number of objects puts additional stress on the memory management system of the JavaScript engine , which has to scale to deal efficiently with object allocation and reclamation .
If engines do not scale to handle large object heaps , performance will suffer when running large web applications .
In browsers without a multi-process architecture , a simple way to see the effect of an increased working set on JavaScript performance is to log in to GMail in one tab and run JavaScript benchmarks in another .
The objects from the two tabs are allocated in the same object heap and therefore the benchmarks are run with a working set that includes the GMail objects .
V8 's approach to scalability is to use generational garbage collection .
The main observation behind generational garbage collection is that most objects either die very young or are long - lived .
There is no need to examine long - lived objects on every garbage collection because they are likely to still be alive .
Introducing generations to the garbage collector allows it to only consider newly allocated objects on most garbage collections .
Splay : A Scalability Benchmark
To keep track of how well V8 scales to large object heaps , we have added a new benchmark , Splay , to version 4 of the V8 benchmark suite .
The Splay benchmark builds a large splay tree and modifies it by creating new nodes , adding them to the tree , and removing old ones .
The benchmark is based on a JavaScript log processing module used by the V8 profiler and it effectively measures how fast the JavaScript engine can allocate nodes and reclaim unused memory .
Because of the way splay trees work , the engine also has to deal with a lot of changes to the large tree .
We have measured the impact of running the Splay benchmark with different splay tree sizes to test how well V8 performs when the working set is increased :
The graph shows that V8 scales well to large object heaps , and that increasing the working set by more than a factor of 7 leads to a performance drop of less than 17 % .
Even though 35 MB is more memory than most web applications use today , it is necessary to support such working sets to enable tomorrow 's web applications .

Nobody was more surprised to learn anti-gay marriage advocate and Miss California Carrie Prejean had a gay activist for a sister than … her own sister .
After the same - sex marriage question fall out , Prejean told Access Hollywood that her straight sister was a “ gay rights activist ” who told her that she stands by and fully supports her position , all part of Prejean ’s publicity spin stop - gap .
Except : “ I have never even given myself that title .
I was kind of surprised that she mentioned it , but I think she wanted to get the point across that our family is tolerant , ” says Christina Prejean , adding , “ A couple weeks back , I attended a public forum in Idaho about protecting the LGBT community against discrimination .
That was the very first thing I attended , and I told her about it on the night of the pageant , after she said she felt bad that people might be offended by her response . …
But that ’s obviously such a hot topic that either way , someone was going to be offended . ”
Ah hah .
So it appears calling Christina a “ gay rights activist ” is the same as calling Carrie “ the winner of Miss USA . ”
Both are gross exaggerations of the truth .

Big man Dwight Howard of the Orlando Magic has been calling himself ‘ Superman ’ for the past few seasons in the NBA .
We all know that the nickname ‘ Superman ’ for a basketball player has been reserved for sometime now for the Big Diesel Shaquille O’Neal .
Well during the early part of tonight ’s Eastern Conference Finals opener in Cleveland , Dwight Howard took a page out of the Shaquille ‘ Superman ’ O’Neal book .
What page was that ?
Dunking so hard and with so much force that you break things .
Important things .
In Shaq ’s case it was often a broken backboard support or shattered glass backboard .
In Dwight ’s case tonight he dunked so hard he broke the shot clock .
The game was delayed for a good period of time .
Maybe that was Dwight ’s way of trying to knock the Cavaliers off their rhythm .
Suuuppperrmannn ’s in the Building !!
Enjoy the replay folks :
I 've been suppressing the urge to write this post for a while now .
It 's not that I do n't love Twitter ( I suspect my wife is a few days away from scheduling my intervention ) ; it 's just that I 'm saturated by it .
It 's not the tweets themselves , but the incessant whining noise made up of every second - rate media personality in the world " discovering "
Twitter on a daily basis and every self - declared " social media guru " regurgitating the same How to Twitter post a thousand times a week .
So , why am I still writing this post ?
I 'm writing it because I 've experienced something with Twitter that I do n't hear many people talking about .
The real power of Twitter is n't in easy mass - marketing , driving a few more links , Diggs , Stumbles , or Sphinns , or even in branding and making a name for yourself .
The real power of Twitter is in transforming online connections into real - world relationships .
For me , Twitter has become the most powerful tool at my disposal to bridge the professional / personal gap and drive offline relationships .
If you have n't experienced this , let me share a few tips ( and a story or two ) :
(1) The Mundane Matters
It 's easy to make fun of Twitter for the constant life - streaming , but I think it 's one of Twitter 's greatest strengths and the key to why Twitter makes the boundary between professional and personal so easy to cross .
As you notice your professional contacts talking about their kids , being home with the flu , having a bad day , etc. , it 's hard not to relate and feel like you know them a bit better .
Of course , that 's a two - way street .
If you 're sincere , it 's a lot easier to start conversations with strangers on Twitter than on a platform where a professional obligation is implied ( like LinkedIn ) .
(2) Harmonic Convergence
Twitter is not only a great place for keeping tabs on your local scene , but it 's also great for letting you know when people are in your neighborhood .
A while back , I saw a tweet from my favorite itinerant SEO , Pat Sexton , that he was in Chicago for an event .
Now , if you do n't know Pat , you have to understand that outside of conferences , he 's a hard man to find ( mainly because he lives in a remote hut in Hawaii and only talks to monk seals ) .
When I noticed Pat was in Chicago , I replied back on Twitter , and found out he was just a few blocks away .
Two hours later , we were catching up in a local bar .
Without Twitter , I would never have known he was just down the street .
(3) Cross the A - List Chasm
Everyone seems a little bit more human on Twitter , and this has a way of leveling the playing field between the " A - List " and the rest of us .
Of course , that does n't mean you should follow every industry celebrity and virtually foam at the mouth every time they tweet , but there 's nothing wrong with sincerely replying to a big name when you have something relevant to say or re-tweeting them when you think it 's worthwhile .
Of course , like any networking activity , it 's easier if the A - Lister is only one or two steps removed from you , relationship - wise .
Eventually , you may get a reply or two , and down the road , some real opportunities .
(4) Round Up a Posse
One of my first experiences with bringing Twitter relationships into the real world was also one of the most powerful .
Before last year 's SEOmoz advanced training , I sent out a couple of tweets saying that I 'd be in town the night before and asking if anyone wanted to grab some dinner .
With little or no effort , I managed to round up a group of 6 , most of whom I 'd never met before , and we accidentally bumped into 3 more folks from the seminar .
Not only did I get to meet new people , but this little group became my unofficial conference " posse , " rounding up other new people and making the networking experience one of the best I 've had at an SEO event .
I should point out that I 'm not naturally inclined to do this sort of thing .
I 'm a bit of a wallflower , truth be told , but the personal nature of Twitter and the low risk of sending out a tweet that goes unanswered made a potentially awkward situation easy .
I used the same tactic at PubCon last year , and had a similar positive experience , meeting another group of new people that I previously only knew online .
(5) Do n't Be Shortsighted
With time and patience , these online - offline relationships become cyclical .
Once you meet someone in person , you return to Twitter knowing them a bit better – they 're more likely to reply , retweet , and generally engage with you .
This can be a powerful cycle , turning people you might only see once or twice a year at conferences into people you correspond with on an almost daily basis .
You 'll miss out on all of this , though , if you take a short - term view .
Instead of obsessing about getting out today 's link , or pushing for a reply or retweet , take the time to get to know people .
Real opportunities come from building real relationships , and Twitter is a uniquely powerful touch point in that process .
Having worked on a treadmill desk for the last year , I can safely say that it has been the best move I 've probably ever made in improving my productivity and overall happiness at work .
Because it's had such a tremendous impact on my life , I 'm pretty evangelical about it and have been looking forward to writing this blog post for many months .
My treadmill desk .
Not super pretty , but highly functional
I really do n't like sitting down all day .
I slouch like any other programmer ( exceptions noted ) and can feel my spine ossifying into the twisted curved shape it takes as I hunch over the keyboard in my ' ergonomic ' chair .
My arms start sticking to the desk and my lunch rebels at the lack of motion .
More than any of this , regardless of how I 'd like the world to work , there 's something about being stuck in one position for hours that really lets physical stress build up , and that physical stress starts to seep into the mind and really cramps up productivity .
A few years ago I started exploring ways to keep my mind fresh through what I learned later to call ' passive exercise ' .
My first attempt at adding said activity into my workflow was a miniature stair stepping machine that fit under the desk .
As is classically said of chewing gum and walking , I found I could either code or step , but not do both , so it got the boot after a week or so .
I also considered getting an under - the - desk exercise bike , but after discovering my multi-tasking limitations , I figured it would be a waste of a hundred bucks .
I let the problem sit for a while ( so to speak ) , and realized that what I really needed was a standing desk .
I mean , I should be able to * stand * and work at the same time , right ?
And apparently when you stand you burn like 50 % more calories .
If I remember correctly , a search on google lead me to the Lifehacker Coolest workspace contest , where I saw several examples of treadmill desks and it struck me that something like that might work really well .
I often take walks to stimulate thought , and thought that maybe if I could code and walk at the same time , I 'd be a lot more creative .
I did some research , and found that treadmill desks had been being used for quite some time - even in offices by people in suits .
If guys in suits can do it , so can a guy in cargo shorts and a t - shirt .
Here 's an interview with the guy that might be the inventor of the treadmill desk on Good Morning America , with some good clips from office environments .
I found that there 's even a company that sells shiny new " Walkstations " to the tune of $ 4,499 .
After a year of having a treadmill desk , I have to say that it would have been worth coughing up five grand for .
But luckily , I got some good ideas off of some wiley spendthrifts on the web and started scouring Craigslist for cheap treadmills with horizontal handles .
Within a week , I found one for $ 75 , talked it down to $ 50 , and brought it home .
Here 's what I did to construct mine :
Lugged the treadmill to my office - by far the hardest part since my office is upstairs Cleaned off a cheap Walmart bookshelf ( something like this ) and faced it towards the end of the treadmill
Took off a couple of the shelves and taped them onto the handles , using empty cd cases as spacers to get it to the right height Eventually I took off some hardware from the bottom of the treadmill because I kept hitting my head on the low ceiling .
Put my laptop on the top shelf of the bookshelf
Put my keyboard on the shelf taped to the handlebars
I would say that this $ 100 or so was my single greatest financial investment of my last year .
It 's had a tremendous impact on how I feel about my work , and especially how I feel after work , when I 'm hanging out with my wife and baby .
Whenever I mention the my treadmill desk to someone who has n't heard of them before , I get a pat series of questions :
Q : Do you run ?
A : I 've tried , but without much success .
Normally , I walk from between .7 to 1.5 miles an hour .
Dr. James Levine ( the guy in the Good Morning America ) suggests .7 , and that 's pretty slow .
I like a little faster because it makes it feel a little more like exercise .
Q : Is n't it hard to use a computer when you 're walking ?
A : It 's actually surprisingly easy , especially at slower speeds .
At about 2 mph using the mouse gets more difficult , but I can use Photoshop and Illustrator at 1.5 mph just fine .
Q : How much time do you spend walking ?
A : I walk about 3 hours a day .
Some days I 'm a little friskier and work all day on the treadmill .
If you 've gotten this far , maybe you 're actually thinking about taking the next step ( ha ha ) .
I highly , highly recommend it !
Here 's a few tips I 've aggregated after a year of active use :
Time Warner Cable has shelved plans to test consumption - based billing until it can improve its " customer education process , " the company announced Thursday .
Time Warner Cable has shelved plans to test consumption - based billing until it can improve its " customer education process , " the company announced Thursday .
" It is clear from the public response over the last two weeks that there is a great deal of misunderstanding about our plans to roll out additional tests on consumption based billing , " Time Warner CEO Glen Britt said in a statement .
" As a result , we will not proceed with implementation of additional tests until further consultation with our customers and other interested parties , ensuring that community needs are being met . "
Time Warner started testing bandwidth caps last year in its Beaumont , Texas market  a test that it recently expanded to North Carolina and New York .
But while rival Comcast implemented a 250 GB bandwidth cap for residential customers last year without much fanfare , and AT&T announced plans to test a 150 GB cap , Time Warner took some heat because its caps were relatively low  between 5GB and 40GB .
The company eventually announced it would also offer a 100 GB " super tier " and unlimited service for $ 150 per month , but by then , Congress was already up in arms and interest groups were circulating online petitions against the caps .
" While we continue to believe that consumption based billing may be the best pricing plan for consumers , we want to do everything we can to inform our customers of our plans and have the benefit of their views as part of our testing process , " Britt said Thursday .
As part of its education process , Time Warner will provide customers with tools to help them understand how much bandwidth they consume .
No mention of how long that will continue before testing resumes .
Sen . Charles Schumer , a New York Democrat , was in Rochester Thursday afternoon to speak out against the proposed caps , according to stopthecap.com , a Web site set up to protest the caps .
" StoptheCap has been working with the senator 's office throughout the day today to help coordinate the visit , which will take place in Irondequoit at the home of just one resident who will be directly impacted by Time Warner 's plans , " according to the site .
" We look forward to continuing to work with Senator Schumer , our customers , and all of the other interested parties as the process moves forward , to ensure that informed decisions are made about the best way to continue to provide our customers with the level of service that they expect and deserve from Time Warner Cable , " Britt concluded .
Free Press , which set up an online petition to encourage a congressional investigation into the Time Warner caps , applauded the move .
" We 're glad to see Time Warner Cable 's price - gouging scheme collapse in the face of consumer opposition , " Timothy Karr , campaign director of Free Press , said in a statement .
" Let this be a lesson to other Internet service providers looking to head down a similar path .
Consumers are not going to stand idly by as companies try to squeeze their use of the Internet .
This is a major victory , but the fight for a fast , open and affordable Internet is far from over . "
The National Cable & Telecommunications Association ( NCTA )  which championed Time Warner 's testing process on Wednesday  said the company 's decision " is completely consistent with how they have approached this from the beginning . "
" Bottom line : they have been and are engaged in exactly the kind of outreach and transparency interest groups profess to want , " NCTA president and CEO Kyle McSlarrow said in a statement .
U.S. Defense Department officials were so impressed with the level of coordination between ground military ops and cyberattacks against strategical targets during the recent conflicts , that they are now looking for ways to weaponize hacking .
Aviation
Week glanced at such a device and reports that it is being designed to be easily used even by non -techy soldiers .
The recent armed confrontations , such as the one in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Hamas or the earlier one between Russia and Georgia , were accompanied by Denial of Service and other types of attacks targeting governmental networks and servers that shocked the IT experts .
It certainly did not take long for everyone to realize that this was the future of warfare and get the military to send its researchers looking for efficient ways to apply similar tactics .
Apparently , there are several devices currently being developed behind closed doors specifically for such purposes , but the one Aviation Week talks about is intriguing .
It is basically a highly complex hacking tool designed for the unexperienced that is to turn soldiers into veritable script kiddies .
Granted , script kiddies with a lot of firepower .
This expensive hacking gadget can be carried around in the backpack on the battlefield and used to assist in missions that might require breaking into wireless networks , such as the ones used for VoIP or satellite communications .
However , the icing on the cake is the ability to hack into SCADA ( Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition ) systems .
These systems are used to administrate industrial equipment at power and chemical plants , nuclear facilities , oil refineries , etc. , so one can easily imagine how that would be extremely valuable .
The device is easily able to map out all the nodes of a given wireless network and , if necessary , cause them to disconnect , then watch them getting back online in order to identify weak spots .
Once the best target is determined , the soldier ( slash hacker ) is presented with several attack attributes and can adjust their respective level by using sliders on a touch - screen .
These attributes include , but are not limited to covertness , speed , or collateral damage .
For example , depending on the situation , one might be OK with a high level of collateral damage in exchange for a more speedy attack .
At other times , when remaining undetected is vital , the covertness slider can be maxed out , but the attack can take days .
Depending on the selections , the device decides what combination of hard - coded hacking algorithms to use .
The attack techniques are implemented by using both publicly available code , from projects such as Aircrack - ng or MadWifi , as well as proprietary one .
The device can also be used for penetration testing purposes or to gather blueprints of possible targets from the battlefield , which are then taken back to more specialized personnel , who can execute the attacks .
Senior adviser David Axelrod says Obama spent about a month pondering whether to release the memos .
Obama consulted widely on memos
White House senior adviser David Axelrod says President Barack Obama spent about a month pondering whether to release Bush - era memos about CIA interrogation techniques , and considered it “ a weighty decision . ”
“ He thought very long and hard about it , consulted widely , because there were two principles at stake , ” Axelrod said .
“ One is … the sanctity of covert operations … and keeping faith with the people who do them , and the impact on national security , on the one hand .
And the other was the law and his belief in transparency . ”

The president consulted officials from the Justice Department , the CIA , the director of National Intelligence and the Homeland Security Department , according to his adviser .
“ It was a weighty decision , ” Axelrod said .
“ As with so many issues , there are competing points of view that flow from very genuine interests and concerns that are to be respected .
And then the president has to synthesize all of it and make a decision that ’s in the broad national interest .
He ’s been thinking about this for four weeks , really . ”
A former top official in the administration of President George W. Bush called the publication of the memos “ unbelievable . ”
“ It 's damaging because these are techniques that work , and by Obama 's action today , we are telling the terrorists what they are , ” the official said .
“ We have laid it all out for our enemies .
This is totally unnecessary .
…
Publicizing the techniques does grave damage to our national security by ensuring they can never be used again — even in a ticking - time - bomb scenario where thousands or even millions of American lives are at stake . "
“ I do n't believe Obama would intentionally endanger the nation , so it must be that he thinks either 1 . the previous administration , including the CIA professionals who have defended this program , is lying about its importance and effectiveness , or 2 .
he believes we are no longer really at war and no longer face the kind of grave threat to our national security this program has protected against . ”
Obama did not act on an arbitrary timeline .
There was a deadline in a court case with the ACLU on Thursday .
It had been extended , but the ACLU was not going to agree to another .
The memos can be read here , here , here and here .
The BOob is a pushover – that is the message from Barack Obama ’s European vacation .
The news from Asia is not much better as North Korea sizes up Obama and sees a dwarf .
World leaders sized up Obama and decided he is a celebrity wannabee .
So world leaders gave Obama the soul craving celebrity he wants for himself and then smartly picked the pockets of Uncle Sam while Obama grinned .
This is all in keeping with the Obama history of self - agrandizement and doing nothing , zero , for anyone else .
During the European Vacation Obama backslapped as if he was back at Harvard University bamboozling conservatives and liberals in order to advance himself .
During the European Vacation Obama grinned and laughed and cameras popped but Americans were about as comforted as Obama ’s freezing Chicago constituents .
During the European Vacation Obama insulted America in order to make himself more popular .
World leaders took a page from Madame Mao , the “ White - boned Demon ” and flattered and built up Obama on a pedestal so high Obama became irrelevant .
Social power and popularity can be potent weapons if you are Louis XIV of France , the “ Sun King ” .
But Obama ’s yearning for celebrity , social power , and popularity are to fill a void in his fatherless self not to help America nor Americans .
Big Media wo n’t say Obama was made a fool of and mocked by real world leaders .
Big Media prefers to focus on the sleeveless scowler and praise her clumsy protocol pratfalls .
World leaders saw Obama , shuttered their eyelids , smiled , and whispered “ Sucker ” .
* * * * *
Obama is whining and wants the Security Council of the United Nations to do something about North Korea ’s latest slap in the Obama face .
Obama whines that North Korea violated international “ rules ” .
This risible plea from Obama made us laugh because Obama , of all people , now wants words to “ mean something ” .
Here is what Obama yelped : “ This provocation underscores the need for action , not just this afternoon at the Security Council but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons , â€  Mr. Obama said .
â€ œRules must be binding .
Violations must be punished .
Words must mean something .â€ 
Any doubt that North Korea wanted to deliberately slap Obama in the face , throw a shoe at him , is dispelled by the timing ( which the hapless New York Times labels an “ irony ” ) .
Mr. Obamaâ€™s comments on North Korea were delivered here at the end of a historic speech before more than 20,000 people that , in a twist of irony , was planned in advance to lay out Mr. Obamaâ€™s plans to stop the spread of nuclear arms .
That North Korea had fired a rocket over Japan and into the Pacific just hours before Mr. Obamaâ€™s speech lent his message an added urgency , Mr. Obama said , although White House officials disputed any suggestion that the secretive government in the North timed its rocket launch to coincide with Mr. Obamaâ€™s speech .
It is clear to anyone allowed to tell the truth or who wishes to accept reality that the North Korea missile launch , ready and able to be fired for days , was designed to “ coincide ” with yet another Obama speech .
Will the United Nations provide Obama with another heaping helping of celebrity but zero action ?
The Security Council resolution bans ballistic missiles for military use , and some suggest it would be tough to come down hard if there was any sign that a satellite really was the payload , even if the technology could also be used to launch a nuclear warhead .
The ambiguity means any decision on how to respond will be political , said Daniel Pinkston , a Seoul - based analyst for the International Crisis Group , a Brussels - based think tank that provides detailed analysis about North Korea .
“ It ’s pretty clear already : I think the Chinese and the Russians , but particularly the Chinese , are not going to support additional sanctions , ” he told reporters Friday .
“ It really depends upon the views of the permanent five members of the Security Council .
And if China or Russia do not support this , then nothing ’s gonna happen . ”
The North Korean launch early Sunday morning “ was a bold act of defiance against President Barack Obama , Japanese leader Taro Aso , Hu Jintao of China and others who pressed Pyongyang in the days leading up to liftoff to call off a launch they said would threaten peace and stability in Northeast Asia .
“ I urge North Korea to abide fully by the resolutions of the U.N. Security Council , ” Obama said in Prague , Czech Republic , calling on Pyongyang to refrain from further “ provocative ” actions . ”
Perhaps it is time for Obama to make matters worse and hold one of his naive promised meetings with North Korea ’s dictator “ without preconditions ” .
The long - range North Korean rocket hit Obama squarely on the nose , with impunity .
International condemnation will amount to Obama style words , words , words .
North Korea , with nuclear weapons and a missile delivery system , will no doubt be considered by Big Media to be an Obama triumph .

Obama ’s European Vacation reminds us of a bar scene in the film Casablanca in which a “ dark European ” warns a fellow bar patron “ I beg of you , Monsieur , watch yourself .
Be on guard .
This place is full of vultures , vultures everywhere , everywhere . ”
The warning coincides with the expert pick pocketing of the hapless bar patron by the “ dark European ” .
Barack Obama went to Europe to bask in the celebrity spotlight and opportunity for myriad publicity stunts .
Obama will temporarily satisfy his need for celebrity adulation but Americans will get nothing other than bills from this Obama concert tour .
President Barack Obama is learning the limits of personal diplomacy .
Warmly greeted by European leaders and the public alike as a welcome relief from his predecessor , Obamaâ€™s appeal hasnâ€™t enabled to him to bridge differences on key economic and military issues with American allies .
Obama left the G - 20 summit in London without securing any further commitment by individual countries to enact more stimulus spending .
And Saturday he departs from NATOâ€™s gathering in this French - German border town without a pledge by allies to send further combat troops to Afghanistan to bolster the American military surge there .
Obama will get applause and frat - boy style back - slapping .
Americans will get the bills from the “ sucker ” .
But in his first real taste of diplomacy , Obama is finding out that , like in domestic politics , the gushing praise that other leaders may bestow doesnâ€™t necessarily translate into support for the entirety of his agenda .
In other words , simply not being George W. Bush wasnâ€™t enough .
At NATO , the president touted the 5,000 additional trainers and security forces and dismissed questions about why nations werenâ€™t sending additional combat forces â€ “ even though the contribution is dwarfed by the 21,000 new American troops Obama has committed to the conflict since taking office .
Obama will get applause to his face from world leaders , and mockery and “ sucker ” behind closed doors .
Even Franceâ€™s Nicolas Sarkozy managed to disappoint , despite gushing over Obama as â€œa U.S. president who wants to change the world and who understands that the world does not boil down to simply American frontiers and borders.â€ 
At the same news conference Friday , Sarkozy said bluntly that , no , there would be no French boots on the ground .
Obama received a similar reaction from Germanyâ€™s Angela Merkel â€ “ a warm embrace and a cold shoulder to a big combat presence there .
The summit in London was equally disappointing .
There , Obama had hoped European allies would pump cash directly into their economies to reverse a global economic meltdown , just the way Obama did with a $ 787 billion stimulus package at home .
But the individual countries stopped short and only committed another $ 1.1 trillion in new International Monetary Fund lending and other guarantees for poor nations â€ “ not at all what Obama had in mind .
The embarrassment that is American Big Media continues to make excuses for the bumbling clod and continues to praise and sing for Obama :
To be sure , Obama can come home feeling like he notched some significant accomplishments on his European tour so far â€ “ not least of which was holding his own comfortably on his maiden voyage onto the world stage .
He also began to forge personal relationships that he said several times he believes will pay off down the road .
Obama got alleged fans to say nice things about him in public and that is supposed to be a “ significant ” accomplishment .
Obama got back - slapping smiles ; Americans got back - stabbing hefty bills from Obama and his 500 aides .
Even Obama at some level knows he has been taken and treated as a rube .
A good case can be made that Obama knows he indeed is a clod , a rube , an inexperienced , unqualified boob :
But Obama couldnâ€™t completely disguise that his first trip abroad as the American president was a bit of an eye - opener .
He hinted at this Welcome to The NFL moment in taking an open - ended question from an Austrian reporter at NATO about his impressions so far of the continent .
â€œIt was also interesting to see that political interaction in Europe is not that different from the United States Senate , â€  he noted .
Thereâ€™s a lot of â€ “ I donâ€™t know what the term is in Austrianâ € “ wheeling and dealing .
And people are pursuing their interests and everybody has their own particular issues and their own particular politics.â€ 
Hillary Clinton , John McCain , and this website have long known what Obama is only now beginning to discover , but still not fully understand nor fully appreciate – Lord Palmerston ’s truism â€ œNations have no permanent friends or allies , they only have permanent interests.â€ 
World leaders will be more than happy to dump “ praise ” of Obama in public in exchange for doing as they please and doing nothing to help American policy aims .
The summit ’s co-hosts , French President Nicholas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel , both were quick to offer support for Obama ’s new Afghan strategy of sending American reinforcements and bolstering the training of Afghan forces .
But they would go no farther .
Obama received applause during his European vacation for his publicity stunts .
Americans received insults from Obama when he spoke to European students , who are in Obama ’s fan base .
“ President Barack Obama has declared that America has “ failed to appreciate Europe ’s leading role in the world ” and has “ shown arrogance and been dismissive , even derisive ” towards its allies .
” His speech in Strasbourg went further than any United States president in history in criticising his own country ’s action while standing on foreign soil .
But he sought to use the comments , which amount to a mea culpa for recent American foreign policy , as leverage to alter European views of America and secure more troops for the war in Afghanistan .
Obama insulted Americans in order to get more troops for his war in Afghanistan and to get applause from students .
No additional troops are coming for Obama ’s war .
Obama received applause , America got nothing .
But though he continued to dazzle Europeans on his debut international tour , the Continentâ€™s leaders turned their backs on the US President .
Gordon Brown was the only one to offer substantial help .
He offered to send several hundred extra British soldiers to provide security during the August election , but even that fell short of the thousands of combat troops that the US was hoping to prise from the Prime Minister .
t two other allies made firm offers of troops .
Belgium offered to send 35 military trainers and Spain offered 12 .
Mr Obamaâ€™s host , Nicolas Sarkozy , refused his request .
The derisory response threatened to tarnish Mr Obamaâ€™s European tour , which yesterday included a spellbinding performance in Strasbourg in which he offered the world a vision of a future free of nuclear weapons .
Obama received applause for his “ spellbinding performance ” .
America got nothing .
Obama begged .
â€ œEurope should not simply expect the United States to shoulder that burden alone , â€ he said .
â€ œThis is a joint problem it requires a joint effort.â€ 
Obama threatened and fear - mongered :
He said that failing to support the US surge would leave Europe open to a fresh terrorist offensive .
â€œIt is probably more likely that al - Qaeda would be able to launch a serious terrorist attack on Europe than on the United States because of proximity , â€  he said .
Obama failed :
The presidential charm offensive failed to move fellow Nato countries .
President Sarkozy told Mr Obama that France would not be sending reinforcements to bolster its existing force northeast of Kabul .
Germany , Italy , Poland , Canada and Denmark said that they were considering their positions .
After a meeting with Angela Merkel , the German Chancellor , Mr Obama tried to apply further moral pressure .
â€ œI am sure that Germany , as one of the most important leaders in Europe , will be stepping up to the plate and helping us to get the job done.â€ 
Obama is only now , when it is too late , beginning to learn that nations have interests , not friends .
World leaders this week pretended to be Obama ’s “ friend ” .
Behind his back , world leaders whisper : “ Obama is a boob .
Obama is a sucker .
Let ’s roll him . ”

The world must burn less diesel and wood , Nobel peace prize - winner Al Gore said yesterday , as the soot produced is accelerating the melting of ice in polar and mountainous regions .
Gore , backed by government ministers and scientists , said that the soot , also known as " black carbon " , from engines , forest fires and partially burned fuel was collecting in the Arctic where it was creating a haze of pollution that absorbs sunlight and warms the air .
It was also being deposited on snow , darkening its surface and reducing the snow 's ability to reflect sunlight back into space .
" The principal [ climate change ] problem is carbon dioxide , but a new understanding is emerging of soot , " said Gore .
" Black carbon is settling in the Himalayas .
The air pollution levels in the upper Himalayas are now similar to those in Los Angeles . "
The impact of the soot is as significant as it is surprising — it was not mentioned as a warming factor in the UN 's major 2007 report on climate change .
A study this month indicated that soot from industry , cars , farming and wood fuel burning has been responsible for half the total temperature increases in the Arctic between 1890 to 2007 .
Temperatures there are rising twice as fast as anywhere else on the planet , making it the region worst affected by climate change .
Gore warned that all the world 's icy regions were experiencing rapid and dangerous global warming .
" The cryosphere – the frozen water part of the Earth – is disappearing .
Global warming is causing the permafrost to thaw .
It contains more carbon than anywhere else and the risk is that it releases methane .
That has the potential to double the global warming potential in the atmosphere , " he said .
Norwegian foreign minister Jonas Store said action on black carbon was even more urgent than that on CO2 : " Even if we turn the rising curve of greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years , the reduction will not occur quickly enough to preserve the polar and alpine environments .
We must address short lived climate pollutants such as black carbon . "
Glaciologists working in Latin America , Nepal , China and Greenland all reported at the meeting in Tromso that glaciers were losing ice more rapidly and becoming less thick as a result of global warming .
Dorthe Jensen , from the Niels Bohr Institute in Denmark , said : " In the last five years we have seen many ice streams double in speed .
Their floating snouts have moved back 30 km .
We never imagined the ice discharge would change so much . "
Glaciers in the Himalayas and on the Tibetan plateau , from which 40 % of the world derives its fresh water , are retreating fast , said Yao Tandong , a researcher with the Chinese academy of sciences .
" This is causing severe social problems as lakes get bigger and people are forced to move .
Himalayan glaciers are mostly retreating at an accelerating rate . "
The meeting also heard , in a new report from the international Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme ( Amap ) , that climate change was now affecting every aspect of life in the Arctic .
Norwegian , Canadian , Russian , US and other polar scientists reported that , in the last four years , air temperatures have increased , sea ice has declined sharply , surface waters in the Arctic ocean have warmed and permafrost is in some areas rapidly thawing , releasing methane .
The report 's main findings are :
Land
Permafrost is warming fast and at its margins thawing .
Plants are growing more vigorously and densely .
In northern Alaska , temperatures have been rising since the 1970s .
In Russia , the tree line has advanced up hills and mountains at 10 metres a year .
Nearly all glaciers are decreasing in mass , resulting in rising sea levels as the water drains to the ocean .
Summer sea ice
The most striking change in the Arctic in recent years has been the reduction in summer sea ice in 2007 .
This was 23 % less than the previous record low of 5.6 m sq kilometres in 2005 , and 39 % below the 1979 - 2000 average .
New satellite data suggests the ice is much thinner than it used to be .
For the first time in existing records , both the north - west and north - east passages were ice - free in summer 2008 .
However , the 2008 winter ice extent was near the year long - term average .
Greenland
The Greenland ice sheet has continued to melt in the past four years with summer temperatures consistently above the long - term average since the mid 1990s .
In 2007 , the area experiencing melt was 60 % greater than in 1998 .
Melting lasted 20 days longer than usual at sea level and 53 days longer at 2 -3,000 m heights .
Warmer waters
In 2007 , some ice - free areas were as much as 5C warmer than the long - term average .
Arctic waters appear to have warmed as a result of the influx of warmer waters from the Pacific and Atlantic .
The loss of reflective , white sea ice also means that more solar radiation is absorbed by the dark water , heating surface layers further .

Om du skadar tänderna eller tappar tänder , så är ett populärt alternativ att ersätta dem med tandimplantat .
Läs våra tips om tandimplantat .
Det är varken kul eller lätt att leva utan en eller flera tänder .
Dels påverkar det ju utseendet , dels är det svårare att tugga .
Fördelen med dagens moderna tandimplantat är att de är så bra att man varken ser eller känner någon skillnad mellan tandimplantatet och de egna tänderna .
Vad är ett tandimplantat ?
Tandimplantat är en konstgjord tand på en skruv kan man säga .
Man fäster titanskruvar direkt i käkbenet som man sedan skruvar fast en konstgjord tand på .
Materialet , titan är bra på det sätt , efter som det har en unik förmåga växa samman med käkbenet .
Tanden i sig , tillverkas av titan eller zirkonium med ett ytskikt av porslin som formats och färgats för att passa in med övriga tänder .
Ska man välja tandimplantat eller löständer ?
Tandimplantat har en stor fördel och det är att de sitter fast .
Du behöver inte oroa dig att de ska lossna och de är ocks å lättare att tugga med än vad det är med till exempel löstagbara proteser eller bryggor .
Tandimplantat blir även mer en naturlig del av din mun .
Vem kan få tandimplantat ?
I stort vem som helst kan få tandimplantat .
Dock är det ett måste att man har ett starkt och friskt käkben .
På barn väntar man med implantat tills att deras käkben växt färdigt .
Det gäller även att man har ett gott hälsotillstånd i allmänhet eftersom vissa sjukdomar och mediciner kan innebära en förhöjd risk för komplikationer .
Man gör alltid en grundlig undersökning med en individuell bedömning inför att en patient ska få tandimplantat eller inte .
Hur sätts tandimplantat fast ?
När man sätter fast ett tandimplantat så gör man det under kortare operation som utförs under bedövning .
Man fäster implantatskruvarna i käkbenet och därefter låter man benet och titanskruven växa samman innan man fortsätter .
Det kan ta ett par månader upp till ett halvår för denna process .
Under tiden detta sker så får man tillfälliga löstagbara proteser att fylla ut tomrummet med .
När implantatskruvarna har växt fast så fäster man de nya tänderna / tanden på skruven / skruvarna .

If you ’ve caught even just one episode of ABC ’s Emmy - winning and tear - jerking Extreme Makeover : Home Edition in the last few years , these descriptions might come to mind when you think of Paige Hemmis , the animated blond who always seems to have a smile on her face and a pink tool belt slung around her waist .
You might even describe Paige Hemmis as one who ’s likely to be the recipient of cliché construction site catcalls rather than one of the hardhats herself .
A description that might not come to mind , however , is depressed .
It ’s certainly not a word many people associate with lively and helpful go - getters like Paige Hemmis , yet , somewhere between building new homes for struggling families and changing lives for deserving folks across the nation , that ’s exactly how Paige found herself .
Depressed .
I was fortunate enough to talk with Paige last week about her struggle with depression , how treatment has helped her refocus her energies on the show , and the exciting new campaign she ’s started to help shed light on depression advocacy , awareness , and resources .
After her plane landed and she was safely settled in the back of a car ( hey , this is Paige Hemmis we ’re talking about – in addition to the show , she ’s juggling her Tuff Chix line of work gear for women and volunteer time with Habitat for Humanity – she ’s a busy gal ) , I dove right into the question that ’d been bouncing around in my head since learning about Paige ’s new advocacy efforts :
Given the stigma that still surrounds mental health issues , what prompted Paige Hemmis – so well known for her happy demeanor – to go public with her depression ?
Paige laughs and agrees there is definitely still a “ big stigma ” surrounding mental health , but launches into a story about a good friend of hers who admitted she ’d sought help for her own struggles after listening to Paige talk about her situation .
“ It ’s so amazing my story could inspire other people ! ”
But before we learn about how Paige is hoping to inspire more people with her story , we first have to learn her story .
You might think building a new home for a devastated family each week – seeing the smiles and tears of joy , hearing the laughter and endless “ thank yous ” – would be enough to keep anyone happy – that Paige Hemmis should n’t even have a story of depression to tell .
However , depression does n’t care who you are , what your job is , or how many good things you do for other people , and for Paige , sometimes this meant Home Edition caused more sadness than joy :
“ It [ the show ] takes an emotional toll .
I like getting involved , but the emotional toll is very hard . ”
Before she went public with her depression , Paige admits she often put on a happy face to make it through the day and sometimes relied on the excuse of her hectic work schedule to avoid hanging out with friends and loved ones , and she feels the way she handled her depression in both her public and private lives is just one example of how depression and its symptoms span a pretty broad range :
“ You do n’t have to be suicidal to be depressed ; there is a gray area .
I think I represent people who go on about their daily lives . ”
Now that she ’s learned how to treat and manage her depression , Paige finds it easier to deal with that emotional toll : “ I focus on the help now … I have a better grasp of that . ”
Which brings us back to Paige using her story to inspire others – something the energetic self - taught carpenter is perfectly poised to do .
Shortly after the conversation with her friend , Paige put the word out that she was interested in getting involved with advocacy .
With the help of the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance ( DBSA ) , Dr. Jesse H. Wright , and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals , Paige launched Blueprint for Hope , the aptly named depression awareness campaign geared toward helping others learn more about the mental health condition and the many tools available for people suffering from depression .
And if you think Paige is just another celeb who ’s slapped her famous face on some well - meaning campaign for all the primo public relations benefits , you could n’t be more off .
She is passionate about the campaign and I can hear the sincerity in her voice when she tells me , “ Blueprint for Hope is the website I wish I had when I was going through it . ”
Keeping true to her DIY roots , Paige has rolled up her sleeves and started a series of videos for the campaign ’s website to help people learn about how they can create their own “ blueprints ” for hope to deal with depression .
And , just like a typical blueprint is a “ plan to create an awesome house , ” Paige believes developing an individual blueprint for dealing with depression will help each person better deal with the condition .
To get started , she would encourage a person to “ [ g ] o talk to your doctor , and look online for resources .
Break it down so it ’s not so scary . ”
Blueprint for Hope currently focuses on providing information and free resources for people with depression , and in the coming months Paige – along with a DBSA representative and a doctor – will attend Blueprint for Hope events in communities throughout the nation to share her story , offer DIY tips for inspiration and motivation , and encourage people to explore resources for managing depression .
The tour dates will be posted on the Blueprint for Hope website as they ’re finalized , but if you live in or near Sacramento , Denver , Houston , Atlanta , or Philadelphia , you can expect a visit .
Overall , Paige wants Blueprint for Hope to educate people about depression and help them realize they ’re not alone , and she can sum up in five simple , yet powerful , words with resolute determination in her voice the one goal above all others she hopes Blueprint for Hope achieves : “ Inspiring people to get help . ”
And here ’s to hoping it does just that .
Visit the Blueprint for Hope website to learn more about the campaign and it ’s supporters , as well as nab some resources and watch Paige ’s DIY videos for developing your own blueprint for hope .
A few weeks ago I wrote about Kossack and blogger extraordinaire Marcy Wheeler :
There is probably nobody who writes about American government and politics who is a more prodigiously talented and devoted reader than Marcy .
Her ability to read voluminous amounts of material and " connect the dots " to come up with an explanation and a narrative of what happened is beyond compare .
It 's a gift , but one that she 's refined .
She 's a virtuoso of reading .
If you know much about what Marcy 's written in the last few years , you probably know that long before it became public , she had essentially figure out almost the entire chronology of the Plame outing .
To read her pieces at The Next Hurrah was to read the future , as almost everything she figured out by reading the public documents — government documents and news releases and trial transcripts and newspaper articles and interviews , all of which were available not only to the general public , but to the legions of reporters who she routinely scooped without recourse to a single unnamed source — came out later in the Scooter Libby trial .
Marcy 's ability to burrow down and concentrate and make connections is extraordinary .
But she 's also excellent at thinking on her feet , as was seen by her live blogging of that trial .
She went on TV and repeatedly made cogent points , without recourse to much arcanum — not that she can't bring the arcanum — and in a manner that was understandable to casual followers of the case .
Marcy also has sound instincts about people , works like a dog , and possesses something too few political reporters have — a sense of progressive purpose behind what she 's doing .
She 's committed to the truth , but also to a progressive view of politics .
She 's a friend for a lot of reasons ; she 's funny , I respect the vigor and practicality she showed when she dove in to local Democratic politics a few years ago and became an officer in her county Democratic party , she knows way more about football than I 'll ever care about , and it 's amusing how quickly her short - term memory goes on hiatus after two stouts .
But more importantly , I respect and value what she 's done for the blogosphere , and the country in general .
Just last week , she made the discovery that Khalid Sheik Mohammed had been waterboarded 183 times .
It 's the kind of discovery she 's made before , and given the resources , will make again and again .
Many of you know how great Marcy is , and what she 's done as a blogger for the blogosphere , but also , in her ferreting out of hidden deceptions and uncomfortable truths , what she 's done for the nation .
Well , it 's not just us that know that as her , as today she was honored by the prestigious Hillman Foundation :
Just last month , Marcy
Wheeler made the front page of the New York Times after she became the first person to notice that a newly - released Justice Department memo revealed that Khalid Sheik Mohammed had been waterboarded 183 times in one month .
Last year ,
Wheeler ’s groundbreaking investigative work on the CIA leak case also made the front page of the Times .
Her early and powerful reporting about malfeasance by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales helped to propel him out of the Bush administration .
And her live blogging from the Scooter Libby trial in 2007 is widely regarded as one of the seminal moments in online journalism .
Wheeler also produced outstanding coverage of the American auto industry crisis .
Combining her background in the industry with a deep commitment to American workers , her depth of analysis was unrivaled .
Though she 's still an active diarist and commenter here at Daily Kos as emptywheel , she 's got her own place , which you should make a regular stop in your daily reading .
You should also consider supporting the effort to increase Marcy 's ability to be a great blogger .
The folks at FDL are trying to raise enough money to support the efforts of Marcy and to give her a team that would include a researcher and another blogger .
They 're halfway to their goal .
Times are tough for a lot of people — and Marcy 's written about it , with some outstanding pieces on the economic devastation of our home state of Michigan — but if you can spare a little coin and care about progressive blogging and journalism , contributing here would be a great act in support of the blogosphere .
Finally , Marcy Wheeler is now an established presence in the blogosphere .
But let 's not shut the door on creating opportunities for new progressive talent .
Please read about the Daily Kos Fellows program , and if you 're able to , make a contribution here .

Kyrgyzstan 's forests are home to the ancestors of domestic apples
The wild ancestors of common domestic fruit trees are in danger of becoming extinct , scientists have warned .
Researchers have published a " red list " of threatened species that grow in the forests of Central Asia .
These disease - resistant and climate - tolerant fruit trees could play a role in our future food security .
But in the last 50 years , about 90 % of the forests have been destroyed , according to conservation charity , Fauna & Flora International .
The Red List of Central Asia identifies 44 tree species in Kyrgyzstan , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan and Tajikistan as under threat from extinction .
It cites over - exploitation and human development as among the main threats to the region 's forests , which are home to more than 300 wild fruit and nut species including apple , plum , cherry , apricot and walnut .
Antonia Eastwood , the lead author of the research , described the region as a " unique global hotspot of diversity " .
" A lot of these species are only found in this area , " she told BBC News .
" It 's very mountainous and dry , so many of these species have a great deal of tolerance to cold and drought .
" A lot of our domestic fruit supply comes from a very narrow genetic base , " she continued .
" Given the threats posed to food supplies by disease and the changing climate , we may need to go back to these species and include them in breeding programmes . "
Farming fruit Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are thought to be the ancestral homes of familiar favourites such as Red Delicious and Golden Delicious .
The US Department of Agriculture has already sponsored expeditions to Kazakhstan , during which scientists have collected samples with the aim of expanding the genetic diversity of farm - grown apples .
Communities in Central Asia are learning to use the forests sustainably
This type of genetic foraging , Dr Eastwood explained , allows domestic lines to be crossed with wild strains , producing varieties more resistant to diseases such as apple scab , a fungus that can devastate crops .
" But these countries lack the resources to conserve their valuable trees , " added Dr Eastwood .
This year , as part of the the UK Darwin Initiative , Fauna & Flora International is working with scientists in Kyrgyzstan to carry out research on threatened trees and develop methods to harvest the fruit sustainably .
The organisation is training local scientists and involving communities in the planning and managing of their own forests .

Former vice - president Dick Cheney said in an interview Monday that the Somali pirates who have been wreaking havoc on commercial shipping off the coast of East Africa are responsible for the World Trade Center attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
CASPER , Wyo. ( The Skunk.org ) — Former vice - president Dick Cheney said in an interview Monday that the Somali pirates who have been wreaking havoc on commercial shipping off the coast of East Africa are responsible for the World Trade Center attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
“ We know they had been plotting to hijack huge ships and ram them into skyscrapers in several metropolitan centers across the U.S. , ” said Cheney .
“ We also know they have been stockpiling weapons of mass destruction at the bottom of the Indian Ocean that will be assembled aboard their fleet of Iranian - built nuclear submarines . ”
Cheney said he is absolutely , positively , correct about this .
To back up his assertions , he produced images his staff downloaded from Google Earth , and pointed to what appeared to be ridges under the sea .
“ Those are n’t ridges , ” he explained .
“ They ’re WMDs . ”
He said the weapons of mass destruction were stockpiled by the Somali pirates , who can breathe underwater with special mermaid fins they have in their necks .
“ Pirates present a clear and present security threat to our homeland , ” he said .
“ Americans are less safe today against pirate attacks than they were under the Bush administration . ”
Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh concurred .
“ Liberals in Congress are going to allow Somali pirates to take over our businesses , manhandle our women and destroy our Judeo / Christian way of life , ” he told his audience , “ all under the misguided doctrine of ‘ civil rights . ' ”
Cheney advised President Obama to follow the precedent set by President George W. Bush and send troops to the bottom of the Indian Ocean to gather the weapons and subdue the pirates .
“ It ’s important that we rout out these combatant pirates and restore democracy to Pirate Land , ” added the former Vice President .
“ Unfortunately , I doubt the current administration has the balls . ”
Examining Game Pace : How Single - Player Levels Tick
By mark davies
[ In this in - depth article , veteran designer Davies looks at games from Call Of Duty 4 through Dead Space to analyze the art of game level pacing . ]
Introduction
" Pacing " is a word bandied around a lot when talking about level design , but it is actually a very complex concept to pin down .
Just how does the pace affect the player 's perception of the level and what is it that sets a well paced level apart from a poorly paced one ?
The Fundamentals
With these questions ringing in my ears I was determined to try and delve a little deeper into just what constitutes level pacing , but I found very little literature on the subject .
Instead I decided to focus my efforts on breaking down the core elements of what determines pace itself .
In doing so I identified several key aspects of game pace :
Movement Impetus -- the will of the player to move through the level .
-- the will of the player to move through the level .
Threat -- the notion of danger .
-- the notion of danger .
Tension -- the atmosphere and mood of the level or perceived danger which is reflected in the player .
-- the atmosphere and mood of the level or perceived danger which is reflected in the player .
Tempo -- the level of actual action currently being experienced by the player .
Movement Impetus
Movement impetus is the will or desire of a player to move forwards through a level .
There are several ways in which the player can be pushed into moving or stalled from pushing forwards in order to affect the movement impetus and thus the pace of the action .
There are many elements that increase impetus to move :
Introduce a threat from behind -- as long as the threat is significant it will cause the player to want to move away from it .
-- as long as the threat is significant it will cause the player to want to move away from it .
Present an objective ahead -- dangling the carrot is one of the most effective methods of encouraging movement .
A clearly defined goal is vital in creating this urge to follow it .

Impose a time limit -- quite obviously the restriction of a time limit will encourage the player to not hang around .
Too many imposed time limits can be extremely frustrating however .

Narrow physical options -- limiting the space in which to travel -- i.e. long corridors as opposed to open spaces , limits the amount of choice available to the player and in turn increases the speed at which they tend to move .

Draw the eye -- items of interest will pull the player towards them .
Judicious use of these will help to pull the player through parts of the level .
Bear in mind that once they reach the item of interest they are likely to pause at that point .

Architectural pressure -- specific forms of architecture promote movement .
Walls that angle down , long corridors , junctions , etc all have psychological impact upon the player .

Snatch desired object -- taking away a desired object will often trigger the player into chasing after it .
-- taking away a desired object will often trigger the player into chasing after it .
NPC leads the way -- having a third party lead the player though the level will nearly always directly affect the movement impetus .
Continual movement keeps the tempo high , but it is undesirable in many ways .
Often players want time to take stock , catch their breath , formulate a plan or even just soak up the atmosphere -- it provides a break from constant travel .
Also in production terms continual travel often requires much more real estate in which to move -- this is both a production risk and possibly a technical issue .
Conversely there are also many elements that decrease impetus to move :
Wow moments -- stunning scenery , dramatic actions , impressive vistas or other elements that halt the player for a while .

Obstacle -- something blocking the progress ahead will decrease movement impetus and force the player to find a way around or a way to clear the blockage .

Altered movement -- a different movement method may require more thought , such as scaling walls via handholds .

Introducing a threat ahead -- a group of enemies ahead , a flaming pit or any other potential threat will slow the player whilst they plan to deal with it , then execute said plan .
-- a group of enemies ahead , a flaming pit or any other potential threat will slow the player whilst they plan to deal with it , then execute said plan .
Increased tension -- when tension is particularly high ( usually through a high perceived threat and good atmosphere ) then the player will often be fearful of moving quickly .
Dead Space is a classic example of this -- many players tend to move slowly to ready themselves for sudden attacks .

Multiple Routes / Open World -- choice requires thought and thought slows movement impetus .
Multiple routes and open world games offer a plethora of choice .
Perhaps the ultimate example of slowed impetus is the moment when a player exits the sewer in Oblivion and sees the huge expanse of the world before them .
It takes a moment or two just to take it all in .

Complex inventory systems will also require management that will slow movement impetus .
Further still -- having collectible items in the first place will encourage exploration .

-- moments of dialog with NPCs or getting into the character will generally require more involvement from the player , and will thus slow movement impetus .
Story exposition -- generally the exposition of story will require the player 's attention and will thus slow movement impetus .
Constantly slowing movement impetus can also be dangerous , as it can prevent the player having a feeling of progression .
A balance needs to be struck in providing a sense of movement and accomplishment and allowing the player time to themselves to explore , soak in the atmosphere or to take stock of their situation .
Threat ( Actual Danger )
The pace of the game can also be increased by the sense of peril that is experience by the player .
The more threat the player believes they are under , the quicker their pulse , the more nervous and often more panicked them are .
Threat can come in many forms -- each form having a different feel of pacing .
For example combat tends to be more frantic and higher paced than traversing an environment , even though the end result -- death -- could potentially occur in either situation .
Generally the level of threat felt by the player is determined by whether the threat is being caused by an external force -- an enemy , an encroaching hazard , etc , or whether is a danger that will result from the player 's own mistake .
Threats from external forces tend to have a much higher level of pace than those that will result from a player 's mistake , as they have time to gather their thoughts and create a plan when they have control .
Proximity of a threat also has a huge influence on the feel of the threat .
An enemy at a distance is not nearly as threatening as one very close by .
This is something that stealth based games can really use to their advantage ( and is something that can also build a great sense of tension ) .
Adding a time limit to a task automatically increases the level of actual danger , as the control the player has over the game world has been reduced -- there are now limits placed upon them which can induce a level of panic .
Tension ( Perceived Danger )
Tension occurs from the belief in an unknown danger and can be difficult to achieve , but the result of achieving it can be incredibly immersive .
Tension works particularly well in creating the right pace for a horror game .
In order to create tension the right atmosphere must be created .
A world has to be crafted that the player can invest in , believe in and ultimately become immersed in .
Audio can help a great deal in building tension .
Music in particular can create tension by playing to well known triggers that people have learnt from years of films and TV shows .
In truth , whilst tension is created from fear of the unknown , the threat must be known in some way .
Take the game Alien Vs Predator , which I feel has possibly the most tense introduction level of any game I have played .
Throughout the level your motion sensor blips and flashes as threats apparently come near you .
However , this sequence heavily relies on the player 's knowledge of the films to know that the flashing blips on the radar could potentially be the deadly aliens .
To achieve tension when you do n't have the luxury of a well - known license to rely on , then you need to show the potential consequence of the threat , or the threat itself in some form .
Dead Space does a very good job of building up tension without the player immediately knowing what the threat is .
As soon as they board the Ishimura it is plainly obvious that something is seriously wrong .
Tension can also be achieved through a known threat in stealth games .
Instead of a fear of the unknown , the tension comes from the fear of being discovered .
Games such as Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell utilize this fear well by forcing the player to engage in tense scenarios with enemies in close proximity .
Tempo
Tempo describes the level of intensity of action -- how much concentration is required by the player to achieve their goal .
Low tempo gameplay tends to be that which requires serious thought and contemplation -- generally puzzles .
High tempo gameplay is generally gameplay that requires fast reactions and split - second decisions .
High tempo action often induces stress or panic and often at its highest level might be termed " frantic " .
There is always a sure - fire method of creating high tempo no matter what the situation -- by imposing a time limit -- or what could be called " Forced Pacing " .
Tempo in Movement
Tempo when moving around the environment is determined by the mechanics of the game and the environment itself .
Explorative movement tends to be low tempo , as the player has time to look around and determine their own route .
More acrobatic environment traversal can often be higher tempo .
It really achieves high tempo when there is a great sense of flow in the design .
A great example of such flow is the Prince of Persia : Sands of Time -- the mechanics and level design merged to create patterns of flow that had high tempo .
Tempo in Puzzles
Puzzles by their very nature tend to be low tempo -- the only real way to create a high tempo puzzle is to add a time pressure .
This tends to make them the ideal method of reducing the pace of gameplay as a counterpoint to high paced action like combat .
Tempo in Combat
Combat is usually high tempo as it will require split - second decision making and requires high levels of reaction .
The tempo itself may change dramatically over the course of a battle .
General Skirmishes
A general battle against a group of enemies in a game tends to follow a bell - curve pattern .
The tempo of the battle builds to a certain tempo before it hits a turning point , where the more the player removes the incoming threat , the easier it becomes to take out the remaining threats .
For example , a Left 4 Dead horde encounter follows this pattern -- the initial build up of enemies increased fairly rapidly up to a maximum number and a frantic tempo , before the player manages to destroy enough to turn the tide of the battle .
At this point the lesser numbers make it easier to kill the remaining zombies and the tempo drops off .
Boss Fights
Boss fights tend to have much more of a crescendo feel -- they are generally eased into the first part of the fight , but as they start to chip away at its health it begins to attack with more and more ferocity , until the final phase where it is particularly dangerous .
Of course once it is defeated the threat has been completely eliminated the tempo drops to pretty much nothing .
Structure of Pacing
Whilst knowing the fundamentals of pacing is important , it is the way these fundamentals interact with each other -- how they are structured -- that is truly important .
The key to creating a well paced level is to provide moments of action interjected with calm - peaks & troughs as they are often called .
Keeping at a trough for too long can become tedious and lack excitement -- remaining at a peak for too long can desensitize a player to the action , to the point where it becomes repetitive and boring .
I heard a fantastic analogy from a designer recently -- that pacing a level is much like composing a piece of music -- he liked to structure it as verse followed by chorus , followed by verse , etc .
I thought this was a really good way of looking at it , as music has much the same job to accomplish -- create an emotional response in a manner that changes over the course of time - the only difference is the level of interaction .
In a way playing a level is more like being a musician interpreting a piece of music .
So are there elements of music theory that could be applied to level pacing ?
The main elements of a piece of music are :
Rhythm -- in music rhythm is the timing of particular notes .
In gameplay this could translate as the timing of events that determines game pace .

Melody -- describes notes in a successive series to create phrases of sound .
This could be comparable to a sequence of events in a level to create phrases of gameplay -- something that might be termed Flow in game design .

Harmony -- is the combination of notes of different pitches to create pleasing sounds , something that can easily be equated to combinations of game mechanics within a sequence to create a pleasing play experience .
Some mechanics will gel well together and some will not -- much like musical notes .

Texture -- describes the amount that is going on in a piece of music at any one time .
In gameplay this can simply translate as how many different things are happening at any one time .
Rhythm
The main element of rhythm that applies to level pacing has really already been covered -- tempo -- the feel of intensity that the player experiences from moment to moment , how fast they feel the pace of action to be .
Tempo can be altered during the course of a piece of music in a number of ways .
There are specific terms used in music to address changes in tempo :
Accelerando -- gradually increasing ( accelerating ) the tempo .
This is very applicable to level pacing as it is often the case that the average tempo of the level increases towards the end .
-- gradually increasing ( accelerating ) the tempo .
This is very applicable to level pacing as it is often the case that the average tempo of the level increases towards the end .
Calando - going slower than previously .
This would decrease intensity of gameplay over the preceding section .
- going slower than previously .
This would decrease intensity of gameplay over the preceding section .
Precipitando -- going faster than previously .
This would increase intensity of gameplay over the preceding section .
-- going faster than previously .
This would increase intensity of gameplay over the preceding section .
Ritardando -- gradually decreasing the tempo .
This may not apply across a whole level , which generally will increase in tempo , but might occur after particularly fraught sections -- rather than simply drop the pace completely it may bring it down gradually .
-- gradually decreasing the tempo .
This may not apply across a whole level , which generally will increase in tempo , but might occur after particularly fraught sections -- rather than simply drop the pace completely it may bring it down gradually .
Ritenuto -- slightly slower than the previous tempo , holding back .
This might be used in level pace to punctuate a battle with a smaller skirmish before returning to a larger battle thereafter .
-- slightly slower than the previous tempo , holding back .
This might be used in level pace to punctuate a battle with a smaller skirmish before returning to a larger battle thereafter .
Stretto -- temporarily speeding up .
This would be a change to bring up the intensity of the gameplay or raise the challenge for a short time .
These changes may be sudden or happen gradually .
In level pace these tempo changes are likely to occur very frequently -- much more frequently than they would in a piece of music .
Flow ( Melody )
Melody in reference to music describes the pattern of notes .
We can apply this to level pacing as the pattern of game mechanics that make up a sequence -- more suited to the term flow .
There are several terms used to describe aspects of melody in music that could be applied :
Monotone -- the repeated use of a single element .
-- the repeated use of a single element .
Ostinato -- a repeated phrase or game mechanic ( separate to monotone in that it is punctuated with others ) .
-- a repeated phrase or game mechanic ( separate to monotone in that it is punctuated with others ) .
Ornaments -- elements that are used to embellish the principle element -- i.e. smaller game mechanics in a sequence that focuses on one particular mechanic as its main theme .
-- elements that are used to embellish the principle element -- i.e. smaller game mechanics in a sequence that focuses on one particular mechanic as its main theme .
Tremolo -- rapid alternation between mechanics .
Harmony
Harmony is the combination of notes to create a pleasing sound -- a chord for example .
In terms of game pacing this might be interpreted as mechanics used in unison to create pleasing gameplay .
Certain types of gameplay tend to fuse well , others are so different that they are discordant -- they do n't work well together and feel wrong .
Form
The form or structure of a piece of music describes the manner in which it is assembled -- breaking it down into constituent parts .
The most common musical structure is the Strophic form -- verse , chorus , verse .
This could quite easily apply to pacing : choruses tend to be louder , more impactful sections between quieter and more relaxed verses .
This is very similar to the peaks and troughs ethos of many games ' level pacing .
There are however other structures used in music that might also be applicable .
Rondo ( to return ) plays a different melody each verse , but returns to one main theme each time .
Other structures are very much like mini narratives , such as Fugue or Invention , which tend to have exposition , then development and then finished with recapitulation .
Variation has a main theme that is played slightly differently each time .
There are certainly some elements of musical structure that might well translate well to the feel of level pacing in a game .
Timbre
Translating timbre to game pacing is really describing the quality of the gameplay as its constituent game mechanics -- it defines exactly what is required of the player .
An examination of timbre is to break down the individual game elements and see exactly how well each one is performing .
Polishing even the smallest mechanic can have a drastic impact on the feel of the whole sequence .
Dynamics
Dynamics pertains to the specifics of the mechanics themselves -- how many enemies in a fight , how aggressive the A.I. is , how many shots are fired , how much damage is caused , etc .
There are a couple of terms applied to music that can also be applied to pacing :
Legato -- long and smooth flowing .
-- long and smooth flowing .
Staccato - short and detached .
Texture
Texture can be used to describe the complexity of what is happening at a given point .
A rich texture may be a sequence of gameplay that has many different things happening all at once .
However , gameplay with too much complexity can become disordered and unreadable .
Sometimes a simple texture can be more pleasing .
There are several musical terms that can be applied :
Monophony - single notes at a time , or in the case of gameplay , single mechanics used one at a time .
- single notes at a time , or in the case of gameplay , single mechanics used one at a time .
Homophonic -- using harmonies , such as chords on a single melody .
This would be the use of mechanics that work well together in defined patterns .
-- using harmonies , such as chords on a single melody .
This would be the use of mechanics that work well together in defined patterns .
Polyphonic -- multiple melodies playing at the same time .
This would be extremely complex scenarios in terms of gameplay , where different gameplay elements are occurring in their own patterns .
This would be fairly rare without being a complete mess .
-- multiple melodies playing at the same time .
This would be extremely complex scenarios in terms of gameplay , where different gameplay elements are occurring in their own patterns .
This would be fairly rare without being a complete mess .
Heterophonic -- the same melody is being played with slight variations at the same time .
This is more likely to be workable than a polyphonic scenario , as it would be more readable in terms of what is going on .
Case Study : Call of Duty 4 " All Ghillied Up "
As an example of how pace could be controlled in a game I examined a video of one of the best levels in one of my favorite games .
The level is really a master class in forced pacing -- I suspect that most people 's playthrough times are very similar -- certainly for earlier parts of the level .
( Click here to watch . )
This study examines a small 10 minute section of the beginning of the level , showing how the threat , tension , movement impetus and tempo change quickly over the course of the scenario .
The level uses the very clever tactic of a scripted AI buddy to literally drive the pace at every moment during the gameplay .
It is n't generally possible to do this in most level designs , but it is a very efficient method of controlling the pace .
Throughout the whole of this 10 minute section the tempo is never extremely high , as there is little in the way of fast paced action until much later in the level , but the pace was maintained constantly by having either threat , tension or movement impetus high at every point .
There are constantly repeating gameplay elements throughout ( as there always tends to be in FPS games ) -- movement to a point , then waiting before eliminating a threat , returning to movement once complete ( which could quite easily be described as Tremolo -- rapid alternation between two mechanics ) .
0:18 -- Arrival
Threat : Low
Tension : Medium
Movement Impetus : High
Tempo : Average
Obstacle up ahead -- " too much radiation we 'll have to go around "
Tells you to follow him -- he is now leading you through the first part of the level , we have forced pacing -- he moves pretty quickly , but gives us information as we move .
0:40 -- First Contact
Threat : Medium
Tension : High
Movement Impetus : Low
Tempo : Low
He stops and the movement impetus slows for a moment , however the pace is still high as there is tension -- they make visual contact with the enemy .
They now creep slowly ahead ; whilst there is forced pacing the movement impetus is low .
The perceived threat is high however , so it feels high paced and tense .
Option is then offered to take out one of the two guards when not looking .
This slows the pace right down as the player observes and formulates a plan .
1:29 -- Move Up
Threat : Low
Tension : Medium
Movement Impetus : High
Tempo : Average
The target is eliminated ; suddenly the obstacle has been cleared .
The AI buddy now instructs the player to move , the movement impetus picks up again .
1:40 -- Go Around
Threat : High
Tension : Medium
Movement Impetus : Medium
Tempo : Low
The player is told to " hold up " .
Suddenly our movement impetus has stopped .
Again the tension rises as the perceived danger increases .
Movement impetus is started again as he instructs them to go around to use more cover , but we have seen the enemy so our perceived threat is now really high .
1:53 -- Four Tangos
Threat : High
Tension : Medium
Movement Impetus : Low
Tempo : Low
A real threat is presented to the player -- four enemies inside a building in extremely close proximity .
The perceived danger is very high , but your AI buddy instructs you not to engage .
Whilst you are engaged in this dilemma another guard approaches outside .
You are offered the choice to take him out or let him pass -- again the pace slows as the player takes time to make the decision .
2:15 -- Go
Threat : Low
Tension : Low
Movement Impetus : High
Tempo : Average
Once the threat has been removed then the pace picks up again as the movement impetus is raised yet again by the AI buddy .
This pace is quite staccato however , as he stops by a set of cover for a moment before continuing .
2:35 -- Guard in the Tower
Threat : High
Tension : High
Movement Impetus : Low
Tempo : Average
Again they stop as the AI buddy spots the enemy in the tower and a patrol closing in .
This is effectively a timed challenge -- forcing a change of pace and heightening the perceived threat .
However the player is forced to make a plan and may take a while to reach a decision .
Once the guard in the tower is taken out again the pace slows as they have the option to take out the patrolling guard or let him pass .
3:12 -- On the move again
Threat : Low
Tension : Low
Movement Impetus : High
Tempo : Average
Once the obstacle is removed they are again on the move in a staccato fashion .
Some items near the car slow the player for a moment as he takes a second to decide if he wants to take the items or not .
They speed up and again slow as they enter the building .
They move pretty quickly through the building , and the " coast is clear " command increases the movement impetus out into the field beyond .
3:45 -- Helicopter
Threat : High
Tension : High
Movement Impetus : Very Low
Tempo : Low
The movement impetus from the previous section is suddenly halted as they reach the gate , as an enemy helicopter passes overhead .
The perceived threat is however severely raised by this event .
4:06 -- Let's Go
Threat : Low
Tension : Low
Movement Impetus : High
Tempo : Average
Again they are on the move once the threat has disappeared .
This is now a fairly long section of high movement impetus in comparison to what has been seen previously .
It nicely relieves the tension for a moment .
However , it turns out to be the calm before the storm .
4:24 -- Enemy Patrol
Threat : Very High
Tension : Very High
Movement Impetus : Very Low
Tempo : Low
This tension is suddenly ramped up massively as a large patrolling group of enemies with vehicles heads directly towards them -- emphasized by the dramatic change in music .
Perceived danger is extremely high as it appears to be certain death if they are spotted .
Movement impetus is slowed and eventually reduced to virtually nil , as the player formulates their strategy to try and evade the incoming patrol .
The enemy proximity makes for extremely tense gameplay as they edge ever closer to your position .
As they move past the tension starts to subside as you realize that they have n't spotted you .
The movement impetus to get away from the enemy threat rises dramatically .
6:05 -- Move Slow
Threat : Medium
Tension : Medium
Movement Impetus : Medium
Tempo : Low
Even though the patrol has passed the movement impetus is kept low as the AI Buddy instructs the player to move slowly .
There is still a large perceived danger of being spotted .
Tension starts to fade as you hear the sounds of the patrol moving away behind you .
6:55 -- The Lake
Threat : Medium
Tension : Medium
Movement Impetus : Medium
Tempo : Low
Again movement impetus is raised as they are now out of visual range .
The AI Buddy picks up the tempo as they move onwards , but this is a very short distance before they reach another obstacle .
They sneak around to another point before stopping .
Here the pace is slowed as he offers the player a choice to either take them out or sneak past them .
The player takes time to decide .
If they take the shot the pace is again forced as the AI buddy instructs the player to wait until he gets into position before they take out the next targets .
Once it is time for the player to take their shot there is again a good period of time in which to make their decision .
8:33 -- Onwards
Threat : Low
Tension : Low
Movement Impetus : High
Tempo : Average
They are on the move again -- having had some pretty slow moving sections this fast movement lasts a little while to give a nice sense of relief .
8:55 -- Stay Back
Threat : Medium
Tension : Medium
Movement Impetus : Medium
Tempo : Average
Yet again however movement impetus is halted as they move up right behind an enemy in very close proximity .
The tension is raised dramatically .
The pace is forced as the AI buddy declares that he will take out the enemy -- the player will generally wait and watch .
After a very short section of forward movement he again stops the player instructing them to wait as he moves forwards .
The tension is increased as he informs the player of a patrol coming their way .
They hear the patrol approaching slowly before he is taken out by the AI Buddy .
Conclusion
Pace is talked about a lot in regard to game design , but it is still poorly defined -- searching the internet for relevant topics brings up virtually nothing .
As we develop as an industry we need more critical analysis of our work .
Whilst we can easily develop our own terminology and draw our own conclusions , it is worth examining other fields of cultural analysis and apply them to our field .
Perhaps we could even adapt musical notation to some form of written system to define the pacing of a game ?
I believe there is plenty more that can be discovered about pacing in games -- certainly some more scientific studies of heart rate , etc whilst playing games might unearth some real revelations about what makes the pace in games so emotionally involving and also what simply does not work .

After six months , those who stopped taking the Pill at the beginning of the test still had about twice the normal SHBG levels .
This was also the case for many after a year .
UV rays in sunbeds can be up to 10 times stronger than the sun
The number of people with skin cancer in Northern Ireland has trebled in the past decade according to the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry ( NICR ) .
The figures reflect increased over - exposure of skin to damaging UV rays from sun bathing and using sunbeds .
Experts will meet on Wednesday in Lisburn to discuss what to do about the increasing rates and how to control the public 's use of sunbeds .
The NICR shows that in 2006 , 259 of melanoma cases were recorded .
MELANOMA
The most serious form of skin cancer Sun exposure is the main - and most preventable - risk factor Around one third of melanomas develop from normal moles
The rest develop on areas of previously normal skin Warning signs include :
Two halves of a mole do not look the same
The edges of the mole are irregular , blurred or jagged
Colour is uneven , with more than one shade
Mole is wider than 6 mm Jonathan Guy , a vet from Ballynahinch , was one of those cases .
He felt that he was not at risk of skin cancer as he had never actively sunbathed .
However , in the summer of 1998 , Mr Guy noticed a mole on his right leg .
" I could feel it for the first time , it was raised above the surface of the skin , it was also a bit crusty and inflamed looking . "
Fortunately for Mr Guy , his wife is a GP and she insisted he got it checked out by a dermatologist .
Taking his wife 's advice meant that doctors caught the malignant melanoma in the early stages and Mr Guy was treated accordingly .
It is this awareness and urgency that Professor Roy Waters , the Chair of COMARE ( Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment ) sunbed sub - group , would like to see more widespread in the UK .
He said : " The publicity and the public awareness of the dangers of associated with exposure to solar UV , albeit from the sun or from sunbeds is not well described in the UK .
Melanoma is a particularly aggressive form of cancer " We know emphatically that exposure to high doses of solar UV can increase the incidents of melanoma and other skin cancers .
" We really have to increase public awareness in a dramatic way in the next few years . "
At the conference he will be presenting a resume of the COMARE report on sunbed legislation in the UK .
The resume shows that with the exception of Scotland , the UK is currently lagging behind a number of Western countries in not having legislation regarding sunbed facilities .
However , the good news is that people in Northern Ireland have among the best survival rates for skin cancer in Europe , with 98.8 % of patients alive one year after being diagnosed .

For years , the CIA has flown killer drones over Pakistan – without giving local authorities much say in how or where the aircraft operate .
But there 's been a major shift in the unmanned war over Pakistan , the Los Angeles Times reports .
Two shifts , really .
First , Pakistani and American military officers have begun jointly operating a set of American Predator and Reaper unmanned planes .
Second , those aircraft are from the U.S. Air Force 's remotely - piloted squadrons , not the CIA's .
This shift from spy drones to military drones could have important consequences in the air war over Pakistan , and the larger struggle against Islamic extremists in the region .
Under a new partnership with Pakistani Government , the Times ' Julian Barnes and Greg Miller write , this " separate fleet of U.S. drones operated by the Defense Department will be free for the first time to venture beyond the Afghan border under the direction of Pakistani military officials , who are working alongside American counterparts at a command center in Jalalabad , Afghanistan . "
Pakistani officers previously have been able to see footage from the Predators ' high - powered cameras .
Now the military men are being given " significant control over routes , targets and decisions to fire weapons . "
The CIA drones will continue to " focus on the United States ' principal target , Al Qaeda .
The military drones , however , are intended to undermine the militant networks that have moved closer to Islamabad , the capital , in recent weeks . "
The underscores an expansion of the Obama administration 's military aims in the region .
No longer is this fight solely about " defeat[ing ]
Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan , " as the President said two months ago .
The war 's goals now include keeping Islamabad from being overrun by a distinct , but related , group of homegrown extremists .
The Air Force drones now being employed against those militants are now presumably subject to the oversight of the lawyers , intelligence analysts , and targeting specialists at the U.S. military 's Combined Air and Space Operations Center ( CAOC ) .
Such reviews could cut down on the unmanned strikes ' civilian casualties – as well as the popular and political resistance to the attacks .
But the greater hesitancy to use the drones ' arrays of Hellfire missiles and laser - guided bombs may allow militant targets to get away , unscathed .
Already , " some U.S. officials have expressed frustration that the Pakistanis have not used the Predator capabilities more aggressively .
Officials said Pakistan was given the authority to order strikes on the jointly operated flights as long as there was U.S. agreement on the targets , " the Times says .
Pakistan also " declined an offer to use the drones for its recent military offensives in the Swat Valley and Buner areas , and poor weather has caused other sorties to be scrapped . "
Until now , " the heavy U.S. military presence in Afghanistan has been largely powerless to pursue the Islamic extremists who routinely escape into Pakistan , " Barnes and Miller notes .
Largely – but not entirely .
There have been cross - border raids by special forces .
And occasionally , the Air Force 's Predators and Reapers * are * allowed to enter Pakistani airspace – with Islamabad 's explicit permission .
Yesterday , Danger Room examined the possibility that the new American commander in Afghanistan might look to expand operations into Pakistan .
Looks like that already happened .

Pittsburgh shooter was fan of online conspiracy theories Muriel Kane

The unemployed twenty - two year old man who killed three Pittsburgh police officers and wounded two others in a four - hour shootout on Saturday morning had been heavily influenced by extremist conspiracy theories prior to the incident .
According to the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette , Richard Poplawski was " convinced the nation was secretly controlled by a cabal that would eradicate freedom of speech , take away his guns and use the military to enslave the citizenry .
...
He appeared to share a belief that the government was controlled from unseen forces , that troops were being shipped home from the Mideast to police the citizenry here , and that Jews secretly ran the country . "
Some of Poplawski's beliefs are fairly commonplace among conservatives .
For example , fears that the Obama administration intends to ban gun ownership have recently become a staple on such relatively mainstream outlets as Glenn Beck 's program on Fox News .
However , many of his ideas appear to have come from more obscure sources .
Poplawski's best friend , Edward Perkovic , told the Post - Gazette , " He was really into politics and really into the First and Second amendment .
...
We recently discovered that 30 states had declared sovereignty .
One of his concerns was why were these major events in America not being reported to the public . "
Perkovic was apparently referring to the so - called " sovereign state movement , " promoted by the Tenth Amendment Center , which presents secession as a reasonable response to federal gun laws and the power of the Federal Reserve and has recently encouraged legislators in a number of states to introduce resolutions reaffirming states rights .
Poplawski had also posted pictures of himself at Stormfront , a white supremacist website whose slogan is " white pride worldwide . "
The discussion of the shootings at Stormfront , which began with speculations that the gunman would turn out to be " some non-white " or " a jew , " then turned to suspicions that the recent rash of shootings is a " setup " to push through gun control legislation , has become oddly muted since the revelation that Poplawski appears to be one of theirs .

[ This memorial for Henry Hazlitt originally appeared in The Free Market , September 1993 , Volume 11 , Number 9 . ]
Old Right journalist Garet Garrett described the New Deal as a revolution against America 's tradition of private property , limited government , and the rule of law .
Indeed , it had all the earmarks .
President Roosevelt ran against government spending and deficits but , once in office , acted like a dictator .
Roosevelt overthrew the traditional limits on government 's role and instituted central planning and welfarism in every sector of the economy .
Then the statist juggernaut could n't be stopped : next came FDR's war socialism , Truman 's unionism , Johnson 's Great Society , Nixon 's price controls , Carter 's inflation , Reagan 's deficit spending , Bush 's regulation , and Clinton 's Fabianism .
Because ideas matter as much as the lust for power , the New Deal could n't have happened without a public intellectual justification .
That entailed theories on the causes of the stock - market crash and the economic downturn that followed .
In order for socialism to prevail in the United States , the academy and the public had to be convinced that capitalism had failed .
Henry Hazlitt was at the center of that debate , holding forth in the pages of The Nation , a sophisticated and trendy fortnightly .
He was hired as literary editor , a relatively nonpolitical position .
But as the politics of the day became more contentious , he was afforded more editorial latitude .
He began to write against federal encroachment on private enterprise .
Once Roosevelt reversed his campaign rhetoric and embraced the total state , The Nation editors knew they had to take a stand .
As Hazlitt 's criticisms of FDR grew , so did the internal complaints about Hazlitt 's philosophy .
Rather than simply fire their editor of two years , they scheduled a knockdown , drag - out fight between those who said capitalism had failed ( thereby making socialism the answer ) and those who said interventionism had failed and that capitalism was the answer .
In one corner was Hazlitt , literary critic and financial journalist .
In the other was Louis Fischer , Russian émigré , journalist , and socialist .
The exchange , " Depression and the Profit System , " ran in the May 24 , 1933 , issue , in the midst of FDR 's monetary and fiscal revolution .
" In order for socialism to prevail in the United States , the academy and the public had to be convinced that capitalism had failed . "
Fischer adopted a Marxian explanation of the Depression .
Citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics , he argued that as productivity increased since the turn of the century , wages had declined relative to output .
Laborers then were able to purchase less and less of their product because capitalists were skimming their surplus value .
What triggered the crisis ?
Fischer explained it was a combination of Marxian crisis theory and Keynesian underconsumption theory : " People who wanted to consume all did not have the means , and the people who had the means could not consume all .
Hence our reduced purchasing power . "
What needs to be done ?
" Divide and redivide profits , " he said .
" That is the way out . "
There should be " provision for a perfectly equal division of surplus value in years to come " ; we should eliminate " the profit of the capital owner " and create " socialism . "
Hazlitt responded by showing Fischer 's figures on surplus value to be based on a " fallacy of selection . "
Fischer had picked base years ( 1899 and 1929 ) with a purpose in mind and then confused anomalies with a general trend .
Two could play that game ;
Hazlitt showed that labor 's product could be said to have been increasing relative to output by picking other years ( 1869 and 1921 ) .
Moreover , Hazlitt asked , if labor 's decreasing share of profits is the cause , how do we explain economic recoveries during the same period in question ?
How can we explain , using this reasoning , why the crisis did not come sooner ?
As Hazlitt said , Marx 's theory " makes it difficult to explain why we are not always in a crisis , and impossible to explain how we ever surmount one . "
On that basis , he dismissed the broader implication that the 1929 crash represented anything like a long - running trend in the structural basis of the economy .
But what if Fischer was right , that labor really was earning a smaller return relative to capital ?
Hazlitt noted this would not necessarily mean that people were being exploited .
It could just mean that the volume of capital in industry was increasing at a greater rate than that of labor , which indicates increasingly efficient technology .
If so , that might lend weight to the expectations of the classical economists that labor would own more capital as productivity increased .
For example , the number of stockholders increased dramatically during the 1920s .
Having dispensed with Fischer 's sweeping Marxian theory , he argued that the best period to examine from an economic point of view was the time " between the last crisis and the present one — the period , say , from 1922 to 1929 . "
In this period , one notices that the prices and output of capital and labor in the industrial sector were growing out of proportion to the agricultural sector .
That may not have any significance to the cause of the crisis , but it brings into question the idea of economywide exploitation of labor .
Having exploded Fischer 's data and economic theory , he went on to speculate on an alternative .
There was no visible free - market theory on why the United States was in crisis .
But Hazlitt knew from his reading of history about the trouble that comes with an overactive and indebted government .
He knew the secret to the Crash resided with these problems .
A stable market order , he said , requires an atmosphere free of shocks — or at least a government that allows the economy to correct once those shocks had occurred .
The war had artificially inflated the prices of commodities and they needed to correct downward to a more realistic level .
He argued that the crisis of 1929 was that downward correction .
" But the focus of this collapse , " he wrote , " was aggravated enormously by the whole series of post - war policies . "
Among these he listed the " vicious Treaty of Versailles , " the " disorganization caused by reparations and war debts , " the " preposterous tariff barriers thrown up everywhere , " the abandonment of the gold standard and the adoption of the " gold - exchange standard , " and " reckless lending to foreign countries . "
" Hazlitt knew from his reading of history about the trouble that comes with an overactive and indebted government . "
Most importantly , he blamed the " artificial cheap - money policy pursued both in England and America , leading here to a colossal real - estate and stock - market speculation under the benign encouragement of Messrs .
Coolidge and Mellon . "
This malinvestment , caused by inflationary policies , created distortions in the capital stock that called for correction .
Later Hazlitt would conclude that malinvestment was the central problem , not only in the Great Depression , but in all business cycles .
He did so under the influence of Ludwig von Mises , whom he met about a decade later .
Together they advocated the gold standard and the " Austrian " theory of the business cycle .
The theory , developed by Mises , points to the way markets coordinate plans over time and the way central - bank money and credit expansion disrupt those plans .
Hazlitt was inclined to the Austrian theory even before he knew it formally .
It was most consistent with his manner of thinking .
As a literary critic , his specialty was exploding the pretensions of ideologues .
He loved picking up a fashionable academic text , dissecting its essential claims from overblown prose , and showing how patently absurd it was .
He had a gift in short for finding the essence of an argument and testing it relentlessly against standards of reason .
These are all traits the Austrian School carried with it since its birth in 19th - century Vienna — traits that had also been essential in the late Scholastic tradition of 16th - century Spain , which was indebted to Thomist and thus Aristotelian reasoning .
One patently absurd recommendation in Fischer 's essay , according to Hazlitt , was his call for high new taxes on capital .
This measure " would violently aggravate the catastrophe , " Hazlitt said , by causing business to take another downturn that would make the 1929 crash look trivial .
An increase in wages would be undesirable as well , Hazlitt said , because that would cause the cost to business to increase and lead to even more unemployment .
In order to make the economy recover , he said , we need more private capital , not less , and that means letting markets work .
More than anything , said Hazlitt , we do n't need socialism , communism , or " that ambiguous thing called Planning . "
Based on the type of people who would be in charge , and the nature of politics , he was sure the economy would be run by " economic illiterates , " people , he no doubt meant , like Louis Fischer .
Virtually everything Hazlitt wrote in this powerful essay — his analysis of cause , effect , and the solution — was later vindicated in the work of scholars like Murray Rothbard and Robert Higgs .
In his book Modern Times , Paul Johnson sketches the same scenario that Hazlitt laid out in the thick of the New Deal onslaught itself .
More recently , Richard Vedder and Lowell Gallaway presented essentially the same position in Out of Work .
Hazlitt might have been spared his job had his attack on the emerging consensus not been so complete and so devastating .
If he had made a few more concessions , or possibly not totally smashed Fischer , he might have lasted .
But it was not in Hazlitt 's nature to withhold the truth for the sake of expediency .
He must have sensed the end was near for his prestigious job at The Nation and decided to go out with a bang .
The dramatic debate between Fischer and Hazlitt ended with an ominous note from the editor : " The discussion … will be commented upon editorially in a forthcoming issue . "
Indeed , it was the next issue in which The Nation announced its devotion to the socialist cause .
" Mr. Roosevelt is attempting to preserve capitalism , " said the editorial , echoing conventional wisdom of the day , " to save it from itself by robbing it temporarily of several of its most fundamentally capitalistic prerogatives . "
If the New Deal passes , said the editors with rare insight , " he will have the power to tell industry what and how much it may produce , what it may charge for its products , how much it shall pay to labor , what hours labor shall work . "
But this was not enough for The Nation .
" We tend to agree " with Fischer , said the editors , " that a collective society offers the best hope for this desirable end . "
They favored a " move toward collectivism " as rapidly as possible .
Criticizing Roosevelt 's alleged timidity , they said the " country 's steps toward an integrated , socialized industrial society should be deliberate and purposeful . "
The pages of a magazine devoted largely to pushing progressive cultural reform had swung fully in favor of collectivism .
The esoteric doctrine had been made explicit for the first time , and Hazlitt was pushed out and forced to find other outlets for his work .
After his death , socialist propagandist Irving Howe , editor of Dissent , was eulogized again and again in the popular media , even though ( or possibly because ) his antiproperty , antibourgeois ideas were utterly alien to the pre–New Deal American experience .
This is even after the failure of socialism around the world .
Hazlitt was right many times over — about socialism , welfarism , inflation and the gold standard , popular culture , and much else .
And unlike Howe , Hazlitt wrote as clearly as he thought .
He never used his position to spread disinformation in the service of ideology , as Howe did ; Hazlitt had a profound faith in truth and let logic and facts speak for themselves .
It 's a measure of the corruption of official culture that the death of Henry Hazlitt was hardly noticed .
In his death , I feel sure , his greatest hope was that this country would realize the errors of its history and rectify them .
When our history is rewritten , and the Irving Howes are seen as the social menaces they were , Hazlitt will be remembered as a prophet who spoke truth to power .
The Nation , in a stunning reversal of socialist editorial policies , will concede that Hazlitt was right all along .

Once again my old security professor from college comes at me with some very useful information .
This time in the form of an awesome Linux tip .
He forwarded me a link to a post from Lifehacker who themselves mentioned a post in the Ubuntu Forums from a guy calling himself TheShiv TheShiv talked about how with the default Ubuntu installation there were a lot of pre-installed applications that he did not use that took up a lot of resources , and ultimately slowed the computer down more than it needed to .
Fed up with that he wrote a quick script to use after doing an install using Ubuntu Server edition or the Minimal CD .
With both of those , Ubuntu installs with just the terminal .
After your install you canTheShiv 's script which I made available here : ( Mini.sh
For example , after your install from the terminal do the following :
Now sit back , grab some coffee and wait for your Minimal Ubuntu install to be pulled down from the repositories to settle nicely on yourhard drive !
After installing all the minimal packages , now you can pull down only what you need as far as applications , and you do n't have any extras your do n't .
Doing this type of install saved TheShiv approximately 260 MB of typical memory usage .
I think I will be doing this for all future releases of Bauer - Puntu ;-) What kind of things do you do to optimize your Ubuntu ( Or other distro ) installation ?
Do you have special scripts of your own ?
Let us know in the comments !
The boss of BT 's corporate IT operation , where a dire performance has forced the telecoms company to axe 15,000 jobs and slash its dividend , pocketed more than £ 3.5 m in his last year , reigniting the furore over rewards for failure .
The award for François Barrault was branded as " outrageous " by union leaders and has forced BT to introduce a clawback scheme designed to prevent any director collecting a huge payout , despite the poor performance of their business , in the future .
Barrault was ousted in October last year as the dreadful performance of his business led to a monumental profit warning by BT .
The company attempted to prevent him collecting his cash and shares but after taking legal advice was forced to admit that his contract allowed the payout .
Last year Barrault received £ 1.25 m in salary and benefits such as his company car , home security , dental cover for his family and even his own financial counsellor .
It also included a housing allowance , school and social club fees .
There was a £ 1.6 m termination payment and he also collected £ 283,000 worth of shares under the company 's long - term incentive plan , £ 264,000 worth of shares under its deferred bonus plan and had £ 135,000 worth of unrealised gains on his share options .
Tonight a spokesman for the company admitted : " We are disappointed at having to make the payment to François but BT honours its legal and contractual obligations . "
Andy Kerr , deputy general secretary at the Communication Workers Union , was scathing about the award , which comes as BT introduces a company - wide salary freeze and is slashing contractor 's pay by as much as a third .
" François Barrault 's payoff is outrageous .
He is being rewarded for failure , " he said .
" This gives the wrong signal to staff at a time when they are being asked to make significant changes to the way they work . "
Once touted as the saviour of the telecoms company , BT Global Services made wildly over - optimistic projections of the potential profitability of a clutch of government and corporate contracts , including its involvement in the multibillion - pound upgrade of the NHS 's IT systems .
BT was last month forced to take a £ 1.6bn writedown in the value of the business and embark on an expensive restructuring .
The unit 's poor performance has created a cash squeeze at a time when BT needs to pump £ 525 m a year into its pension fund , the largest private - sector scheme in the UK , to cope with its widening deficit .
Shareholders , including hundreds of thousands of pensioners , have seen their dividend payout more than halved .
Barrault 's behaviour is in contrast to that of his replacement at BT Global Services , Hanif Lalani .
He was due a small bonus as a result of his previous work as finance director but has decided not to take it .
The chief executive , Ian Livingston , is likely to come under intense scrutiny for his decision to accept a £ 343,000 bonus for last year despite missing all the company 's targets .
His total award for last year was £ 1.17 m but he has pledged to use his bonus to buy BT shares .
The bonus , awarded as BT had met some of its customer service and environmental targets , is one of four given out for the year ending March 2009 , according to the company 's annual report and accounts published today .
Gavin Patterson , who replaced Livingston as head of BT Retail , picked up a £ 162,000 bonus , taking his pay to £ 698,000 , while new finance director Tony Chanmugam pocketed a £ 103,000 bonus , taking his pay to £ 275,000 .
The fourth BT executive to pick up a bonus was Ben Verwaayen , who quit as chief executive last summer and whose role in the creation of BT Global Services has come under scrutiny since the performance of the business has come to light .
Verwaayen pocketed more than half a million pounds for his last three months with the firm , including a £ 300,000 bonus .
Update : Also check out the sequel to this article : 10 Even Better Wolfram Alpha Easter Eggs .
If you have n't heard about it yet , the new computational search engine Wolfram Alpha launched this week to much fanfare and attention .
The service can calculate integrals , tell you the flying time between San Francisco and London , or even the ( lack of ) nutritional content of your M&M's .
But Stephen Wolfram and his team did n't stop there , and they certainly did n't lack a sense of humor when they built their Mathematica - based engine .
Slowly but surely , people have been finding some interesting quirks within Wolfram Alpha , triggered by specific questions or events .
These interesting easter eggs will make you smile or raise an eyebrow in bewilderment .
Know of some of Wolfram 's other easter eggs ?
Please share them with us in the comments .
1 . What is your name ?
Let 's start with a small but simple Easter Egg.
Ask Wolfram Alpha " What is your name ? " and it will return with you the correct answer .
You know , one of the first steps to self - awareness is self - identity ...
Bonus : Give Wolfram Alpha the quintessential computer greeting , " Hello , World . "
2 . What 's the speed of an unladen swallow ?
This easter egg , at least for me , was a very pleasant surprise .
There is a famous scene in the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail where a bridgekeeper asks King Arthur the speed of an unladen swallow .
His question back turns the tide and allows him to pass .
Well , Wolfram Alpha did n't miss this little bit of movie magic .
Ask Wolfram about the average speed of an unladen swallow ( does n't matter if it 's African or not ) , and Wolfram will give you the non-answer you 're looking for .
It even cites the source .
Clever .
3. Hello
One of the simplest and most common greetings in the human language gets you a unique response from the computational knowledge engine .
Just say " Hello " to Wolfram Alpha , and it'll say , " Hello , human . "
Other common greetings like " What 's up ? , " " Hi "
Is this just Wolfram being polite , or is the advanced search program talking to us condescendingly ?
This might be something we have to investigate further .
Bonus : Wolfram also goes beyond " Hello " in conversation .
Some more questions to ask it :
" Can you help me ? " " Where are you ? " " How are you ? "
" What will you do ? " " What are you ? "
" What do you not like ? "
4 . How many roads must a man walk down before you can call him a man ?
We 're glad to know that Wolfram Alpha knows his Bob Dylan .
5 . How to cook a Welshman ?
The answer ... clearly speaks for itself ...
6 . Where am I ?
If you ever find yourself on a random island one morning with just you and a computer , feel comforted knowing that Wolfram Alpha knows where you are .
Seriously , just ask it the question and its magic ( or your IP address ) will do the rest .
7 . Why did the chicken cross the road ?
Did I mention that Wolfram also can crack a joke or two ?
8 . What 's the answer to life ?
In Google , if you ask the question " What is the answer to life , the universe , and everything ? , " you will get a very special answer from the search engine .
Well guess what ?
Wolfram knows the true answer to this very important question as well .
I wo n't spoil the answer for you , though .
Unfortunately , when I asked Wolfram about the question to life , it was stumped .
Hopefully future versions will get us this information as well and initiate an era of peace on Earth .
9. P = NP
For those of you that are not computer science geeks or programming nerds , P = NP is one of the most persistent unsolved questions within computer science .
You can learn more about it on Wikipedia , but the point is n't that Wolfram has the answer , but that Wolfram is working on the problem .
So , if you want to receive the answer as soon as Wolfram knows , just leave your email with the computational engine .
That 's just nifty .
10 . I can't let you do that , Dave
This easter egg is different than all the rest .
If Wolfram is overloaded with traffic or just not working properly , it will let you know .
The creepy thing , though , is how it lets you know .
Is HAL secretly running Wolfram ?
Are we going to have to pull the plug on Wolfram to save ourselves ?
Have you caught the 2001 : A Space Odyssey reference yet ?
Bonus : Easter Eggs that Wolfram should learn
Although our look into Wolfram popped up some great easter eggs , there are a few we are looking for yet .
Some of them :
" Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego ? "
" When is Judgement Day ? " ( Terminator reference ) " Dude , where 's my car ? "
How long until Wolfram can answer all of our silly questions and subtle references ?
It 's probably sooner than we all think .
Do you have any other things you think Wolfram should already know ?

Pro-government forces in Somalia have launched a major attack against Islamist militants controlling parts of the capital , Mogadishu .
The forces said they had made some progress during fierce clashes - a claim denied by the opposition leader .
At least 36 people were killed and some 180 wounded , medical sources say .
Supporters of the transitional government - which is recognised by the UN - lost control of about one - third of the city to the militants last week .
Bitter fighting
Ten days of fierce clashes between the pro-government forces and militant Islamic groups - al - Shabab and Hisbul - Islam - have left more than 100 people dead and displaced about 50,000 civilians .
This is a large military offensive against violent people
Farhan Mahdi Mohamed
Military spokesman
Somali justice - Islamist - style Q&A : Somalia 's conflict
The death toll from Friday 's fighting could be as high as 45 , Reuters news agency reported .
The BBC's Mohamed Olad Hassan in Mogadishu says most of the fighting is focusing on one of the city 's main routes , Wadnaha Road .
" This is a large military offensive against violent people , " military spokesman Farhan Mahdi Mohamed told AFP news agency .
" The government will sweep them out of the capital and the fighting will continue until that happens . "
The pro-government forces said later on Friday they had made some progress against the militants and then retreated for strategic reasons .
But opposition leader Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys said his fighters had been holding ground after repelling the attack .
African Union peacekeepers based in the capital to support the fragile administration are not involved in the attack , our correspondent says .
The 4,300 - strong force does not have a mandate to pursue the insurgents .
A moderate Islamist President , Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , was elected by a unity government in January as part of a UN - backed peace initiative .
But even his introduction of Sharia law to the strongly Muslim country has not appeased the hardline guerrillas , who are accused of links to al - Qaeda .
Somalia has been mired in conflict for 18 years .
California 's failed video game censorship law is headed to the Supreme Court .
The bill , which was passed by the state assembly in 2005 with the support of Governor Schwarzenegger , aimed to criminalize the sale of violent video games to minors .
It was promptly challenged in court by the Entertainment Software Association ( ESA ) , a video game industry trade group .
After the US District Court threw it out Governor Schwarzenegger sought an appeal , which was rejected by the 9th Circuit .
Schwarzenegger announced on Wednesday that he wo n't back down and intends to take it to the Supreme Court .
The courts have consistently rejected laws that restrict video game sales .
Such laws are fundamentally in conflict with the First Amendment rights that are guaranteed by the Constitution .
Despite the evident futility of defending these laws in court , states have attempted to do so and have paid the price .
When the states lose , the courts inevitably order them to foot the bill for the ESA 's legal fees .
This costly burden on taxpayers collectively adds up to well over a million dollars .
Although there have been 12 rulings over the past eight years affirming that video games are protected speech and cannot be censored , the issue has yet to be reviewed by the Supreme Court .
California 's law is the first to be appealed this far , largely because other states decided to cut their losses and avoid further embarrassing and costly defeat .
California , however , is determined to fight the losing battle all the way to the last level .
" I signed this important measure to ensure parents are involved in determining which video games are appropriate for their children , " Schwarzenegger said in a statement .
" By prohibiting the sale of violent video games to children under the age of 18 and requiring these games to be clearly labeled , this law would allow parents to make better informed decisions for their kids .
I will continue to vigorously defend this law and protect the well - being of California 's kids . "
The ESA has responded , contending that California 's effort to instate the censorship law is wasteful and ultimately doomed to failure .
" California 's citizens should see this for what it is — a complete waste of the state 's time and resources , " he said in a statement .
" We are confident that this appeal will meet the same fate as the State 's previous failed efforts to regulate what courts around the country have uniformly held to be expression that is fully protected by the First Amendment . "
California is facing an unprecedented budgetary crisis and is struggling with an enormous deficit which could soon necessitate deep cuts across all state services .
In the face of these challenges , it is troubling that California is throwing more money away to defend flawed legislation .
Unless the state can raid some coins from Bowser 's lair to cover the cost , this is looking like an awfully misguided use of limited states resources .

' We acknowledge , " the letter says , " that violence has claimed the lives of many thousands of Iraqi civilians over the last five years , either through terrorism or sectarian violence .
Any loss of innocent lives is tragic and the Government is committed to ensuring that civilian casualties are avoided .
Insurgents and terrorists are not , I regret to say , so scrupulous . "
This quotation comes from the Ministry of Defence 's " Iraq Operations Team , Directorate of Operations " and is signed by someone whose initials may be " SM " or " SW " or even " SWe " .
Unusually ( but understandably ) , it does not carry a typed version of the author 's name .
Its obvious anonymity – given the fact that not a single reference is made to the civilians slaughtered by the Anglo - American invasion and occupation of Iraq – is no surprise .
I , too , would not want to be personally associated with such Blair - like mendacity .
What is astonishing , however , is that this outrageous letter should have been written this year .
I should say at once that I owe this revelatory text ( actually dated 20 January ) to a very un-anonymous Independent reader , Tom Geddes , who thought I would find its " economy with the truth " interesting .
I certainly do .
We are now , are we not , supposed to be in the age of Brown - like truth , as we finally haul down the flag in Basra , of near - certainty of an official inquiry into the whole Iraq catastrophe , a time of reckoning for the men who sent us off to war under false pretences .
I suspect that this – like the Obama pretensions to change – is a falsehood .
Well , we shall see .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Geddes , I hasten to add , is a retired librarian who worked for 21 years at the British Library as head of Germanic collections and is also a translator of Swedish – it turns out that we share the same love of the Finnish - Swedish poet Edith Sodergrund 's work – and he wrote to the Ministry of Defence at the age of 64 because , like me ( aged 62 ) , he was struck that John Hutton , the Secretary of State for Defence , described those who jeered at British troops returning home as " cretins " .
" Such jeering is clearly not meant to denigrate individual bravery and sacrifice , " Geddes wrote to Hutton on 28 October – readers will notice it took the Ministry of Defence 's " SM " ( or " SW " or " SWe " ) three months to reply – " ( but ) is a political comment on the general dubious legality and morality of recent military actions . "
I 'm not so sure the jeering was that innocent , but Geddes 's concluding remark – that " unless you or the Government can explain and justify Britain 's war activities , you cannot expect to have the country on your side " – is unimpeachable .
Not so " SM's " reply .
Here is another quotation from his execrable letter .
" It is important to remember that our decision to take action ( sic ) in Iraq was driven by Saddam Hussein 's refusal to co-operate with the UN - sponsored weapons inspections ...
The former Prime Minister has expressed his regret for any information , given in good faith , concerning weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , which has subsequently proven to be incorrect . "
I am left breathless by this lie .
Saddam Hussein did not " refuse to co-operate " with the UN weapons inspectors .
The whole problem was that – to the horror of Blair and Bush – the ghastly Saddam did co-operate with them , and the UN weapons team under Hans Blix was about to prove that these " weapons of mass destruction " were non-existent ; hence the Americans forced Blix and his men and women to leave Iraq so that they and Blair could stage their illegal invasion .
I saw Blix 's aircraft still on the ground at Baghdad airport just two days before the attack .
Note , too , the weasel words .
Blair did not give his information " in good faith " , as SM claims .
He knew – and the Ministry of Defence knew ( and I suppose SM knew ) – they were untrue .
Or " incorrect " as " SM " coyly writes .
Then again : " We can assure you that the Government would not have engaged in military action if it were not satisfied that such a decision was justified and lawful .
The former Attorney General , Lord Goldsmith , confirmed on 17 March 2003 that authority to use force against Iraq existed from the combined effect of UN Security Council Resolutions 678 , 687 and 1441 . "
But as an outraged Tom Geddes points out in his reply to this remark , " You must be aware that the decision to wage war on Iraq was neither justified nor lawful .
The Attorney General 's advice has been widely described as ' flawed ' .
Given that his previous advice was that an attack would be unlawful , we all know what ' flawed ' means .
I suspect the MoD ( Ministry of Defence ) also knows . "
So do I .
I 'm also sure that this is a standard " reply sheet " , sent out to all dissenting English people .
The sentence " millions of Iraqis now live free of Saddam 's oppression and have control of their own destiny " is pure public relations – not least because it fails to mention that up to a million Iraqis have not been able to control their own destiny since 2003 because they happen to be dead as a result of our invasion .
There 's a lovely bit at the end of " SM'S " 's letter where he ( or I suppose it could be a she ) says that " our brave servicemen and women ... are ... preparing Basra airport for transfer to Iraqi control ... "
Well of course they are , because – since their own retreat from Basra city -- Basra airport is the only square mile of Iraq in which the British are still in occupation .
The letter ends with " SM'S " 's surely sublime hope that this " letter goes some way to addressing your concerns " and I can only repeat Tom Geddes ' reply : " I am grateful for the length of your response , but shocked by its contents . "
So am I .
No doubt , when the Brown Government – or the Cameron government – holds its inquiry into this illegal war , " SM " will re-emerge as a witness or at least a spokesperson .
By then , I suppose the " Iraqi Operations Team " will have been closed down – even , perhaps , by then transmogrified into the " Afghanistan Operations Team " with a parallel set of historical lies – but I trust there will be a retired librarian on hand to point this out .

Alcohol rehab center North Carolina Recovery from alcohol can be hard to achieve with success .
Severe alcoholism will often require medical alcohol detox to ensure the alcoholic is medically assisted so after he can undergo an alcohol treatment in North Carolina .
Once he has become physically addicted to alcohol the person is in a situation whereby stopping his drinking of alcohol can kill him while continuing to drink alcohol will also kill him .
Alcohol detoxification is a severe and serious procedure .
The condition is called " delirium tremens " or D.Ts .
This is when the individual is physically addicted to alcohol and he stops his use of alcohol and becomes delirious and not aware of his environment .
He will often have severe panic attacks with uncontrolled tremors which can translate to full blown grand mal seizures .
Beside the risks associated with stopping alcohol , sobriety worth every single rough time that someone can go during the detox .
The above are potential dangers associated on the road to sobriety and often this is the lion 's share of the work associated with alcohol rehab treatment .
Once the individual is stabilized , intensive alcohol addiction treatment is required to help him to come back to a rational look of his or her alcohol addiction and as in any type of addiction to drugs or alcohol he must find the underlying causes of his alcoholism if he wishes to experience long lasting stable success with the exception of the serious health risks associated with his alcohol addiction .
From drug addiction to alcoholism , there are normally very similar situation but just different drugs and different withdrawal symptoms .
We can help you to find the most suitable North Carolina alcohol treatment for a loved one or for yourself .
Drug Trends North Carolina
Drug situation : North Carolina has experienced a significant increase in drug trafficking activity , some of it due to a recent influx of Mexican nationals into the state .
Since 1980 , Raleigh 's Hispanic population of immigrants grew 1,189 percent , or by an estimated 72,580 immigrants .
Also , since 1980 , Charlotte 's Hispanic population of immigrants grew 962 percent , or an estimated 77,092 immigrants .
Greensboro's Hispanic immigrants grew 962 percent as well , or by an estimated 62,210 immigrants .
These figures are only estimates due to the difficulty in identifying the number of immigrants located throughout the state with illegal residency .
While the immigrants themselves may not be involved in trafficking , their presence allows traffickers from Mexico to hide within ethnic Mexican communities .
They most commonly transport and distribute cocaine , marijuana , and methamphetamine .
In addition , the rapid population growth in areas such as Raleigh has resulted in additional crime , including an increase in drug trafficking activity .
Cocaine : North Carolina is a transshipment point to states to the North , including Virginia , West Virginia , Pennsylvania , New York and others .
The state continues to be a destination state for cocaine .
It is readily available because major traffickers take advantage of the state 's interstate highways , which are major transshipment routes for cocaine being transported from source areas to other states .
These major source areas are California , Colorado , Arizona and Texas , with major sources of supply being traffickers based in Mexico .
Cocaine is usually shipped in private or rental vehicles .
Cocaine loads arriving in North Carolina by organized Mexican organizations are used to supply crack distribution networks that further present enormous social threat to North Carolina 's inner city communities .
Heroin : Heroin use and availability is relatively low in North Carolina .
Many areas of the state , such as Greensboro , Durham , Greenville , and Wilmington , report that heroin abuse has been limited to a small population and is consistently low .
However , it appears that heroin use and availability is rising in other portions of the state .
Heroin treatment North Carolina Charlotte and parts of the western region of North Carolina are reporting an upswing in heroin use and a correlating increase in heroin overdose deaths .
In August 2002 , the Charlotte DO initiated a heroin investigation after an inquiry from the Athens Country Office .
In September 2002 , the Wilmington RO responded to a Pipeline seizure of 4.319 kilograms of heroin destined for New York .
Mexican supplied heroin is increasing throughout North Carolina .
Meth rehab North Carolina : : Methamphetamine cases have been on the rise in some parts of North Carolina , such as Raleigh , Charlotte , and Greensboro ; however , rural communities in many counties of the western part of the state have experienced a surge in methamphetamine trafficking .
The primary sources are located in West Coast states , principally California and Arizona , but a significant supply also derives from Mexican traffickers in northern Georgia , e.g. Gainsville and Dalton .
Ethnic Mexican traffickers from these states have been identified as the clandestine manufacturers and sources of supply for methamphetamine in multi-pound quantities .
Recent evidence suggests that North Carolina may be contributing to the national supply of the drug , as several methamphetamine laboratories seized in the West Coast of the United States were supplied with pseudoephedrine produced by a Hickory , N.C. - based company .
During the fourth quarter FY 02 , the Greensboro RO participated in a controlled delivery to the Philadelphia Field Division of 30 pounds of methamphetamine from Winston - Salem .
In addition , small clandestine labs within the state are also producing methamphetamine .
There is some indication that , because of enforcement efforts in Tennessee and Georgia , small lab chemists are setting up in North and South Carolina .
In FY 02 , total seizures in North Carolina ( State and local plus DEA ) were 20 , a 62 percent increase over the previous year .
Club Drugs : The Club Drugs that are most popular in North Carolina are MDMA , GHB and LSD .
The use of Dangerous Drugs has increased in popularity across the state and is especially popular with college and high - school aged people .
With more than 50 four - year colleges and universities in North Carolina , there is a large potential market for club drugs .
Marijuana : Marijuana is one of the most prevalent drugs in North Carolina and its availability is increasing .
One cause is the recent rise in the availability of Mexican marijuana due to an influx of Mexican trafficking organizations executing smuggling operations in to the state directly from Mexico via containerized cargo transported by tractor - trailer trucks , particularly in the central portion ( Piedmont ) of the state .
In addition , marijuana is being smuggled in ever - larger amounts via campers , pickup trucks , and larger vehicles .
Over the past three years , Domestic Cannabis Eradication Suppression program authorities have seized domestically grown marijuana in increasing quantities , Specifically , 2000 seizures were 40,464 plants , 2001 seizures were 89,900 plants , and 2002 seizures were 112,017 plants .
Other Drugs : Ecstasy ( MDMA ) is also a problem , although not posing equivalent threat to most North Carolina communities as is cocaine , methamphetamine and marijuana .
Domestic intelligence gleaned from local and state agencies in North Carolina indicate that Ecstasy use is on the rise , arriving from trafficking networks in New York , Florida and California .
Most prominently distributed in larger cities and along the coastal communities , such as beach cities attracting tourist populations , authorities are targeting ecstasy distributors and their out - of - state sources of supply .
Regarding illegal pharmaceuticals , in FY 2002 the Greensboro Diversion Group has noted continued criminal activity and investigated a prescription fraud ring .
This investigation led to the arrest of 20 violators who had been trafficking hundreds of thousands of dosage units of OxyContin , Valium , and Xanax , purchasing them with Medicaid cards .
Of the major abused prescription drugs , OxyContin is most prominent due to its highly addictive nature and use as a pain managing analgesic medication by the health care industry .
In FY 2002 and 2003 , authorities have observed several overdose deaths by OxyContin abuse in North Carolina and South Carolina .
There has been an increase in the use of LSD in the Charlotte area .
The majority of users of the drug are in the 15 to 25 year old category caught up in the " Rave " subculture .
Law enforcement agencies have identified individuals with ties to the Pacific Northwest or West Coast regions of the country distributing bulk quantities of LSD .
North Carolina is a Southern U.S. state in the United States , also considered a Mid-Atlantic state in some cases .
It is bordered by South Carolina on the south , Georgia on the southwest , Tennessee on the west , Virginia on the north , and the Atlantic Ocean on the east .
The state was originally named for King Charles I of England .
North Carolina was originally inhabited by a number of native peoples , including the Cherokee , Creek , Tuscarora , Lumbee and Catawba .
North Carolina was the first American territory the English attempted to colonize .
Sir Walter Raleigh , for whom the state capital is named , chartered two colonies on the North Carolina ( then Virginia ) coast in the late 1580s , both ending in failure .
The demise of one , the " Lost Colony " of Roanoke Island , remains one of the great mysteries of American history .
Virginia Dare , the first English child to be born in North America , was born in North Carolina .
Dare County is named for her .
Today , North Carolina is home to Fort Bragg , near Fayetteville ; it is the largest and most comprehensive military base in the United States and is the headquarters of the XVIII Airborne Corps , 82nd Airborne Division , and the U.S. Army Special Operations Command .
Next to Fort Bragg is Pope Air Force Base .
North Carolina is also home to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune which , when combined with nearby Marine bases MCAS Cherry Point , Camp Geiger , Camp Johnson , Stone Bay and Courthouse Bay , makes up the largest concentration of Marines and sailors in the world .
Drug Courts
As of May 20 , 2005 , there were 37 drug courts in operation or being planned in the state .
13 courts had been operating for over 2 years , 16 were recently implemented , and 8 were being planned .
During FY 2003 , 36.5 % of the Federally sentenced defendants had committed a substance offense .
About 52 % ( 297 ) of these crimes involved crack cocaine .
Corrections
On July 28 , 2005 , the North Carolina Department of Correction offenders population
was : 37,000 inmates , 114,554 probationers , and 2,700 parolees .
Of the 36,663 North Carolina prisoners on June 30 , 2005 , 5,179 were narcotic
offenders .
The goal of the North Carolina Department of Correction DACDP is to offer
comprehensive interventions , programs , and services to help offenders achieve
recovery .
Examples of DACDP programs include Drug Alcohol Recovery treatment
program ( DART ) , Residential Substance Abuse treatment for State Prisoners
( RSAT ) , and therapeutic communities ( TC ) .
Consequences of Use According to the North Carolina medical examiner , there were 6 deaths in 1999 and
21 deaths in 2000 attributed to oxycodone abuse .
According to DEA , almost 30 fatalities occurred in 2002 as a result of OxyContin .
There were 34 fatalities statewide in 2001 in which heroin was the principal
cause of death .
This is an increase from 27 fatalities in 2000 .
That year , cocaine was present in 30 % of the drug - related fatalities in North Carolina .
The amount of cocaine - related fatalities in the state rose 12 % from 65 in 1999 to
73 in 2000 .
treatment
There were 27,111 admissions to substance / alcohol treatment in North Carolina in 2003 and there were 30,068 admissions to drug / alcohol treatment the year prior .
This is a decrease from almost 34,000 admissions in 2001 .
Enforcement Around three - quarters of all Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force investigations in the state target the distribution of crack cocaine .
As of October 31 , 2003 , there were 28,458 full - time law enforcement authorities statewide ( 20,190 officers and 8,268 civilians ) .
Trafficking and Seizures North Carolina has experienced an important increase in drug trafficking activity , most of it due to the influx of Mexican nationals into the state .
Mexican criminal organizations based in North Carolina are the dominant wholesale distributors of cannabis and powdered cocaine .
Mexican and , to a lesser scale , Caucasian criminal groups based in North Carolina buy methamphetamine in Mexico , California , and southwestern states and transport the drug into the state .
In 2004 , the DEA and state and local authorities made 243 methamphetamine lab seizures .
About 391 kilograms of cocaine were seized by Federal agencies in the state during 2004 .
In 2003 , over 34,000 cultivated cannabis plants were eradicated in North
Carolina under the DEA's Domestic Cannabis Eradication / Suppression Program .
In 2004 , the North Carolina State Highway Patrol confiscated 42,271 grams of
cocaine .

It remains unclear , however , who inside the Bush administration first floated the idea of using " waterboarding " – simulated drowning – and other " enhanced " techniques against terrorist suspects in the months after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington .
British troops getting ready to deploy to Afghanistan are being issued with electronic sound - cancelling earplugs designed to let them hear what they need to - orders , conversations , enemy footfalls - but prevent hearing damage caused by explosions , gunfire and so on .
News of the new digi-plugs comes courtesy of the Times , reporting from the ranks of 19 Light Brigade * as it prepares to head out to Helmand Province later this year .
As the Times notes , the heavy - duty fighting in Afghanistan - with intense firefights , with much use of heavy weapons , airstrikes , artillery and so forth being routine - has taken its toll on British troops ' hearing , with many having to be taken off combat status as a result .
Normal earplugs or ear defenders have long been issued , but tend not to be worn as they prevent soldiers hearing orders , radio calls or other necessary sounds .
Hence the new earplugs from Racal Acoustics .
They operate on a different principle to the sound - cancelling buds / headsets now popular in the consumer market .
Each plug has an external mike and a normal internal speaker , and connects to the existing Personal Role Radio - the short - range radio worn by individual soldiers to talk to their teammates .
According to an MoD statement :
The TTS will compress any loud external noises and feed them back to the wearer 's ears at a safe level thereby providing hearing protection and situational awareness .
Speech is passed to the radio via the TTS ensuring the soldier remains in communication with his team .
The system is called Personalised Interfaced Hearing Protection ( PIHP ) , and apparently the plugs are " individually moulded " for better ear protection .
The MoD says it has bought 10,000 sets and intends that units headed into combat in Afghanistan - starting with 19 Light this year - will be routinely equipped with them .
The Telegraph 's headline writers believe that the PIHP plugs are similar to those " used by pop stars from Madonna to Take That to protect their hearing " , which seems reasonable .
The earplugs and the process of making individually - moulded seals for each soldier are said to cost £ 500 a set , but the MoD anticipates a saving overall as fewer soldiers will be rendered unfit for combat and / or require compensation for hearing loss .
So far there 's no word on the competing concept of volume - knob pills . ®
Bootnote
19 Light Brigade is the British Army 's new light - infantry formation , organised and equipped in the same way as the elite Air Assault and Commando brigades - though without their special training and badges .
( The rest of the combat army are still configured primarily for armoured / mechanised warfare . )
As the MoD note , the unit is officially known as " the Black Panthers " .
Other names have occasionally been employed by those who feared that the new brigade would be lumbered with all the rubbish jobs : but this does n't seem to have come true .
Afghanistan is the place to be , these days .

It is nutritious , delicious and sexy as all get - out .
It kicks the shit out of those other edible underwears because those things taste awful even though they look like they should taste like Fruit Roll - Ups .
Plus these ones are meatier .
RAWR !
Note the time and care that has gone into crafting this wonderful undergarment .
The attention to the properly placed groments that enhance the wearers comfort !
We 've even " bedazzled " this pair and added our Mixed Species logo on the back next to a heart of rhinestones .

They are made to order for each specific customer from the highest quality of dried preserved meats we can find at the closest convenience store .
First of all , it should be " haute meat couture " .
And secondly , why the hell are n't they available in teriyaki ?

Thanks to valerie , who is pissed they do n't come in turkey jerky .
Even though there was a snowstorm last week , spring marches forward , washing Appalachian Ohio in an ever - brightening wave of green dotted with yellow , violet , pink , white and rose as trees , flowers and grasses burst from the slowly warming earth .
The gardens , solar greenhouses and farms surrounding Athens are fertile with early spring delights : scallions , sweet radishes , rhubarb , lettuces , kale , chard , collards , tatsoi , bok choy and cilantro are all piled at tables in the farmer ’s market among the still - delicious winter storage vegetables and fruits : garlic , potatoes , apples , parsnips , beets , turnips and pears .
Cultivated oyster and shiitake mushrooms are plentiful , as are fresh eggs , milk and cream , chevre and feta cheese , and various meats .
Even this early in the season , it is possible to make many delicious meals from mostly local ingredients here in Athens .
One spring delicacy I look forward to every year is green garlic–new shoots of garlic which look for all the world like flat - leaved scallions .
Sold in bundles like scallions , green garlic is wholly edible , barring the little root cluster at the bottom .
Slice that away and then wash the stalk and leaves carefully , and you can slice , chop or mince the whole plant and use it in any way you would use scallions or garlic–you can saute green garlic , use it in salads , to top pizza , or you can do as I did–use it as one of the main ingredients in a pasta sauce along with other local ingredients such as kale , spinach , mushrooms , feta , cream and sweet Italian sausage .
This sauce , which I named for the glorious plethora of green vegetables used in it , can be made vegetarian quite easily and deliciously –leave out the sausage , and add more mushrooms , and instead of chicken broth or stock , use vegetable broth or stock , or even better –mushroom broth !
I cheated and used a double handful of non-local fresh basil , but any fresh herb could be used –I nearly used the fresh local cilantro I bought along with all the other ingredients at the market this Saturday , but instead , I saved that to make Cilantro Chicken later in the week .
The next time I make it , in fact , I intend to make it vegetarian–and I will probably change it enough to post the vegetarian version as a separate recipe–because , surprisingly , Zak and Morganna , both meat - lovers , said it would taste just as lovely without sausage as it did with it .
I ’d say that this particular pasta dish is more than halfway local–which is really good for April in southeastern Ohio .
The list of local ingredients used in this dish is long : spinach , kale , green garlic , Italian sausage , cream , chicken broth , goat feta , fresh shiitake mushrooms .
The non-local ingredients are : penne , sherry , balsamic vinegar .
Aleppo pepper , salt , olive oil , onions and fresh basil .
You notice that most of the non-local ingredients are flavorings–sherry , vinegar , pepper , salt and basil .
Oh , and it tastes REALLY , REALLY good , too .
The green garlic is where it ’s at–and I used three whole bunches of it in the sauce .
The white stalks , I sliced thinly and sauteed after the onions were halfway caramelized .
I let the garlic get nice and golden , then added the mushrooms and sausage , and cooked everything all together .
This way the garlic and caramelized onion flavor permeated the mushrooms and meat .
The green tops –which are the bulk of green garlic , by the way , I added right after the meat was finished cooking in two stages –half right after the meat was cooked , but before I added the cream and other greens , and the other half after the cream was added and reduced .
At that point I added the green garlic along with the kale and spinach .
This wilted the greens nicely , and put three layers of garlic flavor in place which really makes the sauce pop .
At the end , I add the feta and a tiny splash of balsamic vinegar , just to give a little ting of acidity .
It cuts the richness of the cream and sausage a bit , and it also really goes nicely with all the greens in the sauce .
The feta is just amazing –it barely melts into the sauce , forming little chunks of salty , goaty goodness that really goes perfectly with the green garlic and the other springtime leafy vegetables .
I will be making this one again , though this time without the sausage , just as Zak and Morganna requested , though I might well add some rapini to it as well , just because I can and I think it would taste really , really good that way .
And some ramps , too .
Because green garlic is n’t enough –I need wild garlic , too .

Our Awesomeness in Numbers
By : Bernard Chazelle
The OECD report is out .
Like a pack of hungry wallabies , the media pounced immediately on the only item worth reporting : the French eat and sleep longer hours than anyone , and yet they 're among the thinnest .
The Americans work the longest hours , spend half as much time eating as the French , and they 're the fattest !
No wonder everybody hates the French .
Oh , and something the wallabies missed .
The French ( like most Europeans ) are now taller than the Americans .
No doubt the nativists will blame short immigrants , except that science has conclusively debunked that myth .
Americans are shrinking ( in height , not width ) because of poor diet and lousy prenatal / infant care .
If you prefer , you can quit reading right here , and surf on to other sites that will tell you how the US is number 1 in all sorts of important things , like arms sales ; bank transactions ; billionaires ; etc. GDP is high , too , and by the measures of classical economics , we 're not doing too bad .
The difference with the OECD report is that it gives you numbers that actually matter to living human beings .
You may choose to be shocked , shocked that such things happen in our advanced society .
But when a rule has more exceptions than instances in which it holds , it 's helpful to change the rule .
Once you think that we live in a third - world plutocracy , then all of a sudden everything begins to make sense .
Also , after you read and weep , ask yourself why the only item that made the headlines was about the sleeping habits of the French .
Maybe the French always sleep but the American propaganda machine surely never does .
Here are the US rankings out of the 30 OECD countries ( 1 is best ; 30 is worst -- worst as in Somalia - like ) .
The names of the countries even more Somalian than the US appear in parens .
Infant Deaths : 28 out of 30 ( Mexico , Turkey ) .
Life Expectancy : 24 out of 30 ( Mexico , Turkey , Hungary , Poland , Czech & Slovak Republics ) .
Health Expenditures : 1 out of 30 .
Poverty Rates : 28 out of 30 ( Mexico , Turkey ) .
Child Poverty : 27 out of 30 ( Mexico , Turkey , Poland ) .
Income Inequality : 27 out of 30 ( Mexico , Turkey , Portugal ) .
Obesity : 30 out of 30 .
Incarceration : 30 out of 30 .
Work Hours ( ranked in ascending order ) : 30 out of 30 .
Height ( women ) : 25 out of 30 ( Mexico , Turkey , Korea , Portugal , Japan ) .
Height ( men ) : 24 out of 30 ( Italy , Spain , Mexico , Portugal , Korea , Japan ) .
OECD countries : Turkey , Mexico , Poland , USA , Spain , Portugal , Ireland , Germany , Italy , Canada , New Zealand , Japan , Greece , Luxemburg , Australia , Netherlands , Slovakia , Korea , Czech Republic , UK , Belgium , Switzerland , Hungary , Iceland , France , Austria , Norway , Finland , Sweden , and Denmark .

My last column generated a lively debate on the prospects for various business and technical options for the delivery of Internet TV so it makes sense to continue this topic and build it into a more full - featured model .
I used to write quite a bit about this back when I was trying to get NerdTV going .
The core of what I ’ll write here can be found in a couple dozen columns from back then — columns that would seem to have been for the most part forgotten given the direction last week ’s discussion took .
You see the future of television IS Internet television .
There is no other in sight .
No business or technology exists in a vacuum .
They all have customers , users , competitors , and make use of resources in an environment that is not one of total abundance .
This means that if there is going to be something like television in the future it is going to adapt to the distribution model that offers the highest price / performance , which is to say the highest performance for the lowest cost .
That is not how one would traditionally describe the Internet , but then times are changing .
Whatever country you live in there are generally four models for live entertainment video distribution — broadcast , cable , satellite , and Internet .
Broadcast is a limited local resource and therefore more highly regulated than the others but it has traditionally featured the lowest cost per marginal user .
That means it costs a lot to build and maintain a TV station but additional viewers within the service area can be added pretty much for free .
Cable offers more channel capacity than does broadcast but requires building a distribution network that ’s fairly expensive .
While one could imagine a cable TV “ station , ” the way the industry has grown is through cable operators becoming content aggregators offering many services over their expensive networks .
That ’s the most efficient way for cable companies to serve the broadest audience and the only way that enables them to sell extra-cost services like pay - per-view , premium movie channels or , indeed , Internet service .
Remember , though , that cable operators pay for nearly all of the content they carry , which is different from broadcast , where a lot of content is free to the broadcaster and some content even comes with money attached .
Satellite operators pay for their content , too .
Satellite initially used wireless technology to offer cable content in rural areas where it was too expensive to build a wired network .
Having gained economies of scale in the rural markets cable could n’t compete for , satellite has come to town competing generally on price .
But satellite offers no practical Internet service .
I know there are some and I tried one years ago ( Starband ) but they do n’t work well .
Internet TV is different from all these others .
It began as a parasite on telephone and cable networks so the cost of building the network generally was n’t there , having already been covered for the most part by those earlier services .
Internet TV is less of a network than a conduit ; at present the Internet Service Providers do n’t pay for video content but then neither do they get paid for it .
Yet this common carrier attribute also makes Internet service often more profitable for telcos and cable companies than the core services those companies were established to provide .
Whatever you pay for Internet service , it is mainly profit for your ISP .
The important lesson to learn when it comes to these competitive services is that the first three — broadcast , cable , and satellite — are all going up in cost to their providers while the cost of providing Internet service is going down .
In the USA , broadcast viewership is dropping , which means the cost per viewer is rising .
Same for cable where viewers are stagnant , viewership is declining ( number of hours of viewing ) and the cost of content is rising .
Satellite has been growing marginally but that could end at any moment and it shares the same content cost increases as cable .
Meanwhile Internet service just gets faster and cheaper thanks to a Moore ’s Law double whammy .
Remember Moore ’s Law works in two ways .
It makes digital products ever cheaper AND ever more powerful .
This has profound meaning for Internet TV because it continually increases the bandwidth we can get for the same dollar while giving our devices the capability to do even more with the same bandwidth .
Here ’s an example .
My primary Internet connection is an 8 megabit - per - second business cable line with a service level agreement and static IP addresses .
I pay more than you do but then I get more , too , though even my service is crap compared to what you can get in Japan , Korea , and much of Europe .
My primary computer WAS a Mac Pro G5/1.6 circa 2004 .
I should have replaced the G5 a couple years ago , I know , but my kids are in private schools and I keep buying airplane parts .
I finally replaced the G5 last week , though , with a dual - core Mac Mini 2.0 .
Both the old and new computers had four gigs of RAM .
Though my Internet connection can easily carry one or more 1080 p H.264 video streams , there is no way that old G5 ( which cost me $ 1999 in 2004 dollars ) could play it .
It did n’t do much better with 720 p for that matter .
But the $ 750 Mini ( small drive but lots of RAM ) can easily decode 1080p .
This is the trend , then : our available bandwidth will go up while our devices will become more powerful , making better use of the bandwidth .
The result , as always with Moore ’s Law , is either better services or lower total cost or maybe a little of both .
What this means for the future of television is that we ’re approaching a point where Internet service will equal and then be lower than the marginal per-viewer cost of the broadcast TV model .
This crossover will inevitably happen with the only question being when .
That ’s a function of bandwidth costs decreasing at 50 percent per year and processing power increasing at 50 percent per year .
My calculations suggest the crossover will happen around 2015 , which used to seem like a long time away but no longer does .
When Internet TV becomes dramatically , unequivocally , and inexorably cheaper than the other three distribution models , those other models will quickly go away .
That ’s why I argued in PBS meetings to forget about spending $ 1.8 billion to upgrade local stations for digital TV and instead sell or lease that spectrum for commercial data use and throw the resulting $ 3 billion ( lease revenue plus the $ 1.8 billion savings ) into rebuilding the network solely as an Internet service .
Nobody listened .
So there is a cliff rapidly approaching for television .
Five years from now local TV stations will have the same complaints that local newspapers have today as many of them go out of business .
Cable TV operators will become ISPs , period .
Phone companies will be ISPs , too , and analog voice service will be gone completely .
The regulatory implications of these changes should be interesting .
Who , then , will be the players in this future TV ?
For the most part they will be the content providers , which probably does n’t mean traditional networks .
And the networks know this , by the way .
Hulu.com is n’t called NBCFoxABC.com and TV.com is n’t called cbs.com for a reason .
Networks will go away .
But content will endure , bringing new value to I Love Lucy episodes and almost anything else people like to watch .
The TV networks are throwing their lot together .
CBS chairman Sumner Redstone will come to his senses one day and merge tv.com into Hulu , I am sure .
Their big competitors will be Google , Apple , and a player yet to be even founded ( definitely NOT Yahoo OR Microsoft ) .
Google will differentiate itself as always through technology .
Those shipping container data centers I first wrote about in 2005 exist not just because they are easy to stack inside big Google plants .
Why botehr with weatherproof containers if they are to be used exclusive indoors ?
Because they are even easier to put in the parking lot at the telephone company central office or at the cable company head - end , both of which will by then be strictly ISPs .
Google will proxy content at every major ISP in America .
And they ’ll do this because Google has no idea what people want to watch on TV , nor do they particularly care .
Apple , on the other hand , cares .
Following the content development scheme I laid out last time Apple will attempt to become the dominant content provider to the 20 percent of the market that spends 80 percent of the money , with margins high enough to use Google distribution and still come out ahead , leaving to Page and Brin the 80 percent of content that generates 20 percent of revenue .
But wait , is n’t Apple just a maker of hardware ?
Do n’t they do iTunes just to sell iPods ?
No .
Apple is a software company that has traditionally packaged its software in attractive hardware boxes .
The fact that any new Mac is essentially a Windows computer proves that .
But price points have been eroding in every hardware category and will continue to do so .
Microsoft right now makes more profit from every Windows PC than does the maker of that PC .
Apple is not immune to this trend .
So the company needs to find ways to sell more and more software .
Content is software .
TV is software .
And the great thing about entertainment is that it is software we can be induced under some circumstances to buy over and over again like those teenage girls who paid to see Titanic dozens of times .
What does that leave , then , for that player to be named later ?
I ’ll get to that next time .
May 23 , 1934 : Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow were killed on a desolate road near their hideout in Bienville Parish , Louisiana .
They were shot by four Texas officers and two Louisiana officers .
The ambush has been criticized because the posse supposedly failed to warn Bonnie and Clyde of impending death and ambushed the duo .
Some sources say Bonnie and Clyde were shot more than 50 times .
Historians and writers have said that there were no warrants against Bonnie for any violent crimes ; and FBI files show only one warrant against her , for helping Clyde to transport a stolen vehicle .
Each year , near the anniversary of the ambush , there is a Bonnie and Clyde Festival in Gibsland , Louisiana .
On an isolated stretch of the Louisiana Highway 154 is a small stone monument that marks the death site of Bonnie and Clyde .
It was built in 1972 , and has since been covered with graffiti and shot at with guns .
President Obama 's decision to name Utah 's governor John Huntsman as the new US ambassador to China is a master - stroke of political strategy .
Huntsman may be the most important person you 've never heard of .
He 's a moderate Republican governor in one of the most conservative Republican states , where , until the time of his appointment , he enjoyed approval ratings above 80 % .
A few weeks back , Obama campaign manager David Plouffe unintentionally elevated Huntsman on the national stage by suggesting that he was one of the few Republican politicians that appeared formidable in 2012 .
Huntsman is young , exceptionally smart , quick on his feet , amiable and incredibly articulate ; when he speaks , he exudes reasonableness , a quality almost entirely missing in the modern Republican party .
He has the potential to be for the Republican party what Obama was for the Democrats – a man capable of simultaneously exciting his political base while appealing to the critical group of independent voters .
To hear him speak is to know he 's a guy an independent would love .
In the wake of Plouffe 's comments , and a few high profile trips to critical presidential states , Jon Huntsman made his way onto just about every Washington insider 's list of possible 2012 Republican presidential contenders .
That is , until he joined the Obama administration .
Huntsman made a calculation , one that other qualified Republicans will no doubt make when contemplating a run against Obama .
Anyone smart enough , capable enough to compete against Obama is going to be smart enough not to run .
When Obama kicks off his re-election campaign , he 'll do so with a two - million - strong member donor base already in place .
He 'll do so with over one million volunteers ready to be reactivated .
In his first month , he 'll likely raise more than $ 100 m in donations .
His re-election will dwarf his first campaign in its size and scope , just as his first campaign dwarfed its predecessor in Howard Dean .
Just through sheer organization , President Obama will be one of the most difficult presidential incumbent to defeat in American history .
Why fall on that sword , Huntsman must have wondered , when Bobby Jindal and Sarah Palin have already eagerly volunteered ?
And so , Governor Huntsman will become Ambassador Huntsman and will spend the next few years building his bipartisan foreign policy credentials for a shot at the White House in 2016 .
Many on the left have already expressed frustration that Obama would provide such a valuable talking point to the opposition of his successor , and have argued that Obama sold out his party to protect his own reelection .
But Obama too has made a calculation , and it has nothing to do with 2012 .
The president recognizes that the Republican party is quickly unfurling and that those currently leading it will be incapable , over the next few years , to right such a wayward ship .
There are few Republicans who can fill the void , reverse the hemorrhaging and rebuild the party .
Huntsman , once counted among those few , is now off the stage , and on the other side of the world .
By co-opting such a valuable politician , Obama has left the GOP flailing .
Without a reasonable voice , the rattle from the skeleton of a once dominant party will echo unchecked .
Will the Beijing ambassadorship help Huntsman in his presidential bid in 2016 ?
Surely , to some extent it will .
Adding foreign policy experience to a governor 's resume does make for an appealing candidate .
But it does n't lessen the obstacle that Huntsman will face – a Republican primary electorate that will be as unforgiving of his Mormon faith as it will be of his time in the Obama administration .
And after eight years of John Boehner and Sarah Palin , of Mitch McConnell and Rush Limbaugh , Huntsman may find that there is n't much party left to mobilise .
Ultimately , Obama has understood what his predecessor Lyndon Johnson said best : " Better inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in . "
In February TechCrunch rumored that Last.fm had ratted out its users to the RIAA .
Now they have another source claiming data was shared with the music industry group , including IP addresses .
Without going into the validity of these allegations , we 'd like to point out that this data is completely useless to the RIAA , from a legal point of view .
With millions of active users , Last.fm is one of the largest and most appreciated music communities on the Internet .
The company was acquired by CBS Interactive back in 2007 , prompting some to speculate that this had led it to the darkside .
The allegations reached a crescendo recently with claims that Last . fm shared the listening habits of its users with the RIAA .
Last.fm has denied all allegations , but let ’s assume for a moment that there ’s some truth in them .
In their most recent writeup TechCrunch published new details which were provided by another source , and in the article they hint at the following doomsday scenario .
“ Their parent company [ CBS ] supplied user data to the RIAA , and that the data could possibly be used in civil and criminal actions against those users . ”
TechCrunch makes it sound really scary , but how useful is this data really in a court of law ?
Let ’s start with a little background .
Last . fm ’s data is provided by its users who report their recently listened - to songs to allow the site to track their listening habits .
The data comes from the ID3 tags or similar metadata formats that MP3s and other digital music files carry .
These list the artist name , title of the track , name of the album and more info related to the music file .
So what can the RIAA do with this data ?
Since the metadata does n’t state that a track was pirated , only pre-release tracks that appear on Last . fm would be worth looking into .
However , since the RIAA only have access to metadata reported to the site there is not much they can prove with it , even if they have access to Last . fm ’s entire database .
The RIAA would only be able to check which IP addresses played a music file tagged as ‘ track X ’ by ‘ artist Y’ , but since everyone can easily edit these tags they can never really be certain that an individual was indeed in possession of the track , let alone that they shared it with others .
So , suggesting that the RIAA is going to use Last . fm ’s data ( if they indeed got their hands on it ) to go after file - sharers is complete nonsense .
As evidence , Last . fm ’s data is not going to be worth much in court .
In fact , there are plenty of better ways to track down copyright infringers and the RIAA is well aware of that .
They are experts by now .
The only thing the RIAA has to do is hire someone to monitor various public BitTorrent trackers where the music is traded , and they can easily catch thousands of people in the act .
The upside of this method is that they can verify that the person on the other end is actually sharing the data .
Plus , they will know that the files are indeed the titles they are looking for .
The RIAA of course knows all of this , and if they indeed requested the data it was for purposes other than taking legal action .
So , assuming that the RIAA was indeed requesting data from Last.fm , why would they want to know what music people are listening to on their computers ?
Most likely the RIAA is interested in the business intelligence value of the data .
For years record labels have been tailoring their music releases to the listening habits of ‘ pirates ’ , and it is not unlikely that they are interested in Last . fm ’s data for similar purposes .
IP - addresses can come in handy here to spot some of the regional differences in popularity of artists or tracks .
Whatever their reasons are , dragging pirates to court is not likely to be one of them .
Perhaps the TechCrunch tipster is an insider at one of the record labels who wants to scare the shit out of Last . fm ’s users ?
Or has Michael Arrington himself been hired as one of the footsoldiers in the RIAA ’s war on piracy ?
Who knows , but anything is more plausible than the RIAA taking people to court for reporting “ copyright infringing ” metadata to Last.fm .
Update : Apparently Last.fm ’s official client also does fingerprinting as LANjackal points out .
However , the ‘ evidence ’ would still be far from usable in court .
The police department in �Portsmouth , NH �is collaborating with �Portsmouth High School to create a database of student iPods ( and other MP3 players ) in hopes of deterring thieves .
The increasingly common occurrence has caused the school 's " resource officer " ( aka police officer on duty inside the school ) to collect information about students ' digital audio players , including serial numbers , descriptions , and pictures that are filed away .
School officials hope that , with the information readily available , stolen iPods will be easier to recover .
i Pod theft was also a huge issue in the last school district I worked with , also in New Hampshire .
iPods were often stolen from gym locker rooms during class and then sold in a pawn shop in another town , or to a student at another high school .
For whatever reason , it seems as if padlocks are much less common today than they were when I went to high school in the late 90s , making theft much easier .
While many high schools are outfitted with closed circuit surveillance systems , the cameras are not allowed inside of locker rooms , preventing administrators from actually catching students in the act .
In turn , circumstantial evidence is usually the result — meaning a principal 's interrogation skills and a potential search of the alleged thief 's belongings are the only hope for recovery .
The program taking place in a high school , where the vast majority of digital audio players are iPods , could actually yield some positive results .
Having a serial number makes proof of ownership a no brainer , and thus recovery should be that much easier .
This is n't the first system we have seen implemented at a school , but we would n't be surprised if it becomes more and more common , eventually spreading to devices like cell phones .
Nathan Drake is one of the most iconic characters of this console generation , with his witty comments , hilarious mannerisms , and constant drive for adventure .
Yet little focus is placed on the actor who not only does the motion capture for this character , but the voice and facial expressions .
Nolan North is credited in over 80 videogame titles , and the similarities between actor and digital character become very apparent in the included interview , which includes information on the upcoming sequel .
Though , we doubt Drake will ever do such an accurate impression of Christopher Walken .

PASCAGOULA , Miss . --
A rural woman shocked deputies when they found her alert and coherent after being shot in the head at close range by her husband .
She even made a cup of tea , according to one of the deputies .
" There 's no way she should be alive , " Jackson County Sheriff Mike Byrd said .
" The bullet completely passed straight through her brain .
It entered at the middle of her forehead and exited from the back of her head .
She should be dead .
It 's one of the most unreal , bizarre things I 've ever seen . "
Byrd said that Donald Ray Sexton shot his wife Tammy in the forehead at 12:10 a.m.
Tuesday , then went to the back porch of their home on Billy Hinton Road in the Harleston community in north Jackson County and fatally shot himself .
Deputies believe that the couple had been arguing .
Tammy Sexton , 47 , was airlifted to the University of South Alabama Medical Center in Mobile .
A hospital representative said Wednesday afternoon that Sexton was listed in fair condition in the intensive care unit .
Lee Kesterson , a neurosurgeon with the Singing River Health System , said that a gunshot victim 's alertness after a head wound signals their ability to survive it .
" If a person is in a comatose state , chances of survival are poor , " he said .
Byrd said a young relative was in the home when the shootings occurred and ran to a neighbor for help .
" When deputies got there , they thought they were responding to a murder - suicide , " Byrd said .
" But , she was up walking around and talking . "
Sheriff's Sgt. Leon Rushing said Tammy Sexton told detectives she had " just made some tea and was fine . "
Rushing said she appeared slightly disoriented but was alert and responsive to questions .
" She had a cup of tea on her nightstand , " Rushing said .
" That was evidence that she had gone to the microwave and made tea .
I 'm sure she made it after she was shot . "
Police recovered a .380 - caliber semi-automatic handgun , which they believe was the pistol that 57 - year - old Donald Sexton used in the shootings , Byrd said .
Rushing said hospital officials told him Wednesday that doctors were predicting that Tammy Sexton would make a full recovery .
" I 've seen many , many head wounds over the years , and people just do n't survive getting shot in the head , " Byrd said .
" She 's an absolute miracle . "

Miss California Carrie Prejean continues to give blondes a bad name , this time blaming Satan for her demise .
Appearing on the James Dobson ’s Focus on the Family program , Prejean was asked about her now infamous response to Perez Hilton ’s gay marriage question .
Her response : “ I felt as though Satan was trying to tempt me in asking me this question .
And then God was in my head and in my heart saying , ‘ Do not compromise this .
You need to stand up for me and you need to share with all these people . . . you need to witness to them and you need to show that you ’re not willing to compromise that for this title of Miss USA . ’
And I knew right here that it was n’t about winning .
It was about being true to my convictions . ”
Prejean ’s future as Miss California comes down to a decision to be announced by Donald Trump Tuesday .
George Pell is wrong - using condoms does stop the spread of HIV .
CARDINAL George Pell's Easter message that condoms have contributed to Africa 's AIDS problem by encouraging promiscuity is not consistent with the evidence , and is dangerous .
Pell suggests that condoms have caused an epidemic of HIV in Thailand and the lack of them has protected The Philippines .
This is not true .
HIV rates and patterns of spread vary greatly between and within Asian countries , depending on many characteristics , and varied strategies are needed in response .
The virus has spread little in the Philippines where most men are circumcised — which greatly reduces the chance that HIV will spread in a population — and buying sex is not common .
In any case , Filipino sex workers have had high rates of condom use , which has protected them from HIV .
In Thailand , the first Asian country to experience rapid spread of HIV , it has long been a social norm for men to buy sex .
Thailand 's dramatic success in turning around the spread of HIV provides evidence for the effectiveness of condoms .
In 1993 , the HIV infection rate among 21 - year - old army conscripts was just under 4 per cent nationwide and as high as 8 per cent in the north .
On the eve of Earth Day , I am reminded of how food connects us to the Earth and makes us human .
It 's currently in vogue to " eat local , " shop at farmers markets and join a co-op or Community Supported Agriculture group .
I understand the importance of these movements .
I decided to become a farmer after volunteering at a farmers market and reading many books focused on modern food issues .
It 's okay to eat for political reasons .
But what about flavor and experience ?
Many chefs will tell you that the main reason they buy food from local growers is flavor .
It 's not because they feel their money should support a small business , a local business or a friend .
It 's not because they want to reduce pollution from transportation .
More than anyone else , chefs love to eat .
They love to play with flavors and experience the full range of intensity .
No chef likes a rock - hard - plain - old - red tomato from Mexico in February .
But they love ripe Cherokee Purples and fresh greens picked four hours ago .
Taste .
The experience of producing your own food changes the dynamics of eating .
If you 've ever made bread , you are much more conscious of its quality while you eat it .
You understand the work that went into producing the final product , so details pop out more .
Crust .
Crumb .
Moisture .
That lump of undercooked dough in the middle .
The more you cook , the more you understand about the kitchen .
Combine food politics , flavor and experience and grow your own .
Forget your black - thumb fears and those pre-started plants from the hardware store .
Do it from seed .
That sense of wonder you experienced sprouting a bean as a kindergartner never diminishes .
People have been tending to plants for thousands of years , so I have confidence you can do it .
Try growing something small , like corn salad ( also called mache or rapunzel ) .
You can do it in a pot by a sunny window .
Make a shallow row , drop in the seeds , cover them and add water .
Wait .
There are no excuses .
A packet of heirloom veggie seeds costs less than $ 3 .
When more people get involved in their own food , environmental issues will start to make more sense .
By touching food at all stages , we can understand how it affects us on physical , mental and environmental levels .
We can see how much it means to be a part of Nature .
Plus , you will eat better foods than you can buy , and there 's no reason to overthink that .

Police say suspect from UH is self - styled vigilante HPD : Accused UH student was self - styled vigilante
Jeremy Lee Pierce , 32 , is charged with murder in the shooting death of Joe David Tall , a homeless man killed on the University of Houston central campus earlier this year .

The University of Houston student accused of killing a homeless man on campus earlier this year considers himself a vigilante intent on cleaning crime from Houston , police said .
Jeremy Lee Pierce , 32 , is charged with murder in the death of Joe David Tall , who was shot in the back of the head at close range while he slept at a bus stop at Holman and Cullen on Feb .
7 .
Investigators were baffled by the crime for weeks because they had no leads or explanations for why anybody would kill a sleeping man .
They got a break in the case Wednesday .
Campus police called Houston Police Department after they arrested a man on accusations that he threatened two of his friends with a gun .
The victims , investigators said , told police that Pierce had boasted about killing Tall .
When Houston homicide detectives interviewed Pierce , he admitted the killing and had offered an explanation , an investigator said .
He also told them he was bipolar and that he wanted to clean crime from the city because police had not been doing a good job .
“ He fancied himself a Charles Bronson type , ” said Houston Police Department investigator Michael Miller , referring to the star of the Death Wish series of vigilante justice films .
“ He was going to clean up the streets and protect the ladies . ”
Miller said that Pierce admitted he had particular disdain for homeless people .
“ He was going to get rid of them , ” Miller said .
“ He did n’t like them always lying around bus stops . ”
Victim ’s brother relieved
Miller described Pierce ’s demeanor as “ boastful ” during questioning and that he appeared excited about being at the center of media coverage .
“ He was very enthusiastic — thrilled , in fact — that his picture would be in the paper , ” Miller said .
Miller said the weapon used to kill Tall was the same .357 - caliber revolver that was used to threaten Pierce ’s two friends , and that was also found in his apartment .
Tall ’s brother , Randall Wade Craven , expressed relief that an arrest had been made in the case .
He said the killing seemed so random that he never thought police would solve it .
“ I ’m just dumbfounded that it was somebody at the college , ” Craven said .
Miller said he knew little about Pierce , except that he had attended Galveston College .
He said that Pierce told investigators he watched them as they investigated the shooting scene .
Aunt in Houston area
According to public records , Pierce was convicted in 2005 of burglary of habitation in Wichita County and sentenced to 205 days in jail .
Miller said Friday that Pierce reported being estranged from his parents and that the relative to whom he was closest was an aunt who lives in the Houston area .
Tall ’s family has said that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was about 15 .
He had left the family ’s northeast home at 19 and lived on the streets for about 30 years .
His mental illness , Craven said , had pushed his brother away from his relatives , even though they tried to help him .
“ I ’m very relieved they got the killer , ” he said .
“ It puts a cap on it . ”
Pierce remains in the Harris County Jail in lieu of $ 75,000 bail .
A court hearing scheduled for Friday was postponed until next week .

AMERICA , Britain and China are among the many countries that have adopted spend - now - pay - later policies to stave off economic disaster .
But giant fiscal stimuluses , tax cuts and bail - outs are weighing heavily on public finances .
In a paper prepared for the forthcoming G20 summit , the IMF sets out new forecasts for government debt .
Japan 's debt burden , which is already the largest of the world 's big economies , will reach a sumo - sized 225 % of GDP in 2010 .
Rich countries ' debt is set to grow from 83.3 % of GDP in 2008 to almost 100 % in 2010 .
Developing economies will see much smaller growth from 35.7 % to 37.8 % in two years , but these countries also have lower debt tolerance than rich ones .

Arbor Networks knows more about the internet 's workings than possibly anyone outside the National Security Agency .
Their monitoring equipment sits in nearly all Tier 1 internet providers – and if you want data on what the internet looks like and what the top threats are , they 've got it through their Atlas service .
So what does it look like when Google 's search , email , and calendar services , among others , stop working for two hours ?
The graph above from the company 's Atlas system shows average traffic from ten top North American ISPs sending data to Google ’s network .
( Note this graph only shows traffic to to Google 's portion of the internet , not internet traffic generally . )
Google says it messed up and routed traffic through an Asian network that could n't handle the flood .
The outage lasted about two hours – starting about 10:15 am Eastern time .
If I were a regulator , this graph would be piece one in evidence that Google holds a monopoly on the world 's information .
Update : Actually , the fact that Google 's slip - up causes such a stir in the media , on mailing lists and on Twitter , says much more about Google 's centrality to the internet than this graph does , even though its a really cool graph .
That drop on the right side of the graph from 15 Gbps to 1 is just astounding .

China Takes Another # 1 Title From the U.S .
China has overtaken the U.S. in yet another category of global influence this morning .
This time it ’s Brazil .
China is now Brazil ’s No. 1 trading partner , snapping a nearly 80 - year tradition of Brazil depending primarily on exports to America .
Brazil announced over the weekend it had conducted $ 3.2 billion in business with China during April — a 12 - fold increase in Sino - Brazilian trade from 2001 .
April also marks the second consecutive month that the U.S. has ranked No. 2 .
What ’s the trade ?
Iron ore .
Brazilian officials say the Chinese have been buying the stuff hand over fist since the start of 2009 .
As one consequence , Brazil ’s stock market , the Bovespa Index , is outpacing the American equity rebound .
Brazil ’s version of the Dow has recouped the majority of its crisis losses .
Check it out :
Brazil and China are just two areas of rich investment opportunity we ’ll be focusing on with the new BRIC report we conceived with our Indian partners last week in London .
Specific details on the report are forthcoming .
“ The Brazilians are gearing up for the first battle of the next war , ” says Byron King .
“ They intend to survive as a prosperous , industrialized country in the 21st century , despite intense future competition across the world for energy fuels and other natural resources .
“ Down in Brazil , they ’re in something like national rapture at the prospect of drilling up the deep pre-salt hydrocarbon plays in the offshore basins .
The estimates are that the deep basins off Brazil hold between 20 - 100 billion barrels of oil .
Maybe more .
“ The entire nation of Brazil , apparently , revels in the prospect of investing over $ 120 billion in offshore development in just the next eight years .
They have a plan .
It ’s their moonshot .
The Brazilians believe that the offshore environment will bring their industries firmly into the modern era .
Brazil wants to be a world power in the 21st century .
And the oil ?
Well , of course they have plans for that oil .
“ Petrobras has plans to emplace HUNDREDS of subsea systems on the deep ocean bottom to bring that oil into production .
The Brazilians will lay thousands of miles of underwater pipeline , with all the associated ship support and other equipment that entails .
“ The Brazilians are not living in the frozen past .
They ’re not hostage to paralyzing myths .
The Brazilians envision a future for their nation , and they ’re acting on it .
They see hundreds of deep - water oil wells pulling petroleum out of the crust from many miles down and piping it ashore to their refineries and industries .
Indeed , Brazil plans to win that first battle of the next war .
And it ’s cutting the steel with which to do it . ”
It was a function of a policy of abuse and torture and mistreatment of prisoners in the war on terror in every theater of combat , directed and emanating from the will of Dick Cheney via the pen of George W Bush .
It is simply impossible to review the evidence and conclude otherwise and no one , outside the Cheney cocoon , has been able to sustain the fiction that Cheney proposes as fact .
The attempt to separate this from his own highly controlled , personally directed program of torture and abuse and coercion is a deep and malicious and wilfull lie .
It may be what Bush wishes to believe .
But Cheney knows otherwise .
His speech was therefore not a patriotic defense of what he thinks is best for this country ; it was a vile and deliberately divisive attempt to use the politics of fear and false machismo against the stability of the American polity .
He has clearly learned nothing ; and will remain a threat to this country 's ability to fight terror and defend its values .
The president will remain above this , as he should , as Cheney seeks further to divide and destabilize this country in a futile attempt to rescue his reputation .
But his reputation is unrescuable , his crimes a matter of record , and his character now indelibly written in history .
Our job is to never let him forget it , to never let history be re-written and to remain resolute in bringing both him and those who attacked us to justice .
And that is in the presidential oath of office .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

The Raleigh ( N.C. ) News & Observer reported that a virus related to the current outbreak was first identified a decade ago at a farm in the eastern North Carolina county .
The N&O cited Raul Rabadan , a Columbia University scientist who 's studying the new virus 's genetics :
" This virus was found in pigs here in the United States , " Rabadan said in an interview .
" They were getting sick in 1998 .
It became a swine virus . "
It spread among pregnant sows in Newton Grove , N.C. , causing them to abort their litters .
The virus then spread to pigs in Texas , Iowa and Minnesota -- putting epidemiologists on alert about the new viral strain and the potential for a human outbreak .
A May 1999 N&O story titled " Disease detectives untangle mystery of mutant flu virus " ( available in the paper 's online archives ) reported that the 1998 bug -- a pig virus " wrapped in a shell of human proteins " -- was isolated by a state government veterinary lab .
Similar mutations are suspected in earlier flu outbreaks , including the 1918 Spanish flu that killed more than 20 million people worldwide .
According to that story , the virus was discovered in August 1998 at a 2,400 - sow breeding farm owned by Newton Grove , N.C. - based Hog Slat Inc. , a leading builder of factory - style hog farms .
The company is also one of Sampson County 's largest employers -- as is Smithfield Foods , the Virginia - based corporation that owns numerous hog farms near the Mexican community where the earliest case of the current swine flu was identified .
The 1998 North Carolina outbreak began with pregnant sows developing high fevers .
A state microbiologist who tested nasal samples taken from the animals was surprised to encounter a virus he did n't recognize -- and his alarm grew when he found that some of the sick animals had been immunized for ordinary swine flu , the N&O reported :
He was concerned for good reason .
Pigs are considered by most virologists to be the primary source of deadly influenza pandemics in humans .
Unlike epidemics , which are usually isolated within specific areas , pandemics spread quickly and can cover the world within a few months .
Those pandemic influenza viruses are n't believed to originate with the pigs , however .
Most flu bugs that have infected humans in the past have been traced back to aquatic birds such as ducks and geese , suspected as the reservoir for almost all strains of human flu .
But because they are so genetically different , it is extremely difficult for viruses to jump directly from birds to people .
That 's where pigs come in .
Pigs are ideal mixing vessels , because they can pick up viruses from both birds and humans .
And since viruses are always mutating , pigs can produce viruses that have a mix of genetic traits from both birds and humans .
After that , it is possible for a potentially deadly strain of avian influenza virus to make the relatively short genetic hop from pigs to people .
The H1N1 virus behind the current flu outbreak contains genetic material from birds , humans and pigs , though it 's called " swine flu " because it 's a type of virus that typically infects hogs .
The state microbiologist investigating the 1998 outbreak sent samples of the virus to Dr. Robert Webster , a leading virologist at St. Jude 's Children 's Research Hospital in Memphis , Tenn .
Webster identified them as a mix of human and swine virus and concluded the virus had originated in humans before jumping to pigs .
North Carolina public health officials tested workers at the Hog Slat farm who had come in contact with the infected pigs .
Those tests showed that 10 % of the workers had developed antibodies to the virus , meaning they had been infected although they apparently had n't become ill .
At the time , health experts said they did not believe the new virus posed a threat to humans -- but admitted the potential was there for future problems :
" We do n't know how often these reassortments occur in nature -- probably more than we want to realize , " said Dr. Newton MacCormack , chief of the communicable disease control section of the state Department of Health and Human Services .
" We 're pretty lucky in that most of these viruses reach a genetic dead end , " he said .
" The big problem is the rare occasion when one of these viruses gets into a human and begins to be passed from person to person . "
That 's what 's happening in the latest outbreak .
But fortunately , it appears we may get lucky again , as the World Health Organization has said community - level transmissions appear to be occurring only in the United States , Mexico and Canada , according to the Washington Post .
And the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported yesterday that the outbreak appears to be milder than initially feared .
The fact that the virus is turning out to be not as bad as it could have been have led some to decry what they consider " hysteria " over the current outbreak .
They include U.S. Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) , who recently called the reaction to the flu " overblown . "
However , President Obama said the response was justified by the risk presented by a new virus for which people lack natural immunity .
While we agree that overreacting to swine flu is not helpful , neither should this be a moment for complacency -- not given the very real problems the outbreak illuminates .
There 's a issue here just as critical as whether governments should discourage people from visiting crowded places during a flu outbreak , and that 's how governments should best regulate factory farms .
Crowding thousands of pigs into cramped , filthy quarters creates ideal conditions for the fast spread of potentially dangerous viruses .
The Humane Society of the United States points out that the unnatural density of such operations enables the large viral loads considered necessary for the emergence of rare flu mutations that can then spread rapidly among animals .
The crowded conditions also stress the animals ' immune systems , while the enormous quantities of decaying fecal waste predisposes them to respiratory infections and the lack of sunlight allows viruses to thrive .
In addition , the industry 's heavy reliance on pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines immunologically pressures the virus to mutate .
And the flies and other pests attracted to such operations may be able to pick up viruses and carry them for miles .
A report released last year by the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production warned of the risks of inadequate U.S. regulation of such operations .
It noted that workers at industrial animal farms can serve as a " bridging population , " transmitting animal - borne diseases to a wider community .
It also pointed to problems with disposing of animal waste , which industrial hog farms typically collect in enormous open - pit lagoons and spray on farm fields , putting nearby waters at risk of contamination with pollutants including viruses .
And lagoons sometimes fail catastrophically , spreading contamination over large areas .
For example , a spill from Sampson County 's Bearskin Farms in 1995 resulted in the release of about a million gallons of hog waste into a tributary of the Cape Fear River .
And that was n't even the state 's worst hog waste spill , a distinction held by Oceanview Farms in coastal Onslow County , where a 1995 lagoon failure contaminated the New River with 22 million gallons of hog waste -- twice the amount of pollution spilled from the Exxon Valdez .
The Oceanview disaster killed 15 million fish and closed almost 365,000 acres of coastal wetlands to shellfishing .
In 2007 , after years of work by environmental advocates , North Carolina became the first state in the country to ban the construction or expansion of lagoons and sprayfields on hog farms under the Swine Farm Environmental Performance Standards Act .
But that law does n't require the closure of existing lagoons , which remain a very real environmental health threat to numerous rural communities .
And of course , the law does nothing to address problems at hog farms in Mexico .
The Pew report offered a number of recommendations to reduce the factory farms ' threat to the public , including improved disease monitoring and tracking , improved regulation , and phasing out of intensive confinement .
Bob Martin , who directed the Pew study , told the N&O that the latest outbreak shows action is needed , given the very real potential for dangerous viral mixing at industrial hog farms :
" It 's a matter of when , not if , " Martin said .
" The structure of the system is the problem . "
If nothing else , the latest swine flu outbreak should spur governments to begin building a safer , more sustainable agricultural structure .
And they must reach across national lines to do so , since neither agribusiness nor viruses are held back by borders .
A New Type of Domain Name , A New Waste of Money
The Grouse has his doubts about the proposed .eco top - level domain
Joseph Levine has a 3,000 - square - foot home in San Jose that burns about $ 1,000 worth of electricity a month , more than 10 times what the average homeowner pays .
So it ’s no wonder Levine wanted to “ zero out ” his power bills by installing solar panels on his roof , which he did last month .
Not only will he now be living “ off the grid ” but his home , with 106 panels generating almost 23 kilowatts of energy , is officially the largest residential solar installation in San Jose — at least twice the size as the next largest residential installation , according to California Solar Initiative records .
“ I was pretty surprised , ” said the 34 - year - old San Jose native .
“ That ’s pretty big news .
But I ca n’t be the only one with power needs .
To me , it was a no - brainer to take some of the money I have and sink it into my house and get rid of a major bill . ”
Levine wo n’t disclose how much the job cost .
However , he said he will have an out - of - pocket cost of “ at least ” $ 100,000 after he receives a federal tax credit of about $ 45,000 and a state rebate of almost $ 30,000 .
“ I was pretty blown away .
I did n’t realize the government offered that , ” he said .
San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed , whose Green Vision plan for the city seeks to have 100,000 solar roofs in place by 2022 , applauds Levine ’s decision .
“ It ’s great to see our residents embracing San Jose ’s Green Vision , which sets bold goals for clean and renewable energy for our city ’s homes and businesses , ” Reed said in an e-mail .
“ I hope more residents will consider the incentives that are available now from the state and federal government for installing solar . ”
Molly Sterkel , supervisor for the California Solar Initiative at the California Public Utilities Commission , also commends Levine .
“ Our state has ambitious and important environmental goals , ” she said , “ and to meet those goals , we need to do everything we can to clean our energy supply mix .
This customer is making a difference and helping us get there sooner . ”
Levine , co-owner of the Comic Collector Shop in Mountain View , which buys , sells and trades new and vintage comic books , said he began exploring going solar about six months ago .
While he does n’t consider himself to be “ Mr. Green , ” he shares concerns about the environment .
But his main goal was to get rid of that mammoth monthly bill .
He works at both the shop and at home , where he uses computers and also does video editing .
That equipment , along with air conditioning , a pool and a jacuzzi , add up to a lot of electricity used by Levine and his family .
Levine hoped to be able to sell surplus power back to PG&E .
But PG&E spokeswoman Jennifer Zerwer said that while customers whose solar systems produce excess energy receive credits to apply against charges on their bill if they consume more energy than they produce , they currently ca n’t sell power back to the utility .
After months of researching solar companies online , Levine decided on Renewable Power Solutions to install his system , partly because it was based in San Jose , he said , and also because it had a track record .
The company , which has been in business since 1998 , has done more than 650 residential and commercial installations , according to CEO Jose Radzinsky .
“ What I can tell you about this house is that it will save the environment 700 tons of CO2 gases in 25 years , ” said Radzinsky , who said his company has helped about 200 other homeowners leave the grid .
Radzinsky said Levine ’s four - week installation was more complicated than most because the workers needed to take advantage of every angle of the roof .
“ The roof is pointing in different ways , so we had to be creative , ” he said of the installation , which weighs 3,000 pounds .
“ And usually this big a system would be ground mounted , not roof mounted . ”
Levine said that when he was told the job would require 106 panels , each measuring about 3 feet by 5 ﻿ 1 / 2 feet , it seemed “ a bit excessive . ”
“ But they mapped it out for me , talked me through it and showed me how it works , ” he said .
“ And I said , ‘ If that ’s what it takes , that ’s what it takes . ’ ”
The installation not only took more panels than most residential projects but also a lot more money .
The typical residential solar system , after rebates , costs $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 .
But while Levine ’s system cost several times that , he thinks he ’ll be able to pay off his investment in eight years .
Levine ’s new solar system is completely automated and will be attached to a Web - based monitoring system that ’s connected to Renewable Power Solutions .
It will allow Levine to track the solar installation ’s performance from anywhere in the world , telling him how much energy he is producing , and how much green gas he is saving the environment .
“ I think it looks pretty neat , actually .
It looks very futuristic , very modern , ” Levine said , though he added that “ my house definitely sticks out like a sore thumb . ”
Some neighbors have been intrigued and asked him about the panels , to which Levine quipped :
“ I told them , ‘ You ca n’t blame me anymore if we have a power outage . ’ ”

The government 's handling of the economic crisis has come under fire again after the International Monetary Fund warned that the UK will suffer a longer recession than other major countries .
The latest economic forecasts from the IMF , which come as unemployment today surged through the 2 million mark , show that the UK economy will contract by 3.8 % this year - a much more severe slump than the government has admitted .
The IMF also predicted that Britain will be the only country to keep shrinking through 2010 .
Shadow chancellor George Osborne seized on the forecast , saying that it showed that the recession in Britain will be longer and deeper because of Labour 's economic policies .
" These IMF forecasts show that Britain is set to have the longest recession of all the major economies , " said Osborne .
" It is further evidence that Gordon Brown 's economic model is fundamentally broken and his policies on the recession are n't working . "
If the IMF 's figures are correct , they could shatter Labour 's chances of winning a fourth consecutive term in office .
A Guardian / ICM opinion poll published today shows that if it can show that the economy is recovering by May 2010 - the likely date of the next election .
The figures were not expected to be officially published until April , but they were released yesterday by Teresa Ter -Minassian , an adviser to IMF managing director Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
They show that the US economy is expected to contract by 2.6 % this year , the eurozone by 3.2 % , and Japan by 5 % .
The overall world economy is forecast to shrink by 0.6 % this year - the first annual global contraction since the second world war .
2 million , and counting
The government faces more criticism after it was confirmed this morning that unemployment smashed through the 2 million mark to reach its highest level since 1997 .
Analysts said the grim figures reinforce fears that the grinding economic crisis will send unemployment above 3 million within two years .
Howard Archer of Global Insight predicted that unemployment will peak at 3.3 million on the ILO measure around the end of 2010 .
Accountancy firm BDO Story Hayward warned on Monday that it expects 36,000 business to fail in 2009 , and another 39,000 in 2010 - which would help to send the jobless figures soaring .
One of the main contributors to the jump in unemployment in January was the collapse of high street chain Woolworths , which had employed around 30,000 people .
But jobs were also lost across the economy , including 400 IT staff at Barclays , 450 at Jaguar Land Rover , and several hundred at Land of Leather .
Unemployment has been rising steadily since January 2008 , with the pace increasing as retailers , manufacturers and banks all suffering from the downturn .
There are now 10 jobseekers chasing every vacancy , putting pressure on job centres around the country .
As this interactive graphic shows , parliamentary constituencies across the country have been hit by the increase in unemployment .
The picture is just as bleak across the Atlantic , where unemployment has hit a 28 - year high .
More than 600,000 jobs are being lost each month - the highest figure since the end of the second world war .
Even those who manage to cling onto their jobs are suffering a drop in income .
Engineering firm Renishaw has asked staff to accept a 20 % cut in pay , while carworkers at Toyota have agreed a 10 % wage cut .
Some government ministers are concerned that women will bear the brunt of the impending job cuts , while economist Danny Blanchflower is very concerned about the impact of youth unemployment .
Blanchflower , who sits on the Bank of England 's rate - setting committee , has warned that losing a job early in one 's career can have a devastating long - term impact .
Actor Jackie Earle Haley is yet another proof that F. Scott Fitzgerald was wrong about American lives not having second acts ;
Haley ’s career has come in at least two phases , maybe three , depending on how you ’re counting .
As a child actor , he had a thriving career , starting on TV ( in Wait Till Your Father Gets Home , then with guest appearances on the likes of The Partridge Family , The Waltons , and Marcus Welby , M.D. ) and moving into film , most memorably as bad - boy Kelly Leak in the Bad News Bears films .
Post - adolescence all but killed his acting career , which effectively ended in 1993 , with the likes of Maniac Cop 3 : Badge Of Silence ; eventually , after struggling with low - level jobs and substance abuse , he found work as a director , launching his own agency to make commercials , infomercials , and corporate training videos .
But in 2006 , director Steven Zaillian sought him out for the role of Sugar Boy in the Sean Penn thriller All The King ’s Men .
The same year , he earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination and a slew of film - critics association awards for his role as haunted child molester Ronnie McGorvey in Little Children .
And now he ’s back on the screen in a starring role as psychotic masked vigilante Rorschach in Zack Snyder ’s blockbuster - to - be Watchmen , based on Alan Moore ’s classic graphic novel .
The A.V. Club recently spoke to Haley about his careers , his commercials , and playing a maniac through a mask .

The A.V. Club :
How do you go about preparing to play a character who ’s going to be hidden under a mask and a bulky costume for most of his time onscreen ?
Jackie Earle Haley : [ Laughs . ]
Huh ? [ Laughs . ]
First , preparing for this guy , I did n’t even consider the mask .
I think it first started with really gazing into the abyss of this guy , and looking at his incredibly victimized childhood .
You know , his mother being a prostitute and an alcoholic and a drug addict , and the beatings that he took , and the fact that she was kind of going from john to john , and from man to man .
He just seemed to be so low on the priority list that he slowly became tweaked to the point of no return .
To where something had to give .
And I think how he found his place in this world was through this black - and - white sense of justice .

AVC : So you were thinking about what ’s under the mask , and never how people would see Rorschach from the outside , how you could bring him across through all these physical barriers ?
JEH : I got there , but my initial preparation on him was just kind of looking at him .
When we started getting to the mask part , it kind of scared me , because as an actor , your face is your main tool .
And covering that up was kind of scary .
But on the other hand , you ’re playing Rorschach .
You throw that mask on , you throw that fedora on , and the rest of the outfit , it ’s incredibly motivating .
And I think I just started to fully embrace that , with the knowledge — do the work internally , as you would with any part , and let the external part take care of itself .
But still , as a storyteller and as an actor , you know you ’re covered up , but you want to go to the monitors and check in on stuff .
And every now and then , I ’d — it did n’t happen a lot — but once in a while , I ’d look and think , “ Hmm , what ’s going on internally is n’t coming through at all , ” so I ’d have to animate the outfit .
[ Laughs . ]

AVC : You ’ve talked a lot in interviews about building your character in Little Children by drawing on your own family relationships , by finding out what was important to him , and comparing it to what was important to you .
Was there a similar process here ?
JEH :
You know , this one was a little bit different .
I think I did some of that , but not to the same degree .
There was just so much in this book , and this character is so fleshed - out , and his experience is so psychotic , I kind of glommed onto the statement of Dr. Long .
Dr. Long got to know Rorschach by gazing into the abyss , and I had to gaze into the abyss of Rorschach for months .
And I think if anything , instead of me finding myself in Rorschach , I think I was searching for and started to find some of Rorschach in me .
I think playing this guy has made me a bit more cynical .
Advertisement
AVC : Was that a concern ?
A lot of people seem to think that Heath Ledger fell apart because he got too close to such an extreme character , that he internalized him too much and it disturbed him .
Were you worried by that example at all ?
JEH : Well … no .
No , it did n’t concern me , but surprisingly , there ’s a little more effect from it than I would ’ve anticipated .
And part of that is , in playing the part , I would isolate myself in my apartment and kind of zone out on the material and Rorschach ’s past , and try to look at this world through the prism of a Rorschach - ian filter .
Advertisement
AVC : Were you familiar with Watchmen before the movie ?
JEH : No .
AVC : Various people have been planning to make Watchmen as a film for 20 years , and there was a long line of people slated to play each part .
Was there competition for the role ?
Did you audition ?
Advertisement
JEH :
When I first heard about this , I read about it on the Internet .
People were suggesting me for this role , and I think this might have been when Paul Greengrass had it .
I remember looking into it a little bit .
I had seen the characters , never read anything , but I had actually seen Rorschach somewhere .
Not sure where , a friend ’s book or something .
But cut to a while later , I ’m acting again , and I hear Zack ’s doing this , and I dove in and started to read the material .
Starting with the script , and then the book , and then I kind of went after the part , only to find out that it looked like they were going down more of a movie - star road .
And that was kind of a bummer .
And I remember at one point , I even called my agent , and he was like , “ Dude , let it go , man .
It ’s gone , they ’re going this other direction . ”
A couple months later , he called me up and he says , “ Hey , it looks like they changed their mind .
Or something happened , they ’re not going down that road .
I ’m not sure what ’s going on , but how about you do an audition tape and send it to Zack ?
Let ’s not wait for them to ask . ”
So I got a bunch of friends together , I put together this little Halloween sort of Rorschach - ian costume and made this cheesy audition tape , and we sent it in to Zack .
And a couple weeks later , he called me in for a meeting , and I went in and talked with him , and he showed me a storyboard of what he was thinking , and we talked about the character for a good hour or two , and we shook hands .
And a couple weeks later , I got the call and he chose me .
And was just thrilled out of my gourd .
AVC : In both this and Little Children , you ’re playing a psychotic who ’s specifically noted for being grubby and weedy and physically unattractive .
Do you worry about getting typecast ?
Advertisement
JEH : [ Laughs . ]
I ’m an actor , I worry about everything .
You know , Ronnie and Rorschach are so different to me .
I realize that you can draw some parallels , and I did .
They ’re both incredibly alone in this world .
But they ’re also opposites .
Ronnie is compelled to victimize others for his own selfish and self - centric needs , and that is so opposite to what Rorschach is .
That is absolutely what Rorschach fights against .
I played this pedophile in Little Children , and in Watchmen , I kill that guy .
[ pagebreak ]
AVC : In Watchmen , you ’re playing opposite your Little Children co-star Patrick Wilson again .
Was that a coincidence , or did one of you have any effect on the other getting the role ?
Advertisement
JEH :
That was total coincidence , and I think — if I understand this right — when Zack saw Little Children , he saw Dan immediately in Patrick .
And I can see that .
Patrick looks like he walked right off the comic - book page .
And I think Zack said the first time he thought about me for the role was when he saw me around the award shows .
On the red carpet and stuff .
Did n’t dawn on him when he was watching the movie .
AVC : What kind of a director is Zack Snyder with actors ?
Does he believe in rehearsals ?
Does he work closely with people building characters , or is he more hands off ?
Advertisement
JEH : No , he ’s very hands - on .
Very thorough .
AVC : Did he sit down with you individually in preproduction and talk about the characters and how to build them ?
Advertisement
JEH : Oh yeah .
We shot and talked at length several times about what makes this guy tick .
And then we would also do it in groups , like Patrick and I would have a meeting with Zack because of our characters ’ relationship .
And I think that Patrick had a few of those meetings , because he has a relationship with Malin [ Akerman ] ’s character , know what I mean ?
So we ’d have these meetings where we ’d talk about the dynamics of these guys and their past , and what all this means to them now , and where they are , and all that stuff .
AVC : You mentioned that Patrick Wilson looks like he walked right off the page .
Most of the film looks like it fell right off the page .
Advertisement
JEH : Is n’t that a trip ?
AVC : It ’s all very specific , with the lighting and composition and angles of the shots made to look exactly like the comic panels .
Was there a lot of fiddling around with that on set ?
Was there a lot of “ You ’ve got to move an inch to the right and lift your hand a little more so it can be exactly like the reference panel ? ”
Advertisement
JEH : Sometimes .
Not so much by the example that you ’re making .
It was n’t like — that ’s more of a question for Zack , but I do n’t remember .
I think we were all , every last one of us , compelled to reference the book in the morning .
Before any scene you were going to do , you ’d read the scene out of the book .
And we were all looking for our own visual cues to do things similar to what was in the book .
So a lot of what you ’re saying was in there , but it was n’t like this exercise of “ This has to look exactly like the panel . ”
It ’s more like an adaptation , but that ’s a much better question for Zack .
AVC : Was it a different experience from other films you ’ve done as an adult ?
JEH : Gosh , yeah .
It was thoroughly different .
AVC : In what ways ?
JEH : Gosh , everything .
I do n’t even know where to — like what we first started talking about , doing a character who ’s covered up through the whole movie , and geez , the scope of the film .
And just the sheer love from the director , which was contagious through the cast and the entire crew .
The sheer love of the source material .
So it was like fans of the source material trying to make this and be responsible to the creators and the fans .
Everything about it was just super - charged .
It was all on 10 .
It was such an amazing experience .
And that ’s not to say that other films were n’t , but it was Watchmen .
I do n’t know what to say !
Advertisement
AVC : It ’s mostly that you ’ve spoken often in interviews about what an intense , visceral experience acting is for you .
But you ’ve never been on such a big - budget , effects - heavy , green - screen movie before .
Some actors complain that they do n’t get the same charge when the acting is so broken up into tiny scenes , and dependent on the tech .
JEH :
You know , it was just so different .
It ’s kind of like apples and oranges .
You ’re right , some of it was choppy , but so much of it was n’t .
A lot of the actiony stuff would kind of get choppy , and even some of that scene with Bryce .
[ Spoiler warning : Bryce is a murderer whom Rorschach kills .
— ed. ]
That , surprisingly , was filmed at two different times .
We shot half of it one week , and I thought we were done with it , and then a week later , we were going back in .
I ’m like , “ What are we doing ? ”
And it ’s like , “ Oh , the dummy ’s ready . ”
And there ’s this dummy that looks just like the actor .
Advertisement
And we go back into that room , and that ’s such a turning point for this character , so I ’m dealing with all of it very — Rorschach ’s emotional experience of crossing that line and deciding to forever become Rorschach and leave [ his original identity ] behind .
It was so emotionally charged .
For it to be broken up over time , yeah , it ’s tough .
But at the same time , when we did those moments , we took our time , and it did n’t seem broken - up when were doing it .
And it was a trip , too , when we got back and it was time to do the rest of that scene with the dummy .
It was freaky , because it was so lifelike .
There was something about that …
First off , the dummy looked real .
Then I took off my glasses , and it looks even more real .
Then I put on my hood , and I ’m looking through a slight gauze , right ?
Even more real .
Then I ’m starting to wield the weapon .
The dummy felt incredibly real , and you layer that in on top of emotionally what ’s going on with the character , and it was just fucking freaky .
AVC : With your acting career taking off again , have you had to scale back your directing work ?

JEH : A little bit , but I ’ve still been able to , for the most part , be of service to my friends and clients in Texas that I ’ve been working with for years .
Whenever I ’m available , I like to try to be available to them and help them with their projects .
AVC : Are you using your acting career at this point to expand into more directing work ?
Advertisement
JEH :
You know , at this point , my focus right now is acting , but I think at some point in time , I definitely want to do some directing , I ’m just not sure when .
But it ’s not on my plate big - time right now , just because I ’m busy , and I ’m having such a great time .
AVC : Do you have any particular piece you ’re particularly proud of having directed ?
One thing you ’d point to as showcasing your vision as a director ?
Advertisement
JEH : No , not at this point .
I think I ’ve got a lot of wonderfully talented , creative directors I ’ve worked with in Texas , but the market we ’re in , they kind of have to write to that .
I think we ’ve done some cool , simple spots .
I was very comfortable in Texas , and getting ready to push out into national stuff , try to get to that national - type creative , and then I got sidetracked with this stuff .
I think this stuff is sound , but it ’s not like this crazy good national commercial stuff like Zack does , you know .
AVC : You ’ve said your acting career got rebooted when Steve Zaillian sought you out of the blue for All The King ’s Men .
The Washington Post even said he spent two months trying to find you , because you were so far off the radar .
Why , after all this time , did he specifically want you so badly for that role ?
What was in it that only you could give him ?

JEH :
You know , I ’m not sure .
I asked Steve that question when I flew out to meet him .
And he was like , “ Well , I remembered your work from 20 - odd years ago , and I always felt there was something about it .
I thought you might be right for this , and I wanted to see what you looked like now . ”
And then he said , on this bizarre side note , “ And you know , I called Sean [ Penn ] and said , ‘ Hey , who do you think of for Sugar Boy ? ’
And Sean said , ‘ How about Jackie Earle Haley ? ’ ”
And he ’s like , “ I just wrote his name on a short list yesterday . ”
And so it was bizarre that they both thought of me independently , and I had been gone for 20 years , or 15 , or whatever it was .
AVC : Did you learn anything as a child actor that ’s helped you as an adult actor , either in terms of performance or surviving in Hollywood ?
Advertisement
JEH : Well , certainly as an actor .
I do n’t know what I could say specifically , except that everything I ’ve learned as a kid of course must somehow play into what I do now .
I think when everything kind of drifted away , I had to go out into the world and learn how to emotionally be okay with all that , which to me was a decades - long process .
But also I happened to find my way in life , to find a living , to figure out what I wanted to be when I grow up .
I think all of that now probably helps me .
It probably gives me more life experience to draw from .
I just love this one , it ’s not what I was expecting ( I was thinking they were going to use the potato itself for fuel since it ’s very starchy ) , and I ’m really
impressed that they managed to get enough juice out of a potato - based battery to start a fire with , very nifty .
What ’s happening here is that the fluoride in the toothpaste and salt are forming an electrolyte which is reacting to the copper and zinc ( one wire is copper , the other is zinc - coated : this is key , make sure you get this right ) such that each wire is
an anode and cathode , waiting 5 minutes allows the chemicals to react and build up an electric charge so the potato thing is now essentially acting as a battery , and then the heat produced by shorting the two wires together is igniting the cotton .
You can get a similar reaction with a 9 - volt battery and some steel wool ( video of that is below , very cool and it takes far less time and prep than the potato thing , so that one is for the lazy people and this first one is for the DIY nuts ) , here ’s the first video on how to make fire with a potato :
Ok , here ’s the video on how to do the 9 - volt battery and steel wool thing–personally I think this would be a great little kit to
carry around as a backup fire - starter if you were camping or out and about in the woods , you could very easily just stick the 9 - volt and the steel wool in some watertight bags ( separate bags , obviously , because you do n’t want the leads on the battery contacting the steel wool while it ’s stored ) .
Here ’s the video :
Oh , by the way , try touching a 9 - volt battery to your tongue–it ’s not enough to hurt you or anything , but you will feel a bit of a tingle due to the conductive nature of your saliva

“ To my mind it is wholly irresponsible to go into the world incapable of preventing violence , injury , crime , and death .
How feeble is the mindset to accept defenselessness .
How unnatural .
How cheap .
How cowardly .
How pathetic . ” ~ Ted Nugent
Women never cease to amaze me .
The majority of them are still " afraid " of guns .
Afraid , as in " oohhhh , they are so scary . "
They say things like " I do n’t like them around " and " they ’re dangerous . "
I know of women who have defense - minded , pro-gun husbands and they will not let their guy talk about those nasty things in their presence .
Shhh , the children will hear , or , they might actually see an evil gun !
Keep them locked away .
Do n’t tell the neighbors you have a gun in our house , or we ’ll be outcasts .
And in the background you can almost hear another feeble Oprah sermon keeping women stupid , but oh , they feel good about themselves and their newfound self - esteem .
All the time , women are shocked , shocked ! to hear that I have a gun , and worse , I have several guns .
And then , oh no , I actually carry one with me .
That ’s so odd , they think .
Oh she ’s different .
Why more than one gun ?
She must be the aggressive type .
After all , the Oprah way is to trust everyone and insist that all people have good intentions always .
Although I tend to think that most women do n’t make sense , period , I especially believe this concerning the gun issue .
It ’s not only difficult to get women to come around to wanting a gun of their own , but they still ca n’t get to the point where they will understand and accept why others want to own them .
Let ’s face it — women are more vulnerable to attack because , most likely , their aggressor will be a man .
Women are physically weaker , and criminals know that we are less willing to be mentally prepared for aggression because , unlike men , most of us just are n’t wired to be combative .
A woman ’s attacker will be bigger , stronger , and faster than her , and by nature they will be more aggressive , and that ’s before considering any mental or drug problem that may be associated with a criminal attack .
So why do women not want to take that into consideration and equalize the situation by learning to use and love guns ?
Dr. Thomas Szasz , libertarian scholar and Professor of Psychiatry at Syracuse University , once stated , " self - defense is not merely our legal right but our moral duty ; because women are more vulnerable than men , their need and obligation to defend themselves is even greater than that of men . "
Dr. Szasz is a wise man .
Here ’s my favorite scene : a woman is walking in a parking garage or parking lot , all alone , wearing 3 - inch skinny heels , head down , flicking her mane of endless hair , and chatting mindlessly on the phone .
" Blah , blah , blah , blah , and blah , " but not a single shred of awareness about the inherent dangers of time and place , who is around her , and what they are doing .
She is a Bambi in the woods .
I witness this kind of thing all the time .
Women tend to function in the fog of the unknown , making themselves easy targets .
The first rule of self - defense is awareness .
Situational awareness can , and will , save your life .
Be conscious about your surroundings .
Stay off the phone , keep your head up , and survey the area around you .
Walk boldly .
You do not want to give a potential attacker the impression that you are an easy target .
Avoidance is the ideal .
How many times do women think about this ?
Probably never .
But then again , this is not meant to be a self - defense , how - to guide for women , but rather , a call to women to stand up and take control of their personal security .
Women who have the habit of entering the mindless , no - think zone while consistently ignoring potential threats are ripe for something awful to happen .
Remember , criminals who attack women frequently scrutinize potential prey for easy pickings .
They do n’t want to tangle with a woman who appears to be alert or tough as nails .
They are looking for women who are unaware , unassertive , and fragile .
Women tend to take a white - picket - fence - and - rose view of the world more often than they should .
They think that the world is made of gingerbread houses and buckets of goodwill just waiting to be poured upon them .
They believe that when evil takes place , it happens anywhere but in their own backyard .
It happens on the evening news , but not to them .
One reason that women need to get over their hostility to guns is because the current environment — economic depression , looming inflation , and widespread unemployment — will bring forth a new criminal class due to desperation .
In addition , the established criminal class will ramp up their activity .
Carjackings , home invasions , robberies , abductions , and rape will plague women in hard economic times .
So how do we get women to dig guns ?
Many women will experience frustration if you keep stressing guns as a method of self - defense and get right to the point of mentally preparing to kill someone to save a life .
They may not be ready to " go there " if they are already hostile to guns .
Ease ’em on in with things to break down their intolerance .
Most women are introduced to guns at the range , or perhaps by just shootin ’ stuff on private property somewhere out in the country .
Husbands , fathers , brothers — they all make good first - time instructors because they are trusted by the first - time female shooter .
Starting out with the smaller guns is less intimidating and therefore works in favor of a woman gaining confidence about her ability .
Women do tend to be frightened by larger guns .
They ’ll come right out and say it .
I recently added a new carry choice — the Ruger LCP .380 , a 9.5 ounce pocketful of reliable defense that is very slim and easy to conceal for us smaller ladies , especially when wearing summer clothing .
I have found out that ladies new to guns are attracted to this thing because of its size and non-threatening appearance .
But watch out !
This gun has some temperamental recoil , especially when loaded with high - velocity ammo .
However , once women learn to shoot the smaller caliber pistols and rifles and grow their confidence , they get a hankering to shoot the bigger guns , and it becomes a thrilling experience .
Knowing that they can handle a .308 rifle or a .45 pistol tends to bring on miles of smiles .
One thing about guns that should appeal to women is their artistic quality .
Guns are beautiful works of art .
Not only are guns attractively manufactured , but also , modern design and engineering methods make gun ownership for women a real option .
There are guns for small hands , small trigger fingers , and even pink guns .
You can buy little , pink rifles for young girls who are just starting to shoot .
You can laugh , but this may invite young girls to aspire to guns whereas they might not find another reason to be attracted to them .
One thing I notice that people at gun shops tend to do is to steer women toward revolvers as the " best choice . "
Because revolvers are thought to be simpler and it requires less practice to load and shoot them , women are steered toward them , oftentimes without being given other workable options .
A .38 revolver is considered to be the handgun for beginners .
Though it is a great gun , this assumption is wrong and it is a risky attitude to take with a female customer whose life may depend on her ability to learn to master her gun .
In fact , a lightweight .38 revolver can have some big recoil , especially in smaller , weaker hands .
But mostly , a lady should never be swayed from looking at a semi-auto such as a 9 mm or .40 , or even a .45 .
Instead , gun shop salespeople should stress the pros and cons between the two , and then impress upon a female newbie that the semi-auto requires more training time but offers many advantages .
Every woman has different needs and her options should be fairly presented so she can make an informed decision that best suits her requirements in the long term .
Boston T. Party , in his superb book , Boston ’s Gun Bible , states in his chapter on women and guns , " I would only recommend a revolver if you do not have the extra time and / or money for a quality semi-auto . "
In fact , instead of slapping a revolver in her hand , it should be stressed to a woman purchasing her first gun that she needs guidance beyond her very basic CPL ( Concealed Pistol License ) class — she must move well beyond the basics and acquire additional training .
A woman who buys a pistol must take supplementary courses such as a concealed weapons course and at least one defensive pistol class .
This will educate her on the use of her gun in varied circumstances and will foster an extraordinary level of confidence .
Only when you really learn to master that firearm do you come to appreciate and love it .
Until that happens , a woman will be wary , lack confidence , and will reject the firearm more often than she covets it .
I came to love guns early on .
My Dad started me off shooting a Winchester rifle at seven years old .
I was fortunate that my entire childhood meant spending the whole summer , each year , at our cottage in Northern Michigan , out in the sticks , thirteen miles removed from the nearest small town .
We had a gravel pit nearby where we shot targets , cans , and other objects .
Once I learned that guns had a purpose , and that they could be handled safely and skillfully , I fell in love with them and wanted my own .
I saw a similar occurrence last month while I was down in rural Tennessee .
I watched a ten - year - old girl shooting a Ruger Mark III 22 /45 , her face plastered with endless smiles each time that little peashooter popped and knocked down another soda bottle .
She reminded me so much of myself at that age when , after unloading a full magazine she ’d turn to the group and say , " Can I do that again ? "
Of course , " again " is never - ending because of the sheer joy experienced while learning real world skills from a trusted adult .
In talking to different women , along with firearms instructors , I find that one of the biggest obstacles for women in actively carrying a pistol is getting to the point where they believe they can take another human life in defense of their own life or the life of a loved one .
Indeed , this involves some serious reflection prior to ever carrying a gun or having one in the home for purposes of self - defense .
I ’ve had CPL instructors tell me about women breaking down and crying upon discussion of this topic during their courses .
However , women need to understand the value of their lives , and the lives of their children , and how life can be so easily snuffed out by one person — or a group of people — who harbor a cruel and vicious , criminal agenda .
It is essential that a woman train to develop a mindset where she can take another human life where and when her life is in immediate danger from an assailant ( or assailants ) .
That can take time , and quite often , that mindset will develop with further training and a better understanding of how to handle the dangers she may confront .
Viewing the world through fuzzy - lined Oprah glasses just wo n’t suffice anymore .
Women need to stop living the dumbed - down life that is being sold to them by daytime TV and brainless magazines and novels .
They need to stop pretending that every incident in life can be coped with by invoking yet another worthless fluff statement that exclaims , for the twenty - fifth time , how " happy " and non-judgmental and politically correct they are .
Being hapless and clueless is not a virtue , no matter what your chromosome factor .
To steal a few words from Ted Nugent , a pull - no - punches advocate of self - defense rights , a person who accepts defenselessness is unnatural , cowardly , and pathetic .
Ladies , boycott that mentality by turning Oprah off and giving guns , and your life , a chance .

From my brother , via e-mail , “ I cant decide if this ( login required @ NYT ) is somewhat disturbing or incredibly disturbing .
Oh , wait — it ’s incredibly disturbing . ”
The NYT ’s Jennifer Steinhauer reports on an Explorer Scout program , indoctrinating training American youths — some as young as 13 and a half — to preserve the Empire , which of course means learning how to shoot brown people from poor countries trying to make a better life for their families and learning how to destroy lives by perpetuating the war on drugs .
Explorers were instructed on how to quiet an obstreperous lookout .
“ Put him on his face and put a knee in his back , ” a Border Patrol agent explained .
“ I guarantee that he ’ll shut up . ” “ Cathy Noriego , also 16 , said she was attracted by the guns .
The group uses compressed - air guns — known as airsoft guns , which fire tiny plastic pellets — in the training exercises , and sometimes they shoot real guns on a closed range .
“ I like shooting them , ” Cathy said .
“ I like the sound they make .
It gets me excited . ” ”
Children , malleable minds , lured by the sound of gunfire .
Hell in a motherf * cking handbag .
There ’s some sick irony when teenagers with surnames like Noriego are learning how keep people , who were unfortunately born on the “ wrong ” side of some arbitrary and purely imaginary line , out of their country .
And I ca n’t help but think that many of these children would n’t be here today if there had been a draconian border policy a cenutry or two hence in order to preserve America ’s “ Manifest Destiny ” .

About the author
( NewsTarget ) According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke , most researchers believe exposure to some kind of toxin or toxins in the environment triggers the development of Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) -- the degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that impairs motor skills ( including walking ) , speech and other functions .
Pesticides have long been on the list of possible suspects as a PD - causing toxin .
But a new study just published in theby University of California at Los Angeles ( UCLA ) scientists appears to be the " smoking gun " that places pesticides at the top of that list .
They found that
In previous animal studies and cell cultures , researchers have shown pesticides spark a neurodegenerative process that leads to Parkinson 's disease .
The UCLA scientists , however , are the first to provide evidence for a similar process in humans .
They came up with their alarming results by analyzing an epidemiological study of Central Valley , California , residents .
The region is one of the nation 's top food - growing regions and crops like potatoes , dry beans and tomatoes have long been routinely sprayed with fungicides , herbicides and pesticides .
For their study , the UCLA researchers enrolled 368 longtime residents of Central Valley who had been diagnosed with Parkinson 's and 341 other PD - free residents as a control group .
Their analysis found that people who lived within 500 meters of fields sprayed with two pesticides , maneb and paraquat , between 1974 and 1999 had an extraordinary 75 percent increased risk for Parkinson's .
What 's more , people who were diagnosed with PD by the age of 60 or younger were found to have been at much higher risk because they had been exposed to maneb , paraquat or both in combination between 1974 and 1989 , during the time they were children , teens or young adults .
In these people , early pesticide exposure had increased their risk for the disease by four to six times .
" The results confirmed two previous observations from animal studies .
One , that exposure to multiple chemicals may increase the effect of each chemical .
That 's important , since humans are often exposed to more than one pesticide in the environment .
And second , that the timing of exposure is also important , " UCLA scientist Beate Ritz , professor of epidemiology at the UCLA School of Public Health , said in a statement to media about her research team 's findings .
She added that this is the first epidemiological study to provide strong evidence that maneb and paraquat work together to become highly neurotoxic in humans and greatly increase the risk of PD .
What makes this particularly concerning is that the UCLA data " suggests that the critical window of exposure to toxicants may have occurred years before the onset of motor symptoms when a diagnosis of Parkinson 's is made , " Dr. Ritz said .

We found another " missing link " this month .
Or , to be more precise , a team of Canadian and American scientists found a missing link between modern seals and their land - dwelling ancestors .
A report in this week 's Nature magazine described fossils of an extinct land - dwelling animal , now called Puijila darwini , discovered in the Canadian arctic .
Its remarkable skeletal structure provides a spectacular demonstration of how evolution modified the limbs of a land - dwelling animal to produce the flippers of modern seals and sea lions .
So , another mystery is solved , and even more evidence is piled up in favor of Darwin 's theory of evolution – as if we did n't have enough already .
But there is another " missing link " that many of us have n't found , and in many ways it is the one that matters most .
It is the link that would join us the rest of the living world .
We humans have a tendency to see ourselves as completely different from other animals , and the way in which large segments of the public continue to reject the theory of evolution is just one symptom of that malaise .
Americans , of course , are famously skeptical of evolution , but so is a large segment of the British population – nearly 40 % according to one recent poll .
No matter what you hear from anti-evolution groups in the US and UK , lack of scientific evidence is n't the problem .
The discovery of Puijila darwini was just the latest in a spectacular series of fossil finds demonstrating how evolution produced the first land vertebrates , the first whales , and even the first humans .
Our own genomes carry the story of evolution , written in DNA , the language of molecular genetics , and the narrative is unmistakable .
No , scientific evidence is n't really what bothers most people about evolution .
What bugs them is that evolution carries with it a message they just do n't want to hear .
That message is that we not only live in a natural world , but we are part of it , we emerged from it .
Or more accurately , we emerged with it .
To them , that means we are just animals .
Our lives are an accident , and our existence is without purpose , meaning or value .
My concern for those who hold that view is n't just that they are wrong on science , wrong about the nature of the evidence , and mistaken on a fundamental point of biology .
It 's that they are missing something grand and beautiful and personally enriching .
Evolution is n't just a take - it - or - leave - it story about where we came from .
It 's an epic at the centre of life itself .
It tells us we are part of nature in every respect .
Far from robbing our lives of meaning , it instils an appreciation for the beautiful , enduring , and ultimately triumphant phenomenon of life .
Seen in this light , the human presence is not a mistake of nature or a random accident , but a direct consequence of the characteristics of the universe .
What evolution tells us is that we are part of a grand , dynamic , and ever - changing fabric of life that covers our planet .
Even to a person of faith , in fact especially to a person of faith , an understanding of the evolutionary process should only deepen their appreciation of the scope and wisdom of the creator 's work .
Acknowledging that " missing link " between ourselves and the rest of the living world does n't demean human life – it enhances it .
We may be animals , but we are not just animals .
We are the only ones who can truly appreciate , as Darwin put it , that there is " grandeur in this view of life , " and indeed there is .
To accept evolution is n't just to acknowledge the obvious – that the evidence behind it is overwhelming – it is to open one 's eyes to the " endless forms most wonderful and most beautiful " that life has generated and continues to produce .
It is to become a knowing participant , in the truest sense , in the living world of which we are all a part .
In an age where our own excesses as a species threaten so much of the living world , it is about time we saw through the metaphor of the missing link , and took charge our of responsibilities to our living kin on planet earth .
the fallout from medical luddism
Unhinged anti-vaccination activism is starting to amass a body count as children are stating to suffer and die from preventable diseases .
A vaccinated and unvaccinated child exposed to the same smallpox source in Leicester , England in the early 1900s
When I was a child , I was vaccinated against mumps , measles , smallpox and a lot of other diseases .
It was done at schools ( this was in Eastern Europe ) and at doctors ’ offices on a regular schedule .
We knew that no vaccine was 100 % safe and 100 % effective , but we also knew that being vaccinated could make it a lot easier to combat common diseases by training my immune system for it .
Oh and by the way , I would also help many of the children around me not to get sick by upholding herd immunity .
Now , after decades of vaccinations , there are people going after drug companies and doctors , shocked that a vaccine is n’t a total , 100 % safeguard against anything and everything , convinced that either the vaccines or the “ toxins ” in them or the angle at which the doctor inserts the needle or whatever the current argument might be , that vaccines cause autism regardless of the proof to the contrary .
Thanks to these anti-vaxx activists , babies in Australia are dying from diseases they should never have died from because the vaccination rate is too low for herd immunity and suppressed infectious illnesses are making a comeback .
Take a look at this segment from the Australian talk show Sunday Night .
There are three very important things you should note .
The first is that the anti-vaccine parents in the audience are afraid .
They ’re not sure about the information , they find conflicting reports that come from doctors and well researched sources and spin from anti-vaxxers like Meryl Dorey .
Legitimate science can and will often lose in a competition with parental fear and uncertainty , something that Dorey and her disciples capitalize on to keep spreading their message of how dangerous vaccines supposedly are while being unable to bring a single , proven , indisputable case of people dying from routine immunization into the public eye .
Note again the shock and outrage coming from the “ revelation ” that vaccines are not 100 % safe !
Can you name a single thing that ’s 100 % safe ?
Name me a medicine that ’s 100 % effective and has no side effects .
If the guideline for approval and use was 100 % or nothing , you could say goodbye to all of modern medicine .
And actually , to all medicine in general because no two bodies and metabolic rates are identical .
( Except maybe in twins . )
The second thing you should note is the outrage that the government dares to pay doctors to cover expenses in immunizing children .
How dare they ?!
Does this not mean that doctors are slaves of the government who are by default slaves of Big Pharma , the evil monsters who ’ll kill your kids for an extra dollar ?!
Um , no .
It ’s just blatant anti-corporatism .
Taking care of kids costs money as every parent should know .
The governments of various countries try to help cut down costs incurred by doctors by paying to keep vaccinations on time and on schedule because they know they ’ll have to spend less on healthcare overall when the populace is properly immunized .
In most developed nations , governments use tax receipts to heavily subsidize healthcare and the last thing they and the taxpayers need , are outbreaks of the 1950s rearing their heads again .
Doctors get paid to do a lot of things .
Why ?
They run a business .
Does this mean that anything they do must be a conflict of interest and bad for you just because there ’s money involved ?
Even non-profit groups running hospitals and major healthcare centers pay their doctors for vaccinations , surgeries , exams and therapy .
Just because there ’s money involved does n’t make it evil .
And yet it ’s being made out to be by people scared out of their minds by devoted doomsayers like Meryl Dorey and Jenny McCarthy .
Finally , I want to call your attention to how Dorey suggests treating the whooping cough .
Homeopathy .
Yes , to use vaccines is to toy with your child ’s life .
But giving your kids water and pretending it has memory of a half a molecule of some plant root or mystical salts is perfectly a - okay according to her in an interview regarding the case being discussed in the clip above .
( about 8:30 into the report )
Maybe , just maybe , her kids had a really bad cough from a cold or the flu and would ’ve shaken it off on their own ?
It ’s not like she sought medical help from a hospital or a doctor as she admits before stating that homeopathic remedies worked to cure her kids .
Then , after stating that no one dies from whooping cough , she does an about face on the next talk show when the parents of a baby who died from whooping cough are face to face with her .
I wonder shy she did n’t wonder aloud if the parents tried homeopathic remedies since they worked so well for her kids …
Funny enough , her son says he feels grateful he did n’t have to “ be put through the vaccinations . ”
Considering that his mother keeps telling him that kids are dying left and right from vaccines on a daily basis , of course he is .
I would be too if all I heard my entire life was how evil vaccines and the companies that manufacture them are and how they ’ll slay me for a dollar with the help of doctors and governments .
And that brings us back to a previous post about the anti-vaxx movement .
The bottom line here is that groups like McCarthy ’s and Dorey ’s are a modern incarnation of Luddism combined with alternative New Ageisms that see evildoers holding big syringes filled with who knows what at every turn , demeaning homeopathy because they supposedly can’t get patents on making products from herbs .
Even though they can and have done so for over 100 years .
The bottom line is that vaccines work .
When was the last time you knew someone with smallpox ?
Or polio ?
To hype up their risks and muddle medical literature with random anecdotes based on personal emotions or a testimony of a trial lawyer who sees an autism trial as a career - making case , is nothing short of causing an immense public health hazard and needlessly scaring parents already concerned about their childrens ’ well being because you like Big Pharma conspiracy theories .
Tina Isa America's Honor Killing
An honor killing is usually a private family matter .
One family member , usually the father or oldest son , kills the family member who has disgraced or dishonored the family , usually a female who has either had premarital sex or been unfaithful in her marriage .
Honor killings take place mostly in third world countries , although in November of 1989 , Saint Louis gained National attention in what became one of the most publicized honor killings in the world .
The FBI unintentionally taped the brutal murder of 16 - year - old Tina Isa , while doing electronic surveillance of the Isa ’s home .
Zein Isa , Tina ’s father was a suspected Palestinian Terrorist and had been under FBI surveillance for some time .
The first clue to Tina Isa ’s death came one morning as FBI agents listened to the surveillance tapes from the night before .
Imagine the difficulty the agents must have experienced listening to Tina ’s terrifying screams , as her Palestinian father kills her and her Brazilian mother Maria helps him .
The agents quickly realize with horror , they are already hours to late and that Tina is already dead .
The agents hear Tina screaming , begging her mother please help me and her mother says only shut up .
Tina ’s father stabs her with a butcher knife 13 times in the chest , while Tina ’s mother Maria holds her daughter down .
The murder of their daughter Tina Isa takes eight minutes .
The tape ends with Zein Isa telling his daughter die , die quickly , quiet , little one , die , my daughter , die .
Then there is silence on the tape and it is obvious Tina has died .
After hearing the murder of Tina Isa on the surveillance tape , agents must make a difficult decision .
Do they blow FBI cover , turn over the audiotapes , and allowing the prosecutor to prosecute the Isa ’s for murdering their daughter or do they continue their surveillance and hope that Zein and Maria Isa lead the agents to terrorists .
In the end , the agents turn over their evidence to the prosecuting attorney ’s office and prosecute the Isa ’s for the murder of their daughter .
Tina is an honor killing .
A daughter killed by her father for causing dishonor for her family in her father ’s eyes .
Earlier in the day , Tina had applied for a part - time job at a local Saint Louis Wendy ’s Restaurant against her parents ’ wishes , and without their permission .
Recently she had begun seeing a black boy from school .
Both of these behaviors were disrespectful to the family ’s culture , enough that her father felt justified in killing her .
The number of honor killings worldwide is difficult to detect , mostly because honor killings are a taboo subject .
Killing your child because they are disrespectful is not open for discussion in any country and can get you killed .
During their trial , the Zein Isa tried to get the surveillance tapes thrown out as evidence because they captured events that had no relevance to the FBI ’s investigation .
The court allowed the tapes as evidence , which allowed the jury to hear Tina ’s voice from beyond the grave , and the stark cold method in which her father and mother murdered her in her own home .
Zein and Maria Isa were both found guilty of murder and sentenced to death .
Maria challenged her conviction since she felt she should not get the same punishment as her husband who stabbed Tina to death .
Yet , the court felt Maria was never forced to hold her daughter down as her husband stabbed her to death .
In the end , the court determined Maria was not directly responsible for her daughter ’s death , and her conviction was converted from a deaths sentence to life in prison .
Zein Isa died on death row in 1997 after he became ill .
Honor killings happen every day in all parts of our world .
In other parts of the world , the police often are witness and some even participate in the stoning of young woman who date outside their ethnic or religious background or are sexually active before marriage .
How sad the very families that should be protecting us are the cause of our death .
Both sides may be sincere in their views , but neither side is right .
The American people are not absolutist , and they do n't elect us to impose a rigid ideology on our problems .
They know that we need not sacrifice our security for our values , nor sacrifice our values for our security , so long as we approach difficult questions with honesty and care and a dose of common sense .
That , after all , is the unique genius of America .
That 's the challenge laid down by our Constitution .
That has been the source of our strength through the ages .
That 's what makes the United States of America different as a nation .
I can stand here today , as President of the United States , and say without exception or equivocation that we do not torture , and that we will vigorously protect our people while forging a strong and durable framework that allows us to fight terrorism while abiding by the rule of law .
Make no mistake :
If we fail to turn the page on the approach that was taken over the past several years , then I will not be able to say that as President .
And if we cannot stand for our core values , then we are not keeping faith with the documents that are enshrined in this hall .
( Applause . )
The Framers who drafted the Constitution could not have foreseen the challenges that have unfolded over the last 222 years .
But our Constitution has endured through secession and civil rights , through World War and Cold War , because it provides a foundation of principles that can be applied pragmatically ; it provides a compass that can help us find our way .
It has n't always been easy .
We are an imperfect people .
Every now and then , there are those who think that America 's safety and success requires us to walk away from the sacred principles enshrined in this building .
And we hear such voices today .
But over the long haul the American people have resisted that temptation .
And though we 've made our share of mistakes , required some course corrections , ultimately we have held fast to the principles that have been the source of our strength and a beacon to the world .
Now this generation faces a great test in the specter of terrorism .
And unlike the Civil War or World War II , we can't count on a surrender ceremony to bring this journey to an end .
Right now , in distant training camps and in crowded cities , there are people plotting to take American lives .
That will be the case a year from now , five years from now , and -- in all probability -- 10 years from now .
Neither I nor anyone can stand here today and say that there will not be another terrorist attack that takes American lives .
But I can say with certainty that my administration -- along with our extraordinary troops and the patriotic men and women who defend our national security -- will do everything in our power to keep the American people safe .
And I do know with certainty that we can defeat al Qaeda .
Because the terrorists can only succeed if they swell their ranks and alienate America from our allies , and they will never be able to do that if we stay true to who we are , if we forge tough and durable approaches to fighting terrorism that are anchored in our timeless ideals .
This must be our common purpose .
I ran for President because I believe that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together .
We will not be safe if we see national security as a wedge that divides America -- it can and must be a cause that unites us as one people and as one nation .
We 've done so before in times that were more perilous than ours .
We will do so once again .
Thank you , God bless you , and God bless the United States of America .

Prime Numbers
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Prime numbers have intrigued curious thinkers for centuries .
On one hand , prime numbers seem to be randomly distributed among the natural numbers with no other law than that of chance .
But on the other hand , the global distribution of primes reveals a remarkably smooth regularity .
This combination of randomness and regularity has motivated researchers to search for patterns in the distribution of primes that may eventually shed light on their ultimate nature .
In a recent study , Bartolo Luque and Lucas Lacasa of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid in Spain have discovered a new pattern in primes that has surprisingly gone unnoticed until now .
They found that the distribution of the leading digit in the prime number sequence can be described by a generalization of Benford ’s law .
In addition , this same pattern also appears in another number sequence , that of the leading digits of nontrivial Riemann zeta zeros , which is known to be related to the distribution of primes .
Besides providing insight into the nature of primes , the finding could also have applications in areas such as fraud detection and stock market analysis .
“ Mathematicians have studied prime numbers for centuries , ” Lacasa told PhysOrg.com .
“ New insights and concepts coming from nonlinear science , such as multiplicative processes , help us to look at prime numbers from a different perspective .
According to this focus , it becomes significant that even today it is still possible to discover unnoticed hints of statistical regularity in such sequences , without being an expert in number theory .
However , the most significant issue in this work is not to unveil this pattern in primes and Riemann zeros , but to understand the reason and implications of such unexpected structure , not just for number theoretical issues but , interestingly , for other disciplines as well .
For instance , these results deepen our understanding of correlations in systems composed of many elements . ”
Benford ’s law ( BL ) , named after physicist Frank Benford in 1938 , describes the distribution of the leading digits of the numbers in a wide variety of data sets and mathematical sequences .
Somewhat unexpectedly , the leading digits are n’t randomly or uniformly distributed , but instead their distribution is logarithmic .
That is , 1 as a first digit appears about 30 % of the time , and the following digits appear with lower and lower frequency , with 9 appearing the least often .
Benford ’s law has been shown to describe disparate data sets , from physical constants to the length of the world ’s rivers .
Since the late ‘ 70s , researchers have known that prime numbers themselves , when taken in very large data sets , are not distributed according to Benford ’s law .
Instead , the first digit distribution of primes seems to be approximately uniform .
However , as Luque and Lacasa point out , smaller data sets ( intervals ) of primes exhibit a clear bias in first digit distribution .
The researchers noticed another pattern : the larger the data set of primes they analyzed , the more closely the first digit distribution approached uniformity .
In light of this , the researchers wondered if there existed any pattern underlying the trend toward uniformity as the prime interval increases to infinity .
The set of all primes - like the set of all integers - is infinite .
From a statistical point of view , one difficulty in this kind of analysis is deciding how to choose at “ random ” in an infinite data set .
So a finite interval must be chosen , even if it is not possible to do so completely randomly in a way that satisfies the laws of probability .
To overcome this point , the researchers decided to chose several intervals of the shape [ 1 , 10d ] ; for example , 1 - 100,000 for d = 5 , etc .
In these sets , all first digits are equally probable a priori .
So if a pattern emerges in the first digit of primes in a set , it would reveal something about first digit distribution of primes , if only within that set .
By looking at multiple sets as d increases , Luque and Lacasa could investigate how the first digit distribution of primes changes as the data set increases .
They found that primes follow a size - dependent Generalized Benford ’s law ( GBL ) .
A GBL describes the first digit distribution of numbers in series that are generated by power law distributions , such as [ 1 , 10d ] .
As d increases , the first digit distribution of primes becomes more uniform , following a trend described by GBL .
As Lacasa explained , both BL and GBL apply to many processes in nature .
“ Imagine that you have $ 1,000 in your bank account , with an interest rate of 1 % per month , ” Lacasa said .
“ The first month , your money will become $ 1,000 * 1.01 = $ 1,010 .
The next month , $ 1,010 * 1.01 , and so on .
After n months , you will have $ 1,000 *( 1.01 ) ^n.
Notice that you will need many months to go from $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 , while to go from $ 8,000 to $ 9,000 will be much easier .
When you analyze your accounting data , you will realize that the first digit 1 is more represented than 8 or 9 , precisely as Benford 's law dictates .
This is a very basic example of a multiplicative process where 0.01 is the multiplicative constant .
“ Physicists have shown that many processes in nature can be modeled as stochastic multiplicative processes , where the previously constant value of 0.01 is now a random variable and the data equivalent to the money of our latter example is another random variable with an underlying distribution 1 /x .
Stochastic processes with such distributions are shown to follow BL .
Now , many other phenomena fit better to a stochastic process with a more general underlying probability x^[ - alpha ] , where alpha is different from one .
The first digit distribution related with this general power law distribution is the so - called Generalized Benford law ( which converges to BL for alpha = 1 ) . ”
Significantly , Luque and Lacasa showed in their study that GBL can be explained by the prime number theorem ; specifically , the shape of the mean local density of the sequences is responsible for the pattern .
The researchers also developed a mathematical framework that provides conditions for any distribution to conform to a GBL .
The conditions build on previous research , which has shown that Benford behavior could occur when a distribution follows BL for particular values of its parameters , as in the case of primes .
Luque and Lacasa also investigated the sequence of nontrivial Riemann zeta zeros , which are related to the distribution of primes , and whose distribution of the zeros is considered to be one of the most important unsolved mathematical problems .
Although the distribution of the zeros does not follow BL , here the researchers found that it does follow a size - dependent GBL , as in the case of the primes .
The researchers suggest that this work could have several applications , such as identifying other sequences that are n’t Benford distributed , but may be GBL .
In addition , many applications that have been developed for Benford ’s law could eventually be generalized to the wider context of the Generalized Benford ’s law .
One such application is fraud detection : while naturally generated data obey Benford ’s law , randomly guessed ( fraudulent ) data do not , in general .
“ BL is a specific case of GBL , ” Lacasa explained .
“ Many processes in nature can be fitted to a GBL with alpha = 1 , i.e. a BL .
The hidden structure that Benford 's law quantifies is lost when numbers are artificially modified : this is a principle for fraud detection in accounting , where the combinatorial mechanisms associated to accounting sets are such that BL applies .
The same principle holds for processes following GBL with a generic alpha , where BL fails .
Last , for processes whose underlying density is not x^( - alpha ) but 1 / logN , a size - dependent GBL would be the correct hallmark . ”

Kal Penn has a string of screen roles to his credit
Hollywood actor Kal Penn has taken a job in the administration of President Barack Obama .
The star , who appeared in US TV drama House and comic movie Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay , will work in the Office of Public Liaison .
Penn 's role will be to connect the President with Asian , Pacific Island communities and arts groups .
The actor recently made a dramatic exit from medical drama House in the US .
The show also stars Hugh Laurie .
Speaking to US journalists , the 31 - year - old said he felt his calling was in public service .
" It 's not like I 'm retiring from acting .
I certainly intend to come back at some point , " he added .
Penn supported Obama throughout his election campaign and spoke at the President 's inauguration concert at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC .
A starting date for his new job is yet to be fixed .
The actor is best known on the big screen for his role as a marijuana - smoking student in the Harold and Kumar movies .

LA JOLLA , Calif. , May 13 ( Reuters ) - Ethanol could replace up to 20 percent of gasoline supplies in the United States and Europe , Tony Hayward , CEO of oil major BP BP.L , said on Wednesday .
Ethanol currently accounts for about 7 percent of U.S. gasoline demand , according to industry groups .
( Reporting by Robert Campbell )
As the story of Bush administration ’s war crimes comes out in fits and starts , it appears that torture is only one aspect – and not the worst , by any means – of this horrific history .
In an interview in mid-March , Seymour Hersh let slip the following :
" After 9/11 – I have n’t written about this yet – but the Central Intelligence Agency was very deeply involved in domestic activities against people they thought to be enemies of the state .
Without any legal authority for it .
They have n’t been called on it yet .
That does happen . "
Well , yes , that ’s hardly surprising .
The PATRIOT Act and other legislation [ . pdf ] passed by Congress gives the government the legal " right " to spy on American citizens and , in the case of Jose Padilla , lock them up without a trial and throw away the key .
But , as Hersh reveals , it gets worse .
Much worse :
“ Right now , today , there was a story in the New York Times that if you read it carefully mentioned something known as the Joint Special Operations Command – JSOC it ’s called .
It is a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently .
They do not report to anybody , except in the Bush - Cheney days , they reported directly to the Cheney office .
They did not report to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff or to Mr. [ Robert ]
Gates , the secretary of defense .
They reported directly to him . …
“ Congress has no oversight of it .
It ’s an executive assassination ring essentially , and it ’s been going on and on and on .
… Under President Bush ’s authority , they ’ve been going into countries , not talking to the ambassador or the CIA station chief , and finding people on a list and executing them and leaving .
That ’s been going on , in the name of all of us . "
Well , yes , that ’s not too surprising , either , actually .
It ’s so – what ’s the word ?
– Cheneyesque .
Those Rethuglicans !
Well , we ’re past all that now .
The Dear Leader ’s in the White House , and it ’s time to move on , right ?
Oh wait …
It turns out the commander of this international order of assassins has just been appointed by Defense Secretary Robert Gates to head of U.S. forces in Afghanistan .
As part of the " fresh thinking " in the Obama administration , epitomized by the COIN crowd , Lt. Gen. Stanley McChrystal replaces Gen. David McKiernan .
So who is McChrystal ?
A 2006 profile in Newsweek put it this way :
" JSOC is part of what Vice President Dick Cheney was referring to when he said America would have to ‘ work the dark side ’ after 9/11 .
To many critics , the veep ’s remark back in 2001 fostered his rep as the Darth Vader of the war on terror and presaged bad things to come , like the interrogation abuses at Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay .
But America also has its share of Jedi Knights who are fighting in what Cheney calls ‘ the shadows . ’
And McChrystal , an affable but tough Army Ranger , and the Delta Force and other elite teams he commands are among them . "
The dark side includes McChrystal ’s overseeing of Camp Nama , a detainee center outside of Baghdad ( since renamed and relocated ) notorious for its brutality .
The very same administration that is up on its high horse about forbidding torture has just elevated one of the chief torturers to direct Obama ’s war in Afghanistan .
It is hardly inconceivable that what we saw at Camp Nama – beatings , degradation of prisoners , and outright , cold - blooded murder – is going to be replicated on a nationwide scale .
That ’s what they call " fresh thinking " over at Obama ’s Pentagon .
The response to all this – or , rather , the non-response – indicates to me that torture is not really the issue , as far as the Obamaites and their amen corner in the media are concerned , it ’s who ’s doing the torturing .
If Bush and Cheney ordered it , it ’s reprehensible and might even be a war crime .
If , however , a known torture - enabler is elevated by Obama ’s secretary of defense to the position of commander of our armed forces in Afghanistan – well , then , that ’s a far different matter .
Yes , I know , it ’s hard to believe such brazen hypocrisy really exists , but here it is , right in front of us , in the person of Human Rights Watch investigator Marc Garlasco .
Garlasco , who investigated and helped expose the abuses at Camp Nama , thinks the question of whether McChrystal ought to be confirmed as Afghan commander is " a tough one . "
Really ?
Well , yes , according to him :
" I defend McChrystal to myself because I think he ’s the right guy for the job .
[ He is ] in the Petraeus model , a new - thinking guy who is not thinking in terms of massive troops and kinetic kills , but non-lethal power – economic issues , winning the population over .
In that mold , he ’s the right guy . ”
It was McChrystal who had operational command over Camp Nama .
He kept out the International Red Cross , and he was personally present in the camp while torture was going on .
Now he ’s going to be overseeing the conduct of the " Af - Pak " war , so do n’t be too surprised to see an entire country , and portions of another , turned into one giant Camp Nama .
What gets me is that it ’s all being done in the name of a kinder , gentler approach to the " art " of counterinsurgency , and presided over by the best , the brightest , the most liberal administration since FDR .
I do n’t know what ’s worse : the crimes themselves , or those who rationalize them , such as the author of the Esquire piece that exposed Camp Nama , linked to above , who has decided that McChrystal is one of the good guys – and that Cheney might not be that bad after all .
A more egregious apologia has never been uttered , at least not since the war criminals of yesteryear declared they were only following orders .
Okay , he admits , excusing Cheney may be going a bit " too far , " but hands off McChrystal – and , of course , Obama .
That someone so conversant with the abuses perpetrated by Commander Dark Side could take this position is an indicator of just how far the moral corruption that characterized the Bush era has penetrated – and how long it ’s going to take for us to return to some semblance of normality .
Author John H. Richardson ridicules McChrystal ’s critics as " armchair moralists , " to which the only appropriate reply is : Better an armchair moralist than an armchair torturer and executioner .
Yet Camp Nama is hardly the worst of McChrystal ’s walks on the " dark side . "
Remember , Hersh reported that JSOC was ( and presumably still is ) going around killing " high - value targets " on a global scale , murdering people from the Middle East to Central America .
The criterion for selecting the victims was ( and presumably still is ) whether , in Hersh ’s phrase , they had engaged in or were planning " anti-American activities . "
Is n’t anyone curious as to who qualified for a hit ?
Congress is threatening to investigate the use of torture techniques during interrogations , but what about the murderous rampage we ’ve been conducting for the past eight years ?
Who fell victim to our army of assassins ?
Along these lines , I note a completely phony – and obviously planted – story that " reports "
Hersh saying JSOC murdered Rafik Hariri , the Lebanese leader whose assassination set off a countrywide crisis .
He has naturally denied saying this , but what ’s interesting is that the false story was timed just as questions about McChrystal ’s tenure at JSOC and Camp Nama were being raised .
Not that the U.S. government or anyone connected with it would ever try to discredit one of its most credible critics – heaven forbid !
With the appointment , and likely confirmation , of McChrystal , it is clear that the " change " we were promised by Obama is just a change of faces : the policies , at least on the foreign policy front , are remarkably similar .
Indeed , the Obamaites may prove to be even more brutal and arrogant than their immediate predecessors , and they ’ll get away with it far longer than the Bushies did .
That ’s because the media is in the tank for Obama , as our fundraising copy put it the other day – just like Marc Garlasco .
Speaking of our fundraising drive : we ’re going into the final stretch now , and this is a good time to remind all of you out there that Antiwar.com is performing an essential function , ensuring that the hopes and dreams of the many antiwar voters who cast their ballots for Obama are n’t betrayed in silence , without a peep of protest .
As our government continues to fight an endless " war on terrorism , " with some of the same commanders and tactics – albeit fronted by the smiling face of a popular president – Antiwar.com is speaking truth to power .
And we ’re almost alone in doing so .
That ’s got to be worth something .
Our fundraising drive is our sole source of support .
We do n’t have any big backers , foundation grants , or corporate contributors to pay our tiny staff and keep this site going .
Without your contribution , we ’re sunk .
It ’s as simple as that .
So please – take the time , right now , to make your contribution if you have n’t already donated .
If you have donated , please consider upping your donation , or signing on to our monthly sustainers ’ program .
We do n’t have the big bucks at the War Party ’s command – all we have is you .
Yes , I know , it ’s tiresome to be hectored , especially for money , but we do n’t have much choice .
So contribute today – and make this fundraising campaign go away !
Orchestrated New York Terror Plot Exploited to Increase Funding

As it turns out the so - called Muslim terrorists busted in New York , who supposedly wanted to blow up synagogues in the Bronx and shoot down military airplanes flying out of the New York Air National Guard base , were petty criminals set - up by the FBI .
“ Last year , the four men began communicating with an FBI informant who sold them fake explosives and inactive missiles , ” reports the Christian Science Monitor .
“ While the bombs these terrorists attempted to plant tonight were — unbeknownst to them — fake , this latest attempt to attack our freedoms shows that the homeland security threats against New York City are sadly all too real , ” said New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg .
In other words , the men were patsies that posed absolutely no threat to New York and without the involvement of the FBI there would have been no terror plot .
In fact , as Paul Joseph Watson notes today , the men “ have turned out to be semi- retarded potheads ” that did not possess the intelligence or wherewithal to engage in terrorist activities .
Even the Associated Press admits they were “ amateurs every step of the way .
They had trouble finding guns and bought cameras at Wal - Mart to photograph their targets .
One was a convicted purse snatcher , another smoked marijuana the day the plot was to be carried out . ”
The New York terror plot is reminiscent of the so - called Miami Seven case .
In that case , the FBI promised a group of semi-retards and losers money and explosives for an FBI - cooked up plot to blow up the Sears Tower in Chicago .
It took two hung juries before 5 of the 7 supposed terrorists were convicted earlier this month .
It did n’t take long for officials to exploit the alleged terror plot and call for Congress to “ increase anti-terror funding to New York and other areas that suffered a significant reduction a few years ago , ” according to Fox News .

Climate change is already responsible for 300,000 deaths a year and is affecting 300 m people , according to the first comprehensive study of the human impact of global warming .
It projects that increasingly severe heatwaves , floods , storms and forest fires will be responsible for as many as 500,000 deaths a year by 2030 , making it the greatest humanitarian challenge the world faces .
Economic losses due to climate change today amount to more than $ 125 bn a year — more than all the present world aid .
The report comes from former UN secretary general Kofi Annan 's thinktank , the Global Humanitarian Forum .
By 2030 , the report says , climate change could cost $ 600 bn a year .
Civil unrest may also increase because of weather - related events , the report says : " Four billion people are vulnerable now and 500 m are now at extreme risk .
Weather - related disasters ... bring hunger , disease , poverty and lost livelihoods .
They pose a threat to social and political stability " .
If emissions are not brought under control , within 25 years , the report states :
• 310 m more people will suffer adverse health consequences related to temperature increases
• 20 m more people will fall into poverty
• 75 m extra people will be displaced by climate change .
Climate change is expected to have the most severe impact on water supplies , it said .
" Shortages in future are likely to threaten food production , reduce sanitation , hinder economic development and damage ecosystems .
It causes more violent swings between floods and droughts .
Hundreds of millions of people are expected to become water stressed by climate change by the 2030 . "
The study says it is impossible to be certain who will be displaced by 2030 , but that tens of millions of people " will be driven from their homelands by weather disasters or gradual environmental degradation .
The problem is most severe in Africa , Bangladesh , Egypt , coastal zones and forest areas . "
The study compares for the first time the number of people affected by climate change in rich and poor countries .
Nearly 98 % of the people seriously affected , 99 % of all deaths from weather - related disasters and 90 % of the total economic losses are now borne by developing countries .
The populations most at risk it says , are in sub-Saharan Africa , the Middle East , south Asia and the small island states of the Pacific .
But of the 12 countries considered least at risk , including Britain , all but one are industrially developed .
Together they have made nearly $ 72bn available to adapt themselves to climate change but have pledged only $ 400 m to help poor countries .
" This is less than one state in Germany is spending on improving its flood defences , " says the report .
The study comes as diplomats from 192 countries prepare to meet in Bonn next week for UN climate change talks aimed at reaching a global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in December in Copenhagen .
" The world is at a crossroads .
We can no longer afford to ignore the human impact of climate change .
This is a call to the negotiators to come to the most ambitious agreement ever negotiated or to continue to accept mass starvation , mass sickness and mass migration on an ever growing scale , " said Kofi Annan , who launched the report today in London .
Annan blamed politicans for the current impasse in the negotiations and widespread ignorance in many countries .
" Weak leadership , as evident today , is alarming .
If leaders cannot assume responsibility they will fail humanity .
Agreement is in the interests of every human being . "
Barabra Stocking , head of Oxfam said : " Adaptation efforts need to be scaled up dramatically .
The world 's poorest are the hardest hit , but they have done the least to cause it .
Nobel peace prizewinner Wangari Maathai , said : " Climate change is life or death .
It is the new global battlefield .
It is being presented as if it is the problem of the developed world .
But it 's the developed world that has precipitated global warming . "
Calculations for the report are based on data provided by the World Bank , the World Health organisation , the UN , the Potsdam Insitute For Climate Impact Research , and others , including leading insurance companies and Oxfam .
However , the authors accept that the estimates are uncertain and could be higher or lower .
The paper was reviewed by 10 of the world 's leading experts incluing Rajendra Pachauri , head of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change , Jeffrey Sachs , of Columbia University and Margareta Wahlström , assistant UN secretary general for disaster risk reduction .

Toyota are apparently developing a new version of their great little MR2 sports car , that ended production back in 2007 .
This comeback model will be in the form of a compact coupe , rather than the roadster style of its predecessor and will feature a specially developed version of the hybrid powertrain from Toyota ’s Prius .
The car aims to blend the sports - like performance of the original MR2 with economy and low emissions , presumably to fit with our modern environmental zeitgeist .
Obviously sensitive to our current economic climate also , the car is expected to be priced at just £ 20,000 | $ 29,000 – only a small premium over Toyota ’s boxy Prius and less than a quarter of the cost of Tesla ’s Roadster .
The new MR2 is said to include steering wheel mounted paddle shifters , get 0 - 60 MPH in around 7 seconds , emit less than 100g / km of CO2 and return 60 mpg .
This is a smart move by Toyota , who could be missing out on a large share of the motor market by focusing so heavily on conservatively styled , family - oriented vehicles .
An earlier model MR2 – before it was discontinued .

Previously , Microsoft 's official stance was that Windows 7 would be available no later than three years after the general availability of Windows Vista , meaning January 30 , 2010 .
Based on the steady development of the OS though , many have predicted that Windows 7 would arrive earlier .
Windows Server 2008 R2 was expected to arrive sometime after Windows 7 , but now Microsoft has noted that the server OS will actually arrive in the same timeframe as its client counterpart .
The Release Candidate builds for both operating systems went public last week .
Bill Veghte , senior vice president of the Windows Business at Microsoft , broke the news at the event , and also took the opportunity to tell the audience that when together , Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 help deliver significant cost savings and productivity gains with features such as DirectAccess and BranchCache .
Microsoft is making sure to tell businesses — now more than ever — about how the new versions of its software can help save them money in the long run .
Microsoft representatives told me that the Windows Server 2008 R2 RC has a few new features worth trying out .
Hyper -v now supports 64 logical processor support ( previously it was 32 ) .
The RC also includes a built - in solution for file classification and management called File Classifications Infrastructure ( FCI ) , which allows applying a classification to data and then taking action upon the classified data .
For example , once data is classified by high , medium , or low business impact , it is possible to intelligently back it up : say back up high business impact data more often , or on more expensive storage .
More detailed information on R2 is available on Microsoft.com .
For over a year since 2005 members of the WSM and many others from the anarchist / libertarian milieu have been heavily involved in a struggle by a small community in a rural part of Ireland against the construction of a gas refinery by the consortium of Shell , Marathon and Statoil being carried out with the full support of the Irish State .
The root of the struggle is the Corrib Gas field which is located off the coast of Mayo , a impoverished rural area on the West coast of Ireland .
The gas was discovered , and was thus owned by Enterprise Oil before it was bought out by a consortium of Shell , Statoil , and Marathon .
According to a deal struck by the government , exploration companies are allowed exclusive exploitation rights to their findings .
Not only that , but they will be able to write off their costs against taxes , meaning that the whole process is being funded by the Irish taxpayer , who will receive nothing , not even a decrease in gas prices .
To process the oil the consortium have been given permission to build a pipeline from the field straight onshore to a refinery at a location called Bellanaboy , neither of these developments have the consent of the local community who are justifiably concerned about the health and safety consequences of living next to a gas refinery .
The pipeline carries gas directly from the field to the refinery , so it is unprocessed and highly pressurised .
Moreover , to get to the refinery it has to pass through the land of local people , who fear that a rupture in the pipeline will destroy their homes , killing them .
A rupture of this pipeline is very possible since the pipe passes over extremely unstable bogland and is in an area prone to landslides .
The terminal itself will almost certainly cause long term harm not only to its immediate neighbours , but to people elsewhere also .
Gas processing is by its nature extremely harmful to the ecosystem , one estimate suggests that there will be at least 30 million cubic feet of emission per day into the air .
The terminal is only two kilometers away from the water supply of the region , and these emissions will travel further afield with the prevailing wind currents .
Not only that , but there will be wastewater pumped out every day into Broadhaven Bay which is a source of livelihood for many fishermen and a breeding ground for mammalian wild - life .
The drainage pit for the wastewater is not built to withstand heavy rainfall , despite the fact that this part of Ireland has near constant rain .
This means that wastewater containing lead , nickel , magnesium , phosphorus , chromium , arsenic , mercury and the radioactive gas radon will end up in the water supply for the surrounding area .
Despite repeated attempts by local people to prevent the development through the legal system they have been ignored by a government and legislature acting as the footsoldier of big business .
Last year
Shell were given injunctions against local landowners which meant that these landowners could not legally prevent Shell from entering their land to construct the pipeline which will endanger them and their families .
When these landowners refused to abide by these terms they were jailed .
This sparked vast public outrage and finally after 92 days in prison , the men were let out , a few days before a national demonstration .
For over a year there has been constant pickets at the refinery site , to prevent any construction work from taking place .
In October of this year , Shell , Statoil and Marathon made a concerted effort to break the local campaign using force .
Several hundred police were moved down to this remote part of Ireland to prevent the local community from blockading trucks and workers going to the site .
This operation seems so far unsuccessful , although they have broken the picket they have not broken the spirits of those who resist the development .
In fact , the solidarity shown by people from all over Ireland , and the success of direct action tactics relative to legal measures has hardened the resolve of the local campaign .
It will take several years of building before the refinery will be operational , and even once completed the complex will have to be secured in the long term against an unfriendly community .
In this context , the task of Shell and the State seems extremely difficult , and we have every reason to hope for success .
The WSM has been active within the community and the national campaign since its beginning .
For us , the basis of this campaign is direct action ; a local community struggling to gain control over their own environment and the decisions that affect them .
As anarchists , we believe that it is through participation in struggle that the working class will develop an understanding of capitalism and the potential to overthrow it .
Thus we will always support and encourage these struggles , victory in Rossport will be a victory for people everywhere .
This is the English version of the article explaining the struggle in Rossport written for the WSM Spanish language bulletin

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama said Wednesday he told government lawyers to object to a court - ordered release of additional images showing alleged abuse of detainees because the release could affect the safety of U.S. troops and " inflame anti-American opinion . "
President Obama discusses the alleged prisoner abuse photos at the White House on Wednesday .
Releasing the photos could have a " chilling effect " on further investigations of detainee abuse without adding to the understanding of past abuses , he said .
The Pentagon was set to release hundreds of photographs of prisoners in detention facilities in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The photos " are not particularly sensational , especially when compared with the painful images that we remember from Abu Ghraib , " Obama said , referring to the Iraqi military prison where photographs released in 2004 of detainees being abused and humiliated sparked widespread outrage .
" But they do represent conduct that did n't conform with the Army manual . "
Obama reiterated that any future abuse of detainees is " unacceptable " and " will not be tolerated . "
The publication of the photos would not add any additional benefit to investigations being carried out into detainee abuse -- and could put future inquires at risk .
Watch the president discuss his detainee photo decision »
" The publication of these photos would not add any additional benefit to our understanding of what was carried out in the past by a small number of individuals , " Obama said .
" In fact , the most direct consequence of releasing them would be to further inflame anti-American opinion , and to put our troops in greater danger . "
The announcement Wednesday was a reversal of what White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said last month , when he told reporters the White House had no problem releasing the photos .
Before Obama spoke to reporters , Gibbs said Wednesday afternoon that there was " a lot of back and forth in [ Obama 's ] mind over the course of several weeks about ensuring that this protected those that keep us safe , that it protected our national security . "
iReport.com : Should photos be released ?
The release was ordered in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the American Civil Liberties Union .
It followed Obama 's decision to release Bush - era CIA documents showing the United States used techniques like waterboarding , considered torture by the current administration .
Waterboarding ' a mistake ' »
Obama 's decision " makes a mockery " of his promise of greater transparency and accountability , ACLU attorney Amrit Singh said .
" Essentially , by withholding these photographs from public view , the Obama administration is making itself complicit in the Bush administration 's torture policies , " Singh said .
" The release of these photos is absolutely essential for ensuring that justice [ is ] done , for ensuring that the public [ can ] hold its government accountable , and for ensuring that torture is not conducted in the future in the name of the American people . "
Singh said his organization is prepared to " do whatever it takes " to have the photos released .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Wednesday that grave concerns coming from top military brass may have influenced the president 's decision .
" What 's motivated my own change of heart on this and perhaps influenced the president is that our commanders ... have expressed very serious reservations about this ... and that the release of these photographs will cost American lives , " Gates said .
" That 's all it took for me , " he added .
Democrats in the Senate were mostly quiet on Obama 's reversal on Wednesday .
But Sen. Russ Feingold , of Wisconsin , said he at least initially disagrees with it .
" I am generally opposed to keeping the American people in the dark for no other reason than to shield misconduct , avoid embarrassment or other reasons not pertaining to national security , " Feingold said in a written statement .
" From what I 've heard so far , I 'm not convinced there is a compelling reason these photos should n't be released . "
Two Democratic congressmen had different reactions to Obama 's decision .
Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York said he thinks " the administration may be very well justified in withholding the pictures . "
Nadler , who said he agrees with the ACLU " 98 percent of the time -- but not here , " said he had not seen the photos but he doubted they provided any more information than was in Bush - era memos recently released .
" Get all the memos out , get everything out ... but with these pictures it may be that they 're dangerous , and that 's a legitimate concern , " he said .
But Rep Lynn Woolsey of California said , " I would have preferred that they were out there . "
" We have so much to do .
It 's such a distraction , " Woolsey added .
" Get these pictures out there and get it behind us . "
The ACLU said the Pentagon had agreed to release a " substantial " number of photographs by May 28 .
Officials at the Pentagon said the photographs are from more than 60 criminal investigations between 2001 and 2006 and show military personnel allegedly abusing detainees .
" The disclosure of these photographs serves as a further reminder that abuse of prisoners in U.S. - administered detention centers was systemic , " ACLU National Security Project Director Jameel Jaffer said before Obama 's decision .
" Some of the abuse occurred because senior civilian and military officials created a culture of impunity in which abuse was tolerated , and some of the abuse was expressly authorized . "
Singh added that the photographs " provide visual proof that prisoner abuse by U.S. personnel was not aberrational but widespread , reaching far beyond the walls of Abu Ghraib . "
But Pentagon officials reject ACLU allegations that the photos show a systemic pattern of abuse by the military .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the Defense Department has " always been serious about investigating credible allegations of abuse . "
" The policy of the Department of Defense is to treat all prisoners humanely , and those who have violated that policy have been investigated and disciplined , " he added .
More than 400 people , Whitman said , have been disciplined based on investigations involving alleged detainee abuse .
The discipline ranged from prison sentences to demotions and letters of reprimand .
The Pentagon initially wanted to prevent the images from being made public , but decided to release them after losing two court cases , according to Whitman .
" We felt this case had pretty much run its course , " he said prior to Obama 's decision .
" Legal options at this point had become pretty limited . "
CNN 's Alan Silverleib , Deirdre Walsh , Ed Hornick and Mike Mount contributed to this report .

Legalization :
We 're getting there Public opinion on marijuana legalization is closing in on the tipping point of majority support .
In February DoseNation wrote about a meta analysis of legalization polls over the last decades showing a slow but steady increase over the years with the hitherto highest poll percentage at around 44 percent ( Zogby - NORML ) earlier this year .
The continuation of the existing opinion trend seems to have picked up speed , as a recent Washington Post - ABC News poll has now cranked that number up to 46 percent , with opponents down to 52 percent , and a buffer of 2 percent undecided respondents in between .
From the
... a new Washington Post - ABC
News poll shows rising support for same - sex marriage , legalized marijuana and a process by which undocumented immigrants could become legal residents ...
Respondents were near split on another issue that until recently was deemed untouchable in many parts of the coutry -- marijuana legalization .
Forty - six percent of all respondents said they supported legalizing " possession of small amounts for personal use , " with rates of support higher among men , among younger voters and among independents , a majority of whom supported legalization .
From the Washington Post From
FIRST LEAN LEFT 
On an entirely different issue , 46 percent of Americans now favor legalizing small amounts of marijuana for personal use , the most in data back to the mid-1980s and more than double its level 12 years ago .
While 52 percent remain opposed , that 's down from 75 percent in the late 1990s and 78 percent in 1986 .
The biggest changes in the past two decades are 29 - and 27 - point advances in support of legalization among Democrats and independents , to 49 and 53 percent , respectively .
The slightest : a 10 - point gain among Republicans , to just 28 percent support ...
POT - Support for legalizing small amounts of marijuana for personal use is nearly twice as high among young adults ( 57 percent of those under 30 ) as seniors ( 30 percent ) , with middle - aged Americans split about evenly .
Nearly six in 10 liberals like the idea ; just 36 percent of conservatives agree .
Politically , more independents are in favor ( 53 - 44 percent ) , Democrats divide evenly and Republicans broadly are opposed , 28 - 69 percent .
Support 's highest of all among people who express no religious preference , 70 percent ; and lowest among evangelical white Protestants , 24 percent .

A mass singalong of 160,000 people in the Indian city of Hyderabad , in Andhra Pradesh , has broken a 72 - year - old record for the world 's largest choir .
Participants sang religious hymns by " saint - composer " Annamacharya for just under 40 minutes at an event on Sunday .
An adjudicator from Guinness World Records said the audience was " ecstatic " to learn of their record .
The previous record was set in 1937 by a choir of 60,000 at a contest held in what is now Wroclaw , Poland .
An official Guinness World Record adjudicator , Raymond Marshall , was at the gathering to present the record certificate .
He described the event as a " highlight of this year 's record - breaking around the world " .
The massive audience in Hyderabad sang seven compositions by Annamacharya as part of the effort to break the world record .
The event was organised by the Andhra Pradesh state cultural council and a non-governmental organisation , Silicon Andhra , to commemorate the 601st anniversary of the birth of Annamacharya , one of the earliest " saint composers " of southern India .
In The Why of Perl Roles I explained some of the motivations behind the inclusion of roles in Perl 6 and their implementation in Perl 5 through Moose .
One common question is " How do roles differ from subclasses ? " ( where " subclassing " means " inheriting state and behavior from a parent class " as in C++ , Java , et cetera ) .
Reddit commenter netytan pointed out that plenty of OO research literature uses the word " inheritance " in a broader sense , but I 'm limiting it here to the concrete behavior by which you can specialize a more general class and take on or override its behavior .
Any poor academics who run across this , please feel free to bite your lip because I 'm about to tell some lies to help explain things to people who may not read your papers for fun .
Features of Inheritance
Suppose you write a class :
class Parent { method wipe_nose { ... } method tie_shoes { ... } }
You 've declared a type , Parent , which has a specific interface ( methods wipe_nose and tie_shoes ) with specific signatures ( zero-arity methods , in the absence of other information such as language support for slurpy parameters or mandatory signature checking ) , and an implicit semantic meaning for the term Parent .
That is , you 've modeled an entity representing some ideal .
Whenever you refer to a Parent in your code , you mean this entity .
Whenever you invoke the wipe_nose method on anything you treat as a Parent , you have specific behavior in mind -- the wipe_nose it makes sense for a Parent to do .
Suppose you extend this Parent by subclassing it ( what I refer to here as " inheritance " ) :
class Child extends Parent { method wipe_nose { ... } method play_in_mud { ... } }
This declares another type , Child , which behaves as a Parent ( revealing uncomfortable semantic properties of my naming system here ) .
In theory , anywhere I can use a Parent appropriately , I can use a Child appropriately .
( The Liskov Substitution Principle applies . )
The converse is not true ; a Child is a specialization of a Parent .
You can see this in that the Child class defines another method , play_in_mud , which is not present in Parent .
Parents can't play in the mud , lest they get their shoes dirty .
( Of course my parents still think of me as their child , and I can take off my shoes anytime I want -- so the code example is n't as wrong as it could be .
Real life is taxonomic weird . )
You 've probably also noticed that the Child does not declare a tie_shoes method .
The Parent implementation of tie_shoes suffices .
Even this simple example implies several features of this type of inheritance :
Classes define types which represent named collections of state and behavior .
( Type declarations . )
Classes can extend or specialize other classes .
( Subtyping -- though see Contra vs. Covariance for some debate over what languages can and should provide . )
Classes can include behavior from superclasses or reimplement behavior .
( Code reuse . )
In my mind , this type of inheritance conflates two separate concerns : type relationships and code reuse .
When Inheritance Attacks
Problems arise when you want one or the other but not both ( or at least not in the way the language supports ) .
Suppose you want to write a Guardian class which performs the same behaviors as the Parent class :
class Guardian { method wipe_nose { ... } method tie_shoes { ... } }
How do you express that a Guardian is equivalent and semantically substitutable for a Parent everywhere ( at least in terms of the behavior described here ) ?
If your language supports this , and if you have the ability to modify the declaration and use of Parent , and if you can reify the results to something concrete , you could extract Parent into an interface like Java supports -- perhaps ICanHasChild .
What if the implementation of wipe_nose is the same between Parent and Guardian ?
You could subclass Parent to create Guardian and inherit the implementation of those two methods , but then Child has to subclass Guardian -- and speaking of weird taxonomic relationships , that hierarchy does n't make sense either .
Then there 's multiple inheritance and abstract base classes and other approaches to try to minimize all of the complexity of the conflation of these two separate ideas .
The Role Separation of Concerns
The important attribute of the Guardian type is that a Guardian can act like a Parent .
It supports the same behaviors that a Parent supports .
It may need to reuse some implementation from the Parent , but it's not clear that it has a hierarchical taxonomic relationship to a Parent .
Imagine instead if you could write :
class Guardian does Parent { method wipe_nose { ... } method tie_shoes { ... } }
Presuming you have a role - based type system , every place in your code that checks for a Parent object can use a Guardian object because the wipe_nose method called on either a Parent or Guardian object means " Grab a tissue , then hang on to your kid . "
Alternately , you can slice all of these behaviors into more meaningful and smaller units of behavior : GoodHygiene could include the cover_your_mouth method and the wipe_nose and the brush_teeth methods .
Perhaps they act on the invocant by default , so you can compose that role into any Person class -- but perhaps there 's a role which represents performing good hygiene principles on a kid .
Perhaps not .
It depends .
Perhaps your Parent is also the Guardian for a grandparent .
Perhaps your Parent is the Child of a grandparent .
Perhaps your Child does babysitting for even younger children .
How do you model those relationships with an inheritance hierarchy ?
The important question is not " How do these entities relate to each other in a static taxonomy ? " but rather " What do you do ? "
Next time : roles versus duck - typing .

On Friday the first bikie was arrested since NSW ’s questionable new anti-gang laws were rammed through State Parliament the day before .
Then last night it was revealed that bike club members had done some " maintenance " at the Lodge last year .
Under normal circumstances , club members going about their day jobs would not be news , but in the current climate of hysteria they are all sworn enemies of society and must be up to something .
These two developments serve as a neat snapshot of the way fear - peddling and bad legislation go hand - in - hand to erode long - held freedoms .
In 2002 , anti-terror legislation was thrust through the Federal and New South Wales parliaments with great gusto .
The justification for the speedy introduction of the new laws was that terrorism , as a criminal act , is by its nature unique , has the potential to be seriously destructive and is generally planned over a protracted period .
Moreover , it was suggested that the organisations planning and committing the acts are internationally based , well funded and , most importantly , motivated by extremist ideals far removed from those held by your average Aussie drug pusher , murderer or gangster .
The Commonwealth Attorney General at the time , Daryl Williams , justified the proposed laws as a " response to the changed security environment since September 11 " .
It was argued that the criminal laws in existence at the time were insufficient to combat the threat .
The legislation faced strong criticism .
Numerous lawyers , academics , Islamic advocacy groups and concerned Australians complained that the laws were hastily prepared , and lacked adequate checks and balances , or even precision .
Assurances were made to the contrary by the government , and all the concerned parties were summarily ignored .
I can recall the former federal member for Wentworth , Peter King , stating in 2004 in support of further reforms that " [ a] t the end of the day , what we really want to do is ensure that terrorism and acts associated with terrorism are the real target of this proposed legislation " .
Numerous promises and assurances of that nature were also made in NSW .
The Premier made it clear at that time that additional police powers were absolutely inappropriate for use in everyday civil society .
The Attorney General , Bob Debus , echoed these sentiments .
The bills passed and were enacted into law .
Nobody can argue that the political and economic landscape in Australia has changed markedly in the years since those laws came into force .
While it is not immediately clear , to me at least , whether the nation is any less susceptible to a terrorist attack now than it was shortly after the events in 2001 , the hysteria surrounding the spectre of terrorism has died down .
National nail - biting has turned to the ailing economy .
Most people I know have tossed out that ridiculous anti-terrorist fridge magnet — it is no longer strong enough to hold all the unpaid bills .
However , amid the doom and gloom over our economic situation , the " law and order " issue remains popular as a means of extracting political support from voters .
In early March , the NSW Government introduced the Law Enforcement ( Powers and Responsibilities ) Amendment ( Search Powers ) Bill , permitting the covert search of a suspect ’s home without their consent or knowledge that it has happened .
" If you are a serious criminal in NSW , " Premier Nathan Rees bellowed , " you should not sleep easy .
These laws will enable our police force to inspect your home without you knowing . "
These laws are based on the provisions of the state ’s Terrorism ( Police Powers )
Act 2002 as well as Commonwealth terrorism legislation , however , the act effectively extends the search powers contained in that legislation to state crimes carrying a maximum term of imprisonment of seven years or more .
Likewise , the recent bikie gang - related violence in NSW has provided some colourful , Underbelly - style relief for the media and the Government .
Rees et al leapt on the development immediately , taking their cue from the earlier anti-terror laws as well as from South Australian legislation dealing with the problem of outlaw bikie gangs and proposing laws to prohibit members of those gangs from consorting with each other or their associates .
Before he brought his new laws to State Parliament in a surprise move on Thursday , Rees had lamented the possibility that he may not be able to ram them through the legislature at the speed of light , because if hurriedly drafted they might be subject to pesky judicial review .
This , unfortunately , appeared to be his only concern .
Little consideration seems to have been given as to whether existing legislation may have been adequate to deal with offenders , or indeed whether the new legislation will necessarily prevent outlaw bikie gangs from simply removing their beards or heading interstate to hold meetings .
Outlaw bikie gangs have been around for decades , trading in drugs , prostitution , firearms and violence .
Despite this , when the South Australian laws came into effect in 2005 , Mike Rann , the South Australian Premier , sneered : " To the civil libertarians let me say this : that we ’ve got legislation across Australia that deals with the threat of terrorism , but these are terrorists within our community who think they can do what they like , and that ’s why we ’re standing up to them . "
Suddenly , the definition of terrorism has expanded .
The extremist madman in the cave has become the rough - looking bloke in the pub , and the law appears toothless for all purposes other than to push us further down the slippery slope .
The ragged argument that " if you ’re not involved , you have nothing to worry about " has well and truly disintegrated , because these new laws will , without doubt , affect ordinary members of the Australian community .
The alarming reality , if the initial assurances as to the ambit of the anti-terror laws are accepted , is that the community has been invaded .
Not by bikies , since they ’ve always been there in one form or another .
Not by terrorists , either .
The community has been invaded by the law .
Assurances from Rees , Rann and co as to the future use or effect of their legislation should be afforded little to no credence .
Law and order , in the current political climate , will always trump human rights , and this is difficult to reverse .
The political incentive to enact a new " get tough " law , whether it is well thought - out or not , greatly outweighs the incentive to repeal an old one .
More to the point , old laws provide a very solid foundation for the creation of newer , more draconian ones .
It is a classic slippery slope , and one which we are already sliding down .
We cannot rely on effective opposition , since the political capital gained from standing up for long - standing principles is easily defeated by the short - term fear of appearing " soft on crime " .
If there was ever a more concrete justification for the introduction of a bill of rights in this country , or at the very minimum in NSW a statutory charter similar to that enacted in Victoria and the ACT , I can not think of one .
Such a bill would be very valuable right now , helping to ensure that intelligent debate regarding the implications of new laws on civil freedoms and human rights extends beyond a cry from the sidelines as dangerous legislation is driven through .
Ever since the introduction of the first Opteron , Intel has faced a formidable foe in the x86 server and workstation markets .
AMD ’s decision to integrate a memory controller into its processors and use a narrow , high - speed interconnect between CPUs and I / O chips has made it a perennial contender in this space .
Even recently , while Intel ’s potent Core microarchitecture has given it a lead in the majority of performance tests , Xeons have been somewhat hamstrung on two fronts : on the power - efficiency front by their prevailing use FB - DIMM type memory , and on the scalability front by the use of a front - side bus and a centralized memory controller .
Those barriers for the Xeon are about to be swept away by today ’s introduction of new processors based on the chip code - named Nehalem , a new CPU design that brings with it a revised system architecture that will look very familiar to folks who know the Opteron .
Try this on for size : a single - chip quad - core processor with a relatively small L2 cache dedicated to each core , backed up by larger L3 cache shared by all cores .
Add in an integrated memory controller and a high - speed , low - latency socket interconnect .
Sounds positively ..
Opteronian , to coin a word , but that ’s also an apt description of Nehalem .
Of course , none of this is news .
Intel has been very forthcoming about its plans for Nehalem for some time now , and the high - end , single - socket desktop part based on this same silicon has been selling for months as the Core i7 .
Just as with the Opteron , though , Nehalem ’s true mission and raison d’etre is multi-socket systems , where its architectural advantages can really shine .
Those advantages look to be formidable because , to be fair , the Nehalem team set out to do quite a bit more than merely copy the Opteron ’s basic formula .
They attempted to create a solution that ’s newer , better , and faster in most every way , melding the new system architecture with Intel ’s best technologies , including a heavily tweaked version of the familiar Core microarchitecture .
Since this is Intel , that effort has benefited from world - class semiconductor fabrication capabilities in the form of Intel ’s 45 nm high - k / metal gate technology , the same process used to produce “ Harpertown ” Xeons .
At roughly 751 million transistors and a die area of 263 mm² , though , the Nehalem EP is a much larger chip .
( Harpertown is comprised of a pair of dual - core chips , each of which has 410 million transistors in an area 107 mm². )
The similarity with AMD ’s “ Shanghai ” Opteron core is , again , striking in this department : Shanghai is estimated at 758 million transistors and measures 258 mm² .
The Xeon W5580
We have already covered Nehalem at some length , since it ’s already out in the market in single - socket form .
Let me direct you to my review of the Core i7 if you ’d like more detail about the microarchitecture .
If you want even more depth , I suggest reading David Kanter ’s Nehalem write - up , as well .
Rather than cover all of the same ground again here , I ’ll try to offer an overview of the changes to Nehalem most relevant to the server and workstation markets .
A brief tour of Nehalem
As we ’ve noted , Nehalem ’s quad execution cores are based on the four - issue - wide Core microarchitecture , but they have been modified rather extensively to improve performance per clock and to take better advantage of the new system architecture .
One of the most prominent additions is the return of simultaneous multithreading ( SMT ) , known in Intel parlance as Hyper - Threading .
Each Nehalem core can track and execute two hardware threads , to keep its execution units more fully occupied .
This capability has dubious value on the desktop in the Core i7 , but it makes perfect sense for Xeon - based servers , where most workloads are widely multithreaded .
With 16 hardware threads in a dual - socket config , the new Xeons take threading in this class of system to a new level .
Additionally , the memory subsystem , including the cache hierarchy , has been broadly overhauled .
Each core now has 32 K L1 instruction and data caches , along with a dedicated 256K L2 cache .
A new L3 cache is 8 MB in size and serves all four cores ; it ’s part of what Intel calls the “ uncore ” and is clocked independently , typically at a lower speed than the cores .
The chip ’s integrated memory controller , also an “ uncore ” component , interfaces with three 64 - bit channels of DDR3 memory , with support for both registered and unbuffered DIMM types , along with ECC .
Intel has decided to jettison FB - DIMMs for dual - socket systems , with their added power draw and access latencies .
The use of DDR3 , which offers higher operating frequencies and lower voltage requirements than DDR2 , should contribute to markedly lower platform power consumption .
The bandwidth is considerable , as well : a dual - socket system with six channels of DDR3 - 1333 memory has theoretical peak throughput of 64 GB/s .
That ’s a little more than one should typically expect , though , because memory frequencies are limited by the number of DIMMs per channel .
A Nehalem - based Xeon can host only one DIMM per channel at 1333MHz , two per channel at 1066MHz , and three per channel at 800M Hz .
The selection of available memory speeds is also limited by the Xeon model involved .
Intel expects 1066MHz memory , which allows for 12 - DIMM configurations , to be the most commonly used option .
The highest capacity possible at present , with all channels populated , is 144GB .
Nehalem ’s revised memory hierarchy also supports an important new feature : Extended Page Tables , which is again like a familiar Opteron capability , Nested Page Tables .
Like NPT , EPT accelerates virtualization by relieving the hypervisor of the burden of software - based page table emulation .
NPT and EPT have the potential to reduce the overhead of virtualization substantially .
The third and final major uncore element in Nehalem is the QuickPath Interconnect , or QPI .
Much like HyperTransport , QPI is a narrow , high - speed , low - latency , point - to - point interconnect used in both socket - to - socket connections and links to I /O chips .
QPI operates at up to 6.4 GT/s in the fastest Xeons , where it yields a peak two - way aggregate transfer rate of 25.6 GB / sagain , a tremendous amount of bandwidth .
The CPUs coordinate cache coherency over the QPI link by means of a MESIF protocol , which extends the traditional Xeon MESI protocol with the addition of a new Forwarding state that should reduce traffic in certain cases .
( For more on the MESIF protocol , see here . )
One of the implications of the move to QPI and an integrated memory controller is that the new Xeons ’ memory subsystems are non-uniform .
That is , getting to local memory will be notably quicker than retrieving data owned by another processor .
Non-uniform memory architectures ( NUMA ) have some tricky performance ramifications , not all of which have been sufficiently addressed by modern OS schedulers , even now .
The Opteron has occasionally run into problems on this front , and now Xeons will , too .
One can hope that Intel ’s move to a NUMA design will prompt broader and deeper OS - and application - level awareness of memory locality issues .
Power efficiency has become a key consideration in server CPUs , and the new Xeons include a range of provisions intended to address this issue .
In fact , the chip employs a dedicated microcontroller to manage power and thermals .
Nehalem EP includes more power states ( 15 ) than Harpertown ( 4 ) and makes faster transitions between them , with a typical switch time of under two microseconds , compared to four microseconds for Harpertown .
Nehalem ’s lowest power states make use of a power gate associated with each execution core ; this gate can cut voltage to to an idle core entirely , eliminating even leakage power and taking its power consumption to nearly zero .
The power management microcontroller also enables an intriguing new feature , the so - called “ Turbo mode . ”
This feature takes advantage of the additional power and thermal headroom available when the CPU is at partial utilization , say with a single - or dual - threaded application , by dynamically raising the clock speed of the busy cores beyond their rated frequency .
The clock speed changes involved are relatively conservative : one full increment of the CPU multiplier results in an increase of 133MHz , and most of the new Xeons can only go two “ ticks ” beyond their usual multiplier ceilings .
Still , the highest end W - and X - series Xeons can reach up to three ticks , or 400M Hz , beyond their normal limits .
Unlike the generally advertised clock frequency of the CPU , this additional Turbo mode headroom is not guaranteed and may vary from chip to chip , depending upon its voltage needs and resulting thermal profile .
What headroom is available brings a “ free , ” if modest , performance boost to lightly threaded applications .
A new platform , too
Of course , this sweeping set of changes brings with it a host of platform - level alterations , not least of which is the modification of the role and naming of what has been traditionally called the north bridge chip , or the memory controller hub ( MCH ) in Intel ’s world .
Say hello , instead , to the I/O Hub , or IOH .
A block digram of the Tylerburg chipset .
Source : Intel .
The new Xeons ’ first IOH has been known by its code name , Tylersburg - 36D , and will now be officially called the Intel 5520 chipset .
True to its name , this IOH is focused almost entirely on PCI Express connectivity , with one QPI link to each of the two processors and a total of 42 PCIe lanes onboard 36 of them PCIe Gen2 and six Gen1 .
Those lanes can be apportioned in groups of various sizes for specific needs .
Tylersburg also has an ESI port for connecting with an Intel south bridge chip , one of the members of the ICH9 / 10 / R family ; these chips provide SATA and USB ports , along with various forms of legacy connectivity .
Tylerburg ’s dual QPI links open up the possibility of dual IOH chips , which Intel has decided to enable for certain configurations .
In this scenario , each Tylersburg chip is linked via QPI to a different CPU , and the two IOH chips are linked via QPI , as well .
The primary IOH chip handles various system management and legacy I/O duties , while the secondary one simply provides 36 additional lanes of PCIe Gen 2 connectivity , for a total of 72 lanes in the system ( plus six Gen1 lanes ) .
That ’s a tremendous amount of connectivity , but it ’s in keeping with the platform ’s high - bandwidth theme .

The new Xeons ’ LGA1366 - style socket
Nehalem - based Xeons come in a much larger package ( left ) than the prior Xeon generation ( right )
The new Xeons drop into a new , LGA1366 - style socket that looks , unsurprisingly , just like the Core i7’s .
The CPU itself is housed in a larger package , as well , that dwarfs the Harpertown Xeons and their predecessors .

Nehalem has a plethora of knobs and dials available for product differentiation , and Intel has apparently decided to twiddle with them all .
Each of them impacts performance in its own way , so choosing the right processor for your needs may prove to be something less than straightforward .
On top of all of the possibilities you see in the table above , there ’s the issue of L3 cache speed , a notable attribute that impacts performance , but one Intel has n’t opted to document too clearly ( as we learned with the Core i7 . )
As I understand it , the uncore elements in Nehalem chips can be clocked independently of one another , so the speed of the memory controller or the QPI link does n’t necessarily correspond to the frequency of the L3 cache .
The pair of processors we have for this first review , of the decidedly ultra - high - end , workstation - oriented Xeon W5580 variety , have a 2.66 GHz L3 cache .
So does the Xeon X5570 , the top server model .
The Opteron also edges forward
Unfortunately , we do n’t have a direct Opteron competitor to test against the Xeon W5580 , primarily because AMD does n’t make a dual - socket CPU that expensive .
We do , however , have a pair of new “ Shanghai ” Opterons , model 2389 , with a 2.9GHz core clock frequency ( and a 2.2GHz L3 / north bridge clock . )
These are not “ SE ” parts , so they offer higher performance within the same power / thermal envelope as most mainstream Opterons , with a 75W ACP rating .
The bigger news here may be the addition , at last , of HyperTransport 3.0 support to these Opterons .
HT3 essentially doubles the bandwidth of a HyperTransport link , and at 2.2GHz , the link between our Opteron 2389s should operate at 4.4 GT/s and provide a total of 17.6 GB/s of bandwidth quite close to the 19.2 GB /s supplied by the 4.8 GT/s QPI link on mainstream Nehalem variants .
Upgrading to HT3 was as simple as dropping these new Opterons into our existing test system .
This system ’s Nvidia core logic chipset does n’t support HT3 , but the socket - to - socket interconnect automatically came up with HT3 enabled .
The Opteron 2389 currently lists for $ 989 , which makes it a direct competitor for the Xeon X5550 .
I ’d certainly like to show you a performance comparison between these two chips , but unfortunately , time constraints and a minor flood in my office have prevented me from pursuing the matter .
Perhaps soon .

We used the following versions of our test applications :
The tests and methods we employ are usually publicly available and reproducible .
If you have questions about our methods , hit our forums to talk with us about them .
Memory subsystem performance
This test gives us a visual look at the throughput of the different levels of the memory hierarchy .
Generally speaking , Intel ’s caches seem to achieve higher bandwidth than AMD’s .
Looking at the block sizes between 512KB and 16MB shows us that the Xeon W5580 ’s L2 caches appear to be quite a bit faster than the older Harpertown Xeons ’ , but the W5580 ’s throughput drops at 4MB , where its smaller L2 caches run out of space .
The most striking result may be the new Xeons ’ throughput once we spill into main memory .
Let ’s take a closer look at that data point .
The W5580 ’s main memory throughput nearly doubles that of the fastest Opterons and is just short of four times that of the fastest Harpertown Xeon , the X5492 .
That ’s a staggering increase in measured bandwidth
Memory access latencies are down dramatically , as well the W5580 ’s round trip to main memory takes nearly half the time that the Xeon E5450 ’s does , and the W5580 ’s even quicker than the quickest Opteron .
Incidentally , other than the fact that the 2389 has HT3 enabled , I ’m unsure why the 2389 ’s memory performance is n’t quite as good as the 2384 .
They were tested in the same server and otherwise configured identically .
To rather gratuitously drive the point home , we can take a more complete look at memory access latencies in the charts below .
Note that I ’ve color - coded the block sizes that roughly correspond to the different caches on each of the processors .
L1 data cache is yellow , L2 is light orange , L3 ’s darker orange , and main memory is brown .
Each stage of the new Xeon ’s cache and memory hierarchy delivers shorter access times than the corresponding stage in the Shanghai Opteron ’s , although the two certainly look similar , do n’t they ?
Bottom line : the Nehalem Xeon ’s re-architected memory subsystem delivers the goods as advertised , with higher throughput and quicker access times than anything else we ’ve tested .
SPECjbb 2005
SPECjbb 2005 simulates the role a server would play executing the “ business logic ” in the middle of a three - tier system with clients at the front - end and a database server at the back - end .
The logic executed by the test is written in Java and runs in a JVM .
This benchmark tests scaling with one to many threads , although its main score is largely a measure of peak throughput .
As you may know , system vendors spend tremendous effort attempting to achieve peak scores in benchmarks like this one , which they then publish via SPEC .
We did not intend to challenge the best published scores with our results , but we did hope to achieve reasonably optimal tuning for our test systems .
To that end , we used a fast JVM  the 64 - bit version of Oracle ’s JRockIt JRE R27.6  and picked up some tweaks for tuning from recently published results .
We used two JVM instances with the following command line options :
start / AFFINITY [ 0 F , F0 ] java - Xms3700 m - Xmx3700 m - XXaggressive -XXlazyunlocking - Xlargepages:exitOnFailure=true - Xgc:genpar - XXgcthreads=4 - Xns3200 m - XXcallprofiling - XXtlasize :min=4k , preferred=512k -XXthroughputcompaction
Notice that we used the Windows “ start ” command to affinitize our threads on a per-socket basis .
We also tried affinitizing on a per-chip basis for the Harpertown Xeon systems , but did n’t see any performance benefit from doing so .
One exception to the command line options above was our Xeon L5430 / San Clemente system .
Since it had only 6GB of memory , we had to back the heap size down to 2200 MB for it .
Also , in order to affinitize for the 16 hardware threads of the Xeon W55800 system , we used masks of FF00 and 00 FF .
Although our Xeon W5580 system has more memory than the rest of the systems practically unavoidable in an optimal configuration because of its six DIMM channels we did not raise the heap size to take advantage of the additional space .
( Although we did experiment with doing so and found it not to bring a substantial advantage . )
In order to follow the rules of SPECjbb to the letter , we tested the Xeon W5580 with one to 16 warehouses with two JVMs topping out at twice the number of concurrent warehouses at which we expected performance to peak , thanks to Nehalem ’s two hardware threads per core .
( We also experimented with running four JVMs on this system , but as with the older Xeons , doing so did n’t improve throughput significantly . )
The new Xeons ’ prowess here is absolutely staggering .
We ’ve rarely , if ever , seen this sort of performance increase from one CPU generation to the next .
One ca n’t help but think how ominous this looks for AMD upon seeing these results .
I should note that you may see published scores even higher than these .
We ’re testing with an older version of the JRockIt JVM that ’s not as well optimized for Nehalemor Shanghaias a newer version might be .
Unfortunately , we have n’t yet been able to get our hands on a newer revision of this JVM , though I believe our present comparison should put the newer CPUs on relatively equal footing .
Before we move on , let ’s take a quick look at power consumption during this test .
SPECjbb 2005 is the basis for SPEC ’s own power benchmark , which we had initially hoped to use in this review , but time constraints made that impractical .
Nevertheless , we did capture power consumption for each system during a test run using our Extech 380803 power meter .
All of the systems used the same model of Ablecom 700W power supply unit , with the exception of the Xeon L5430 server , which used an FPS Group 460W unit .
Power management features ( such as SpeedStep and Cool ’n ’ Quiet ) were enabled via Windows Server ’s “ Balanced ” power policy .
Although it delivers much higher throughput , the Xeon W5580 ’s system ’s peak power draw is n’t appreciably higher than that if its direct predecessor , the Xeon X5492 .
This is a top - end workstation Xeon model with a generous 130W TDP ; I ’d expect more mainstream Nehalem Xeons to draw quite a bit less power within their 80 and 95W TDPs .
Hopefully we can test one soon .
Still , have a look at what happens when we consider performance per watt .
On the strength of its amazing throughput , even this 130W version of the new Xeon edges out the most effective Opteron in terms of power - efficient performance .
Only a low - voltage version of the Harpertown Xeon , on the low - power San Clemente platform , proves more efficient .
Cinebench rendering
We can take a closer look at power consumption and energy - efficient performance by using a test whose time to completion varies with performance .
In this case , we ’re using Cinebench , a 3D rendering benchmark based on Maxon ’s Cinema 4D rendering engine .
The performance leap with the new Xeons is n’t quite as stunning here as it is in SPECjbb , but it ’s formidable nonetheless .
The W5580 is nearly 50 % faster than the Opteron 2389 .
Once again , we measured power draw at the wall socket for each of our test systems across a set time period , during which we ran Cinebench ’s multithreaded rendering test .
A quick look at the data tells us much of what we need to know , Still , we can quantify these things with more precision .
We ’ll start with a look at idle power , taken from the trailing edge of our test period , after all CPUs have completed the render .
Despite all of the bandwidth and its tremendous performance and despite the 130W peak TDP of our Xeon W5580 processorsour Nehalem test system draws even less power at idle than our Opteron 2389 - based system .
Finally free from the wattage penalty of FB - DIMMs , Intel is again competitive on the platform power front .
Next , we can look at peak power draw by taking an average from the ten - second span from 15 to 25 seconds into our test period , during which the processors were rendering .
The combination of a 130W TDP and smart power management gives the Xeon W5580 more dynamic range in terms of power draw than any other solution tested .
As with SPECjbb , the Xeon W5580 system ’s peak pull is slightly higher than the Xeon X5492 system’s .
Another way to gauge power efficiency is to look at total energy use over our time span .
This method takes into account power use both during the render and during the idle time .
We can express the result in terms of watt - seconds , also known as joules .
We can quantify efficiency even better by considering specifically the amount of energy used to render the scene .
Since the different systems completed the render at different speeds , we ’ve isolated the render period for each system .
We ’ve then computed the amount of energy used by each system to render the scene .
This method should account for both power use and , to some degree , performance , because shorter render times may lead to less energy consumption .
Here , too , the new Xeon just outdoes the Opteron 2384 in our perhaps best measure of power - efficient performance by using less energy to complete the task at hand .
MyriMatch proteomics
Our benchmarks sometimes come from unexpected places , and such is the case with this one .
David Tabb is a friend of mine from high school and a long - time TR reader .
He has provided us with an intriguing benchmark based on an application he ’s developed for use in his research work .
The application is called MyriMatch , and it ’s intended for use in proteomics , or the large - scale study of proteins .
I ’ll stop right here and let him explain what MyriMatch does :
In shotgun proteomics , researchers digest complex mixtures of proteins into peptides , separate them by liquid chromatography , and analyze them by tandem mass spectrometers .
This creates data sets containing tens of thousands of spectra that can be identified to peptide sequences drawn from the known genomes for most lab organisms .
The first software for this purpose was Sequest , created by John Yates and Jimmy Eng at the University of Washington .
Recently , David Tabb and Matthew Chambers at Vanderbilt University developed MyriMatch , an algorithm that can exploit multiple cores and multiple computers for this matching .
Source code and binaries of MyriMatch are publicly available .
In this test , 5555 tandem mass spectra from a Thermo LTQ mass spectrometer are identified to peptides generated from the 6714 proteins of S. cerevisiae ( baker ’s yeast ) .
The data set was provided by Andy Link at Vanderbilt University .
The FASTA protein sequence database was provided by the Saccharomyces Genome Database .
MyriMatch uses threading to accelerate the handling of protein sequences .
The database ( read into memory ) is separated into a number of jobs , typically the number of threads multiplied by 10 .
If four threads are used in the above database , for example , each job consists of 168 protein sequences ( 1/40th of the database ) .
When a thread finishes handling all proteins in the current job , it accepts another job from the queue .
This technique is intended to minimize synchronization overhead between threads and minimize CPU idle time .
The most important news for us is that MyriMatch is a widely multithreaded real - world application that we can use with a relevant data set .
MyriMatch also offers control over the number of threads used , so we ’ve tested with one to eight threads .
I should mention that performance scaling in MyriMatch tends to be limited by several factors , including memory bandwidth , as David explains :
Inefficiencies in scaling occur from a variety of sources .
First , each thread is comparing to a common collection of tandem mass spectra in memory .
Although most peptides will be compared to different spectra within the collection , sometimes multiple threads attempt to compare to the same spectra simultaneously , necessitating a mutex mechanism for each spectrum .
Second , the number of spectra in memory far exceeds the capacity of processor caches , and so the memory controller gets a fair workout during execution .
Here ’s how the processors performed .
The Xeon W5580 completes this task in almost precisely half the time it takes the Xeon X5492  another eye - popping performance .
STARS Euler3d computational fluid dynamics
Charles O’Neill works in the Computational Aeroservoelasticity Laboratory at Oklahoma State University , and he contacted us to suggest we try the computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) benchmark based on the STARS Euler3D structural analysis routines developed at CASELab .
This benchmark has been available to the public for some time in single - threaded form , but Charles was kind enough to put together a multithreaded version of the benchmark for us with a larger data set .
He has also put a web page online with a downloadable version of the multithreaded benchmark , a description , and some results here .
In this test , the application is basically doing analysis of airflow over an aircraft wing .
I will step out of the way and let Charles explain the rest :
The benchmark testcase is the AGARD 445.6 aeroelastic test wing .
The wing uses a NACA 65A004 airfoil section and has a panel aspect ratio of 1.65 , taper ratio of 0.66 , and a quarter - chord sweep angle of 45 º .
This AGARD wing was tested at the NASA Langley Research Center in the 16 - foot Transonic Dynamics Tunnel and is a standard aeroelastic test case used for validation of unsteady , compressible CFD codes .
The CFD grid contains 1.23 million tetrahedral elements and 223 thousand nodes . . . .
The benchmark executable advances the Mach 0.50 AGARD flow solution .
A benchmark score is reported as a CFD cycle frequency in Hertz .
So the higher the score , the faster the computer .
Charles tells me these CFD solvers are very floating - point intensive , but oftentimes limited primarily by memory bandwidth .
He has modified the benchmark for us in order to enable control over the number of threads used .
Here ’s how our contenders handled the test with different thread counts .
Here we are again with another stunning leap in performance .
The Xeon W5580 performs this simulation at over the twice the rate of the fastest Opteron .
Nehalem seems to be especially well suited for bandwidth - intensive scientific computing and HPC applications like the two on this page .
For what it ’s worth , I should note that at lower thread counts , we saw a striking amount of variability from run to run with the Xeon X5580 system .
At two threads , for instance , the scores came in at 1.5 Hz , 2.4Hz , and 1.8 Hz .
So I would n’t put too much stock into those non-peak results .
Things seemed to even out once we got to higher thread counts .
This variance at low thread counts could be the result of one or several facets of the Nehalem architecture , including Turbo mode , NUMA , and SMT , all of which can contribute some performance variability , especially when interacting with a non-NUMA / SMT - aware application and perhaps a less - than - optimal thread scheduler .
For what it ’s worth , we did n’t see any such variability on our Opteron test systems .
Folding@Home
Next , we have a slick little Folding@Home benchmark CD created by notfred , one of the members of Team TR , our excellent Folding team .
For the unfamiliar , Folding@Home is a distributed computing project created by folks at Stanford University that investigates how proteins work in the human body , in an attempt to better understand diseases like Parkinson ’s , Alzheimer ’s , and cystic fibrosis .
It ’s a great way to use your PC ’s spare CPU cycles to help advance medical research .
I ’d encourage you to visit our distributed computing forum and consider joining our team if you have n’t already joined one .
The Folding@Home project uses a number of highly optimized routines to process different types of work units from Stanford ’s research projects .
The Gromacs core , for instance , uses SSE on Intel processors , 3DNow ! on AMD processors , and Altivec on PowerPCs .
Overall , Folding@Home should be a great example of real - world scientific computing .
notfred ’s Folding Benchmark CD tests the most common work unit types and estimates performance in terms of the points per day that a CPU could earn for a Folding team member .
The CD itself is a bootable ISO .
The CD boots into Linux , detects the system ’s processors and Ethernet adapters , picks up an IP address , and downloads the latest versions of the Folding execution cores from Stanford .
It then processes a sample work unit of each type .
On a system with two CPU cores , for instance , the CD spins off a Tinker WU on core 1 and an Amber WU on core 2 .
When either of those WUs are finished , the benchmark moves on to additional WU types , always keeping both cores occupied with some sort of calculation .
Should the benchmark run out of new WUs to test , it simply processes another WU in order to prevent any of the cores from going idle as the others finish .
Once all four of the WU types have been tested , the benchmark averages the points per day among them .
That points - per - day average is then multiplied by the total number of cores ( or threads , in the case of SMT ) in the system in order to estimate the total number of points per day that CPU might achieve .
This may be a somewhat quirky method of estimating overall performance , but my sense is that it generally ought to work .
We ’ve discussed some potential reservations about how it works here , for those who are interested .
I have included results for each of the individual WU types below , so you can see how the different CPUs perform on each .
Because each of its cores is executing two threads at once , the Xeon W5580 ’s performance in the individual work unit tests is relatively lackluster .
Once we reach the bottom line and look at total projected points per day , though , it achieves nearly a 50 % gain over the Xeon X5492  just another day at the office for Nehalem , I suppose .
3D modeling and rendering
POV - Ray rendering
We ’re using the latest beta version of POV - Ray 3.7 that includes native multithreading and 64 - bit support .
Some of the beta 64 - bit executables have been quite a bit slower than the 3.6 release , but this should give us a decent look at comparative performance , regardless .
To put this performance in our chess2 scene into perspective , the Xeon W5580 box finishes in 30 seconds what used to take over 10 minutes to complete .
Valve VRAD map compilation
This next test processes a map from Half - Life 2 using Valve ’s VRAD lighting tool .
Valve uses VRAD to pre-compute lighting that goes into its games .
The new Xeon ’s dominance continues here .
x264 HD video encoding
This benchmark tests performance with one of the most popular H.264 video encoders , the open - source x264 .
The results come in two parts , for the two passes the encoder makes through the video file .
I ’ve chosen to report them separately , since that ’s typically how the results are reported in the public database of results for this benchmark .
These scores come from the newer , faster version 0.59.819 of the x264 executable .
I ’m at a bit of a loss to express the reality of what we ’re seeing .
Across a broad mix of applications , the Xeon W5580 is by far the fastest processor we ’ve ever tested .
Yes , this is a very high end part , but Intel ’s new architecture is unquestionably effective .
Sandra Mandelbrot
We ’ve included this final test largely just to satisfy our own curiosity about how the different CPU architectures handle from SSE extensions and the like .
SiSoft Sandra ’s “ multimedia ” benchmark is intended to show off the benefits of “ multimedia ” extensions like MMX , SSE , and SSE2 .
According to SiSoft ’s FAQ , the benchmark actually does a fractal computation :
This benchmark generates a picture ( 640×480 ) of the well - known Mandelbrot fractal , using 255 iterations for each data pixel , in 32 colours .
It is a real - life benchmark rather than a synthetic benchmark , designed to show the improvements MMX / Enhanced , 3DNow ! / Enhanced , SSE ( 2 ) bring to such an algorithm .
The benchmark is multi- threaded for up to 64 CPUs maximum on SMP systems .
This works by interlacing , i.e. each thread computes the next column not being worked on by other threads .
Sandra creates as many threads as there are CPUs in the system and assignes [ sic ] each thread to a different CPU .
The benchmark contains many versions ( ALU , MMX , ( Wireless ) MMX , SSE , SSE2 , SSSE3 ) that use integers to simulate floating point numbers , as well as many versions that use floating point numbers ( FPU , SSE , SSE2 , SSSE3 ) .
This illustrates the difference between ALU and FPU power .
The SIMD versions compute 2/4/8 Mandelbrot point iterations at once – rather than one at a time – thus taking advantage of the SIMD instructions .
Even so , 2/4/8 x improvement cannot be expected ( due to other overheads ) , generally a 2.5 - 3 x improvement has been achieved .
The ALU & FPU of 6/7 generation of processors are very advanced ( e.g. 2 + execution units ) thus bridging the gap as well .
We ’re using the 64 - bit version of the Sandra executable , as well .
Well , OK , then .
