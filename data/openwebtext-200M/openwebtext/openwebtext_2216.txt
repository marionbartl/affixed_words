Choosing a radio station was once a right of passage for the American adolescence .
It was what bound you to your friends , disassociated you from your parents and attracted to you whatever partner had the misfortune to have you .
Regional in range , determined by frequency , traditional radio was completely national in scope , cities to suburbs , Natick to Nashville .
And then , like with the overnight successes the medium helped popularize , everything seemed to decline .
Traditional radio has been in a steady fall for nearly a decade .
While it still remains a 21 billion dollar industry , the time spent listening to radio has fallen somewhere to the tune of 8 percent since 2000 , according to Arbitron , a firm that measure radio audiences .
This steady drop in listenership has forced terrestrial radio stations to program music that can appeal to the broadest of audiences , disenfranchising both music fans and emerging artists , and helping to foster the growth of satellite and Internet radio .
" Internet radio has redrawn the whole radio landscape , " said Tim Westergren , a founder of Pandora , a leading Internet radio company .
" It provides a more fulfilling radio experience and a mass promotion for artists being shut out of terrestrial radio . "
The metrics are in agreement with Westergren , Internet radio captures 33 million listeners per week , according to Arbitron , and nearly 15 % of 18 to 49 year olds tune in to Internet radio on a weekly basis .
Internet radio companies , such as Pandora , Last.fm and Slacker offer a personalized radio experience which gives its listeners access to a greater variety of music and enhanced control over the music being delivered to them .
The listening experience is now being offered portably , with Slacker 's offering a for - sale portable player and Pandora delivering an iPhone application .
Internet radio might be an even greater bonanza for the working artist .
" For bands that have no shot at traditional radio " , says radio expert Kurt Hanson , " it is one way they can expose their music to fans . "
Pandora is home to 60,000 artists , 70 % of which are n't affiliated with a major label .
" While some bands are still holding out for that elusive deal , " says Joanna Ifrah , a former artist and repertoire scout for Columbia and Sony records , " Many more emerging bands are working their audience , working their Myspace pages , betting on themselves and getting paid . "
Artists are working comfortably and profitably outside of major labels , getting airtime through Internet and satellite radio , building audiences through social networks , and further being able to monetize themselves through sites such as Los Angeles based startup True Anthem .
However , major labels are pushing back by influencing Soundexchange to refuse to renegotiate royalty rates agreed upon last year that could potentially bankrupt the Internet radio industry .
While the numbers can be complicated , it comes down to simple metrics ; a now profitable Internet radio site will pay royalty rates that exceed total revenue if the current rates negotiated by Soundexchange are upheld .
A company like Pandora , which is paying $ 750,000 per month to Soundexchange under the current rates , would go out of business under the new rates which increase per year retroactively going back to 2006 .
( Satellites and cable radio settled for 7.5 percent of revenue with Soundexchange ) .
The idea that Internet radio has to pay any royalty rates , while fair to the artists , legally speaking , is laughable .
Traditional radio does n't pay a dime in royalty rates because it is considered promotional .
Has there been a greater promotional tool for an artist since the invention of the barker than the Internet ?
Even with the 50 % cut that the artist receive from Soundexchange , for the working musician , according to Hanson , Internet radio is for more valuable developing a fan base than the " single digit cut they get from royalties . "
If these rates are enforced and companies like Pandora go out of business , bands that do n't fit in the broad world of terrestrial radio will have a far more difficult time building a fan base and will lose the revenue stream that is Internet radio .
While the negotiations between Internet radio and Soundexchange look grim , companies like Pandora are n't ready to lower the antennae on Internet radio just yet .
" We are going to plow ahead until we reach a reasonable settlement , " said Westergren .
Out on a lawn at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with joggers and traffic passing nearby , Spencer Ahrens is demonstrating what looks like either the future of solar power – or perhaps a death ray .
Thrusting a 12 - foot board up into the air in front of a large mirror - covered satellite - type dish , Mr. Ahrens , an MIT graduate student , waves the board , looking for an elusive sweet spot where reflected sun rays converge .
With three student teammates looking on , he steadies the board once its tip begins to glow .
Shining white in the reflected solar rays , the wood suddenly bursts into flames .
Students laugh as smoke billows in the breeze .
This burning - board trick may seem like a YouTube stunt , but it ’s actually a visceral demonstration of a device with a serious purpose : to make super - cheap solar heat .
From garage inventors to government scientists , many have tried to make a solar dish that focuses sun rays to generate power .
What makes this student project different is not that they ’ve done it – but that they ’ve done it so cheaply , building this dish with off - the - shelf parts .
“ A lot of good people have built working dishes , but generally they ’re more expensive , more complex , and harder to build , ” says Matthew Ritter , an Olin College of Engineering student who ’s also part of the team .
“ We use widely available materials – that ’s our breakthrough . ”
The student team has already formed a company – Raw Solar – that they hope will one day have an assembly line cranking out cheap solar dishes that individually or in large arrays could supply affordable heat to a college campus , suburban home , or third - world village .
A few minutes later , the real demonstration begins .
A pole protrudes from the front of the solar dish – similar to the rod that sticks out from satellite - TV dishes .
Wrapped around the end of it is spiral tubing , which the team fills with water from a garden hose .
With the dish swiveled to face the sun , the tubing glows white .
Boiling water sputters from the far end of the hose , which lies in the shade beneath the dish .
The secret : frugal design
Materials and construction are fairly simple .
Aluminum tubing is riveted to a steel cross bracing .
Affixed to that frame are strips of mirror from a local supply house .
High - heat barbecue paint coats the coil collector at the apex of the pole .
“ Small solar thermal is a kind of power that has really been traveling under the radar , ” says Micah Sze , an MIT business school graduate tapped to help market the technology .
“ People have been focusing on electricity from the sun , not the heat market .
We think there ’s an opportunity to supply heat to large institutions like universities and someday individual homes . ”
“ Concentrating solar power , ” as this type of system is called , is seeing a boom .
At least 4,500 megawatts of capacity is in the development pipeline , according to the Solar Electric Industries Association in Washington .
That power is about 13 to 20 cents per kilowatt – cheap enough to compete with peak power prices of fossil fuel plants – but not yet off - peak regular prices .
The goal is to bring the price down .
Many older and current systems are very complex , involving a host of motors to keep dozens or hundreds of carefully polished mirrors focused on the sun .
So the team focused instead on making a dish that only requires a simple electronic system to keep it aimed at the sun – and pump water into the collector coil to be heated into steam .
The MIT team says their unit will produce steam heat for less than the cost of heat from oil or natural gas .
The steam is “ low temperature ” – about 212 to 400 degrees F. – not high temperature steam generally used to power electric turbines in conventional power plants – which can surpass 700 degrees F. Still , this “ process heat ” can be used cost effectively in manufacturing , food pasteurization , and heating buildings .
Making good ideas better
Part of the genius here may also be all about knowing where to look for technology .
The MIT students , for instance , did not take a go - it - alone approach .
As part of his “ Energy Ventures ” class , MIT lecturer David Pelly was hunting for some of the best new energy ideas that needed development and marketing – and discovered Doug Wood ’s solar dish .
An inventor who lives on Fox Island off the coast of Washington State , Mr. Wood ’s backyard is filled with all manner of solar dishes he has built – but most are enormous , he says .
After working with the MIT team , they settled on a dish that is just 12 feet across .
“ Our big discovery was that small worked better , cheaper , than any of our huge old models , ” Wood says .
“ Getting the size right was the critical breakthrough . ”
This summer , the team plans to relocate its fledgling company to the San Francisco area in order to find funding , as well as to tap the burgeoning solar - power expertise in the region .
Fortunately for traffic and pedestrians here at MIT , the Raw Solar dish is unlikely to be of any use as a laser - style device .
When lowered toward street level the beam deflects .
“ Yes , I know it probably looks like a ray that could fry Boston , ” Ritter says .
“ But it actually loses power very quickly beyond the focal point , so there ’s no actual danger .
You ca n’t accidentally step into the focal point .
Nobody walking along the sidewalk will get toasted . ”
The probes have already set world records Russian scientists say they have reached the bottom of the world 's deepest body of fresh water - Lake Baikal in Siberia .
However , they did not break the record for the deepest freshwater dive , as was originally reported .
The Mir - 1 submarine descended 1,580 m ( 5,184ft ) , organisers said , and not a record 1,680 m as was earlier claimed .
The mission is part of a research project at Lake Baikal , which contains about 20 % of the world 's fresh water .
The lake was declared a Unesco World Heritage site in 1996 .
See map of region Russia 's Interfax and Itar - Tass news agencies cited expedition organisers as saying that the Mir I and Mir II mini- submarines had touched the bottom of the lake .
" This is a world record for a submarine diving in fresh water , " Interfax quoted an organiser as saying .
However , it was later confirmed that the dive did not go as deep as first thought .
" There was no record ...
We 'll try again , " expedition leader Artur Chilingarov , a Russian parliamentarian and celebrated Arctic explorer , said after the dive .

The mission team plan to make up to 60 dives in total .
The current record of 1,637 m was set in Lake Baikal in the 1990s .
The Mir capsules are already in the record books for their undersea expeditions - descending to depths greater than 4,000 m .
' Confident Russia '
Before the expedition set off , Mr Chilingarov described it as a complex one .
" There are technological problems , fickle weather conditions .
Fresh water dictates its own special conditions , " he said .
The two 18 - tonne mini-submarines were designed to operate in seawater - but have shed hundreds of kilos to make them buoyant enough in less dense fresh water .
Mr Chilingarov also led a team of scientists to the North Pole in August last year - where they controversially staked Russia 's claim by planting a flag on the seabed .
The BBC's James Rodgers , at Lake Baikal , says the latest expedition is another sign of the Kremlin 's desire to show the world the kind of feat a newly confident Russia is capable of .
Environmentalists had expressed concern that Russia intended to exploit the lake 's mineral wealth , but expedition leaders insisted the mission was for research and conservation purposes only .
Mr Chilingarov said his team would put together " a package of practical measures and recommendations " to promote conservation of the lake .
Lake Baikal , formed 25 million years ago , is home to hundreds of species of flora and fauna .
One of the most unusual animals unique to the lake is the Baikal seal - one of the few seals to spend its life in fresh water .

The NDP has followed through with its promise to introduce legislation to the House of Commons that seeks to keep the internet open and free from control by service providers .
" This bill is about fairness to consumers , " said Charlie Angus , the NDP 's digital spokesman , in the House of Commons on Wednesday .
" The internet is a critical piece of infrastructure not just for Canada but for the world ... this bill protects the innovation agenda of Canada . "
The private member 's bill , C - 552 , is in reaction to moves by some of Canada 's largest internet service providers ( ISPs ) , including Bell Canada Inc. and Rogers Communications Inc. , to limit their customers ' uses of the internet .
Bell , Rogers and a few others say a small percentage of customers have been congesting their networks by using peer - to - peer applications such as BitTorrent , so they have slowed the internet down at peak times of the day .
The ISPs ' actions have provoked outrage from internet users , with about 300 protesters taking to the steps of Parliament Hill on Tuesday .
Critics have said the targeting of peer - to - peer applications is just the tip of the iceberg .
If ISPs are allowed to decide which internet applications can and can't be used , innovative new companies that were born from experimentation — such as Google , Amazon and eBay — may not happen in the future .
" Net neutrality affects everybody , every person , every business , every hospital , every institution is involved in the exchange of information over the internet , " Angus told CBCnews.ca .
" This should n't be about party lines . "
The four - page bill seeks to amend the Telecommunications Act and " prohibit network operators from engaging in network management practices that favour , degrade or prioritize any content , application or service transmitted over a broadband network based on its source , ownership or destination , subject to certain exceptions . "
It also looks to prohibit " network operators from preventing a user from attaching any device to their network and requires network operators to make information about the user 's access to the internet available to the user . "
The proposed bill makes exception for ISPs to manage traffic in reasonable cases , Angus said , such as providing stable speeds for applications such as gaming or video conferencing .
" There are areas where telecoms have to be able to exercise rights , but that does n't give them the ability to arbitrarily interfere or discriminate , " Angus said .
NDP wary about government intervention
The NDP is " very wary " about the government intervening in the internet , Angus told the House of Commons .
But the bill is n't about regulating the internet , it 's about ensuring there will be scrutiny of those who provide access to it , he said .
Now that the bill has been tabled , it has to wait to be called up in private members ' business in the House .
Angus is far down on the randomly generated list that determines the order in which members are scheduled to present their bills or motions , but he said he will try to trade positions with another party member to bring it up the list for discussion .
The point of the bill , Angus said , is to give MPs who otherwise have no idea what net neutrality is a reference point .
It also gives critics a focal point for their arguments .
Officials at Rogers did not immediately return requests for comment .
Mark Langton , spokesman for Bell , said there is no need for additional legislation as the existing Telecommunications
Act is sufficient .
A spokesperson for Minister of Industry Jim Prentice also did not immediately return a request for comment .
The spokesperson also did not reply to requests for comment on the net neutrality rally .
Prentice earlier this month told the House that the government was against regulating the internet and would leave the matter to be resolved by ISPs and their customers .
Scott Brison still to weigh in
Liberal industry critic Scott Brison has not weighed in on the issue , despite having held meetings with Bell , Rogers and several smaller ISPs a few weeks ago .
His spokesman did not reply to a request for comment on Wednesday .
Liberal MP Mauril Belanger spoke at the rally on Tuesday and said he was in favour of net neutrality , but added that the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission already has all the tools it needs at its disposal to punish abuse by ISPs .
Section 27 ( 2 ) of the Telecommunications
Act says : " No Canadian carrier shall , in relation to the provision of a telecommunications service or the charging of a rate for it , unjustly discriminate or give an undue or unreasonable preference toward any person , including itself , or subject any person to an undue or unreasonable disadvantage . "
Section 36 also says : " Except where the commission approves otherwise , a Canadian carrier shall not control the content or influence the meaning or purpose of telecommunications carried by it for the public . "
Despite those two sections , Angus said CRTC chairman Konrad von Finckenstein told the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage two weeks ago that the regulator did not have sufficient means to punish ISPs violating the rules .
Finckenstein said the CRTC needs the ability to impose monetary penalties for violating both the Telecommunications and Broadcasting Acts .
" It is something we need in our tool box , " he said .

Advertisement The Scottish National Party has pulled off a stunning by - election victory by winning Glasgow East , one of Labour 's safest seats , by 365 votes .
The SNP overturned a Labour majority of 13,507 to win with a swing of 22.54 % .
The SNP polled 11,277 votes in the contest , while the Tories came third with 1,639 and the Lib Dems , with 915 votes , came fourth .
SNP candidate John Mason said the victory was " off the Richter scale " , while Labour expressed disappointment .
Voter turnout was 42.25 % , down on the 48 % figure at the last election , with 26,219 votes cast .
The result was declared at Glasgow 's Tollcross Leisure Centre in the early hours of Friday , after a recount was requested by Labour , which won 10,912 votes in the contest .
Will it add to the pressure on Gordon Brown ?
Of course

Labour minister and Scottish MP Douglas Alexander said his party needed to " learn the lessons " from the " bad result " .
He added : " We will continue to reflect on these results in the days and weeks ahead because actually we do hold ourselves to a high standard .
We do want to serve not simply one part of the country but every part of the country .

" It hurts us to lose a seat like Glasgow East and we are determined to win it back . "
Defeated Labour candidate Margaret Curran said she did not regret standing in the by - election , but added : " I regret that I did not win this for Labour tonight .
" I do believe the Labour Party has to listen and has to hear the message from the people of Glasgow East . "
' Epic win' Mr Mason said : " Three weeks ago the SNP predicted a political earthquake .
" This SNP victory is not just a political earthquake , it is off the Richter scale .
" It is an epic win and the tremors will be felt all the way to Downing Street . "
BBC Scotland 's political editor , Brian Taylor , said it was an appalling result for Labour in a constituency it had held in various guises virtually since the party came into existence .
He said : " Will it add to the pressure on Gordon Brown ?
Of course .
Frankly , though , I do n't expect him to stand down any time soon .
" He already knew he faced a tough fight .

This year , there are n’t any gas lines ( though stay tuned ) , but the price seems outrageous ; and in particular , its rate of increase recently has been amazing .
Once again , establishment media offer no credible explanation ; reports of gas prices often follow weather information , which seems quite appropriate since they have little idea what causes either .
But this time , there ’s a difference : I ’ve not yet seen a fully credible explanation of what ’s going on even in libertarian literature .
That ’s a first .
~ Jim Davies , " Gas Puzzler " from Strike - the - Root.com
According to a recent study , among the things about which the elusive " average American " worries the most , the economy is among the top .
What ?
That anyone , and yes , I mean anyone spends any time worrying about the relative health of a measure so nebulous as the economy is testimony to the abilities of agents of the State to draw attention away from truly important matters and toward completely made - up , nearing bogus , statistics that no one can change .
On the other hand , I bet everyone has an opinion , forged with the frustration of a rapidly emptying wallet , about the question that heads this essay .
Not surprisingly , having people worry about " the economy " is also the type of question framing by which agents of the State can obtain almost god - like power .
Someone must do , well , something !
There outta be a law !
Certainly the average Joe knows he can't change the economy , but he still likely believes that " the government " or " the Fed " or Congress or the President can somehow directly affect these areas .
Maybe they can affect them , but I remain convinced of one other truth : almost anything they do will have negative and unexpected consequences .
In fact , that is exactly the premise of this essay .
As I read Jim Davies interesting piece on STR — quoted above — I wondered right along with him .
Why does gasoline cost so much ?
I do disagree with him a little bit though .
There has been no lack of Austrian - flavored scholarship on the matter .
Sterling Terrell 's basic primer on gasoline economics provided excellent context for the difference between the current price and the historical price .
He also showed credible reasons why the typical boogey - men — price gouging and excessive oil company profits come to mind — are not viable alternatives .
One must also , I think , avoid being blinded by rather typical American paternalism .
What many people are really asking is :
Why does gasoline cost so much in the U.S. now , and why did the price go up so quickly ?
The simple fact of the matter is that gas has been over $ 4.00 a gallon outside the U.S. , off and on , for years .
It seems to me that two factors are at work .
One is the actual price of the commodity .
The second is the rate with which the commodity has recently approached that price .
My working assumption , based upon the free market based scholarship I 've been able to read , is that gas purchased in the U.S. now costs just about what it should , given inflation between now and 1971 .
For instance , according to Steven Yates in a very recent piece for the New American :
How much of the rise in gas prices is attributable to the overall rise in prices caused by dollar inflation ?
One way of finding out is to measure the price of gasoline in terms of “ constant ” dollars instead of nominal dollars .
For instance , in 1971 — the year is significant because that was when President Richard Nixon took us totally off the gold standard — a gallon of gasoline that cost 50 cents a gallon would cost $ 2.66 today in 1971 dollars , as calculated by the Consumer Price Index .
In fact , this is a very conservative estimate of the devaluation of the dollar for the reason that the CPI increasingly underreports the actual overall increase in the cost of goods and services .
( See “ Dangers of an Underreported CPI ” in our June 23 issue . )
But even this conservative estimate shows that most of the increase in the price of gasoline from 50 cents in 1971 to $ 4.00 today is attributable to the dollar ’s overall loss of purchasing power , a devastating consequence of inflation .
So ( very ) roughly , nearly $ 3.00 of a $ 4.00 per gallon gasoline price can be accounted for by inflation !
( I wo n't spend any time debating the CPI .
I think we can all agree that it is very conservative . )
Even if one tries to use other rubrics , the answer remains the same .
As Doug French noted just the other day — comparing the cost of a gallon of gas to " real money " like silver — the value of a gallon of gas is relatively unchanged .
The cost of a gallon of gas in terms of the fake , inflation - roasted dollars we all must use , well , that 's another story .
The puzzlement  to use Davies ' very appropriate term  is that the rate with which the price has approached $ 4.00 seems much too high for inflation to be the only factor .
( The price has doubled in the last nine months .
Inflation , that ain't ! )
He 's correct .
He also provides an excellent clue to the answer as well , when he says , " The premise is that the rate of oil price increase proves that no free market is operating . "
Exactly .
If one was to plot the price of a gallon of gas now and the price of a gallon of gas in 1971 and draw a line between them , overlaying another plot of inflation between now and then , he'd see a gradual rise to the current price and it would all make sense .
Heck , he could probably change the slope of the line to match changing inflation rates in the intervening years and still get an excellent match .
So why has the price changed so fast recently ?
The answer is the same as always : the State did it .
My guess : the controls placed on gasoline prices in the U.S. wore out .
Those controls held the prices down , particularly relative to pricing of the same commodity worldwide .
When those controls — whatever they were and I do n't claim to know — stopped working , the price went up rapidly .
When the State uses price - control schemes , and we already know that no truly free market exists in oil , unexpected and negative effects always result .
One quick note about inflation : people often fail to see it as it really is .
They tend to define inflation as a rise in consumer prices , when , in fact , it is growth in what is accepted as money .
In the U.S. , the inflation first was directed toward the stock market , and then housing .
When those markets tanked , then it was directed towards commodities and , ultimately , oil .
And here we are .
In a capitalist economy , over time ( provided money is relatively stable ) prices tend to fall , which is what we have generally seen .
However , when you have a government that tries to penalize production and engage in the art of inflation , you are going to see commodity prices rise .
I think some might refer to the current rapid change in price as a correction , but I 'm just guessing .
That some might now think the government should impose controls to keep U.S. prices levels at the unrealistic level they had maintained for so long , when the culprit is government intervention in the first place , particularly because of inflation , is truly ironic .
Conclusion
The U.S. almost always used more gasoline than it produced .
The U.S. generally exceeded almost every other industrialized country in the relative amount of gasoline consumed , i.e. , the demand in the U.S. always impinged greatly on the worldwide supply .
The economic fact of the matter is this : gasoline should have cost more in the U.S. than it has long before now !
As best I understand economics , the people who use more , i.e. , demand more , of something , all things equal , generally pay more .
For years , somehow , the U.S. has gorged itself on gasoline while Canada , Europe , and everyone else paid through the nose .
Well , now that nations like China are vying for that gasoline , the demand is up even more .
Even at that , I 'm not sure that the cost has topped out , given the relative cheapness of gas in the U.S.
( That 's not a misprint . )
Do n't believe U.S. gas is a relative bargain ?
Think again .
( This data is three years old and still shows a massive difference . )
But wait , there 's more .
I realize that saying Americans still pay less than many people around the world wo n't make the frustration one feels at the pump go away .
Just for yucks , here is a chart , created with a handy web - based tool I found , that compares U.S. and Canadian gas prices , with crude oil prices superimposed .
Notice how Canadians have been paying about $ 1.00 a gallon more than U.S. consumers for a long time .
Notice also , how the recent rate of change for crude oil prices still has not been fully accounted for in the price of either Canadian or U.S. gasoline .
Notice too , how the Canadian price shows almost the same shape , only with a different set - point than the U.S. price .
( I wonder where that money went . )
According to AirInc , a company that tracks the cost of living in various places around the world , " the main factor in [ gasoline ] price disparities between countries is government policy . "
No surprise there .
Worse yet , the State cannot fix anything without causing another problem someplace else .
The size of the proverbial pipeline in the U.S. has been getting smaller and smaller for years , due to crazy regulations , environmental mumbo- jumbo , and just plain irrationality .
Well , guess what ?
The chickens of inflationary economic policy , combined with extremely non-free - market energy policies , are coming home to roost .
Repeat after me : The State is always the problem .
I just hope people wake up and do n't actually cry out for more of what already did n't work .
Yes , I know .
I 'm dreaming .

HARRISBURG – Senator Mike Folmer ( R - Lebanon ) today introduced the
Voters ' Choice Act ( VCA ) , which removes the Commonwealth 's unfair
hurdles that obstruct ballot access for independent and minor party
candidates for public office .
" No state makes it tougher to get on the ballot than Pennsylvania , as
independent and minor party candidates face significantly more
difficult barriers than Republicans and Democrats , " Folmer said .
" My
bill would enhance our democratic process by leveling the playing
field . "
Currently , Pennsylvania law uses a complex formula to produce an
extraordinarily high number of petition signatures that non-major
party candidates must obtain in order to appear on the ballot in a
general election .
In 2006 , that formula resulted in minor party and
independent candidates having to gather nearly 68,000 petition
signatures to run in the General Election for Governor or U.S .
Senator .
Major party candidates , meanwhile , were required to gather
only 2,000 signatures during the primary election to run for those
same offices .
Folmer 's legislation would make the signature requirements for
independent candidates to appear on the general election ballot the
same as which major party candidates have for primary elections .
Because minor parties do not participate in primary elections , the
Voter Choice
Act would require them to nominate candidates for a
general election according to their own rules , and at their own
expense .

I noticed that while there 's a whole ton of stories — and people who emulate them — about heavily armed survivalists bravely holding off the twilight of civilization after the Big One , there are damned few stories about super - networked post - apocalyptic Peace Corps who respond to the Great Fall by figuring out how to put it all back together .
I even came up with a name for it : the Outquisition ; the opposite of the Inquisition — missionaries who come to your town to remind you of how awesome it can all be , leave behind a bunch of rad , life - improving systems and tools , and generally get on with the business of being happy , well - fed and peaceful .
Alex wrote up a great post about this and 24 hours later , some WorldChanging readers created Outquisition.org .
I 'm not sure what they 'll do there , but in my dreams , they 're off building a non-secret society of emergency - preparedness Nice People who think that the response to catastrophe is n't lifeboat rules and militias , but humanitarian aid and kick - ass tools .
What would it be like , we wondered , if folks who knew tools and innovation left the comfy bright green cities and traveled to the dead mall suburban slums , rustbelt browntowns and climate - smacked farm communities and started helping the locals get the tools they needed .
We imagined that it would need an almost missionary fervor , something like the Inquisition ( which largely destroyed knowledge ) in reverse , a crusade of open sharing , or as Cory promptly dubbed it , the Outquisition .
Imagine these folks like this passing out free textbooks , running holistic programs for kids , creating local knowledge management systems , launching microfinance projects , mobilebanking and complementary currencies .
Helping rural landowners apply climate foresight and farm biodiversity .
Building cheap , smart , quality housing for displaced people ( not to mention better refugee camps ) , or an Open Architecture Network for cheap informal rehabs of run-down suburban housing .
Hacking together DIY windmills and ad hoc smart grids , communication systems , water treatment systems — and getting really good atadaptive reuses of outdated infrastructure .
In other words , these folks would be redistributing the future at a furious clip .

Seen While Running : Eaten By Trees
One of the pleasures of running is the ability to observe everything as you trot along .
You see little subtleties that you would n’t notice as you race past in a car .
I have run the same routes dozens of times and I always see something new and interesting each time .
Here are some examples of trees that might look normal at 60 mph , but they ’ll give you a good excuse to stop for a breather if you see them in the wild .
This sign still surprisingly legible considering it is about to be swallowed completely .
For good luck , hikers push a penny into this old log .
Look closely ; the tree has actually grabbed the basin and lifted it off the ground .
You know those neighbors that never take down their Christmas lights ?
This is what will eventually happen .
This is definitely the best bike lock I ’ve ever seen .

Plame files appeal to resurrect lawsuit against Bush Administration
The lawyers for outed CIA officer Valerie Plame have filed suit in federal court to appeal a decision to quash her lawsuit against those in the Bush administration she says illegally outed her as a CIA operative in 2003 .
Plame says her CIA cover was blown as retribution for her husband 's criticism of the Iraq war .
She says that violated her constitutional rights .
The ex-career CIA officer is also set to attend will an annual " power lunch " to benefit Illinois congresswoman Jan Schakowsky with the wife of presidential candidate Barack Obama , Michelle .
A federal judge dismissed Plame 's lawsuit last year on procedural grounds .
Her lawyers asked a federal appeals court Friday to force the judge to consider the merits of the case .
Plame and her husband , former Ambassador Joseph Wilson , sued Vice President Dick Cheney ; his former chief of staff , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby ; former White House political adviser Karl Rove and former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage .
DEVELOPING ...
Here ’s a question prompted from some conversations with Mike :
To what extent do ideas influence the formation of culture ?
This is a big one , of course .
At one extreme we have Hegel , who thought culture , civilization , history , and politics were nothing but the evolution of ideas , like a great big collective consciousness making up its mind .
At another extreme we would have someone who sees the changes in culture and history as entirely whimsical – maybe each change can be explained given enough information about the prior state , but there really are n’t any general laws governing the changes , let alone any sort of “ end ” culture is approximating toward .
( Can anyone name a thinker to credit with this ? )
Somewhere in the middle is Marx , who thought economics ( and not ideas ) does the driving .
Clearly there is sometimes some of what Mike calls “ trickle - down philosonomics . ”
Meaning , sometimes a great idea of a philosopher gets passed along eventually to the producers of culture and ends up being a significant mover .
Anyone have some good examples ?
Right now the best I can come up with is the idea of “ political correctness , ” which started in the academy and then filtered down through society in all sorts of regrettable ways .
More often , it seems , media mavens appropriate some austere idea in order to pin a snazzy label on some change that is happening anyway .
I ’m thinking here of literary and film criticism , which is always trying to see the hand of the great thinkers in the most inane cultural products .
And it also frequently happens that some change occurs in a society , and the philosophers pick up on it and theorize about it – so culture influences the formation of ideas , not the other way around .
Maybe ideas influence the formation of culture only in retrospect .
When you look back on a historical period , and want to understand what happened , sometimes you want to trace economic changes , or political changes , and sometimes you want to track philosophical / literary evolution .
You may want to see how the tensions within Hegel ’s philosophy led to Marx on the one hand , and Kierkegaard and Nietzsche on the other .
And , if you are knowledgeable and creative enough , you might see parallels between these ideological evolutions and changes that took place within the culture .
This sounds like a bunch of make - believe , but damned if it does n’t make for edifying results .
Read Schorske ’s Fin-de - Siecle Vienna .
I think the practitioners of this art do think they are tracing some kind of causal history .
There , I suppose , I ’m skeptical .
I think what they are really doing is exploring abstract ideas ( like freedom , absurdity , and responsibility ) , and the role they play in our views of history and culture .
So if I am for whatever reason interested in turn - of - the - century Vienna , and read up on the history and literature of the time , I might turn to Schorske ’s work to help me integrate some elements of the causal history with ideological elements .
What I end up with is a fusion of history and network of ideas – historio - philosophy , I guess .
It may be bad or distorted history , but that does n’t mean its valueless .
When you were young , one of the most basic forms you learn is the stick figure .
Lines for arms , lines for legs , and a circle for the head .
They ’re so easy to draw , even a caveman could do it .
( And they did , portraying their stick men hunting buffalo or dragging women in their caves or somesuch . )
They ’re also forever linked to our childhoods , as — in the days before we learned about perspective and depth — they were the first things were learned to draw .
Thus , almost all webcomics using stick figures acknowledge how juvenile it all is .
Cyanide & Happiness revels in it , with their characters oozing bodily fluids as if they were characters in a bored 10 - year - old ’s notebook .
xkcd employs the medium to toy with our expectations , launching into subjects that no child would contemplate ( such as complex math equations or heartache ) .
But can stick figures be more ?
Rich Burlew thinks so .
Despite having a degree in Illustration at the Pratt Institute , he decided to primarily use stick figures in his wildly popular webcomic , The Order of the Stick ( popularly abbreviated OotS , though its true abbreviation , tOotS , provides a more flatulently melodic acronym ) .
Why ?
According to an interview at Sequential Tart , Rich believes that “ art really is more than just rendering anatomy , especially comic art .
Communicating the actions of the main characters is the primary goal here , not to show off how well I understand facial structure . ”
A lofty goal , to be sure … but does he succeed ?
Do n’t let the humble appearance of the comic fool you .
OotS is the Tom Hanks of webcomics , visually unassuming yet winning a veritable poo-pile of comic - related awards .
It has won 5 Web Cartoonists ’ Choice Awards , including Best Long Form Comic in 2008 .
OotS ‘ second print compilation won an ENnie Award in 2007 ( an award I never heard of before , but is apparently awarded for role - playing products ) .
Most recently , OotS won the 2007 Eagle Award for Best Web - Based Comic and scored a nomination for Favourite Original Graphic Novel .
Like other works of high fantasy , The Order of the Stick can be summed up as an adventure that involves long , arduous travels between different locations punctuated by events that can best be described as epic cluster ****s.
OotS is primarily a humor comic , so it has closer ties to Terry Pratchett ’s Discworld than The Lord of the Rings .
It ’s playful and lighthearted , even when it shows scenes where legions of soldiers are getting decapitated .
That ’s is more or less the only way you can play that sort of scene in a stick figure comic , anyway .
You ca n’t really feel too horrified when death is represented by a frowny face and two big X’s where the eyes should be .
The protagonists are collectively known as the Order of the Stick , named so because they ’re stick figures ( duh ) , though the in - story explanation has yet to be explained .
Roy Greenhilt , the dark - skinned fighter with a sword that , uh , has a green hilt , is the leader .
He ’s often irritated by the shenanigans of the less responsible members .
He ’s aware , too , of his own shortcomings .
Among his teammates , Roy evolves the most as a character , even if he ’s the one who tends to arrogantly run his mouth on self - righteous speeches .
( I like to think of him as OotS ‘s version of South Park‘s Kyle Broflovski . )
The red - head ponytailed thief Haley Starshine is a little more complex .
Initially , she ’s portrayed as a greedy dungeon robber who ’s only in it for the bling .
Later strips completely overlook her lust for gold and instead focus on the true purpose of her life choices .
It ’s not a character evolution , but rather a deeper exploration of her character as a whole .
There are long sequences that explore her internal struggles and her unrequited ( later , requited ) love for Elan .
On the FAQ , Burlew mentions that Haley is his favorite character , and it is n’t hard to see why .
She ’s the team ’s heart .
And speaking of the blonde - haired bard who ’s a hit with the chicks , Elan represents the team ’s odious comic relief .
I ’m sure plenty of OotS fans are ready to smack me across the face with their +2 Rolled - Up Dragon Magazine of Crushing Damage as Elan seems to be a fan favorite .
Scenes of spontaneous singing or streaking strike me more as embarrassing and failed attempts at being funny .
Elan ’s most infamous moment comes when he introduces his puppet , Banjo the Clown , as a new diety .
Is this puppet a charming example of Elan ’s innocent goofiness or a lame , overdone prop gag that ’s trying way too hard to make the reader laugh ?
( More on this sort of humor later . )
I did think that Burlew did a good job by turning Elan into a “ Dashing Swordsman ” ( which was culled from a third party developer ) , which promises to turn Elan into something more than the team ’s Jar Jar Binks .
There are three other members of The Order of the Stick — an elven mage , a dwarven cleric , and an evil halfling ranger — but so far , they do n’t get nearly as much spotlight as the series ’ version of the Holy Trinity .
That ’s the way it always turn out , is n’t it ?
The damn humans always gotta hog the spotlight !
The Order ’s initial mission represents the crowning achievement of all Advanced Dungeons & Dragons missions : to pile up phat loot and to level up like a mofo .
After traveling some distance and meeting up random encounters and with folk who happen to be their evil dopplegangers ( known , creatively , as The Linear Guild ) , they soon find themselves cast as unlikely players in a plot that will determine nothing less than the fate of all existence .
( Like you could n’t see that coming . )
From this point , the Order must protect the three remaining gates that hold together the structure of the universe , fight off a massive goblin army from invading the paladin stronghold at Azure City , and figure out how to raise fallen comrades from the dead .
As you might expect , much of the humor is aimed exclusively at Dungeons & Dragons players .
They ’re the sort of jokes told , punctuated with barely contained snorts , by oily , acne- infested kids who smell of egg - salad sandwiches as they gather around a table at the local Game Workshop .
Believe it or not , this is the source of much ( unspeakably nerdy ) controversy .
OotS ‘s Wikipedia entry claims that some detractors gripe that the humor is a barrier to new readers , alienating those who are n’t embedded in the tabletop gaming culture .
( By the way , I highly suggest clicking on that Wikipedia link .
I know I ’ve said it of other comics , but the OotS entry really blew away .
This is by far one of the most detailed entries I have ever seen .
In this day an age where “ non-notable ” entries are deleted left and right , I stand in awe at the unnecessary voluminousness of the article for Miyo Miyazaki , a secondary character . )
I ’ve never played Dungeons & Dragons in my life .
( “ Yeah , whatever , you big nerdlinger ! ” you say , but it ’s true .
I write reviews of webcomics ; what do I have do to prove my nerd cred ? )
I ’ve dabbled in Black Isle ’s D&D games , mainly Baldur ’s Gate and Planescape : Torment , as well as a slew of other RPGs , from Daggerfall to Final Fantasy .
If you ’re the sort of person that reads webcomics , chances are you did , too .
One or two jokes went over my head , namely anything that had to do with “ listening checks , ” but they are n’t that hard to figure out .
Only some of the humor is directed at RPG players — a bonus for the faithful .
The rest is all about corny pratfalls exemplified by our pal , Elan the Bard .
Whether or not that humor is funny is an entirely different question .
At best , I cracked a small smile , like when a small band of evil adventurers managed to penetrate OotS ‘s version of heaven .
( I admit , there are times when nerdy references , this time of Planescape - type scenarios , can make even my black - hearted self chuckle . )
Most of the time , though , the jokes come straight out of a Jungle Safari Tour .
There ’s nothing terribly offensive or infantile about the jokes ( and make no mistake , I ’m quite appreciative of that ) .
They just happen to be the type that induces copious amounts of groaning and eye rolling .
The evil halfling committing violence and quipping , “ When in doubt , set someone on fire ” ?
Eh .
The millionth unfunny homage to Abbott & Costello ’s “ Who ’s on first ? ” routine ?
That was only funny when Slappy Squirrel did her Woodstock - inspired diatribe .
There ’s light - hearted , breezy humor , and then there ’s humor that makes you want to bang your head against the wall .
There are other times when Burlew is attempting to be serious and sentimental , yet is derailed by the medium he has chosen .
Spoilers ahead .
There ’s a point in the story where , after a long dramatic build - up lasting several hundred pages , Elan finally plants a kiss on Haley ’s lips .
You can tell this is supposed to be a big pay - off , the point where two will - they - or - wo n ’t - they characters finally express their feelings for each other .
Instead , my reaction … well , I really do n’t need to elaborate , do I ?
Two stick figures making out ?
Seriously ?
If you can stomach this scene , though , then other dramatic moments — such as the time where Roy pulls a Tom Cruise to celebrate his love or when Haley just wants to be held in Elan ’s manly arms — should roll off your back , mama ’s boy .
End spoilers .
On the other hand , Burlew succeeds immensely in depicting grand , sweeping scenes .
I could take pot -shots here , too , by the way .
The main villain , Xykon , is portrayed as a bit of an annoying joke .
In one scene , during the siege of Azure City , he ’s tossing off one - liners like a second - rate Shecky Greene .
This does not , however , detract from the fact that Burlew has managed to craft an epic scene of
two vast armies colliding using nothing but circles and lines .
Here ’s where to stick - figure simplicity works to OotS ‘s advantage .
You get a good feel for the size and strategies of each army .
The Battle of Azure City switches between many locations — from a breach in the castle wall to the parapets to the commanders of both armies — and at no point does the reader get lost .
The backgrounds are simple enough to identify at a quick glance .
The scenes can get quite horrifying , too .
In a genuinely disturbing scene , a spell causes a legion of paladins to commit mass suicide .
In another incredibly well composed scene , we follow one of the main character in freefall ( spoilers in link ) by scrolling down the page along side him until the inevitable moment where he meets his fate .
The spartan stick - figure style also works to OotS ‘s advantage earlier in the story , where Lord Shojo , the head of the paladins , explains the true purpose of the Gates .
Burlew depicts the story ’s mythos with panels that look like they were drawn by a Kindergartener in Crayola .
It ’s a shift in style that not only ties into the childish aesthetic of the stick figure characters , but also successfully simplifies a fairly complex concept for the reader .
The Order of the Stick is also a very talky comic .
There ’s plenty of dialogue — mountainous bucketloads , in fact — which I can only assume is there to compensate for the lack of artistic detail .
Sometimes , it ’s welcome .
Roy and an angel spend quite a bit of time discussing whether or not he is , technically , lawful good .
It rambles on a bit too long , yet provides an invaluable peek into how morality works in the world of OotS .
I ’m in a far less forgiving mood when the paladin Hinjo talks down to Miko in why she is a far worse person than anyone on the Order of the Stick .
By this point , we , the reader , had been treated to many , many occasions why we should hate Miko .
She ’s self - righteous , stuck - up , and unreasonable .
Yet , I already found it tiring the first time Roy launched into a long tirade over why we should hate Miko .
We have to be subjected to it a second time ?
I get it !
We ’re supposed to hate Miko !
This was by far the most annoying segment in the series .
I did n’t bother reading OotS again for another two weeks after .
Still , despite its annoyances , I ’m going to give OotS a fairly high rating .
It ’s for basically the same reason why I gave the similar 8 - Bit Theater a good score for its advances in the field of pixel art .
The Order of the Stick does something no one else does : elevate the humble art of stick figures into something grandiose .
Rating : 4 stars ( out of 5 )

As we wait with bated breath for the Associated Press to come down from the mountain with its own rules for " fair use for bloggers , " Patrick Nielsen Hayden gives us a sense of what the AP considers fair use ( found via Boing Boing ) .
Apparently , for quite some time , the AP has had up a page that lists out prices for quoting AP text .
I will quote the list prices , and hope I do n't get a DMCA takedown : Oh , and it gets better .
The AP claims that it can revoke the license at any time if it feels you 're saying something negative about the Associated Press : " Publisher reserves the right to terminate this Agreement at any time if Publisher or its agents finds
Your use of the licensed Content to be offensive and / or damaging to Publisher ’s reputation .
" Now , these are the terms that the AP has had on its site for some time -- but they explain why the AP went after the Drudge Retort for quoting less than 100 words .
To the AP , that was a violation requiring a $ 25 license .
So , while some believe that those criticizing the AP are overreacting , I 'd argue that 's not the case at all .
This is not , as suggested , a one - time thing .
This is an ongoing pattern of misuse of copyright law by the AP .
And it 's been pointed out to the AP in the past that these actions are wrong -- and it did nothing to change the AP 's behavior .
Instead , it seems to have only emboldened the AP .
Besides , it now appears that the AP 's way of having this " conversation " with bloggers on what is AP - acceptable " fair use " is to meet with some guy who represents some blogging " group " I 've never heard of .
That group does not represent bloggers and it certainly does n't speak for all of us in reaching some sort of " agreement . "
If the AP really wants to engage with the critics , why does n't it come out and talk to those of us criticizing its actions ?
So far , the only engagement has been to cut and past the same comment on a bunch of blog sites ...
Other than that , it has only spoken to reporters about this issue .

US rushes military show trial for alleged 9/11 conspirators
By Don Knowland
6 June 2008
Five persons alleged to have participated in the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington , including the alleged 9/11 mastermind Khaled Shaikh Mohammed , made their first appearances today before a Military Commission in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba on war crimes charges .
Prosecutors , who are asking for the death penalty , have sought a mid-September trial , on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks and just seven weeks before the US presidential election .
The sudden rush to trial stands in contrast to the five long years the prisoners have been held incommunicado .
During that time they had no access to legal counsel or any other semblance of due process .
Most , if not all , were tortured .
Now , with trial just three months away , defense lawyers , who have just recently been assembled and allowed to meet with the prisoners , are expected to somehow mount a defense .
Political considerations fully govern both the timing of and methods used in this trial A show trial that places details of the 9/11 attacks front and center in an election year is designed to muzzle any domestic challenge to the US “ war on terrorism , ” the principal ideological cover for US policies of aggressive war and implementation of a national surveillance state .
The US government also sees a terrorist trial spectacle as a means to bring pressure on its overseas allies to buttress what remains of the unpopular and flagging military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The trials are also designed to legitimize the use of waterboarding , to which Shaikh Mohammed was subjected , and other torture techniques .
The intended message will be that torture should be allowed because its use could uncover heinous plots such as 9/11 .
Moreover , Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld and the others at the highest echelons of the American state who authorized it therefore should not be criminally prosecuted .
A military judge recently ordered that the government ’s most prominent spokesman for the commissions , Air Force Brigadier General Thomas Hartmann , be removed from any role in a separate military commission pending against Salim Ahmed Hamdan , who is alleged to have been Osama Bin Laden ’s driver , precisely because of evidence that such naked political calculations controlled the commission ’s decisions .
Hartmann also serves as the legal advisor to Susan Crawford , the “ convening authority ” in charge of the commissions .
Civilian defense lawyers for the five 9/11 defendants filed a 20 - page legal brief objecting to the Pentagon ’s rush to trial .
Army Major Jon Jackson , the military lawyer for defendant Mustafa al - Hawsawi , who is accused of helping to finance the 9/11 attacks , had unsuccessfully sought to delay al - Hawsawi ’s arraignment on this same basis .
Jackson said he had only met his client twice , that he had “ been barred from discussing those meetings with his assistant defense counsel , Navy Lt. Gretchen Sosbee , because the military has not yet given her security clearance , ” that he “ has not received any potential evidence against al - Hawsawi supporting charges that ‘ allege a complex conspiracy spanning several years . ’”
Jackson said that he and the other defense lawyers have had no place to store their work , discuss classified material or prepare for their case while in Cuba .
The presiding trial judge , Marine Colonel Ralph Kohlman , cut short such arguments , ordering attorneys to be seated when they persisted in trying to argue the point .
Defense lawyers also appealed to the Court of Military Commission review to halt the arraignment of the defendants on these charges , apparently unsuccessfully .
Defense lawyers asked that trial not go forward “ until the most rudimentary building blocks necessary to afford a defense are in place . ”
Shaikh Mohammed told the presiding military judge today that he and his co-defendants were tortured following their capture by US forces and that the proceeding “ is inquisition , it is not trial . ”
“ I ’m looking to be martyr for long time , ” he said .
First Shaikh Mohammed and then the other defendants asked and were granted permission by Kohlman to represent themselves without counsel .
According to the Associated Press , one defendant said he had barely been allowed to meet with his lawyer anyway and described him as “ a signboard ” hung up so the government could say , “ Hey , we give these people lawyers . ”
The head of the ACLU , Anthony Romero , attributed these developments to a government attempt to eliminate effective legal representation .
“ It hardly comes as any surprise that after holding individuals in solitary confinement for five years and subjecting them to torture , these detainees would reject the legal system and offers to represent them , ” he said .
Romero continued : “ It is highly suspect that the government changed its protocols for the interaction of the defendants on the very day they were arraigned .
For several years they ’ve been held separately without communication and yet , on the day of their arraignment , they were allowed to interact with the obvious goal of allowing them to present a unified rejection of legal representation . ”
Even apart from the government ’s failure to give attorneys for the accused adequate time to prepare a defense , the tribunal grossly denies the defendants even the rudiments of a fair trial .
For example , evidence obtained by torture is not barred .
General Hartmann , the legal advisor to Susan Crawford , who oversees the military commissions , has repeatedly emphasized that trial judges may decide to admit statements from interrogations that involved waterboarding , if they find that is merely “ coercion ” rather than torture .
Coerced statements may be used as evidence if the judge determines they are “ reliable ” and “ probative ” ’ and that their use is “ in the best interest of justice . ”
Similarly , hearsay evidence is permitted .
For example , investigators will be permitted to testify as to what they claim witnesses said .
No opportunity will be given to cross-examine the underlying witnesses .
Hartmann said that defendants will get only 30 days to challenge such evidence after receiving notice of the prosecution ’s intention to introduce it .
Much trial evidence is supposedly sensitive material that will be withheld from public view .
This is designed to hide the use of torture to the extent possible as well as to keep the defendants from testifying to possible links between their activities and US intelligence operatives , some of whom likely had advance notice of the 9/11 attacks .
The convening authority , Susan Crawford , last week threw out charges against a sixth defendant , Mohammad al - Qahtani , the alleged “ 20th hijacker . ”
That decision illustrates the rotten nature of the whole commission edifice .
An FBI investigation of possible war crimes by US personnel documented the abuse to which al - Qahtani was subjected .
This included prolonged restraint , sleep deprivation , sensory overload , use of dogs , and exposure to extreme temperatures .
Al - Qahtani was interrogated for up to 20 hours a day for 48 days , made to wear women ’s underwear , and leashed like a dog .
Al - Qahtani ’s lawyer , Lieutenant Colonel Bryan Broyles , told the Wall Street Journal the government had no evidence against him other than that obtained through such methods .
However , al - Qahtani can still be held indefinitely as an enemy combatant , and the military prosecution may decide to file new charges .
The ACLU and other organizations roundly criticized today ’s arraignment of the defendants .
The ACLU ’s Romero said : “ The government has had over six years to build its case and is giving the defense just three short months to prepare for trial — all in an effort to steamroll the process to meet an arbitrary court date clearly designed to influence the elections .
This is a direct assault on the fundamental concepts of American justice and due process . ”
Families of 9/11 victims also expressed their outrage today .
Patricia Perry , mother of New York City Police Officer John William Perry , said , “ Like others who mourn family members killed on 9/11 , I wish for justice and accountability for my son .
But secretive proceedings tainted by the use of torture are outside the system of justice on which the honor of this nation depends . ”
Valerie Lucznikowski , who lost her nephew , Adam Arias , on 9/11 , said , “ I lost someone I dearly loved on September 11 , and have waited too long to see those responsible brought to justice .
But these special military tribunals that are stained by politics and deny detainees the basic American principle of due process smack of revenge rather than justice , and mock our legal system and those we lost . ”
Pervasive Pollyannas of Prosperity
David Leonhardt discusses a few items today which are regular discussion points here at TBP .
My favorite lately is why the public is so much gloomier than the pundits :
" Pundits have been scratching their heads about why the public mood is so grim .
Last week , Barron ’s called the drop in consumer confidence “ difficult to figure . ”
A front - page headline in The Washington Post claimed , “ We ’re Gloomier Than the Economy . ”
But are we really ?
For the first time on record , an economic expansion seems to have just ended without most families having received a raise .
For the first time on record , the typical home price nationwide is falling .
The inflation - adjusted value of the Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index has dropped 20 percent in the last year — and 30 percent since its peak in 2000 .
I think the public has called this issue exactly right : the American economy has some real problems .
Even if this summer ’s downturn turns out to be mild , those problems are n’t mild — or simple — and they are n’t going away anytime soon .
It ’s going to take some real work . "
That 's spot on .
Want some more evidence ?

We have heard longstanding charges of liberal media bias , going all the way back to Spiro Agnew 's Nattering Nabobs of Negativism ( September 11 , 1970 ) .
Whatever validity that Trojan horse might have ever had has now jumped the shark .
Mass Media is owned by large corporate interests ( Disney , Viacom , News Corp , Time Warner , etc. ) .
If anything , the disconnect between reality and the " Pervasive Pollyannas of Prosperity " has rendered moot William Safire 's catchphrase .
Indeed , the bias is precisely the other way -- between reality and ideological absurdity .
Its the Lite Beer marketing syndrome :
If your product is pisswater , and fattening to boot , you never admit that in your advertising .
Instead , you frame the debate as whether it " tastes great or is less filling . "
Its jiu jitsu marketing , turning your liability into an advantage .
The misdirection is often effective .
How absurd has the Panglossian cheerleading become ?
On my pal Larry Kudlow 's show last night , several of Candide 's descendants talked about how great stocks are if you hold them for 30 years .
That 's right , the holding period for equities according to this crowd is three decades .
Of course , this means every pullback is a buying opportunity .
Words such as these can only be spoken by someone who has never worked on a trading desk or managed assets professionally -- or if they did , they lost most of their clients ' money .
Rather than address why the public is so unhappy , the triple Ps toss charges of bias .
Ignore the worst monthly Auto Sales since 1992 , ignore the latest signs of consumer distress ( Starbucks closing 500 stores ) .
And when that stops working , PPP starts discussing the long run , ignoring the trading wisdom of Keynes .
Its yet more evidence of the pollution of economics with partisan politics .
Fortunately for most of the Pervasive Pollyannas of Prosperity , they do n't have to live off their market calls .
Those who invest based on their " Never say recession " worldview best have another source of income .
Fortunately , most of the public is n't so easily misled .
~~~
As noted earlier , we are overdue for as bounce today .
But this short term market noise will not change our long held belief that we are in for a slow - motion slowdown .
And merely wishing it were otherwise wo n't change the grim reality of the situation .

I , like a lot of you , grew up on Sesame Street and the Muppets .
But do you ever stop to wonder where they came from ?
Some of the characters we know and love today were recycled from other T.V. shows and commercials Jim Henson worked on and others were invented by using whatever materials were around .
Be prepared for a little nostalgia for today 's Q10 .
And do n't be offended if I left out some of your favorites ( I know , Big Bird ? ! ) " “ not all of the characters have interesting background stories .
But if you know the story behind one that I left out , share with us in the comments !
The Origins of 10 of Your Favorite Muppets
1. Cookie Monster .
Jim Henson drew some monsters eating various snacks for a General Foods commercial in 1966 .
The commercial was never used , but Henson recycled one of the monsters ( the " Wheel - Stealer " ) for an IBM training video in 1967 and again for a Fritos commercial in 1969 .
By this time , he started working on Sesame Street and decided this monster would have a home there .
2. Elmo .
The way it 's described by a Sesame Street writer , apparently this extra red puppet was just lying around .
People would pick him up and try to do something with him , but nothing really panned out .
In 1984 , puppeteer Kevin Clash picked up the red puppet and started doing the voice and the personality and it clicked " “ thus , Elmo was born .
3. Telly Monster was originally the Television Monster when he debuted in 1979 .
He was obsessed with T.V. and his eves would whirl around as if hypnotized whenever he was in front of a set .
After a while , producers started worrying about his influence on youngsters , so they changed him to make him the chronic worrier he is now .
4. Count von Count made his first appearance in 1972 and was made out of an Anything Muppet pattern " “ a blank Muppet head that could have features added to it to make various characters .
He used to be more sinister " “ he was able to hypnotize and stun people and he laughed in typical scary - villain - type fashion after completing a count of something and thunder and lightning would occur .
He was quickly made more appealing to little kids , though .
He is apparently quite the ladies ' man " “ he has been linked to Countess von Backward , who loves to count backward ; Countess Dahling von Dahling and Lady Two .
5. Kermit was " born " in 1955 and first showed up on Sam and Friends , a five - minute puppet show by Jim Henson .
The first Kermit was made out of Henson 's mom 's coat and some ping pong balls .
At the time , he was more lizard - like than frog - like .
By the time he showed up on Sesame Street in 1969 , though , he had made the transition to frog .
There are rumors that he got the name Kermit from a childhood friend of Henson 's or a puppeteer from the early days of the Muppets , but Henson always refuted both of those rumors .
6. Real Swedish Chef Lars " Kuprik " BÃ¤ckman claims he was the inspiration for the Swedish Chef .
He was on Good Morning America , he says , and caught Jim Henson 's eye .
Henson supposedly bought the rights to the Good Morning America recording and created the Swedish Chef ( who DOES have a real name , but it 's not understandable ) .
One of the Muppet writers , Jerry Juhl , says that in all of the years of working with Jim Henson on the Swedish Chef , he never heard that the character was based on a real person .
7. Animal - Everyone 's favorite member of Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem may have been inspired by Keith Moon of The Who .
This is speculation , but people who support this theory will point out that Jim Henson named one of the Fraggle Rock characters " Wembley " , which is the town Moon was born in .
8. Miss Piggy is apparently from Iowa .
Makes sense .
Anyway , she started as a minor character on The Muppet Show , but anyone who knows Miss Piggy can see that she would n't settle for anything " minor " .
Her first T.V. appearance was actually on an Herb Alpert special .
It was n't until 1976 , when The Muppet Show premiered , that she became the glamorous blonde with a penchant for frog that we know and love today .
Frank
Oz once said that Miss Piggy grew up in Iowa ; her dad died when she was young and her mother was mean .
She had to enter beauty contests to make money .
9 . Rowlf the dog , surprise , surprise , was first made in 1962 for a series of Purina Dog Chow commercials .
He went on to claim fame as Jimmy Dean 's sidekick on The Jimmy Dean Show and was on every single episode from 1963 to 1966 .
Jimmy Dean said Rowlf got about 2,000 letters from fans every week .
He was considered for Sesame Street but ended up becoming a regular on The Muppet Show in 1976 .
10 . Oscar the Grouch is performed by the same guy who does Big Bird , Carroll Spinney .
Spinney said he based Oscar 's cranky voice on a particular NYC cab driver he once had the pleasure of riding with .
He was originally an alarming shade of orange .
In Pakistan , his name is Akhtar and he lives in an oil barrel .
In Turkey , he is Kirpik and lives in a basket .
And in Israel , it 's not Oscar at all " “ it's his cousin , Moishe Oofnik , who lives in an old car .
Approximately 1 million people paid for tickets to go on whale watching cruises off the coast of Massachusetts and Maine in 2006 .
These sales generated around $ 21 million dollars for the companies who operate the boats : no small change .
While the public might have been enjoying the experience of seeing and learning more about endangered whales and other animals that sometimes use the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary , scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were concerned that perhaps the tours were affecting the whales negatively .
Using spies armed with GPS receivers and high - tech binoculars , they set out to see if whale watch tour companies were upholding what are commonly referred to as “ voluntary conservation agreements . ”
Voluntary conservation agreements are just what they sound like , and are sometimes used as a management strategy with the hope that organizations will comply with mutually agreed - upon guidelines more readily and eagerly than legally - enforced regulations .
In this case , the whale watch companies using the Stellwagen Bank Marine Sanctuary had all agreed to decrease their speeds when approaching whales , so as to prevent harmful collisions with the whales , and also decrease any other potential negative influences on the whales ’ typical behavior .
David N. Wiley and his fellow researchers published their spy study in the latest issue of the prestigious journal Conservation Biology .
They explained that it was crucial to determine whether or not the voluntary conservation agreements made by the whale watch companies were being followed because “ the efficacy of these agreements is important to the conservation and management communities .
Such a determination is particularly important for managers dealing with endangered species because reliance on a management tactic that is not working can cause species to decline further . ”
How the Spies Collected Data
To discover whether or not the tour companies were in fact complying with the agreements , the researchers planted “ paid passengers ” on board of each of the major tour companies boats ’ during the summers of 2003 and 2004 .
Armed with GPS units and high - tech binoculars , the observers discretely downloaded data directly from the devices to handheld PDAs .
During the whale watch tour , an observer ’s GPS unit pinpointed the geographical location of the boat every 5 seconds , as well as its speed and several other measures .
The observers used their binoculars , which included laser rangefinders , to pinpoint the location of whales when the boats drew near .
After each trip , the data were then overlayed using GIS mapping software .
The maps that were created allowed the scientists to ascertain the speed of boats at all times , and most importantly , when the boats were within close range of any whales that were sighted .
So what did they find out ?
An Ugly Truth about Whale Watch Tours
After all of the maps were examined , and all of the data analyzed , it was very clear that none of the whale watch tour companies were complying with the guidelines that they had agreed to follow .
Each company operated its boats at speeds that were much higher than the suggested limits to help protect the whales .
In what is probably over - gracious reasoning , the researchers write that “ it is possible that our study presents an overly critical picture of the industry ’s behavior .
For example , guideline compliance might be extremely low because the guidelines are impossible to follow . ”
They further explain that sometimes it might not be possible for the boats to slow down because they only sight a whale after they are to close to it .
But they also suggest that this explanation is generous , given that many tour companies alert each other to the presence of whales long beforehand .
As a final note of context , the researchers do suggest that in the summers of 2003 and 2004 ( when the study was conducted ) , the number of whales in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary was extremely low .
For this reason , after representatives from the tour companies saw the results of the study , they argued that they had an obligation to paying customers to do their best to see whales .
Of course , while this makes sense , it also worsens our ability to protect endangered whales if tour companies are speeding along to reach any whales they see as fast as they can .
As the researchers write , “ it is unclear why those animals would be in less need of protection than whales in more abundant times . ”
So What Does this Tell Us about Voluntary Conservation Agreements ?
The results of this study are not encouraging in regard to the applied use of voluntary conservation agreements .
In the case of whale watch tours , probably enforceable laws will be needed to protect whales and other species from harm , rather than the failed voluntary agreements .
Wiley and his colleagues end by writing that “ the challenge to scientists and managers is to bring participant behavior up to the standards needed for conservation , rather than dropping standards to a point where high levels of compliance can be achieved . ”
While the researchers cite additional studies with results that also frown upon the effectiveness of voluntary conservation agreements , they do mention how one study indicated that harassment of waterfowl by boaters was reduced by voluntary conservation agreements , and that another showed that voluntary watershed protection agreements were quite successful in Costa Rica .
For this reason , it becomes clear that using these agreements as a conservation strategy might work in some circumstances and not in others .
Only with more research and evaluation we will know when they work and why .

LONDON  A British judge has ordered a hearing into whether the British government must turn over evidence bearing on accusations by a prisoner at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , that he was tortured during interrogation in Morocco .
The judge , acting on a request by lawyers for the prisoner , Binyam Mohamed , rejected an argument of the British government that releasing any documents risked “ that more robust evidence of mistreatment of C.I.A. prisoners could emerge in the future . ”
The British government , in a court filing last month , accepted that Mr. Mohamed had presented an “ arguable case ” that he had been tortured after his “ extraordinary rendition ” to Morocco and Afghanistan .
Mr. Mohamed has said that , among other things , his interrogators in Morocco made cuts on his chest and genitals with a razor .
To support Mr. Mohamed ’s claim , his lawyer Clive Stafford Smith is seeking photographs that he said an American soldier took of Mr. Mohamed ’s injuries , during a flight from Morocco to Cuba .

Despite public protests both online and on the streets of Stockholm , the Swedish parliament has voted in favor of a new " wiretapping " law which invades the privacy of its citizens by allowing the government to monitor web traffic and phone calls , without the need for court orders or similar authorization .
On Wednesday evening the Swedish parliament voted yes to a bill that allows FRA , National Defense Radio Agency , to monitor all phone traffic and e-mail traffic in the name of national security .
Unlike the police , FRA can listen in on anyone for any purpose without a court order , bringing the level of personal integrity in Sweden to an all - time - low .
The bill was passed after it was debated in parliament , with 143 votes in favor , 138 opposed and 1 representative abstaining .
Before the debate the situation was crystal clear .
The four party government alliance would win the vote if all party members voted in favor of the bill , but with the seven seat majority the government currently holds , only four representatives had to vote against the party line in order for the bill to fail .
With all the editorials and statements regarding integrity , copyright and online - rights published during the last months by members of these parties , surely there would be four members of the parties that would follow their convictions rather than the party line ?
In fact , there were four representatives who have been crystal clear in these kinds of issues : Birgitta Ohlsson ( Liberal Party ) , Karl Sigfrid ( Moderate Party ) , Annie Johansson and Fredrick Federley ( both Centre Party ) .
They have profiled themselves on these issues and in some cases even campaigned on them .
Surely , Fredrick Federley could n’t let down his everyone of his voters ?
Things proved more complex .
Leading up to Tuesday ’s debate , the bill had been heavily criticized by journalists , pirates , lawyers , bloggers , all political parties ’ youth organizations – as well as the head of the Swedish intelligence agency SÃ¤po .
Rick Falkvinge of The Pirate Party was one of the voices that spoke most strongly against the bill .
Also , all of the four daily newspapers ’ senior political editors were heavily opposed .
Rumours had begun circulating that Karl Sigfrid was indeed going to vote against the bill while Fredrick Federley wrote an ambivalent blog post that indicated where this was heading .
The debate was intense with defense minister Sten Tolgfors of the Moderate Party showing his arrogance , ignorance and lack of understanding time and again ( if the bill was not passed , he said , parliament would be risking the lives of Swedish UN troops in Afghanistan ) .
Towards the end of the debate , Fredrick Federley was on the speakers list .
He pulled off a tear - filled act ( including sentimentalities about his mother ) in which he said he had to follow his conviction but at the same time did n’t want to let his party down .
He motioned for the bill to be sent back to parliament ’s defense committee for expanding the safeguards of individual rights .
This was a carefully orchestrated piece of political theater designed to keep the government alliance together while at the same time allow the Centre Party ( which until yesterday held high integrity and online rights ) not to lose face .
At this time , Federley knew that the bill was being reworked on an initiative from the Liberal Party to a new version that had a new authority controlling the controllers .
The original vote was due to be held on Wednesday morning and following an initiative from The Pirate Party , a crowd of hundreds was gathered in front of parliament to protest the bill and try to convince representatives to vote against it .
The crowd was a mixture of pirates , the journalists ’ union , the political parties ’ youth organizations and worried citizens .
Following the debate on Tuesday , the morning vote only considered if the bill should be sent back for revision and the vote was in favor .
In a farce of democracy , it was announced that the bill was to be revised in record time and a new vote be taken later in the evening .
“ I think the law needs to be re-written .
It is not enough to create a few checks and balances …
It is the law itself there is something wrong with , ” Anders Eriksson , former Chief of Swedish intelligence agency SÃ¤po , told Swedish radio before the vote .
By now , Fredrick Federley and Annie Johansson of the Centre Party had put themselves in a position where they could show to their voters that they had “ improved ” the bill while at the same time they could vote for the revised version to the happiness and joy of their party colleagues .
So , what about the other possible nay - sayers ?
According to the buzz on the blogs , Karl Sigfrid of the Moderate Party had decided to vote against the bill and was taken into a party meeting where 30 representatives from the Moderate Party along with party leader and Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt were on a speech list , bashing him one after the other until he could n’t take it anymore .
And the remaining ?
Birgitta Ohlsson of the Liberal Party was as lame as her Centre Party counterparts :
She abstained her vote , according to an interview in Dagens Nyheter “ with respect to my liberal consciousness and to my voters but also to my party colleagues ” .
When the FRA bill version 1.01 was brought back into the chamber on Wednesday evening , the outcome could only go one way .
The Government parties along with PM Fredrik Reinfeldt had decided that this bill should go through and with the internal critics effectively silenced the bill was voted through , plunging Sweden into DDR era lack of privacy .
How the bill is compatible with Human Rights ( The right to respect privacy , family , home and correspondence ) will be decided later in the court of the European Union where a number of opposition representatives will bring it to be tried .
The only liberal voting according to her ideology rather than her party line was Camilla Lindberg of the Liberal Party .
In an editorial in today ’s Expressen she explains why : “ My loyalty is with my voters .
And with myself and my conviction .
I could n’t get myself to vote in favour of the bill , regardless of the arguments from my colleagues and the last - minutes improvements . [… ]
If the surveillance poses a threat for integrity and freedom without having a proved positive effect , I ca n’t support such a bill . ”
Welcome to 1984 ….
Getting to the Bottom of the Paul Newman Lung Cancer Reports
Joanne Woodward , Paul Newman and Martha Stewart at the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp fundraiser
Although 's rep has denied reports that the 83 - year - old actor is terminally ill , yesterday it was reported that Newman has turned over the entire $ 120 million value of his ownership in Newman 's Own - the company that makes salad dressing , spaghetti sauce and cookies - to charity , which has only added fuel to rumors that the Academy Award winner is dying of lung cancer .
However ; it should be noted that Newman actually set up Newman 's Own Foundation Inc. , the recipient of the donations , two years ago - prior to any alleged lung cancer diagnosis - in honor of his 80th birthday to ensure his charities would continue benefiting from his generosity .
" He 's been there a lot — he 's even worked out in the waiting room , doing squat thrusts .
Last time he was in there he had a long beard , " an unnamed source told PageSix.com .
" Joanne Woodward is there waiting for him and being very sweet with the assistants . "
The Web site previously reported that Newman was a no - show at his Hole in the Wall Gang charity party last Monday night .
According to his rep , it was because " he 's been having trouble with his back , " PageSix.com reported .
" I 'm very sorry I can't be part of this Westport Country Playhouse production , but I leave Of Mice and Men in Mark Lamos ' very capable hands with the full support of my wife , Joanne Woodward , and Anne Keefe as Playhouse artistic directors . "
Reports of Newman 's illness started in March when PageSix reported that the Academy Award winner had been seeing an oncologist at New York ’s Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center for the past seven months .
Then late last month Newman announced he would not be directing " Of Mice and Men" at the playhouse in his hometown of Westport , Conn . ( * see note below ) , citing an unspecified illness * Although many media outlets are reporting that Newman was to direct " Our Town , " that is n't the case .
Newman actually starred in a production of " Our Town " at Westport six years ago , which may be the cause of the confusion .
Last week rumors of his illness were intensified when Martha Stewart posted photos of a gaunt - looking Newman on her blog from a benefit she hosted for the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp , an organization for which the actor sits as board of directors .
And now Fox News is reporting that a longtime friend and business partner of Newman 's has confirmed his illness :
“ He ’s a fighter , ” one of his close friends told Fox411 Tuesday morning .
“ And he ’s going to keep fighting . ”
So does he or does he not have lung cancer ?
All I can say is that if he does , it is obvious that he and his family are trying to keep this a private matter .
Not surprising since he and wife Joanne Woodward have lived far from the Hollywood spotlight in Westport , Conn . for the last 50 years .
I think I can speak for all of us in saying we hope the rumors are just that .
昨年、情報処理推進機構（IPA）が開催したIT業界の重鎮と現役学生による討論会で、学生の持つIT業界への「ネガティブイメージ」が明らかにされたのは記憶に新しい。5月28日、IPAが開催したイベント「IPAX2008」で、再び経営者と学生の討論会が行われた。IT産業が国際的な飛躍をめざすために学生に期待することが今年の討論のテーマ。
学生側は、慶應義塾大学、九州大学、千葉工業大学、東京情報大学、東京工科専門学校から各校2人ずつ、計10人が出席。一方、産業界代表としてCSKホールディングス 取締役 有賀貞一氏と、コムチュア 代表取締役社長 向浩一氏が討論を行った。また 、IPA からは理事長の西垣浩司氏が参加した。司会はインプレスR&Dの田口潤氏が行った。
「 ポジティブなビジョンを提示して 」
「 産業を問わず、やりがいのある仕事のイメージ」について学生に質問をしたところ、「達成感がある」「自分の成長が感じられる 」「成果物が目に見える 」
「チャレンジができる 」「きちんと評価される」などの回答が上がった。しかし、「IT企業のイメージ」についての質問になると、「グーグルやヤフーのような企業と、あとはNTT系くらいしか、就職活動をするまで知らなかった」「日本だと、ソニーや東芝など『パソコンを作っている会社』のイメージ」などの声が上がり、そもそもどんな企業があるかよく分からないという結果となった。西垣氏は「IT企業といっても幅がありすぎて分かり辛いのは確かに業界側の責任がある」と回答。有賀氏も「業界に関する説明がなされていない」と問題点を指摘した。
「 IT技術者という仕事へのイメージ」については、「身の回りのものをITが支えていて、そのベースに技術者がいる」「役に立つものの、ほんの一部でも関わっているということはモチベーションにつながる」など、やりがいのある仕事であるというポジティブなイメージが上がった。一方で、「やらなければならない仕事」「『作って』といわれて作っている人というイメージ」「現場の人がみな、全体の完成までを見据えて仕事をしているのか疑問」「ネットを見ていると、3Kどころか『42K』まで見かける」などのネガティブなイメージも。
特に 「全体の完成、ゴールのイメージが沸かない」という声に対して、有賀氏は「若いうちは1つの仕事を与えられても、そこから全体が見えるようになるまでは時間がかかる。それでも、知る努力をしなければいけない」と主張。また、「そうはいっても上の人が教えてくれないじゃないかという声があるが、こっちだって忙しい。聞きに来なさい」と回答すると、学生からは「できれば教えて欲しい」「自らポジティブなビジョンを提示する人の方がいい」「忙しいから聞きに来いという人に会社や社員がコントロールできるのか」などの反発も見られた。
西垣氏は伊藤忠商事の取締役会長 丹羽宇一郎氏 の 「 入社して最初の10年は泥のように働いてもらい、次の10年は徹底的に勉強してもらう」という言葉を引用し、「仕事をするときには時間軸を考えてほしい。プログラマからエンジニア、プロジェクトマネージャになっていく中で、仕事というのは少しずつ見えてくるものだ」と説明。これを受けて、田口氏が学生に「10年は泥のように働けます、という人は」と挙手を求めたところ、手を挙げた学生は1人もいなかった。
学生の鋭い突っ込みに答える経営者陣
日本は学生も企業もぬるま湯？
企業側が欲しい人材について、向氏は「貪欲（どんよく）に学ぶ気持ちを持っていて、環境適応力が高い人」と回答。自らの若いころは、いかに楽をするかを考えていたが、「それではいけないと自戒を込めたアドバイス」（向氏）だという。また、「日本の大学を卒業して日本企業に入ってくる海外の学生たちは、みんなハングリー精神がある。日本の学生は頼りない」とこぼした。
有賀氏は 「
優れた学生はどんな企業に行きたいのか」と逆質問。慶應義塾大学大学院に所属し、2007年度の天才プログラマ／スーパークリエータとして認定された斉藤匡人氏は、「自由度が高い企業。自分の考えや意見がきちんと上の人に通る環境がいい。10年泥のように働いたら少しずつ上にいけるよ、ではなく、今、自分を生かしてくれるところが望ましい」と自信を覗かせた。有賀氏も、「こういうことをいえる学生は全体の1％くらいだろう。もっと増やさないといけない」と付け加えた。
西垣氏は 「英語は勉強しておきましょう。海外に出て行くにも英語は必須」と主張。しかし学生から「英語は必須というが、日本企業にも海外との接点を作ってくれないと意味がない。企業は海外の人を招致しているのか」と問われると、西垣氏は「私はNEC時代、自分が駄目だったら海外から社長を連れて来い、といっていた。ちょうど（日産自動車の）ゴーンが出てきたころだった。確かに、企業の役員会に自国の人間しかいないような状態はおかしい」と返答。一方で、「役員会は確かに全員日本人。海外に拠点を置く合弁会社の社員には日本語を学んでもらっている。国内でも逆に、英語を学ばせていかないといけないのだが……」（向氏）という声も上がり、田口氏は「日本の学生はぬるま湯につかっていて頼りないという話になっていますが、実は日本の企業もぬるま湯ということですね」とまとめた。
「学生時代に学んでおいてほしいこと」というテーマでは、「よく調査などでは文書作成能力やコミュニケーション能力が上位に上がるが、これはIT業界に限った話ではない。できて当たり前で、それができていないから企業側が苛立っている証拠だ。高校までに学ぶべきことで、どちらかというと日本の教育制度の問題」（有賀氏）と主張。「そういうスキルは置いておくとして、基礎は押さえておいてほしい。なぜプログラムは動作するのかとか、なぜ通信できるのかとかが、きちんと説明できなければ話にならない」という有賀氏に対し、田口氏は学生に「そのようなことがすべて説明できる人は」と挙手を求めたところ、2人が手を挙げるに留まった。
学生からの質疑では、 「 学部卒でもどんどん採用しているが、本当はソフトウェア産業は専門職だと思う。その点はどう思うか」という質問に対し、「修士を経た専門家は年に1000人くらいだろう。彼らは本当に有名な企業に行ってしまう。これだけでは人が足りない」（有賀氏）と苦笑い。また、「本当に優秀な人は1人で何人分もの生産性を上げるのに、入社採用時はみんな一律のことが多い」という学生の不満には、「本当に自分が売れると思う人は、そういう個々人のスキルが最大限に生かせる企業に行くといい」（有賀氏）と断言。大きなシステムの構築などの仕事では、個々人の突出したスキルではなく、チームワークが重要だと主張した。
Fred Thompson ends candidacy for president Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday January 22 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Update : Fred Thompson has withdrawn from the campaign with the following statement posted at his website : " Today I have withdrawn my candidacy for President of the United States .
I hope that my country and my party have benefited from our having made this effort .
Jeri and I will always be grateful for the encouragement and friendship of so many wonderful people . "
While America returned to work on Tuesday at the end of a three - day weekend honoring the life of Martin Luther King , the webmasters for the presidential campaign of former senator and actor Fred Thompson still appear to be kicking back and relaxing .
Most sections of the Republican presidential back - fielder 's website have not been updated since the South Carolina primary concluded .
The last press release posted on the site is from Jan. 18 .
And , campaign staff have not posted any favorable news coverage about the candidate since the same day .
A campaign blogger posted a Jan. 22 entry , but only for an " Open Thread " discussion .
Within the open thread , hundreds of Thompson supporters urged the candidate to press on , while some bemoaned the lack of news coming out of the campaign .
" From having this site updated many times daily and the red truck for donations to a stagnant page for a few days now - somebody official needs to say something soon , " wrote one commenter .
The campaign 's information blackout followed rumors that Thompson was officially getting ready to bow out of the contest for the Republican nomination after his poor showing in South Carolina , a state that he identified as crucial to his path to the nomination .
The Atlantic 's Marc Ambinder and the Washington Post 's Michael D. Shear both referred to rumors that an announcement would come this Tuesday .
And Fox News ' Carl Cameron reported on Monday night that Thompson would not participate in a Thursday night debate in Florida , but also seemed to indicate that Thompson might not make a Tuesday announcement .
" The Senators plans are very fluid , " Cameron wrote .
" As of 8:45 this evening , there are no plans for any announcement about whether he will stay in the race or not .
The team is wrestling with very few options .
The Senator is in Nashville visiting his mother ( in her 90s ) who has been ill . "
Cameron speculated that Thompson was hoping for a Vice Presidential nomination , perhaps from Senator McCain .
But the National Review's Jim Geraghty challenged that speculation , and added that Thompson would not endorse another candidate .
And he also predicted Thompson 's exit soon .
A new report from a DC telecom law firm claims , as many other recent reports have , that the US is falling behind when it comes to broadband deployment , and it says that aggressive action is needed to keep the country competitive .
What 's different about the new report is just how aggressive its recommendations are : 100 Mbps of " affordable " broadband available to all Americans by 2012 , with 1 G bps service coming online by 2015 .
The Baller Herbst Law Group prepared the new report for e-NC , the government - backed entity in North Carolina charged with spurring both broadband rollouts and higher adoption rates .
E- NC 's chair Jane Smith Patterson was in DC this morning to address a House subcommittee hearing on Universal Service Fund reform , and she made a strong case for more government support for broadband .
The report 's argument is that broadband has become a utility service , and that communities that do n't have it ( or that do n't have adequate speeds ) are in danger of being left behind .
" The history of electrification is repeating itself in the broadband era , " says the report .
" Like the power companies of the century ago , the major communications providers are focusing first on their most lucrative markets and are leaving less profitable communities behind . "
How did communities respond then ?
Many of them " step forward to establish their own electric utilities , believing that their economic survival and quality it of life were at stake . "
The report praises the public / private partnership model of e-NC and suggests that local and state governments across the country need to take their broadband destinies into their own hands to keep from missing out on the massive benefits of fast ' Net connections .
But when it comes to a new " moon shot " effort for the entire country , some kind of national leadership would do plenty to help .
Even casting a vision for broadband would be useful , but " the current Administration in Washington has simply refused to come to grips with the reality of America 's descent into mediocrity on almost every internationally - recognized indicator of success in broadband deployment . "
Look at Japan !
By way of contrast , the report highlights what has happened in Japan during the last seven years , a broadband effort little short of a miracle .
It 's worth quoting at length :
America 's dismal record in broadband deployment is particularly discouraging when compared to that of Japan .
In 2001 , when the United States ranked 4th in the world , Japan had only a small handful of broadband lines .
Spurred by the " broadband miracle " under way in nearby South Korea , Japan 's top government and private - sector leaders decided to make Japan the world 's leading broadband nation .
They then developed and executed an all - hands - on - deck action plan to achieve that goal , including aggressive federal subsidies , low - interest and no-interest loans , loan guarantees , tax breaks , grants - in - aid to municipalities , targeted government purchases of services , a concerted national public education campaign , and a wide range of private - sector initiatives driven by a sense of national purpose and long - term thinking .
Today , Japan has the fastest and cheapest broadband in the world .
Consumers in Japan can get broadband that is 10 times faster than the speeds available to average Americans , for prices that are less than a quarter of the prices that Americans must pay .
Broadband providers currently compete at 1 Gbps , and this is expected to increase to 10 Gbps by 2010 .
Broadband is now available almost ubiquitously throughout Japan , and the " almost " will be removed by 2010 .
Today , 85 percent of households have access to fiber connectivity , and more than 35 percent of households have adopted it .
Availability of fiber connective it will increase to 90 percent by 2010 .
While the US may be a " bit behind " at the moment , the report warns that the country is in imminent danger of dropping sharply on international rankings .
That 's largely because the only truly next - generation attempts to bring high - speeds to the home are coming from Verizon 's FiOS and from cable 's DOCSIS 3.0 .
But the report notes that FiOS is only available in a few states and that no other telco has plans to deploy fiber to the home .
Likewise , with DOCSIS 3.0 , Comcast will take several years to fully deploy it , and other cable operators are taking even longer .
Even when rolled out , the promised high speeds must be shared with entire neighborhoods , and cable operators have little incentive to upgrade systems when they 're simply competing against DSL .
Baller Herbst admits that the goals in the paper , which are even more ambitious than those touted by EDUCAUSE earlier this year , " are very aggressive and may not be fully achievable . "
But not staying at the top of the broadband heap comes it with own costs , and the effort and expense are worth making a huge investment .
" We believe that great nations find the means to do what will make them and keep them great , " says the report .
" The United States has done this time and again — building canals and railroads , developing electric , telephone and highway systems , conquering outer space .
Now , the time has come to build a world - class communications network . "
The US Patent and Trademark Office is a convenient whipping boy for problems with the patent system .
The USPTO famously approved the junk patents at the heart of the legal battle between Research in Motion and a patent - trolling firm called NTP .
The USPTO belatedly recognized its mistake and began invalidating the patents , but did n't finish the job in time to save RIM from being forced to pay $ 612.5 million to avoid having its whole BlackBerry network shut down .
Perhaps shaken by the negative publicity generated from that case and others , the USPTO seems to have gotten religion on patent quality .
Over the last year , the courts have heard a series of cases in which the Patent Office has rejected software - related applications .
The legal theories advanced by the Patent Office in these cases are causing consternation among software patent supporters .
In an article last week at Patently - O , law professor John Duffy warns that the Patent Office has staked out positions that , if accepted by the courts , would amount to the de facto abolition of software patents .
He 's right that the Patent Office has become increasingly hostile to software patents in the last couple of years .
However , it 's far from clear that the end of software patents is imminent .
And Duffy is dead wrong to suggest that fewer software patents would be bad for innovation .
Growing hostility
Duffy cites four recent cases that illustrate the Patent Office 's growing hostility to the patenting of software and other abstract concepts .
While the USPTO has n't formally called for the abolition of software patents , the positions it took in these cases do suggest a growing skepticism .
In the first two cases , decided last fall , the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ( which has jurisdiction over patent appeals ) upheld patent rejections by the USPTO .
They were not software patent cases , as such .
In In Re Nuijten , the court considered a patent related to an algorithm for adding a watermark to a digital media file .
The Federal Circuit did not invalidate the claims relating to the watermarking algorithm itself ; everyone seemed to agree that the algorithm was patentable .
Rather , the decision focused on whether a digital signal could be the subject of a patent claim .
The court concluded that it could not .
A victory for common sense , perhaps , but hardly a rejection of software patents .
In the case of In Re Comiskey , the Federal Circuit found that adding binding arbitration language to a legal document is an unpatentable mental process .
However , it sent the case back to the lower courts to consider whether automatically performing this process with a computer would have been obvious at the time the application was filed .
Two decisions from May and June of this year show the Patent Office moving more decisively toward rejecting patents on software .
They were heard by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences ( which is above the Patent Office but below the Federal Circuit in the appeals process ) and concerned patents on simulating physical processes using mathematical models .
The Patent Office rejected both patents on the grounds that they involved only the manipulation of abstract mathematical formulas and were not tied to a specific machine or physical process .
The Board of Patent Appeals upheld the Patent Office 's decision in one case but , in the other , it overturned the Patent Office because the patent described a simulation that occurred on two processors operating in parallel .
The Board ruled that because the patent described a specific machine — a computer with two processors instead of just one — the patent was sufficiently tied to the real world to merit patent protection .
The underwhelming case for software patents
Duffy rightly ridicules this result .
Clearly , it makes no sense for the patentability of an algorithm to depend on the number of processors used to implement it .
And it would surely be pointless to have firms gratuitously adding or removing processors from their software algorithms simply to dodge patent liability .
Duffy would have granted both patents .
But the Patent Office 's position — that both applications should be rejected — is not only more consistent with Supreme Court precedents , but it 's better policy as well .
The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that abstract concepts and mathematical algorithms are not patentable .
Unfortunately , the Federal Circuit has ruled that merely loading an algorithm onto a general - purpose computer and executing it transforms it into a patentable invention .
This doctrine makes a mockery of Supreme Court precedents .
However , the Supreme Court 's precedents are still technically the law of the land , and the Patent Office seems to be increasingly willing to stand up for those precedents even at the risk of being overturned by the Federal Circuit .
Duffy seems to regard the end of software patents as a calamity for innovative companies , but his argument is awfully thin .
Duffy focuses on Google 's PageRank patent , which he has long regarded as a poster child for software patenting .
He describes it as " surely one of the most famous and valuable of all modern software patents , " and suggests that the invalidation of Google 's patents would be a calamity for the company .
Curiously , however , he never explains how Google benefits from this or other patents in its portfolio .
Google derives little , if any , of its revenue from patent royalties and has managed to dominate the search engine marketplace without suing its major rivals for patent infringement .
Indeed , it appears that the primary function of Google 's patent portfolio is as a defensive stockpile to be used if any competitors should sue it for patent infringement .
If that 's true , then the only real effect of software patent abolition on Google would be that the company could lay off its patent lawyers .
Looking forward
We should n't overstate the significance of the Patent Office 's newfound skepticism toward software patents .
While the USPTO has rejected a few " pure " software patents , it 's unclear precisely where it would draw the line when it comes to software patents with a more significant physical component .
More importantly , the USPTO is far from the final authority on patent questions , and there is little sign that the courts immediately above it on the food chain are as enlightened .
The Federal Circuit has grudgingly responded to recent adverse Supreme Court decisions , but the Federal Circuit is unlikely to end its experiment with software patents unless specifically told to do so by the Supreme Court .
Things look better at the Supreme Court , which has repeatedly smacked down the Federal Circuit in recent years .
The high court has never endorsed software patents , and at least three justices have voiced concerns about the patenting of software .
If the USPTO continues rejecting software patents , one of those rejections will eventually find its way to the Supreme Court .
But software patent opponents should n't get their hopes up just yet .
With the legalization of software patents more than a decade old , the Supreme Court may not have the stomach to invalidate hundreds of thousands of extant patents in one stroke .
Regardless , the Patent Office 's newfound hostility to software patents is cause for celebration .
The problem is a long way from being fixed , but things are moving in the right direction .
SARATOGA SPRINGS , New York ( AP ) 
A judge has ordered a 19 - year - old man to write an apology to the city of Saratoga Springs in New York for dressing in a penis constume at a high school graduation .
Calvin Morett had pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct for dressing in a costume at the graduation at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center .
A video of his visit last month has appeared on YouTube .
The judge has also ordered Morett to pay to have the apology published in a local newspaper , pay court fees and perform 24 hours of community service .

The pack contains transfers of the red , blue and gold Tibetan flag A campaign group in Australia is offering Olympics athletes and supporters a protest kit to highlight their concerns over Tibet .
The pack includes a T - shirt bearing the words " I support human rights " in English and Chinese , badges , stickers and temporary tattoos of Tibet 's flag .
The T - shirt slogan was specially chosen to avoid making explicit reference to Tibet and contravening Olympic rules .
But backers admit that those using the kit may still " face consequences " .
In March , Chinese authorities suppressed the biggest protests against Chinese rule in Tibet in two decades .
Many campaigners for Tibetan independence have used China 's hosting of the Olympic Games as a platform to publicise their cause .
Risks " Going right back to March , people have been approaching us and asking how they can help Tibet in Beijing , " Simon Bradshaw , campaign co-ordinator for the Australia Tibet Council ( ATC ) , told Reuters news agency .
But he warned that the packs could be confiscated by Chinese authorities at the airport , or could contravene Australian Olympic Committee rules and be barred from the Olympic village .
There is " no doubt that athletes who choose to make public statements over Tibet may face consequences " , he said .
Launching the packs on Monday , former Olympic swimmer Michelle Engelsman said that whether athletes decided to speak out at the Games was up to them .
" It is important to bear in mind that the athletes also have the right to focus on their sport , " she said .
But she said she hoped that athletes might choose to use the protest items - available on request and in confidence from the ATC - once they had finished competing .
A spokesman for the Australian Olympic Committee , Mike Tancred , told AP news agency that his organisation recommended that no athlete travelling to China take the kit in case the contents " antagonised " other competitors .

The impact that parental drinking has on children is related to the parents ’ reasons for drinking , not to the amount that they drink , according to researchers in Philadelphia .
They found that children of mothers who drank “ to escape ” were much more averse to the smell of alcohol than others , regardless of the amount that the mothers drank .
Julie Mennella and Catherine Forestell at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia , US , divided 145 children aged five to eight years into two groups according to whether their mothers reported using alcohol to escape from feelings of tension and depression .
The children were presented with two odours and asked to pick the one they preferred .
One of the odours was always beer .
The other was either an odour that the children had previously identified as pleasant , such as bubblegum or chocolate , or an odour previously identified as unpleasant , such as coffee , cigarette smoke or rotten food .

Emotional link
Mennella and Forestell report that while all the children chose the pleasant odours over beer , those whose mothers drink to escape were more likely to choose the unpleasant odours in preference to the smell of beer .
Out of 36 “ escape ” children , 72 % preferred coffee to beer , compared to 51 % of 103 “ non-escape ” children .
And 55 % of 22 “ escape ” children preferred the smell of rotten food to the smell of beer , compared to only 29 % of 79 “ non-escape ” children .
Although the women classified as escape drinkers did have a tendency to drink greater quantities more often , statistical analyses showed that it was the women ’s reasons for drinking , and not the amount , that created such strong aversion to the smell of alcohol in their children .
Mennella says that children as young as five were clearly aware of the negative feelings that led their mothers to drink .
“ They are associating the smell of beer with the mood state of the mother when they are drinking , ” she says .
“ When it ’s a mood state that ’s not positive , low and behold , when these children are faced with a choice between beer and rotten eggs , they are picking rotten eggs . ”
Drive to drink
However , this does not mean that children of escapist drinkers are safe from becoming problem drinkers themselves .
Animals studies have shown that young rats who spent time with intoxicated mothers were more likely to seek out alcohol when stressed as adolescents .
Richard Velleman , an expert in the effect of alcohol on the family at the University of Bath , UK , says he is impressed by the study .
However , he would like to see more work to find out how the negative association with alcohol affects children when they get older .
“ There is no good evidence that children ’s negative associations with alcohol then translate into altered behaviour when they become old enough to start drinking themselves , ” he says .
“ Young people ’s drinking behaviour is much more influenced by overall parental behaviour , peer influences , and the major influence of the media , ” adds Velleman .

Happy People Dancing on Planet Earth
Credit : Matt Harding & Melissa Nixon
Explanation :
What are these humans doing ?
Dancing .
Many humans on Earth exhibit periods of happiness , and one method of displaying happiness is dancing .
Happiness and dancing transcend political boundaries and occur in practically every human society .
Above , Matt Harding traveled through many nations on Earth , started dancing , and filmed the result .
The video is perhaps a dramatic example that humans from all over planet Earth feel a common bond as part of a single species .
Happiness is frequently contagious -- few people are able to watch the above video without smiling .
The factory is surrounded by wasteland and other industrial units A police officer has died after suffering a gunshot wound to the chest on a training exercise in Manchester .
Pc Ian James Terry , 32 , from Burnley , Lancashire , died in North Manchester General Hospital after the incident in Thorp Road , Newton Heath , at 1135 BST .
It was not immediately clear whether the officer had been shot accidentally by one of his own colleagues .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) has begun an investigation into the fatal shooting .
Pc
Terry joined the force in 1997 and had been a firearms officer for six years .
Acting Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police ( GMP )
Dave Whatton said : " Everybody in Greater Manchester Police is devastated by the news that we have all received and the loss of a highly regarded colleague and friend . "
This demonstrates the dangers that police officers face on our behalf
Jacqui Smith , Home Secretary
Firearms training heavily regulated Mr Whatton said a full investigation had begun and teams were working to preserve evidence at the scene .
He added there had been no risk to the public at any stage during the training exercise .
A GMP spokesman said the training exercise had been " reasonably routine " and that similar exercises happened " fairly frequently " .
Disused factory
The IPCC has sent three investigators to the scene to carry out an initial assessment .
The area where the incident happened is the site of a disused former electronics factory , known locally as the Sharp Building .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
It was the former distribution centre for Sharp , the electronics giant , which used to sponsor Manchester United .
Police sealed off entrances to the site , but forensic officers in white overalls could be seen in the goods yard outside the warehouse , which was cordoned off with yellow tape .
An ambulance was also on site .
The factory is surrounded by other industrial units and wasteland and one of the main links into Manchester runs alongside .
Speaking in the Commons , Home Secretary Jacqui Smith told MPs : " The whole House will be saddened to learn of the tragic death today of a police officer during a training exercise with Greater Manchester Police .
" This demonstrates the dangers that police officers face on our behalf . "
Brothers Haroon and Bilal Razaq , who work at a plumbing supplies shop near the site entrance , said they were alerted by police cars and an ambulance entering the site .
Haroon , 17 , said : " All of a sudden there were police cars and an ambulance pulling skids and going round the corner on to the site .
The shooting was said to have happened in a " routine " training event " There were six or seven police cars and they just shot past all the standing traffic .
They were going really fast , so we knew it was something serious . "
Bilal , 25 , added : " We have been here for around three months and we thought the building was closed and Sharp had moved somewhere else .
" We have never seen an officer in uniform around here and we did n't know the police used it for training . "
Leon Willis , 26 , who was working in the same plumbing shop , said : " We have had the door open all day because of the weather and we heard a loud bang .
I do n't know if it was a gun shot or not . "
Five UK police officers have been shot and killed accidentally with police firearms .
The last officer to die was Pc Samuel Lock , from the Metropolitan Police , in 1950 , who was shot while cleaning a police pistol at a police station .
The last officer shot and killed by accident during a training exercise was Special Constable Arthur Guest in 1941 , who was shot by an instructor .

This link 's been sitting on my desktop for almost two weeks now , constantly reminding me that I wanted to bring it to your attention and say a thing or two about it : Eric Eckholm , " Reports Find Racial Gap in Drug Arrests , " May 6th , 2008 .
It 's based largely on a newly updated report from Human Rights Watch , and its main conclusion , as reported by theis that " large disparities persist in the rate at which blacks and whites are arrested and imprisoned for drug offenses , even though ( emphasis added by me ) .
I emphasize the end of that sentence because most Americans who get their news from television take it for granted that this is not true , but you can look up the numbers yourself in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 's recurring reports .
This paragraph in thewas a major breakthrough of reality into most people 's racist fiction ; I 've heard it claimed that it 's the first time a major newspaper in the US has admitted , above the fold , that blacks and whites use illegal drugs at basically identical rates .
Now , here 's the fascinating thing that I did n't know until I saw it in thethis is a more localized problem than I ever guessed .
In every state for which they were able to get data , black drug users are more likely to go to jail than white drug users .
But the level of the disparity varies from a low in my own home state of Missouri of 2.7 to 1 , to a high in Wisconsin ( of all places ) of The comments to thearticle include a lot of speculation , only some of it at all informed by facts , as to why the disparity is so wide .
One plausible hypothesis about Missouri 's numbers is that it's the result of a very high profile campaign against both marijuana and methamphetamine by the state police in ( very , very white ) rural south - central Missouri bringing up the arrest rate for white drug users .
One hypothesis that I find equally plausible about Barack Obama 's home state of Illinois , knowing what I know about Illinois politics , is that one of the things that makes Illinois ' rate the 2nd worst in the nation ( 23.6 to 1 ) has to do with the fact that the state police and the feds both almost completely ignore down - state Illinois ( almost entirely white outside of the East St. Louis area ) , that all the police resources are up in ( more racially mixed ) Chicago , so there are no state or federal cops to bust the vast majority of Illinois ' white drug users who live in nearly - all - white rural counties .
Anyway , the actual results are in a table in the report I linked above , but to give you a taste for it , here 's themap :
Oh , and I can't resist saying it , but is n't it justoverlaying that map with the map of the states that Hillary Clinton won ?
The Vancouver housing bubble has finally burst and here is just some of what I have seen in the past month or so that has led me to this conclusion :

Java theory and practice
Going wild with generics , Part 2
The get - put principle
Content series :
This content is part # of # in the series : Java theory and practice Stay tuned for additional content in this series .
This content is part of the series : Java theory and practice Stay tuned for additional content in this series .
In the Java language , arrays are covariant ( because an Integer is also Number , an array of Integer is also an array of Number ) , but generics are not ( a List < Integer > is not a List < Number > .)
People can argue over which choice was " right " and which was " wrong " — of course , both have pros and cons — but there is no question that having two similar mechanisms for constructing derived types with subtly different semantics is a substantial source of confusion and mistakes .
Bounded wildcards ( those funny " ? extends T " generic type specifiers ) are one of the tools the language provides for dealing with the lack of covariance — they let classes declare when method arguments or return values are covariant ( or the opposite , contravariant ) .
While knowing when to use bounded wildcards is one of the more complicated aspects of generics , the burden of using them falls mostly on library writers , rather than library users .
The most common mistake with bounded wildcards is forgetting to use them at all , restricting the utility of a class or forcing users to jump through hoops to reuse an existing class .
The need for bounded wildcards
Let 's start with a simple generic class , a value container called Box , which holds a value of known type :
public interface Box < T> { public T get ( ) ; public void put ( T element ) ; }
Because generics are not covariant , a Box < Integer > is not a Box < Number > , even though an Integer is a Number .
But for simple generic classes like Box , this is not a problem , and in fact we might not even notice , because the interface to Box < T > is specified entirely in terms of variables of type T — and not types generified over T. Dealing directly in terms of type variables allows the polymorphism we want to come along for free .
Listing 1 shows two examples of this sort of polymorphism : retrieving the contents of a Box < Integer > as a Number and putting an Integer into a Box < Number > :
Listing 1 . Exploiting inherent polymorphism with generic classes
Box < Integer > iBox = new BoxImpl < Integer >( 3 ) ; Number num = i Box.get ( ) ; Box < Number > n Box = new BoxImpl < Number >( 3.2 ) ; Integer i = 3 ; n Box.put ( i ) ;
Our experience with this simple Box class could convince us that covariance is n't needed , because in the places where we expect polymorphism , the data is already in a form where the compiler is able to apply the appropriate subtyping rules .
Things get more complicated , however , when we want the API to deal not only in variables of type T , but in types generified over T .
Let 's say we want to add a new method to Box that allows us to fetch the contents from another Box and put it in this one , as shown in Listing 2 :
Listing 2 .
An extended Box interface , which is not as flexible as it looks
public interface Box < T> { public T get ( ) ; public void put ( T element ) ; public void put ( Box < T > box ) ; }
The problem with this extended Box is that we can only put the contents in a Box whose type parameter is exactly the same as the receiving box .
So , for example , the code in Listing 3 wo n't compile :
Listing 3 . Generics are not covariant
Box < Number > n Box = new BoxImpl < Number >( ) ; Box < Integer > i Box = new BoxImpl < Integer >( ) ; n Box.put( iBox ) ; // ERROR
We get an error message that tells us it cannot find the method put( Box < Integer > ) on a Box < Number > .
This error makes sense when we consider that generics are not covariant ; a Box < Integer > is not a Box < Number > , even though an Integer is a Number , but this makes the Box class feel less " generic " than we'd hoped it would be .
To increase the usefulness of our generic code , instead of specifying the exact type of a generic type parameter , we can specify an upper ( or lower ) bound instead .
To do so , we use a bounded wildcard , which takes the form " ? extends T " or " ? super T " .
( Bounded wildcards can only be used as type parameters ; they cannot appear as types themselves — for that , a bounded named type variable is required . )
In Listing 4 , we change the signature of put ( ) to use an upper - bounded wildcard — Box <?
extends T> , which means that the type parameter of the Box can be T or any subclass of T .
Listing 4 . Improved version of Box class from Listing 3 , which accounts for covariance
public interface Box < T> { public T get ( ) ; public void put ( T element ) ; public void put ( Box <? extends T> box ) ; }
Now the code in Listing 3 will compile and do what we want , because we 've said that the parameter to put ( ) can be a Box whose type parameter is T or any of its subtypes .
Because Integer is a subtype of Number , the compiler is able to resolve the method reference put( Box < Integer > ) because Box < Integer > matches the bounded wildcard Box <?
extends Number > .
The " mistake " in the early version of Box is an easy one to fall into .
Even the experts make this mistake — you can find numerous places in the platform class libraries where a Collection < T > is used instead of a Collection <?
extends T> .
For example , in AbstractExecutorService in the java.util.concurrent package , the argument to invokeAll ( ) was originally a Collection < Callable <T >> .
This made using invokeAll ( ) fairly cumbersome , though , as this required that the set of tasks be held by a collection parameterized exactly by Callable < T > , and not by a collection parameterized by some class that implements Callable < T > .
In Java 6 , this signature was changed to Collection <?
extends Callable <T >> — but to illustrate how easy it is to make this mistake , the correct fix would have been to make invokeAll ( ) take an argument of Collection <?
extends Callable <? extends T >> .
The latter is definitely uglier but has the benefit of not boxing in your clients .
Lower - bounded wildcards
Most bounded wildcards are bounded above ; the " ?
extends T " notation places an upper bound on the type .
It is also possible , though less common , to place a lower bound on the type with the notation " ? super T " , meaning " T or any superclass of T " .
Lower - bounded wildcards show up when you want to specify a callback object , such as a comparator , or a data structure into which you are going to place a value .
Let 's say we want to enhance our Box with the ability to compare the contents with that of another box .
We can extend Box with a containsSame ( ) method , and the definition of a Comparator callback object , as shown in Listing 5 :
Listing 5 . Too -restrictive an attempt at adding a comparison method to Box
public interface Box < T> { public T get ( ) ; public void put ( T element ) ; public void put ( Box <? extends T> box ) ; boolean containsSame ( Box <?
extends T> other , EqualityComparator < T> comparator ) ; public interface EqualityComparator < T> { public boolean compare ( T first , T second ) ; } }
We remembered to define the type of the other box in containsSame ( ) using a wildcard , which avoids the problems we 've seen before .
But we 've still got a similar problem ; the comparator parameter must be exactly an EqualityComparator < T > .
This means we could n't write the code in Listing 6 :
Listing 6 . Failure when attempting to use the comparison method from Listing 5
public static EqualityComparator < Object > sameObject = new EqualityComparator < Object >( ) { public boolean compare ( Object o1 , Object o2 ) { return o1 == o2 ; } } ; ... Box Impl < Integer > iBox = ... ; BoxImpl < Number > n Box = ... ; boolean b = nBox.containsSame( iBox , sameObject ) ;
Using an EqualityComparator < Object > here seems a perfectly reasonable thing to want to do .
Why should clients have to create a separate comparator for every possible type of Box when they can specify it generically ?
The solution is to use a lower - bounded wildcard — represented by " ? super T " .
The correct version of the Box class , as extended with a compareTo ( ) method , is shown in Listing 7 :
Listing 7 .
More flexible version of the comparison operation from Listing 5 , using bounded wildcards
public interface Box < T> { public T get ( ) ; public void put ( T element ) ; public void put ( Box <? extends T> box ) ; boolean containsSame ( Box <?
extends T> other , EqualityComparator <? super T> comparator ) ; public interface EqualityComparator < T> { public boolean compare ( T first , T second ) ; } }
By using a lower - bounded wildcard , the containsSame ( ) method is saying that it requires something that can compare a T or any of its supertypes , allowing us to provide a comparator that knows how to compare Objects without having to wrap it with an EqualityComparator < Number > .
The get - put principle
There 's an old joke that says " A man with one watch always knows what time it is ; a man with two watches is never sure . "
Because the language supports both upper - and lower - bounded wildcards , how do we know which one to use , and when ?
There 's a simple rule , called the get - put principle , which tells us which kind of wildcard to use .
The get - put principle , as stated in Naftalin and Wadler 's fine book on generics , Java Generics and Collections ( see Resources ) , says :
Use an extends wildcard when you only get values out of a structure , use a super wildcard when you only put values into a structure , and do n't use a wildcard when you do both .
The get - put principle is easiest to understand when applied to container classes like Box or the Collections classes , because the notion of getting or putting connects naturally with what these classes do : store things .
So , if we wanted to apply the get - put principle to create a method that copies from one Box to another , the most general form would be as shown in Listing 8 , where an upper - bounded wildcard is used for the source and a lower - bounded wildcard is used for the destination :
Listing 8 .
Copy method for Box using both upper - bounded and lower - bounded wildcards
public static < T> void copy ( Box <?
extends T> from , Box <? super T> to ) { to.put ( from.get ( ) ) ; }
How do we apply the get - put principle in the case of the containsSame ( ) method shown earlier , where we used an upper - bounded wildcard for the box but a lower - bounded wildcard for the comparator ?
The first part is easy : we are getting a value from the other box , so we need to use an extends wildcard .
But the second part is not as clear — because the comparator is n't a container , so it does n't feel like we 're either getting or putting from a data structure .
The way to think about the get - put principle when the data type is not obviously a container class like a collection is that , even though an Equality Comparator is not a data structure , it is still something you can " put " a value into — in the sense of passing the value to one of its methods .
In the containsSame ( ) method , you are using the Box as a producer of values ( retrieving values from the Box ) and using the comparator as a consumer of values ( passing values to the comparator ) .
So it makes sense to use an extends wildcard for the Box , but a super wildcard for the comparator .
We can see the get - put principle at work in the declaration for Collections . sort ( ) , shown in Listing 9 :
Listing 9 .
Another example of using lower - bounded wildcards
public static < T extends Comparable <? super T >> void sort ( List < T> list ) { ... }
Here , we are saying we can sort a List that is parameterized by any type that implements Comparable .
But rather than restricting the domain of sort ( ) to lists whose elements are comparable to themselves , we can go further — we can sort lists of elements that know how to compare themselves to their supertypes , too .
Because we are putting values into the comparator to determine the relative ordering of two elements , the get - put principle tells us we want to use a super wildcard here .
The seeming circular reference — where T extends something parameterized by T — is not really circular at all .
It is simply expressing the constraint that to be able to sort a List < T> , T has to implement the interface Comparable < X > , where X is T or one of its supertypes .
The last part of the rule — do n't use a wildcard when you are both getting and putting — follows from the first two parts .
If you can put a T or any of its subtypes , and you can get a T or any of its supertypes , then the only thing you can both get and put is a T itself .
Keep bounded wildcards out of return values
It is sometimes tempting to use a bounded wildcard in the return type of a method .
But this temptation is best avoided because returning bounded wildcards tends to " pollute " client code .
If a method were to return a Box <?
extends T> , then the type of the variable receiving the return value would have to be Box <?
extends T> , which pushes the burden of dealing with bounded wildcards on your callers .
Bounded wildcards work best when they are used in APIs , not in client code .
Summary
Bounded wildcards are extremely useful in making generic APIs more flexible .
The biggest impediment to using bounded wildcards correctly is the perception that we do n't need to use them !
Some situations will call for lower - bounded wildcards , and some for upper - bounded ones , and the get - put principle can be used to determine which should be used .

Friday 's market rout in employment , oil , the dollar and stocks was not the end of the world , but it is a warning .
The message is that the current Washington policy mix of easy money and Keynesian fiscal " stimulus " is taking us down the road to stagflation .

Amit Yoran , director of the National Cyber Security Division of the Department of Homeland Security , was responsible for carrying out the lion 's share of the initiatives outlined in the Bush Administration 's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace .
Yoran resigned Thursday because he had completed what he set out to do and felt it was time to move on , he said .
" When I spoke with the leadership of the department before I accepted the job , we were clear what the expectations and goals were , " Yoran said .
" The core objectives of building the cybersecurity division and US - CERT were complete . "
Yoran ascended to the post in September 2003 , after leaving security software firm Symantec to join the government .
The homeland security position was Yoran 's second tour of government duty ; he once headed vulnerability assessment at the Department of Defense 's Computer Emergency Response Team and managed the Pentagon 's network security .
In the interregnum , he founded network protection firm Riptech and then sold the company to Symantec .
While Yoran was given a weighty task in securing the nation 's computers and providing cybersecurity guidance , he did not have full access to the Secretary of Homeland Security , critics say .
Some members of Congress had introduced bills that would raise the top cybersecurity position to one that directly reported to Secretary Tom Ridge .
While many have charged the Department of Homeland Security with frustrating its cybersecurity staff by not giving their leaders enough clout , Yoran said that was not why he left .
" I never applied for an assistant secretary position , " he said .
" I never advocated for one . "
Still , the technology industry pointed to Yoran 's resignation as proof that the top cybersecurity position needed more authority within the Department of Homeland Security .
" It is even clearer today that cybersecurity must be properly elevated within the DHS in order to provide the necessary resources and the ability to implement policy that will better protect our information infrastructure , " Robert Holleyman , president of the Business Software Alliance , said in a statement regarding Yoran 's resignation .
Before Yoran , the United States ' top cybersecurity position was held by Howard Schmidt , now the chief security officer at eBay , and before that by Richard Clarke .
Clarke is the antiterrorism expert whose book " Against All Enemies " criticized the Bush Administration 's tactics against terrorism .
Clarke resigned the position in February 2003 , Schmidt in April 2003 .
When Clarke held the office , the top cybersecurity position was not part of the Department of Homeland Security , which was created in March 2003 , but part of the Bush Administration .
Both Schmidt and Clarke criticized the relatively low priority that cybersecurity was given in the organization of the Department of Homeland Security when it was created .
" It was an incredibly difficult situation to try and carry on an important mission , " said Doug Goodall , CEO of RedSiren , a network monitoring company that competed with Riptech , the business that Yoran founded .
" That 's the reason that you have seen three directors step down in 24 months . "
The Department of Homeland Security plans to announce a replacement for Yoran soon , a representative for the agency said .
Yoran would n't comment on the problems that the Bush Administration has had with keeping its cybersecurity czars , but he did say that the birth of his twins three months ago convinced him he should spend more time with family .
" You think cybersecurity is a full - time job , that 's the easy part of the day , " he said .

The disputed piece of land that will be under negotiation is known as the Shabaa Farms .
When Israel withdrew from the occupation of southern Lebanon in 2000 , the United Nations Security Council stated that the withdrawal was complete despite its holding onto the disputed area because Shabaa , the United Nations said , was part of the Syrian Golan Heights occupied by Israel .

The New York Times
But Lebanon and Hezbollah say the land is Lebanese and Syria has not contradicted them .
Moreover , Hezbollah has used Israel ’s hold over Shabaa as a pretext for keeping its men under arms despite United Nations resolutions calling for the disarming of all Lebanese militias .
Hezbollah says that as long as part of the Lebanese homeland is occupied , it needs its weapons because the national army is weak .
But the West , especially the United States and France , wants to reduce the power of Hezbollah , a client of both Syria and Iran , and has been looking for ways to strengthen the pro-Western government of Lebanon .
On Wednesday , Hezbollah officials made clear that they viewed Israel ’s offer as part of an effort to disarm the group .
“ If they really want to give us back our land , they can withdraw and implement the security council resolutions , ” said Nawar Sahili , a Hezbollah member of Lebanon ’s Parliament , referring to a United Nations resolution that calls for the Shabaa issue to be resolved .
Next month , United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is due to brief the Security Council on the implementation of Resolution 1701 , which ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah .
In that report , it is likely that he will announce a revised or clarified stand on the sovereignty of Shabaa .
For Israel , the main concern in Lebanon is Hezbollah ’s increasing power .
Israeli military officials say that Hezbollah has far more rockets and far deadlier ones today than it did two years ago when the two fought a month - long war after Hezbollah guerrillas crossed the border to kidnap and kill Israeli soldiers .
I just had a great idea for a TV show : People from all over the world begin to sense they have superpowers .
One guy can fly .
Another can walk through walls .
A cheerleader is impervious to physical harm .
A kid can move back and forth in time .
You get the idea : normal people , sick and tired of living under constraint , are busting out , into a world without limits !
But here ’s the twist :
These people , who believe they have superpowers ?
They do n’t .
They never have and never will .
There is no such thing as a superpower .
The guy who thinks he can fly ?
Jumps off his minivan and sprains his ankle .
The one who can walk through walls ?
Tries to run through the living - room wall and breaks a photograph of his wife ’s mother .
His wife is really upset .
The cheerleader impervious to physical harm throws herself down a flight of stairs , breaks her back , then lies there waiting for it to miraculously mend .
But no .
The cat steps over her .
So much for cheerleading .
The kid who thinks he can move back and forth through time decides to exit a math test early by time - transporting himself back to Mozart ’s Vienna .
He tries and tries , so hard that he finally farts really loudly in a wet double - burst .
The other kids crack up .
He tries to time - transport himself back to the instant before the fart , so he can withhold the fart , but no : he tries so hard , he farts again .
The classroom just dissolves into uncontrollable laughter .
Even the teacher drops her head to her desk , shoulders heaving .
A housewife who can cause objects to levitate destroys the family aquarium .
An elderly woman whose superpower is that she can speak telepathically to animals gets bit by a squirrel .
When , using her mind , she asks the squirrel why , it bites her again , then dashes up a tree .
A stripper whose superpower is that she can read an entire book just by picking it up goes into a bookstore and keeps picking books up and putting them down , a quizzical look on her face , wearing a crop - top and spike heels .
A nun in New Mexico whose superpower is the ability to make delicious bread using any ingredients on hand , even mud , even dead bugs , makes a loaf of bread that all the other nuns decline to eat .
“ I actually just ate , ” one says .
“ Honestly , Sister , I have an upset stomach , ” protests another .
A Virginia boy whose superpower is that he can throw a wad of paper into his trash can misses sixteen times in a row .
Even when he goes right up to the can and drops the wad directly down , it hits the edge and drops into his gym shoe .
Maybe that ’s my superpower , he thinks : whenever I throw a wad of paper , it lands in my gym shoe .
He throws a wad of paper out the door of his room , to see if it will boomerang back and land in one of his gym shoes .
But no .
His octogenarian grandfather is just then hobbling by and the wad of paper hits him in the side of the head .
He is so old he does n’t even notice , just keeps hobbling .
His superpower is : he can make it to the bathroom on time whenever he likes .
On the outskirts of town , an aging balding bachelor ’s superpower is : he can take a box of his mother ’s precious stupid vintage glassware and hurl it down the basement stairs and not a single piece will break .
Later in the day , as he waits for her to get home , his superpower is : when she comes in , he will make a Cloud of Forgetting form around her head .
Or , failing that , a Cloud of Not Really Liking That Glassware Anyway , Sweetie .
At this point , as her car pulls up , oh God , he would settle for the superpower of : can make his knees stop shaking under the table whenever he likes .
Jesus , she ’s going to absolutely smite him .
Her superpower is : can cause the front door to open using only her mind .
He hears her head slam into the closed door , as usual .
Then , as usual , she swears under her breath , goes for her keys .
Down the block , more disappointment : Kenny Dennis stands outside the home of Amelia St. Laurent , trying to gaze through her bedroom wall .
But no .
All he can see is the wall .
Then he gets stung by a wasp .
He kills the wasp with his shoe .
Then , ah , jeez , here comes Amelia herself , face all scrunched up , because she ’s trying to burst into flame .
But no .
She ’s only succeeding in giving herself a big migraine .
And why the hell is Kenny Dennis standing there with his shoe in his hand ?
Just then an arrow enters Kenny ’s hip , fired by Fred Lowry , whose superpower is : can fire an arrow in any direction whatsoever but still hit the bull ’s - eye on a target set up over at the high school via directing the arrow ’s course with his mind .
Lowry ’s hightailing it up the street , red- faced , bow under his arm , when he ’s struck by an Omni driven by the blindfolded Leonard Metz , whose superpower is : has a tiny functioning eye in each fingertip .
Soon , in a plot twist , people begin losing even their normal abilities .
A Japanese woman forgets how to speak Japanese .
A Texas mother forgets how to chew , and that her kids are supposed to wear pants .
Her husband also loses an essential ability he ’s always had , which is : whenever he wants to have an affair , he just has it .
It ’s like he totally forgets he ’s married .
After these affairs , he manifests a secondary ability : forgets he ’s had the affair , does n’t feel the slightest bit guilty .
Today , he goes out , has an affair .
But right in the middle he remembers he ’s married .
Lori ’s a nice girl — why must he always do her wrong ?
Sexually , he performs not so great .
His partner ’s also sad .
Her superpower is : whenever she has a sleazy affair , the guy ’s always at least adequate in the sack .
When he gets home , Lori ’s at the table , mouth full of chips .
The kids are running around the yard in their underwear .
What gives ?
No wonder he cheats on Lori .
Nothing , anywhere , is getting done .
There ’s great fear in the air .
What fools we were , to take our basic abilities for granted !
How wonderful life was , back when we still knew how to drive cars , button shirts , call for takeout , paint a series of watercolors depicting various views of our summer house , find our damn summer house in the first place .
The entire population of earth just stumbles around , slowly starving to death and / or perishing of thirst and / or dying of sunburn or of walking right up to and petting a tiger in the wild , and so forth : an absolute apocalypse of ineptitude .
In this way , my TV show is like life , where people ’s abilities always fall short of their hopes and aspirations and the extent of their love .
This will be great for ratings .
It will make my show relatable .
The first season ends like this :
We zoom down , into a lonely room .
There sits a guy who has lost an ability he ’s always had : can easily find a pithy way to end a comic piece of writing .
He ’s been up all night revising the bastard , trying to find a decent ending , but nothing ’s coming .
His face is a contorted mask of desperation .
We zoom in closer .
His eyes are filled with utter insanity .
It used to be so easy for him .
How is he going to get out of this ?
How , how , how ?
Wait .
He ’s got it !
For sure !
Holy cow , he ’s done it !
Not only has he come up with a killer ending ; he ’s broken the downward spiral of incompetence infecting all mankind !
He ’ll finish the piece , then rush out to tell the others ,
You can break free , as I have broken free with my miraculous ending !
Yes , life is full of trouble , but we are walking miracles , able to rise above any —
Wait a second .
That ending . . . actually , now that he thinks about it , it does n’t exactly . . .
Yeah .
Does n’t make sense .
Unless he —
No .
Still does n’t work .
Crap .
He swears aloud , tears the page from his typewriter , is about to rip it into halves , then quarters , then eighths , and throw it into the air and laugh maniacally as it falls around him like snow .
But then he realizes he ’s forgotten how to tear paper , throw paper , or laugh maniacally .
He turns back to the typewriter .
“ Woe is us , ” he intends to type .
“ Woas ass , ” he types .
Then he bursts into tears , an ability that , apparently , is one of the last a human being ever loses . ♦
Two penguins native to Antarctica met one spring day in 1998 in a tank at the Central Park Zoo in midtown Manhattan .

But no egg was forthcoming : Roy and Silo were both male .
As food riots break out around the globe , vegetarianism seems like more than a way of being kind to animals .
It 's about eating as efficiently as possible , so that grains destined for livestock will reach people instead .
A bit of background : I love meat .
It 's a part of the human biological heritage that I 've never managed , or really even tried , to shake .
( Heck , my cousin 's diet was so one - dimensionally carnivorous that he became jaundiced .
If humans are predisposed to meat , my family is downright prejudiced . )
As I grew older and my palate more sophisticated , I learned to appreciate the joys of vegetables and grains and fruits .
I ate more of these , and after reading Michael Pollan 's " This Steer 's Life " tried to make sure that the animals I consumed lived and died as decently as possible .
But going non-meat was a non-starter .
Even when environmentalists pointed to the extraordinary
greenhouse gas burden of global livestock , I put it out of mind .
I 'm not sure if I can sustain that willful blindness anymore .
In the last month , something largely ignored by the public but long predicted in organizational white papers and academic studies has come to pass :
widespread food shortages .
Ballooning prices .
Outright riots .
Neighbor fighting neighbor .
Countries scrambling to feed themselves , export partners be damned .
From the International Herald Tribune :
Hunger bashed in the front gate of Haiti 's presidential palace .
Hunger poured onto the streets , burning tires and taking on soldiers and the police .
Hunger sent the country 's prime minister packing .
Haiti's hunger , that burn in the belly that so many here feel , has become fiercer than ever in recent days as global food prices spiral out of reach , spiking as much as 45 percent since the end of 2006 and turning Haitian staples like beans , corn and rice into closely guarded treasures .
Haiti is a flashpoint , but other countries are on the same path .
In the last year , riots have also taken place in Egypt , Cameroon , Peru , Guinea , Mauritania ,
Mexico , Senegal , Uzbekistan , Yemen and Indonesia .
The World Bank estimates that 33 countries are similarly threatened by social unrest ;
experts at last week 's International Food Aid Conference described a
" perfect storm " of factors producing a rise in food costs , and rice prices jumping 50 % in just two weeks in March .
Panic has struck Malaysia ,
Thailand and the Philippines , where hoarding rice is now a crime punishable by life imprisonment .
Japan , China and South Korea are buying overseas farmland .
China , Egypt , Vietnam and India are cutting crop exports , driving global prices even higher .
Even where there is food to eat , people often do n't have the money to buy it .
And it 's quite possible that this is just the beginning .
From The Star :
" World agriculture has entered a new , unsustainable and politically risky period , " Joachim von Braun , head of the Washington - based
International Food Policy Research Institute told The Economist , after
G8 finance ministers ended their summit last weekend declaring that global hunger had eclipsed in importance the worldwide credit and climate - change crises they had gathered to discuss .
There is a consensus among agricultural economists that a 30 - year era of cheap food is over .
What 's responsible for this crisis ?
Many things .
Mistaken global trade policies and national mismanagement .
The petering out of the Green Revolution .
The
diversion of crops to fuel .
Famine profiteering .
None of these are easily addressed by you or me – but one thing that is in our power is our own diet .
It takes an estimated five pounds of grain to produce a single pound of beef .
Even before this crisis , food experts said the world could not feed itself in coming decades if growing populations in developing countries insisted on a meat - rich western diet .
That time may already have arrived – and largely without climate - change induced agricultural disruption .
Add droughts and years of failing harvests , and things get seriously scary .
So maybe it 's time for taste to take a back seat to conscience .
I know that sacrificing meat for veggies wo n't solve the problem on its own , but it 's certainly just as meaningful as using compact fluorescent bulbs or cloth shopping bags , and I do that without hesitation .
And it might take a while to reduce my meat consumption to zero , but at the very least I can start cutting back .
Starting tonight .
What do you think , Wired Science readers ?
Will you go vegetarian , too ?

Tall , slim and with flowing locks , Lara Masters modelled in her teens .
But the work dried up as she developed a degenerative nerve condition .
So is the fashion world ready for its first big disabled model ?
The fashion industry has a very precise , exacting and unwavering view of beauty : a model must be tall , extremely slim and physically " flawless " .
It 's a code of understanding which has ruled me out of modelling even though I am 5ft 9ins , size 6 and , if you 'll excuse my immodesty , beautiful .
FIND OUT MORE ... Britain 's Missing Top Model is broadcast on BBC
Three , starting Tuesday , 1 July at 2100BST
Or catch up using the iPlayer I have a degenerative nerve condition that has been gradually paralysing my limbs for many years , and now use an electric wheelchair .
As a writer , model ( I use the term very loosely as will be explained ) actor and TV presenter , I 'm more visible than most disabled people .
But I have never been accepted in any of these jobs for my skill alone - there is always a focus on my disability .
My mum , Debbie Moore , ( founder of Pineapple dance studios ) was a very successful model in the 60s and 70s .
In my early teens , before my disability set in , I followed in her footsteps - modelling for girls ' magazines and Mum 's company .
But from the age of 14 , because I had some paralysis down my left side and an awkward gait , I could not get an agent and that was the end of my hopes for a modelling career .
I even tried joining an agency called Ugly which claimed to be looking for something " different " .
By the time my potential employers had scraped their jaws off the floor I felt that even for an agency that was thinking outside of the box , disability was more disturbing than different .
Considering the agency name , I did n't know whether to be flattered or outraged when they refused take to me on .
Lara Masters , whose modelling ambitions have been thwarted by disability Role models were in short supply , until Paralympic runner Aimee Mullins briefly took to the catwalk for designer Alexander McQueen in 1998 - sporting hand - carved wooden prosthetic limb .
But when McQueen said he was n't out to shock people but " to show that beauty comes from within " , I was appalled and confused .
It was patronising the stunningly gorgeous Mullins and seemed to be saying that having a disability makes you a beautiful person .
Eventually , when I started using a wheelchair , I got signed up by an agency that only recruited disabled models .
It felt like I was only a casting away from becoming the new face of Mac or Aveda .
Instead , I found myself on a poorly paid path of infrequent job offers to advertise wheelchairs , stair lifts and accessible buses - all important campaigns but a far cry from New York Fashion Week .
So when the BBC set out to challenge stereotypes of beauty , with a reality - style show in which eight young , disabled women compete to be a " top model " , I was excited but also sceptical .
Car accident
It introduced me to other people who'd had similar experiences , such as 22 - year - old Jenny Johnson , who had modelled until a car accident at 16 left her with some lower paralysis .
Aimee on the track in 1996 , and at a McQueen opening in 2008 " I started modelling at age 14 .
I went on several photo shoots and gained some real experience .
In spite of acquiring this knowledge , after my accident , it has been impossible to catch a break , " says Jenny .
" I 've even been flat out informed that the reason the agency would not accept me was because of the way I walked . "
So what about the industry 's insiders - are they really willing to give disabled models a fair chance ?
Designer Wayne Hemingway initially sounds an upbeat note .
" We 're learning to support diversity and be inclusive of disability in areas such as sport , " he says , name - checking the Paralympics and the disabled basketball players who featured in a recent series of BBC One idents .
" In new buildings and transport systems it 's now unthinkable not to design with disability in mind , " he says .
But fashion sees itself differently .

Advertisement " The fashion industry is still seeking out so - called ' perfect symmetry ' in impossibly skinny girls and being predictably immoral . "
For Marie O'Riordan , editor of Marie Claire magazine , fashion is n't alone in its promotion of the " perfect " human form - it is reflecting wider prejudices in society .
It 's a business " Disability is largely ignored by the mainstream .
Traditionally , fashion models have represented the ' ideal ' of womanhood - they are taller and slimmer so that they can show off clothes to the maximum benefit .
Being a clothes horse is not something most women could do very well . "
A disabled model , by definition , will be more memorable in a photo than an able - bodied girl
Marie O'Riordan
The fact is that fashion is a business and it is us , the consumers , who keep it thriving .
Is it any wonder the industry sticks to a winning formula and largely shuns the idea of using bigger , more representational female models , let alone disabled models whose physical forms will be even more difficult to sell as aspirational ?
Yet maybe the BBC 's reality show will make a difference .
After all , fashionistas are always looking for something new , and disabled models are perfect to create intrigue and attract attention .
" A disabled model , by definition , will be more memorable in a photo than an able - bodied girl , thus making her attractive to a commercial person trying to sell clothes in an advert , or in editorial , " says O'Riordan .
Her magazine will feature the programme 's winner in a high - end fashion spread by world - renowned photographer Rankin .
This gesture in itself would give any able - bodied model major kudos and guarantee further bookings , so it will be interesting to see what kind of impact this shoot will have on the future of the disabled model .
After that , maybe , it 's up to the public .
Are they willing to prove their readiness to accept a different ideal of beauty by buying a magazine featuring a amputee model .
It 's our collective responsibility .
If we want to see the fashion industry broaden its parameters , we must put our money where our mouth is .

Models set impossible standards of beauty for the ordinary woman to emulate .
Not long ago I saw a girl of about 20 dressed in an artsy fashion walking down the street with two artifical legs .
She was not hiding the fact that her legs were gone .
Still she wanted to look pretty .
I was very moved by her spirit .
Most females want to look good and if they are disabled even more so .
The rest of us can be inspired by their courage
angelica adams , cambridge ma us Good luck to all of you .
It is time the fashion industry woke up to real life .
I 'm sure you will all look great .
My father was disabled and ( apart from things he was physically unable to do ) let nothing get in his way !!
Jean Smith , Dunfermline Does anyone REALLY care if a disabled girl can become a model ?
It 's akin in a lot of ways to asking if someone suffering with a mentally debilitating condition can become one of the worlds top scientists !
I 'm not disabled and I can't be a model .
These programs anger me because I do n't believe they are about " hopes and dreams " .
I believe it 's just more fodder for people who want to be shocked .
Helen , Warwickshire Totally agree with Marie 's comments about a disabled model being memorable .
The girls shown are certainly much prettier than the usual models BUT I feel we live in a sad world that does n't like " abnormalities " and I say that NOT meaning at all to offend anyone at all .
I 'm 54 , 5ft 4 inches and about 4 stone overweight so I know people would never accept me as a model .
Having said all this I wish all of them the very best of luck indeed .
Janis , Surrey
These women chose modelling as a career when their bodies matched what the industry wanted - a standard which automatically excludes the vast majority of people ( especially those that fancy a meal every once in a while ) .
How can they be surprised when such a shallow business discards them when they are no longer " perfect " ?
Michaela , Runcorn , UK 2 points : 1 . Heather Mills is disabled as is Gabrielle - both had decent modelling careers .
2 . I am not disabled and I also can't get modelling jobs why ?
Because I 'm ugly .
Not everyone can be a model , or a singer , or a footballer .
Special exception cannot be granted to one minority .
That would be wholly unfair to everyone else .
Ask yourself can Boris Johnson be the next top model ?
My guess is you will say no with a captial N .
Graham Pinnock , Norwich
In my mind , all of the girls from the BBC show are stunning enough to deserve the status of ' supermodel ' .
I do n't like that they should have to compete to prove that only one of them can fit in with Naomi / Heidi / Kate etc .
Rather than making them compete I would be much more interested in seeing them all modelling and comparing their lives to those of ordinary models .
Maybe it's also time for people to adjust to the fact that ' flawless ' does n't automatically mean beautiful .
Heather , Willenhall I think this programme is a fantastic idea !
Good on you BBC .

What are these ?
Not only were we not concerned about scaling when we launched our beta , our site architecture prohibited it .
We launched the beta on a single box and , due to the disk - based nature of Git and our particular setup , would have been unable to simply ' add another box ' had traffic spiked .
We would have to re-engineer the entire thing .
But that 's fine .
Getting users was more important .
Launched ASAP
We literally launched our " beta " as soon as the signup code was finished .
We had real users and real projects on the site right away , bringing us invaluable feedback .
What worked , what did n't work , all of that .
No lab tests or surveys .
We watched what people did instead of listening to what they said they might do ( which , of course , is never accurate ) .
Once we eschewed funding , we made a few more decisions : stay lean , give the site an attitude , bust out features quickly , and define the site 's purpose in a single sentence .
Oh yeah , and find our third musketeer .
We brought on PJ Hyett , a well - rounded and entrepreneurially minded developer , then got to work .
No outside funding
We had a talk and agreed right away : no outside funding .
We wanted to keep the whole company .
Having very little money , very little time , and a lot of passion leaves few options .
You pretty much have to do what Jason , David , and the boys say .
It 's the smartest way to succeed .
Applying Getting Real to GitHub , though we were familiar with it , did n't cross our minds .
The main idea was to build something useful we 'd enjoy .
The beautiful part , of course , is that other people wanted to enjoy it too .
As such , we quickly realized we could turn GitHub into a real business .
Sure , we always planned to make some money off it , but making money and running a business are different things .
Tom Preston - Werner and I were working full time on other startups when we started GitHub .
It was just a side project .
See , sharing Git repositories was too damn hard .
The existing sites sucked and setting everything up by hand was a pain .
We did n't know it then , but we immediately hit upon some major Getting Real tenants - picking a fight ( crappy existing Git sites ) , scratching your own itch ( we had Git repositories we wanted to share ) , and staying lean ( the two of us planned to do the whole thing ourselves ) .
Getting Real since day one We've employed Getting Real ( with great success ) at GitHub since day one .
Not because we wanted to , or because we thought it was the One True Way .
We 've done it because we had no choice .
Git is a fast , efficient , distributed version control system ideal for the collaborative development of software and GitHub is " the easiest ( and prettiest ) way to participate in that collaboration . "
GitHub 's Chris Wanstrath wrote to tell us how much Getting Real influenced the team there .
Getting noticed
We blogged our asses off and watched Twitter ( via Summize ) like a hawk .
We worked hard to build hype and celebrated every time an influential blogger joined GitHub or wrote something positive .
Seeing what people were saying , especially the good things , fueled us .
In a few ( 3 ) months we had a billing system in place , fleshed out the features we thought were necessary , and were ready to launch .
Things broke on launch day , naturally .
If you have a flawless launch you 're doing it wrong .
We recovered quickly and overall had a great day .
We even managed to launch some new features as a ' thank you ' to our beta testers .
We did not , however , launch everything .
A lot of web apps in our space still have a lot more features than us .
Bug tracking , integrated chat , continuous integration , stuff like that .
Being only three people , we could spend forever building these features or , with considerably less effort , open a few integration points to let people use the sites they already love in conjunction with ours .
Campfire
We 're big Campfire fans , so why not give people a way to integrate their code on GitHub with Campfire ?
We love Lighthouse for ticket tracking , so why not embrace it ?
Features like ' team chat ' and ' ticket system ' look good as bullet points on functional specs , especially when compared to the list of features a competitor has , but luckily we had no functional specs .
Rather than waste cycles on 'me too ' features we were able to spend time on ground breaking ideas like our network visualizer and commit comments .
" Things have been amazing "
We launched three months ago and things have been amazing since then .
Great growth , lots of wonderful users , and most of all a fulfilling site we 're all proud of and use every day .
In fact , after just three months we 're already paying salaries .
All with no funding .
Really , not accepting funding has been huge for us .
Would you pay out of your own pocket for Feature X ? No ?
Shelve it .
If I 'm not going to love a feature , I 'm not going to spend my time ( and therefor money ) implementing it .
Money is quite powerful , and so is its absence .
They say it 's hard to live in San Francisco and not take funding , but I beg to differ : out here it 's easy to get lucrative consulting gigs and fill your bank account .
Contract for someone else with funding , make some money , save it up , then spend it on your company .
You do n't have to sell your soul to a VC or live off of ramen .
Just be smart .
Other invaluable principles
While the ' no funding ' and ' less ' ideas are pillars , a few Getting Real principles are easy to gloss over but invaluable nonetheless .
The ' first - run ' is one such idea .
Basically , what users see when they first use your application matters .
A lot .
One well respected Ruby developer approached PJ at a conference and specifically mentioned how much he liked GitHub 's first - run news feed .
He did n't use those words , of course .
Instead he said exactly what we wanted to hear : " After I signed up , the Welcome Event told me exactly what to do next . "
When you create a new project on GitHub , you can actually copy and paste the " What 's Next ? " text into your console to setup a repository on your computer .
Make it easy .
For me , the ' attitude ' aspect is another favorite and potentially overlooked idea .
Such a perfect solution for so many problems .
Major planned downtime ?
Show users a YouTube video on the " We 'll be back soon page " ( we do this - visitors see a video from a pre-selected pool ) .
Need to show a " this page is loading " message for background operations ?
Make it funny .
" Forking " ( copying ) a repository takes a while and our " Hardcore Forking Action " loading screen has become infamous among users .
Adding a bit of spice into things that are normally bland , boring , and unexciting goes a long way .
You are not Bank of America or any other faceless mega corporation - showing your creative side in unorthodox places is the best way to prove it .
I mentioned earlier we agreed on a single sentence to define the site 's purpose .
While GitHub sports seamless 3rd party integration , social networking aspects , APIs and feeds , interesting visualizations , and other features we love , it 's really about easily sharing code .
And that 's what we say : " Git hosting : no longer a pain in the ass . "
So far , so good .

April 29th , 2008 | by admin | as Domain Names
When wanting to start a website one of the most important aspects that have to be considered is which domain name to use and if owning one is really necessary .
The answer to this question might seem straightforward to most clued - up internet users but you might be asking yourself if it is really important to purchase a domain name especially seeing as there are so many free services that can provide an equivalent solution for free .
If you are unsure of what is intended by a domain name , think of it as a memorable name that points directly to your site .
Every single site on the internet has a domain name that can be comprised of letters and numbers followed by a TLD ( top level domains ) .
A TLD is the end portion of a domain name and currently there are two groups that apply to ordinary users , country code top - level domains ( ccTLD ) ( . US or . FR ) and generic top - level domains ( gTLD ) ( .COM or . BIZ ) .
For people not wanting to invest money there are many free alternatives available on the internet but it is very important to state that neither will ever offer the same levels of personalization and security as purchasing your own domain name .
Free services usually provide a subdomain ( Mysite.freeservices.com ) that will serve as the address to your site together with some sort of hosting , usually the bare minimum , to store files .
The problems and complications associated with such services are overwhelming especially because user accounts are susceptible to termination without prior warning , given that any content created is property of the service provider .
These and many other problems are completely avoided when purchasing a domain .
Once a domain name has been purchased or registered as it is often referred to , no other person may use a similar domain as long as you pay the yearly renewal fees .
If the domain is not renewed it will be made available once again for anyone to register .
Domain names have become extremely affordable although prices still vary considerably between different registrars and TLDs however most users will undoubtedly find that no matter the cost the benefits presented compensate the initial investment .
In some cases hosting providers even offer free domain name registration together with their hosting plans thus eliminating the need to purchase one separately .
After analyzing the advantages there is no question that having your own domain name is important .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey said on Thursday that he is working to revise the guidelines for FBI investigations as the bureau seeks to transform itself into an intelligence - gathering agency that seeks to prevent terrorist attacks .

Meeting with reporters at the Justice Department , Mukasey said for the first time that he is working on revising the guidelines , but declined to discuss possible changes .
It was unclear when the review would be finished .
In May 2002 then - Attorney General John Ashcroft announced sweeping changes to the guidelines to give the FBI greater leeway to conduct domestic counterterrorism surveillance .
A quarter century after the government sought to curtail domestic spying by imposing the guidelines , Ashcroft announced a complete overhaul , lifting restrictions on the FBI conducting surveillance at public gatherings , on religious and political organizations and on surfing the Internet .
Civil liberties groups widely criticized the changes .
The attorney general ’s guidelines on surveillance were first imposed on the FBI in the 1970s following disclosures that the bureau under the late J. Edgar Hoover had run a widespread domestic surveillance program that spied on civil rights activists and political opponents .
Mukasey said the guidelines needed to be changed “ because it ’s necessary to put in place regulations that will allow the FBI to transform itself ... to an intelligence - gathering organization in addition to just a crime - solving organization . ”
He also said he wanted to ensure “ coherent regulations across the board ” so the guidelines in one area do not conflict with the rules in another area .
Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr later said the FBI operates under several sets of guidelines , including one for criminal investigations and another for national security investigations .
“ As there are differences with the standards and guidance governing certain core FBI activities , the attorney general has begun an effort to review these guidelines , ” Carr said .
Regular readers know I am deeply impressed with astronomical imagery , and I tend to be a little over - the - top on occasion when describing it .
However , having said that , let me be very clear :
the following is just about the coolest thing I have ever seen
.
First , the setup .
The Deep Impact spacecraft was the one that smacked a chunk of copper into a comet so that we could see what materials were below the surface .
After the impact , the spacecraft kept going ( with the mission renamed EPOXI ) , and it 's being used to do all sorts of interesting observations .
In late May , 2008 , it turned its cameras back to Earth and observed us over the course of a several hours .
During this time , from EPOXI 's point of view , the Moon passed directly in front of the Earth !
The images were put together ( by my old boss , Don Lindler ! ) into , well , one of the most astonishing animations I have ever watched .
Ever .
Now below is the same view , but this time the " red " you see is actually infrared ; note that land masses which are warm , appear really red since they are emitting lots of IR compared to the oceans : appear bright in the IR due to vegetation and the ground being good reflectors ( see note at bottom of post ) :
To my knowledge , nothing like this has ever been seen before .
These are incredible .
Higher - res versions of these videos can be found on the NASA EPOXI press release page .
Take a look at that , folks .
It 's us , seen from 50 million kilometers away .
I 've seen many images of the Earth and Moon together as taken by distant spacecraft , but this , seeing them in motion , really brings home -- if I may use that highly ironic term -- just where we are : a planetary system , an astronomical body , a blue orb hanging in space orbited by a desolate moon .
This is a view that is literally impossible from the ground .
Only a spacefaring race gets the privilege of this view from a height .
While there is science galore in these animations , I think their real impact is the visceral one from simply seeing them .
As Carl Sagan once said : everyone you have ever met , every human who has lived and died , lived out their lives on that blue ball .
And yet here we are , in the 21st century , plains apes allowed to evolve and satiate their curiosity , now with the ability to lob metal proxies into deep space , look back , and see ourselves .
Science .
I love this stuff .
A very big tip o' the solar panel to Don Lindler , for alerting me about these animations .
And oops : I originally said that the land is warm , and thus bright in the IR .
That 's wrong , at least in this case !
That would be true if these were far ( thermal ) IR images , but they 're actually near - IR , just outside the range seen by the human eye .
At those wavelengths , plant and other objects are pretty good reflectors , so they appear bright .
My thanks to R Simmons in the comments below for pointing this out .
In the south of the UK , crop circles are a common event .
These strange , flattened patterns appear suddenly and without explanation in farmland throughout the county of Wiltshire .
Skeptics will argue that these patterns have been made by pranksters or by enthusiasts wanting to create large - scale crop graffiti .
Others will argue it is an attempt by extraterrestrial beings to communicate with us by stamping their presence into a field .
I ’m keeping an open mind as to the source of these features , neither agreeing nor disagreeing with either “ skeptic ” or “ believer ” .
And this is the reason why .
The UK ’s most complex crop circle appeared in a field earlier this month , and it took an astrophysicist to decipher what it meant …
I usually do n’t cover stories like this on astroengine , but I thought this was pretty captivating .
A crop circle , measuring 150 metres in diameter appeared in a field last month , and at first no one knew what it meant , and filed it under “ C ” for “ Cool Looking Circle . ”
That was until a retired astrophysicist saw the aerial photograph above the Wiltshire countryside near the village of Wroughton .
Mike Reed realised that far from being an interesting pattern , it was in fact a graphical representation of the mathematical symbol π ( Greek letter pi ) .
Complex crop circles have appeared before featuring fractal patterns , but this one is a geometric shape that accurately depicts the first ten digits of π .
π = 3.141592653
Reed managed to understand what was being communicated and drew up his graphical representation of π to 10 digits .
Although it may not appear obvious at first , the crop circle above has been designed in the following way :
But how does it work ?
If you cut the crop circle into 10 pieces , the pattern becomes obvious .
You have to start in the middle , at “ 1 ” in the diagram to the left , and work clockwise .
It is important to take note of the “ steps ” as the spiralling black line progresses outward .
The first number with a step immediately after is the number “ 3 ” , we make a note of this number .
As in the crop circle in Wiltshire , there is a small circle embedded in the step noted as “ 1 ” , this is a decimal point .
Progressing beyond the first step , we immediately hit a second step , so this means we make a note of the number “ 1 ” ( giving us 3.1 ) .
Spiralling outward we hit a third step at the number “ 4 ” , we make a note of this number ( giving us 3.14 ) .
As we continue , another step at “ 1 ” ( 3.141 ) , and then at “ 5 ” ( 3.1415 ) , “ 9 ” ( 3.14159 ) and “ 2 ” ( 3.141592 ) .
This pattern continues to the end of the spiral at the tenth and last digit .
After this , there is a series of 3 circles denoting that π continues to infinity .
To be honest , I find this awesome .
If this was created by a group of humans , it is a stunning achievement ( although no one has come forward claiming responsibility ) .
As for the other option ( i.e. ET communication ) , I ’m not so sure .
However , as I was asked during the Paranormal Radio show with Captain Jack last week , “ UFO ’s , yes or no ? ” , I will have to respond with : Keep an open mind .
Yes , I believe in extraterrestrial life , but as for them visiting Earth to communicate via crop circles seems a bit far fetched .
Still , this is a nice little mystery …

Skinny dipping appeals to a whole bunch of people who are not into nudism .
There are a whole host of reasons to abandon your bathers – it's dark , they 're already wet , you have n't got them .
Or it just feels better .
There 's an Adam and Eve quality to wild swimming : on a riverbank bodies stop being objectified and start being appreciated as brilliant vehicles you get to go places and do things in .
Inhibitions fall away as fast as the wind flaps away towels .
So take a quick look around , check you 're not offending anyone - then strip off , and jump in …
1. Fishing Cove , Gwithian , Cornwall
For me , a tan is n't a tan without a tanline : brown bodies and white bottoms bouncing headlong towards water have a wayward abandon that is lost when no part of the body has been kept private from sun .
But while you may want to sunbathe with your pants on , going to a beach where you can swim with them off is still a pleasure .
Naturist beach Fishing Cove , 1 km from Gwithian ( east along the coast from Navax Point about halfway between Portreath and Hayle on the B3301 ) is hidden away down a steep cliff with a secret garden approach , great jumping rocks , a bay to swim to and every chance of seeing Atlantic grey seals , which haul out at Godrevy Point nearby .
Clothes can be worn .
2. Llyn Morwynion , Snowdonia , Gywnedd
There are multitude of reasons to use birthday suits rather than bathing suits in the llynnoedd ( lakes ) around Wales : long hot hikes benefit from having little to carry , and the one big downside of skinny dipping ( offending others ) is unlikely where llynoedd are remote .
In amongst the gruff bare rocks , heather roots , sky and bogs , polka dot bikinis seem out of place , and skin becomes the more elegant vehicle .
Llyn Arenig Fach , Llyn Hywel and Llyn Edno are all high , wild and atmospheric places to disrobe , but my favourite is Morwynion ( OS map OL18 , SH658303 – note there is a reservoir of the same name in the area ) .
There is a good hike across crow country to get there , and a rock jetty that heats up in summer – good both to lie on , and for a graceful ( rather than hobbling ) entry into the water .
3. Lady Falls , Brecon Beacons , Powys
There are a multitude of bathing spots within Coed Y Rhaeadr ( " wood of the waterfalls " ) , all recommended by dedicated river swimmer Rob Fryer .
The ultimate for a skinny dip is one mile into the wood at the paths end : Lady Falls , a round pool surrounded by trees and steep banks , with the River Neath falling about 40ft from a huge - flat , overhanging ledge .
" Almost a spiritual experience , " says Rob .
4. Blackmoss Pot , Stonethwaite , Cumbria
There was a time when skinny dipping was less about pleasure than a back - to - nature wash .
Unzipping a tent flap and plunging straight into a mountain stream or lake provides a mix of both , the delight only intensified if someone 's brewed tea by the time you get back out .
In Scotland there is a legal right to wild camp , in England and Wales it 's generally accepted in places like the Lake District , Dartmoor and Snowdonia .
So you could try a wild camp at Blackmoss Pot , a popular climbers ' dipping spot in the Lake District .
The pool is sheltered pool , the water is crystal clear , there are great jumping rocks , and a 20 metre swimming channel between high rocks .
The Scottish Right to Roam is based on responsibilities as well as rights , see yours as a wild camper at the outdoor access Scotland website .
5. Newnham Riverbank Club , Cambridge
Star jumps may be a problem in view of passing punts , but Newnham Riverbank Club , on the green and dreamy Cam , is an English skinny - dipping haven .
Just £ 16 will buy a year 's membership for the club grounds , and ready access to the tea and cake that are a frequent fixture of the clipped lawns .
Elegant steps lead into the water , and there is delicious swimming up to Grantchester meadows ( where Virginia Woolf and Rupert Brooke swam naked in a river smelling of ' mint and mud ' ) surrounded by billowy banks , kingfishers and dragonflies .
And all of this can be done naked , as the club operates a " clothing optional policy " , dropping their towels and slipping into the water discreetly when there 's a gap in the traffic ( more than one swimmer has had to tread water while becoming increasingly chilly to avoid causing offence when getting out ) .
6. Berneray Beach , Berneray , Outer Hebrides
The Outer Hebrides are so remote that the beaches are tracked by deer and sheep rather than people .
The landscape of white sand beaches , electric blue water and peat bogs is littered with stone circles and animal bones .
It 's a place that emits a primeval call : go skinny dipping .
Clothes seem out of place here , an unnecessary impediment between you and the elements .
I relished the bittersweet pleasure of cold water here more than anywhere , with thermals , ski gloves and thermoses for afterwards , the exposure itself becomes an unmitigated pleasure .
Berneray Beach has white sand , crystal clear sea , seals , fresh Atlantic winds bringing in forbidding storms and squinting sunshine in quick succession , and three miles of beach for those that fancy a very long streak .
7. The Thames , Oxfordshire
Water seems to change consistency in moonlight , lapping over hands like ripples in mercury , and night swims have their own sounds : in the early evening crickets strike up as the thrum of distant traffic dies down , by nightfall the wet slap of water against riverbank is newly heard in the hush .
The only safe place to indulge a night swimming urge is perhaps a spot that 's well known to the swimmers , and for friends and I that 's a stretch on the Thames : we go during summer when there 's a full moon , rolling down tops and throwing clothes back on the banks , the silkiness of the river all the more delicious for being naked in the black water .
8. Wellsfoot Island , Dartmoor
Forget driving and getting stuck on coastal roads : for a happy summer find yourself a nearby inland beach .
Passing Wellsfoot Island , an improbable sandy beach on the River Dart , the other day some swimmers and I came across a group who had done just that , and were lounging under a red tarpaulin , with sun hats and books .
Swimming in the Dart , which drains straight from the sky down through moor land , is a bit like taking a mineral water bath – all the better , perhaps , to do so unimpeded by clothes ?
To find Wellsfoot Island , park at New Bridge and take the path on the east side of the river through ancient Holne Woods , passing Horseshoe Falls ( a possible natural Jacuzzi come spa bath when river flow is low ) until you reach the beach .
9. Lumb Falls , near Hebden Bridge , Yorkshire
This quiet circular swimming pool is overhung with ferns and ivy , with mossy cliffs sprouting small waterfalls like a Japanese garden .
The water is brown and cold , but a great place to strip off and plunge in , massaging shoulders and the crown of your head under the falls .
10 . Covehithe Beach , Suffolk
Local birdwatchers in hidden stake - outs with binoculars that wander away from the marsh may not thank me for saying , but Covehithe Beach is a great beach for skinny dipping .
With a short explosive run from crumbling cliff to brown sea one 's dignity ( and others sensibilities ) are likely to go unharmed here on quiet days .
It 's a great beach for shoreline swimming , and the brown sea and crumbling cliffs provide a post - apocalyptic beauty .

BAGHDAD - Iraq 's prime minister said yesterday his country wants some type of timetable for a withdrawal of American troops included in the deal the two countries are negotiating .
It was the first time that Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki has explicitly and publicly called for a withdrawal timetable - an idea opposed by President Bush .
He offered no details .
But his national security adviser , Mouwaffak al - Rubaie , told the Associated Press that the government is proposing a timetable conditioned on the ability of Iraqi forces to provide security .
The White House said it did not believe Maliki was proposing a rigid timeline for US troop withdrawals .
" Any agreement would not have any hard timetables for withdrawal , but could include the desire by the US and Iraq to withdraw troops based on conditions on the ground , " National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
" I know that Prime Minister al - Maliki has said that he does n't want a precipitous withdrawal because of the security consequences , " Johndroe said in Toyako , Japan , where President Bush is attending the G - 8 summit .
Maliki said in a meeting with Arab diplomats in Abu Dhabi that his country also has proposed a short - term interim memorandum of agreement rather than the more formal status of forces agreement the two sides have been negotiating .
The memorandum " now on the table " includes a formula for the withdrawal of US troops , he said .
" The goal is to end the presence [ of foreign troops ] , " Maliki said .
Democratic Senator Barack Obama and an aide for Republican Senator John McCain said the Iraqi leader 's remarks were consistent with the presidential candidates ' positions .
Obama , speaking aboard his campaign plane yesterday , said Maliki 's view " is consistent with my view about how withdrawals should proceed and how a status of force agreement should not be structured without congressional input and should not be rushed . "
The Iraqi leader 's remark " is encouraging partly because of the extraordinary work of our troops on the ground in Iraq and improvements in the situation when it comes to Iraqi forces , " Obama said .
" The prime minister himself now acknowledges that in cooperation with Iraq , it 's time for American forces to start sending out a time - frame for the withdrawal , and I hope that this administration as well as John McCain is listening . "
Randy Scheunemann , a senior foreign policy adviser to the McCain campaign , issued a statatement yesterday saying that McCain " has always said that conditions on the ground - including the security threats posed by extremists and terrorists , and the ability of Iraqi forces to meet those threats - would be key determinants in US force levels . "
" As Iraq 's national security adviser said as recently as yesterday , " Scheunemann said , " the Iraqi government was proposing a timetable that would be conditioned on the ability of Iraqi forces to provide security .
Unlike Senator Obama 's constantly shifting positions , Senator McCain has been consistent in arguing that the US presence in Iraq should be based on sound judgments of the situation in Iraq . "
AFTER scanning his textbooks and making them available to anyone to download free , a contributor at the file - sharing site PirateBay.org composed a colorful message for “ all publishers ” of college textbooks , warning them that “ myself and all other students are tired of getting ” ripped off .
( The contributor ’s message included many ripe expletives , but hey , this is a family newspaper . )
All forms of print publishing must contend with the digital transition , but college textbook publishing has a particularly nasty problem on its hands .
College students may be the angriest group of captive customers to be found anywhere .
Consider the cost of a legitimate copy of one of the textbooks listed at the Pirate Bay , John E. McMurry ’s “ Organic Chemistry . ”
A new copy has a list price of $ 209.95 ; discounted , it ’s about $ 150 ; used copies run $ 110 and up .
To many students , those prices are outrageous , set by profit - engorged corporations ( and assisted by callous professors , who choose which texts are required ) .
Helping themselves to gratis pirated copies may seem natural , especially when hard drives are loaded with lots of other products picked up free .
But many people outside of the students ’ enclosed world would call that plain theft .
Compared with music publishers , textbook publishers have been relatively protected from piracy by the considerable trouble entailed in digitizing a printed textbook .
Converting the roughly 1,300 pages of “ Organic Chemistry ” into a digital file requires much more time than ripping a CD .

Last night on PBS , Bill Moyers interviewed investigative journalist Jane Mayer and mentioned that in Mayer ’s new book , she notes that FBI agents refused to participate in the CIA ’s interrogation of terror suspects at Guantánamo Bay because they determined it to be “ borderline torture . ”
Moyers then asked , “ Who were some of the other conservative heroes , as you call them , in your book ? ”
Mayer remembered one top Justice Department lawyer and “ very conservative member of this administration ” who said that after participating in White House meetings authorizing torture , he believed that “ lunatics had taken over the country . ”
Mayer said two other top DOJ lawyers had to develop a system of speaking codes because they feared they were being wiretapped while others described an “ atmosphere of intimidation , ” mainly from Vice President Dick Cheney :
MAYER : There was such an atmosphere of intimidation . …
They felt so endangered in some ways that , at one point , two of the top lawyers from the Justice Department developed this system of talking in codes to each other because they thought they might be being wiretapped …by their own government .
They felt like they might be kind of weirdly in physical danger .
They were actually scared to stand up to Vice President Cheney .
Watch it :
Mayer later said that “ there is a paper trail ” documenting U.S. torture policies “ that goes right to the top of our govenment ” and that Congress “ is beginning to ” get to the truth and “ piece it together . ”
Mayer added that the truth to the White House policies is “ a humungous jigsaw puzzle ” because “ there are many , many secrets we still do n’t know .
There are legal memos that nobody ’s ever seen . ”

We ’ve heard through the grapevine that Apple is n’t pleased with Rogers right now , due to their insanely high iPhone data prices .
This is n’t 100 % confirmed at the moment , but here ’s what is rumored to have happened :
Rogers hired additional sales staff to handle the iPhone launch , all of whom have been fired effective immediately
Apple has informed Rogers that they will be diverting a “ large percentage ” of their iPhone stock that was destined for Canadian shores , sending it instead to their European distributors .
According to the rumor , this would leave Rogers with as few as 10 - 20 units per store for launch day .
The consumer backlash against Roger ’s data rates was understandable , but we ’re honestly a bit shocked to see Apple reacting in a similar fashion .
Cupertino is doing one of two things here : they ’re either attempting to strong - arm Rogers into lowering their data tariffs and making the iPhone more accessible to average consumers , or they really have simply given up and are abandoning the Canadian market in favor of a European market that seems a bit more eager to , uh , allow people to purchase an iPhone without mortgaging their Moose farm .
Let ’s hope , for the sake of our Canadian friends up North , that Apple is simply trying to affect some change , and that Rogers will be forced to comply by next Friday .
Any more takers for the Rogers petition ?

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
At least 11 species of African frogs carry a built - in concealed weapon -- they can sprout claws on demand to fight off attackers , U.S. researchers reported on Monday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
When threatened , the frogs can puncture their own skin with sharp bones in their toes that they then use to claw their attackers , David Blackburn and colleagues at Harvard University reported .
“ It ’s surprising enough to find a frog with claws , ” Blackburn , a graduate student , said in a statement .
“ The fact that those claws work by cutting through the skin of the frogs ’ feet is even more astonishing .
These are the only vertebrate claws known to pierce their way to functionality . ”
Blackburn became aware of the frogs when one scratched him in Cameroon .
He looked at museum specimens of 63 African frog species .
In 11 central African species the bones at the ends of the toes were pointed and hooked , with smaller , free - floating bones at their tips .
“ These nodules are also closely connected to the surrounding skin by dense networks of collagen , ” Blackburn said .
“ It appears they hold the skin in place relative to these claw - like bones , such that when the frog flexes a certain muscle in the foot , the sharp bone separates from the nodule and bursts through the skin . ”
While the finding is new to science , it is not news to locals .
“ Cameroonian hunters will use long spears or machetes to avoid touching these frogs , ” Blackburn said .
“ Some have even reported shooting the frogs . ”
For their part , the frogs probably use this defense rarely , Blackburn said .
“ We suspect , since the frog does suffer a fairly traumatic wound , that they probably use these claws infrequently , and only when threatened , ” he said .
“ Most vertebrates do a much better job of keeping their skeletons inside , ” he added .

I was recently working on the integration between Mocha and expectations .
Expectations promotes the idea that you should only have one expectation per test ; therefore , I wanted to display a warning if you call Object #expects within an expected block .
For example , the following code will print a warning .
Usually , I 'd use one of the various Alternatives for Redefining Methods , but redefining the Object #expects method had two additional constraints that complicated matters .
At first I attempted to solve this problem by aliasing methods and pointing to different method definitions based on the context in which the code was currently executing .
This turned into a complicated mess , and also required me to define a few methods that could potentially collide with methods defined by applications using Expectations .
After going down that path for a bit it became clear that it would be simpler to define modules and delegate the expects call to the appropriate module based on the context .
The actual implementation involves several moving parts , so here 's a much simpler example .
Start with some behavior defined on Object .
This behavior will have been defined by another framework so you cannot ( easily ) alter the original method definition .
Next , you 've decided to create a framework that says hello in Spanish also .
You still want to be able to return " hello " when English is required , but you want themethod to return " hola " when you are expecting Spanish .
Below is the output we are looking for .
Currently our code returns " hello " both in English and Spanish .
We can make themessage sent to Object return " hola " by removing themethod , defining an InSpanish module , and including the InSpanish module .
Now we have Spanish working , but we 've lost our English .
Remember the actual implementation needed to preserve the original behavior in some circumstances .
Themethod is our circumstance where we need to preserve original behavior .
This can be done easily enough by Moving the say_hello definition from Object to an InEnglish module
Now we have the original behavior of themethod , but we 've lost our ability to speak Spanish .
The final step is to define Object # say_hello in a way that delegates themessage to the appropriate module instead of removing the method .
The final change was setting theinstance variable to the module who 'smethod definition was required .
As you can see from the printed output , our code works as desired .
This is n't a technique that you 'll use often , but it 's a good trick to know when you need it .
If you 're interested in the actual application you can check out the expectations framework code

And here we thought the ' No shirt , no shoes , no service ' sign was restrictive
by Jeremy Hooper
According to a Queerty reader , the following sign was ( is ? ) hanging up at a Rite Aid store in NYC's West Village ( the one on Sixth Avenue at West 13th Street ) :
Wow .
This is totally shocking .
We never thought ANYONE could give us strong positive feelings about patronizing Duane Reade stores , but Tom Marquez has just managed to do exactly that .
Though if you think this managerial move is a bad , deeply offensive one -- just wait until later this week , when we hear Mr. Marquez will change his store 's name to " AIDS is Rite . "
No Gay Rights At NYC Rite Aid [ Queerty ]
** UPDATE : But wait a minute :
Is this much ado about nothing ?
A store employee says yes : Audio : Rite Aid did no Wrong ? [ G - A - Y ]
Your thoughts
Could Tom ban sick people too ?
I 'm really uncomfortable waiting for my prescription with all those people hacking , coughing and sneezing .
And the sign does say " ANYTHING that would make our customers feel uncomfortable is prohibited in the store . "
Has making out in the drug store become a major problem ?
Is there a new trend that I have n't heard of ?
It 's not like I asked my boyfriend where he'd like to go for a romantic evening out and he responded with " let 's go to Rite Aid . "

I did n't realize that buildings could have beliefs , and that said beliefs could trump common decency .
So sad that brick and mortar achieves sentience and THIS is what it comes up with .
Posted by : Jason D | Jul 7 , 2008 10:12:21 AM
Wow .
He really does n't want any business .
Just for you non-NYC types , this is one avenue and change over from the NYC LGBT Center .
Not exactly the neighborhood you want to be in if you want to spout homophobic bigotry and stay busy .
But I think that 's not a bad idea .
I think me and the beau are going in and make out in aisle 5 ...
Posted by : Morry | Jul 7 , 2008 10:18:27 AM
LOL , Jason !
Of course that must also mean the store disallows men from entering into it 's backdoor .

WANT an email site ?
GOOGLE it and you can write a review of the store .
Posted by : LOrion | Jul 7 , 2008 10:21:42 AM
I went to the Rite Aid website and posted the following .
If you would like to do the same , the store 's zip code is 10011 .
I was a loyal customer and shopped frequently at the Rite Aid store at 13th street and 6th avenue in Manhattan .
Thanks to the actions of Tom Marquez your store manager I will no longer do any shopping at your store .
I maintain a business around the corner and will persuade my employees and friends to do the same .
Tom Marquez ' anti gay discrimination is a horrendous mistake and will do more harm than good to your company .
It 's a shame since I preferred Rite Aid to Duane Reade and CVS , but now they will be getting my hard earned money rather than your bigoted stores .
It 's a real shame that you allow this behavior to ruin your formerly good name .
Posted by : John | Jul 7 , 2008 10:23:00 AM
This is an opportunity for some fun while providing great publicity for Rong - Aid .
Organize a mass intervention that occurs over an extended period of time .
You send in one loving couple , and then just after they are thrown out , another couple enters , etc. , etc . .
In a place like NYC this could go on for days tying up their employees time .
Getting it all on video is essential , or course .
Posted by : Richard Rush | Jul 7 , 2008 10:23:06 AM
Agreed , Morry .
I 've never been turned on in a Rite Aid before , but I 'm thinking my partner and I might just have to consider it for our next attempt to set the " most public displays of affection in ten minutes " world record !
Posted by : G - A - Y | Jul 7 , 2008 10:23:25 AM
How about the Human Rights Commission of NYC looking into this matter ?
He can say whatever he want under free speech , but he does n't have the right to disciminate in a public forum under NYC law .
And is the the store a ' private ' institution ?
Something to look into .

I 'm glad you posted the update , but ... honestly , how oould anyone swallow this on face value and get themselves in a tizzy ?
If we are willing to believe that a random sign ' claiming ' to be from a manager and posted on the outside of the door is proof of anything , then we deserve to be derided .
Not for our sexuality ; for our gullibility .
For the record , there is apparently no ' Tom Marquez ' at that Rite Aid .
So everyone can start unbunching their panties now .
Posted by : Famous Author Rob Byrnes | Jul 7 , 2008 11:14:19 AM
That 's an unfair criticism , Rob .
It 's not like this is a common prank whose inauthenticity is patently obvious .
If a prank , it 's an oddly specific one .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Jul 7 , 2008 11:18:35 AM
It 's also unfair , Rob , to act as if everyone who has reacted negatively to this has had one monolithic response .
Some might have had a " heads are gonna roll " reaction , while others wanted to learn more before getting into full - on boycott mode .
Personally I was shocked , but had every intent on getting the company on record ASAP ( which I did ) .
There 's also some who might call you gullible for willingly accepting the denials from a company who clearly has an interest in running damage control .
Even if no " Tom Marquez , " this still very well could have been the work of another employee .
It could also have been a completely random and unfair act against the store by a layman .
We simply do not know .
But the point is that this is , regardless of how the facts flesh out the matter , is not a straightforward , obvious joke .
It 's an odd incident that still holds many questions .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Jul 7 , 2008 11:29:50 AM
I think Morry was heading in the right direction given your update .
If I were a disgruntled customer ( or employee ) of a store in the heart of Chelsea , then what better way to score a cheap shot than to surreptitiously post an anti-gay message ?
Posted by : KipEsquire | Jul 7 , 2008 11:41:51 AM
Jeremy , my comment was based on the fact that this story was covered by several blogs ( including this one ) in a ' blog first , ask questions later ' fashion .
And the comments that ensued took the posts as fact .
I highly commend you for taking the initiative to look into it further , but my comment stands .
And with all due ( and considerable ) respect , if I am gullible , at least I am erring on the side of caution , rather than whipping readers into a frenzy over a photo of unknown origin and motivation .
Posted by : Famous Author Rob Byrnes | Jul 7 , 2008 12:36:08 PM
Rob : I of course get where you 're coming from .
But I , while also maintaining great respect for you , do think that you 're taking a little too much of a holier - than - thou approach with this .
You 're making it sounds as if you , unlike all the rest of us , could so clearly see through it .
I just do n't think the facts , as they organically played out , merit that stance .
What I reported on was the fact that the sign , per a Queerty reader , was posted in the window .
I then made a few benign comments about its existence .
At that point all of us were on the same page .
Me , the readers , yourself --
We all became aware that this sign exists , and then we go about piecing together the " whys " and " hows . "
That is sometimes the nature of blogging .
Nobody was " whipped into a frenzy " by me :
They were presented with the situation at hand .
Anyone who knows this site knows that I will ( a ) continue to dig , and ( b ) GLADLY , WILLINGLY present all information that comes out .
That is exactly what happened .
What about a person who just happened on the sign while walking down the street ?
If their friend points it out to them , is that friend " working up a frenzy " ?
No !
And if the natural reaction is to get pissed , are they in the wrong ?
No !
Well that is essentially what happened here .
The Queerty reader served as the eyes for all of us , and we reacted accordingly .
The variable is that we chose to go further and get the store on record rather than to stew in our anger .
Oh , and I did n't say you WERE gullible -- I 'm saying that one could make that argument .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Jul 7 , 2008 12:47:31 PM
I can be very gullible on occasion , but I usually cast a skeptical look at items ( especially when they originate at Queerty . )
I suspect that 's because I 'm very , very old .
The bad news is that it makes me too skeptical at times .
The good news is that I can say ' I told you so ' about Obama and still be his supporter .
Such as : http://robnyc.blogspot.com/2008/04/question-answered-for-months.html
You jumped right in and looked for answers , so this really is n't a bone I have to pick with G* A*Y .
But whether through this site , or Queerty , or Joe My God , or other sites that picked up on this , a lot of people seem to be worked up .
For example : http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=17614054620
Listen , as far as I 'm concerned , Godspeed to them .
But I 'm a bit embarrassed for them ( and other people ) who ran with a Known Fact before it became a Probable Fiction .
I 'll go back to my cave now and try to invent a wheel ... :-)
Posted by : Famous Author Rob Byrnes | Jul 7 , 2008 9:50:01 PM
LOL .
Please do n't go back to your cave , Rob .
You raise some good and valid points .

I just received this from Rite Aid today :
John , I can assure you that we are taking this matter very seriously , and these
signs absolutely do not represent the views of Rite Aid , nor the associate
identified .
One of our core values is to be a place where all customers and
associates are treated with respect and dignity .
We are conducting an investigation regarding this matter and our findings
show that these signs were not posted by any current Rite Aid associates as
indicated .
As soon as the signs were noticed , they were immediately removed .
We have also notified the local authorities on this act of vandalism , and
are offering our full support and cooperation so that the individual (s )
responsible for this act of intolerance can be prosecuted to the fullest
extent of the law .

I like that people on the left carp about people on the right getting worked up over nothing .
Such as the incident of the kid drawing a crucifix and getting sent to the counselor .
Hey , I mean , at least that incident was real ... it was a mis-understanding or taken out of context by the people who reported on it , but it did actually happen .
Now we get worked up over a total fake .
Really , people on all sides need to calm the F* down .
Posted by : Bruce | Mar 7 , 2010 8:58:31 PM
Bruce : Some facts are in order .
( 1 ) This was never proven to be a " total fake . "
The Rite Aid staff denied all knowledge , and thankfully spoke out against it .
But the culprit was never nabbed .
it could 've been a disgruntled staffer who never owned up to it .
Nobody knows .
All that was ever " proven " was that it was posted , for some strange reason .
( 2 ) Yes , people reacted to this .
Naturally .
It 's a human instinct .
But many sites presented a round picture , with both the incident and Rite Aid 's quick and appreciated response .
In fact , we posted audio that came directly from this Rite Aid store , as well as other responses from the store regarding the name Tom Marquez / why this might have happened / etc .
See update link .
So while easy to act like this was all knee jerk and unfair , the reality is much different .
( 3 ) What 's really unfair is that you 'd turn this into a right v. left matter when there is absolutely nothing partisan at play .
What makes this a right or left matter ?
Hopefully folks of all political stripes would speak out against the sign ( regardless of why it was posted ) , and hopefully the culprit would receive round criticism regardless of his party ID .

PARIS 
They ’re clunky , heavy and ugly , but they have become modish  and they are not this season ’s platform shoes .
A year after the introduction of the sturdy gray bicycles known as Vélib ’s , they are being used all over Paris .
The bikes are cheap to rent because they are subsidized by advertising , and other major cities , including American ones , are exploring similar projects .
About 20,600 Vélib ’ bicycles are in service here , with more than 1,450 self - service rental stations .
The stations are only some 300 yards apart , and there are four times as many as there are subway stations , even in a city so well served by its metro system .
In the first year , the city says , there have been 27.5 million trips in this city of roughly 2.1 million people , many of them for daily commutes .
On average , there are 120,000 trips a day .
And on July 27 , at the conclusion here of the Tour de France , 365 lucky Vélib ’ riders will be chosen to ride along for a while and cross the finish line .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil prices jumped more than $ 3 on Thursday after Libya said it was studying options to cut output in response to U.S. threats against producer countries .

U.S. crude rose $ 3.50 to $ 138.05 a barrel by 1:33 p.m. EDT ( 1733 GMT ) .
London Brent crude traded up $ 3.81 to $ 138.14 a barrel .
“ The crude oil market spiked sharply higher in early trading after Libyan National Oil Company chief Shokri Ghanem said that Libya was considering a production cut , ” said Tim Evans of Citi Futures Perspective .
Ghanem , Libya ’s most senior oil official , said he was studying the possibility of reducing production in response to a bill before the U.S. Congress that would empower the Justice Department to sue members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for limiting oil supplies .
“ We are studying all the options , ” Ghanem told Reuters .
“ There are threats from the Congress and they are taking OPEC to court , extending the jurisdiction of the U.S. outside the U.S. ”
President George W. Bush has said he would veto the legislation if it were passed by Congress .
The House of Representatives passed the bill in May , but the Senate has yet to schedule a vote on the measure .
Oil prices are nearing the record of $ 139.89 a barrel struck on June 16 as part of a six - year rally supported by surging demand from emerging economies like China and India .
Rising flows of cash into commodities from investors seeking to hedge against inflation and the weak dollar have added to gains this year .
The dollar fell broadly on Thursday after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday and dashed expectations of an imminent rate hike .
Rising fuel costs have strained economies and spurred protests around the globe , prompting OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia to pledge to hike output during a meeting between producer and consumer nations over the weekend .
OPEC President Chakib Khelil said in an interview Thursday that prices could reach $ 170 a barrel in the coming months , and he reiterated the cartel ’s position that speculation -- not a supply problem -- was driving oil to new highs .
“ I forecast prices probably between $ 150 and $ 170 during this summer .
That will perhaps ease towards the end of the year , ” Khelil told France 24 television , according to a text of the interview released by the station .
“ I think that the devaluation of the dollar against the euro , if everything goes as I think it will , will be of the order of perhaps 1 to 2 percent , and this will probably generate an $ 8 rise in the price of oil , ” he said .
Oil prices fell on Wednesday after U.S. government data showed a surprise build in the crude inventories of the world ’s top consumer as demand continued to drop .
A Nigerian oil workers union and Chevron were expected to resume talks on Thursday in a last - ditch effort to avert an all - out strike that could sharply cut output from the OPEC nation .
Separately , pipeline attacks cut Chevron ’s Nigerian output of around 350,000 barrels per day by a third last week .

Mom writes :
" Something really amazing happened in Downtown Spokane this week and I had to share the story with you .
[ My colleague ]
Joel is a loan officer at Sterling [ Savings ] Bank .
He works downtown in a second story office building , overlooking busy Riverside Avenue .
Several weeks ago he watched a mother duck choose the cement awning outside his window as the uncanny place to build a nest above the sidewalk . "
" The mallard laid ten eggs in a nest in the corner of the planter that is perched over 10 feet in the air .
She dutifully kept the eggs warm for weeks and Monday afternoon all of her ducklings hatched . "
" Joel worried all night how the momma duck was going to get those babies safely off their perch in a busy , downtown , urban environment to take to water , which typically happens in the first 48 hours of a duck hatching . "
" Tuesday morning , Joel came to work and watched the mother duck encourage her babies to the edge of the perch with the intent to show them how to jump off ! "
" The mother flew down below and started quacking to her babies above .
In his disbelief Joel watched as the first fuzzy newborn toddled to the edge and astonishingly leapt into thin air , crashing onto the cement below .
He could n't watch how this might play out .
He dashed out of his office and ran down the stairs the sidewalk where the first obedient duckling was stumbling near its mother from the near fatal fall .
Joel looked up .
The second duckling was getting ready to jump ! "
" He quickly dodged under the awning while the mother duck quacked at him and the babies above .
As the second one took the plunge , Joel jumped forward and caught it with his bare hands before it hit the cement .
Safe and sound , he set it by the momma and the other stunned sibling , still recovering from its painful leap . "
" One by one the babies continued to jump to join their anxious family below .
Each time Joel hid under the awning just to reach out in the nick of time as the duckling made its free fall . "
" The downtown sidewalk came to a standstill .
Time after time , Joel was able to catch the remaining 8 and set them by their approving mother . "
" At this point Joel realized the duck family had only made part of its dangerous journey .
They had 2 full blocks to walk across traffic , crosswalks , curbs , and pedestrians to get to the closest open water , the Spokane River . "
" The onlooking office secretaries then joined in , and hurriedly brought an empty copy paper box to collect the babies .
They carefully corralled them , with the mother 's approval , and loaded them up into the white cardboard container .
Joel held the box low enough for the mom to see her brood .
He then slowly navigated through the downtown streets toward the Spokane River , as the mother waddled behind and kept her babies in sight .
As they reached the river , the mother took over and passed him , jumping into the river and quacking loudly .
At the water 's edge , the Sterling Bank office staff then tipped the box and helped shepherd the babies toward the water and to their mother after their adventurous ride . "
" All ten darling ducklings safely made it into the water and paddled up snugly to momma duck .
Joel said the mom swam in circles , looking back toward the beaming bank workers , and proudly quacking as if to say , ' See , we did it !
Thanks for all the help ! ' "

I rise in support of Dennis Kucinich 's articles of impeachment against President Bush for 9/11 .
I will provide information to back up the relevant portions of the articles which deal with 9/11 :
Article 2 : Falsely , Systematically , and with Criminal Intent Conflating the Attacks of September 11 , 2001 , With Misrepresentation of Iraq as a Security Threat as Part of Fraudulent Justification for a War of Aggression :

Article 34 : Obstruction into the investigation of 9/11 :
- Read this and this .
Article 35 : Endangering the health of 9/11 first responders :
An aggressive new fungus - like plant disease spreading across Britain could destroy millions of garden shrubs , including historic ornamental plants , and transform the rural landscape .
Phytophthora kernoviae , a new plant pathogen from the same family as the mould which caused the Irish potato famine , was discovered in Cornwall in 2003 and is now spreading across the United Kingdom , with 52 cases identified in formal gardens and the countryside in England , Wales and Scotland .
The speed of the spread and the ability of Phytophthora kernoviae to rapidly kill or damage species has alarmed scientists , who say it is showing the capacity to target and destroy specific plants and trees , in particular wild rhododendrons and the European beech .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The organism is a close relative to Phytophthora ramorum , which is also a growing threat to plant life in the United Kingdom and is responsible for Sudden Oak Death – the disease which has devastated the population of American tan oaks in California and Oregon .
The Government has announced an urgent consultation to draw up measures to try to halt the spread , which could include removing rhododendrons and other host species from all woodlands and gardens at risk of the disease .
Uprooting and burning infected plants has so far failed to control it .
Jeff Rooker , minister for Farming and Animal Health at the Department for Food , Environment and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) said : " Despite five years of emergency action , Phytophthora kernoviae and Phytophthora ramorum have continued to spread ...
We now know that they have the potential to cause significant harm to businesses and the natural landscape , and we need to decide on a policy for future management . "
It was announced this week that Phytophthora kernoviae has reached beyond gardens and woodland for the first time by infecting native Bilberry bushes on heathland in Cornwall .
The National Trust , which has seen 14 of its gardens infected , is creating a living archive of rare shrubs and plants on properties at risk of being destroyed .
It called on the Government to provide long - term funding to halt the progress of the pathogens .
The Independent understands work is now being carried out to assess whether the fungus - like organism is reaching a tipping point where it can infect other hosts and go on to cause widespread damage beyond the 15 species it is already known to attack .
Dr Sandra Denman , senior pathologist at Forest Research , the scientific arm of the Forestry Commission , said that although the mould was first discovered in Britain , it does not originate from the UK and therefore presents a particular threat to plant life .
Scientists underline that the extent of the ability of the disease to spread without its key host , the Rhododendron ponticum , an exotic species from Asia introduced to the UK by the Victorians and already blamed for causing widespread damage to native plants by its voracious growth , remains unknown .
A Defra consultation paper published this month made clear that heathland , woodland and other habitats are at risk of an assault that could last decades .
One senior scientist said : " The worst case is that it finds another common host such as a tree species and begins to spread more rapidly . "

Women feel unhappy later in life than men in spite of the fact that many of them are happier in their early adulthood .
A new study by Anke Plagnol of the University of Cambridge , and University of Southern California economist Richard Easterlin was the first to collect the nationally representative data to analyze the importance of unfulfilled desires on a person 's feeling of happiness over several decades .
The researchers revealed that women generally start out happier than men , but their sense of well - being diminishes with the time .
The happiness largely was linked to such important aspects of life satisfaction as family and finances .
Men after the age of 48 are more satisfied with their family lives and finances than women .
Both men and women see happy marriage as their life goal in early adulthood with nine out of ten people of both genders pointing out to this factor .
However , overall satisfaction for men and women will be different depending on the realization of this goal .
On average , men were found to be the most unhappy during their 20's , and this was the time , when most were single and dissatisfied with their finances .
Discontent with financial situation was explained by the fact that men usually have higher expectations .
But as men age , their overall life satisfaction increases .
After 34 years old , men are more likely to be married than women , a tendency that seems to continue with the age , indicating the increasing satisfaction with family life .
Men 's financial situation is also likely to improve with the time with more of them spending on large - scale items such as a car or vacation home , which they could not afford early in life .
The study showed that at age 41 men were more satisfied with finances than women , while at age 48 men 's overall happiness was greater than women 's sense of happiness .
At age 64 men were more satisfied with their family life than women .
Researchers also added that the study revealed greater satisfaction for previous generation in comparison to the recent generation despite having more .

By year ’s end , roughly 100 American communities will be left without regular commercial air service , and that number may double next year , according to the Air Transport Association , the industry trade group .
“ The guy who is used to taking a nonstop flight on a small airplane now has to drive an hour to an hour and a half to an airport to take a trip , ” said David Castelveter , a vice president with the trade group .
“ It is a crisis of great magnitude and it is having an impact already . ”
At least one major carrier could liquidate , the trade group has warned , on top of eight small airlines that have disappeared or filed for bankruptcy protection this year .
The prospect of losing service alarms passengers and politicians alike .
“ I implore American Airlines , as well as the other carriers considering various cost - saving scenarios , to take into account more than profit when they evaluate routes , ” Gov. David A. Paterson of New York said this week after American announced a series of cuts affecting La Guardia and other state airports .
Airlines know the changes are painful .
Said John P. Tague , United ’s chief operating officer : “ There ’s going to be a period of adjustment in the last half of the year that will be unpleasant . ”
But the downsizing of the airlines is unlikely to be reversed anytime soon .
Carriers are selling off hundreds of older , less - efficient planes , so the industry would have trouble growing sharply again even if oil prices were to drop and the economy were to rebound quickly .
Well before jet fuel costs jumped , analysts were saying there were too many carriers and that a round of mergers was needed to consolidate the industry .

In effect , travelers are seeing the likely results of such mergers  reducing operations to save costs  with only one merger occurring , the combination of Delta and Northwest .
How do you rate as a husband or wife of the 1930s ?
Update 4/26/2014 : Several of you have emailed me to let me know that the scoring is somehow messed up .
Thank you for letting me know !
I 'm not sure what 's going on , but I assume it has to do with an update to PHP or something like that , and it's been over 2 years since I last looked at it , so I 'm going to have to get myself back up to speed on it .
Until I get the quiz fixed , you can always check the copy of the scale posted on Flickr ( linked below ) and add them points up manually .
This scale was first brought to my attention by the blog Mind Hacks , and after being posted on Boing Boing , a reader realized they had a full copy of the scale and posted it on Flickr .
What else was there to do but make it an internet quiz ?
Today the Bush Administration released a letter threatening to veto the upcoming FISA legislation if it included the Bingaman Amendment , which puts both telecom immunity and the court cases on hold until after the Inspector General reports about the warrantless wiretapping program .
If given the choice between new surveillance powers without immunity for telcos on the one hand , or surveillance under the existing law on the other , the Bush Administration said its choice was clear : keep with the existing law .
Even though the White House " strongly support[s ] " the FISA bill , and contends it is necessary to provide " our intelligence professionals the tools they need to keep our Nation safe , " and urges the Senate " to act as soon as it returns from its recess , " the Bush Administration is willing to veto the legislation and forgo these tools unless the telecom immunity is given effect immediately .
The Administration has said " [t ] hat the failure to enact long - term FISA modernization legislation is costly and dangerous is beyond any serious dispute , " contending that " [ i] t's vital that our intelligence community has the ability to learn who the terrorists are talking to , what they 're saying , and what they are planning . "
However , according to today 's veto threat , none of this is as important as immediate immunity for the telecommunications carriers .
Even if the President gets an unprecedented expansion of government surveillance power , and the bill merely delays telecom immunity until Congress has more information , this , Bush contends , is not better than continued surveillance under the current version of FISA .
Assuming that the President would not put the financial interests of large corporations ahead of the safety of the American people , today 's veto threat puts the lie to the dire warnings put forth by the Bush Administration .
Alternatively , if the government is being honest about the need for immediate legislation , today 's veto threat shows a callous indifference to that purported danger , favoring special interests over security .
Senator Kennedy addressed this issue in his floor statement back in December :
Think about what we ’ve been hearing from the White House in this debate .
The President has said that American lives will be sacrificed if Congress does not change FISA .
But he has also said that he will veto any FISA bill that does not grant retroactive immunity .
No immunity , no new FISA bill .
So if we take the President at his word , he is willing to let Americans die to protect the phone companies .
The President ’s insistence on immunity as a precondition for any FISA reform is yet another example of his disrespect for honest dialogue and for the rule of law .
It ’s painfully clear what the President ’s request for retroactive immunity is really about .
It ’s a self - serving attempt to avoid legal and political accountability and keep the American public in the dark about this whole shameful episode .
The Senate is set to vote on the FISA bill and the Bingaman Amendment this week .
Please call your Senators and ask them to call the President 's bluff by supporting the Bingaman Amendment and to vote against the unconstitutional FISA bill .
BRANDON , Man. -
Thirty - six passengers on a Greyhound bus watched in horror Wednesday night as a fellow passenger stabbed a man sleeping next to him , decapitated him and began waving around the man 's severed head .
The bus made an emergency stop , and passengers fled in terror onto the darkening Trans - Canada Highway near Portage la Prairie , Man. , while the bus 's driver and a driver of a nearby truck shut the crazed man inside the bus with the victim .
Passengers on the Winnipeg to Edmonton bus say they stood outside and watched through the window , horrified , as the man disfigured the victim 's body .
RCMP have confirmed they are investigating a homicide , although investigators wo n't provide further details about how a young man was stabbed to death and then decapitated .
" He did n't do anything to provoke the guy .
The guy just took a knife out and stabbed him , started stabbing him like crazy and cut his head off , " said Garnet Caton , 36 , a passenger .
" Some people were puking , some people were crying , other people were in shock . . . everybody was running , screaming off the bus .
" Greyhound spokesman Eric Wesley , speaking from Texas , said drivers are trained to get help as soon as they can when incidents occur .
" This is very rare , unique occurrence .
Bus transportation is one of the safest modes of transportation .
This is highly unique that something like this happened , " he said .
" Our drivers are trained to provide the safest travel for all our passengers , and every time an incident occurs they know to pull the bus over and call 911 .
" Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day , speaking in Quebec City , said the issue of safety on buses may need to be examined more closely once the legal process of this case is over .
"
We 're never closed to looking at how Canadians can be more safe and more secure , " Day told reporters in Quebec Thursday .
" This particular incident , as horrific as it is , is obviously extremely rare .
" Witnesses described a nightmarish scene inside the bus .
Caton and others said once they escaped the bus , they prevented the attacker from getting off by threatening him with makeshift weapons - a hammer and a metal bar .
" We were telling him , ' Stay put , stay put , stay there , do n't try to come out . '
He tried to get the bus working and the bus driver disabled the bus somehow in the back , I 'm not sure how he did it , and at that point , I think the police showed up , " he said , adding officers rushed them away .
Caton described the man who attacked the passenger as about six feet tall , 200 pounds , with a bald head and wearing sunglasses .
He seemed oblivious to others when the stabbing occurred , said Caton .
Caton said he was struck by how calm the man was .
He just walked up to the front of the bus and dropped the head , Caton said .
Caton said the victim boarded in Edmonton , was Aboriginal in appearance , was wearing hip - hop clothing and appeared to be around 20 years of age .
" When we saw the head , we knew he was dead , " he said .
" I do n't think the guy knew him at all .
I think he was really crazy . . . the poor guy , he did n't see it coming .
" Two yellow school buses were brought in to the closed - off stretch of highway for passengers to sit in while the standoff between officers and the man inside the bus proceeded for hours .
The passengers were later taken to Brandon , Man. , to be interviewed by police and to stay overnight at a hotel there .
Some will be resuming their trips later Thursday .
Crisis counsellors were also at the hotel to provide support to the passengers , and counsellors could be seen chatting with them outside the hotel as groups went out to local stores for snacks or to smoke cigarettes .
One small boy , who was with an adult man and woman , was given a plush teddy bear by a crisis health worker .
Another young man from Nova Scotia sat outside the Brandon hotel smoking around 3 a.m.
Visibly shaken , he said RCMP had taken 36 witnesses in for questioning into a detachment approximately 100 kilometres east .
" I felt bad that all the young people and old people had to see that , " he said .
The man , who did not want his name used , said the victim of the stabbing had been sleeping before the attack .
Other passengers said that the two men were sitting at the rear of the bus and the stabbing victim was listening to music through his headphones .
The men were both sitting in the back of the bus , and the attack appeared to be unprovoked .
" The first thing I heard was something like a terrible type ( of ) yowl and that was from the guy who got stabbed , " said an elderly woman on the bus , from Winnipeg .
The woman and her adult daughter said they were three or four rows in front of the suspect when the attack began .
" ( My daughter said ) ' Oh my God ' and everybody else started screaming , " she said .
" They had terror in their eyes .
" Passengers said there was a rush of people toward the front of the bus to get off .
Two other passengers on the bus , a 22 - year - old man and 21 - year - old woman from France , said they were heading to Winnipeg after visiting the woman 's father in Whitehorse .
The 22 - year - old man said in French that he saw a man holding a long knife repeatedly stab another passenger .
He and his girlfriend said they were shocked by the attack , and the isolation in the middle of the prairie when it occurred .
" There was nowhere to go , " she said .
Wesley said counselling will be provided and monetary compensation will be determined on an individual basis .
"
We are going to do whatever we need to provide the passengers with counselling or any other measures to make sure they 're taken care of , " he said Thursday .
He said there are security systems on the buses that enable drivers to contact the Greyhound operations office quickly .
He said officials from the company have been in talks with Transport Canada to review security measures on bus routes , but it could prove difficult .
" Well , the rural nature of our network does n't allow us to have airport - style security - does n't make it practical for us to do that .
We 're working with Transport Canada to review inner-city bus security , " Wesley said .
" We 're working with them to make things as safe as possible . "
A lawyer for David Woodman 's family voiced outrage yesterday after learning that two of the nine officers who were with the 22 - year - old Brookline man when he stopped breathing as he was being taken into custody during the Celtics championship celebration on June 18 had previously been disciplined , one for domestic violence and the other for a lack of judgment in dealing with a shooting suspect .
The prior complaints against the officers " could indicate they have anger management problems , " said Howard Friedman , who represents the parents of Woodman , a former Emmanuel College student who died in the hospital 11 days after his encounter with the officers .
Friedman said there are unanswered questions about who started the encounter with Woodman .
" We 're still in the dark , " Friedman said .
" But if one of these officers were involved or were the lead , that would be a sign of a more serious problem .
That would shed new light on the entire incident . "
Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis said that neither of the two officers initiated Woodman 's arrest , and that one had no physical contact with him , while the other helped push Woodman 's arm behind his back while he was resisting arrest .
" There was a violent resistance to an arrest , and the incident was over very , very quickly , " Davis said in a telephone interview .
He said yesterday that he asked Donald K. Stern , the former US attorney and now a lawyer in private practice , to review the circumstances around Woodman 's death .
The Woodmans have called on the FBI and US Attorney 's office to investigate their son's death .
Stern - who now works at Cooley , Godward , Kronish - was head of a panel that reviewed the death of Victoria Snelgrove , a 21 - year - old Emerson College student who died in 2004 during a Red Sox celebration after a police officer fired a pepper pellet that struck her in the eye .
" I 've worked very closely with Don Stern in the past , and I think he 's the perfect person to help with this situation , " Davis said , adding that Stern would " really make sure people are satisfied we are being completely transparent on this . "
Stern said last night that it is unlikely he would convene a commission as he did in the Snelgrove case , where the facts were more technical and complex .
That case involved a review of department weapons and crowd control tactics .
" This seems to me more manageable to get my arms around without forming a commission , " Stern said , adding that he will probably serve as an independent investigator and call on specialists to aid in the review .
Yesterday Boston police released the names of the eight officers and one sergeant involved in arresting Woodman , along with their department histories , in response to a request from the Globe under the Freedom of Information Act .
Speaking at the Lambeth conference , the chief rabbi , Jonathan Sacks , has said that almost all of the ills that plague modern society are caused by our lack of religion .
Since we stopped going to church we 've become a nation of fat , isolated , divorced , graceless and uncaring slobs who spend all our time online creating " ever smaller sects of the like - minded . "
Families are falling apart , loneliness is escalating and so on .
The ills that he identifies are all real , of course .
Obesity is becoming an epidemic , more people are complaining about depression and isolation and divorce is on the rise .
But is n't the same true of the US – with knobs on ?
And is n't the States supposed to be one of the most religious nations in the world , not to mention one of the most violent ?
I have a different explanation from the rabbi about the way that our society is developing .
I believe that some of the things that he complains about are not necessarily negative at all .
The rising divorce rate could simply be an acknowledgment that marriage does n't work for everyone .
It is only since we have been released from the shackles of religion that we have we been able to do anything about it .
In days of old , when religion ruled every aspect of our lives , divorce was not an option , except for the very rich .
And so millions ( mainly women ) endured lives of utter misery in marriages that verged on torture .
Obesity is a sign of our affluence , not of our atheism .
In deeply religious countries in the developing world there is little obesity .
But that has nothing to do with religion restraining people 's greed , it is to do with poverty and lack of opportunity .
Yes , new technology can be isolating , we know that , and a new publication by a government advisor suggests that we should be less materialistic and send fewer emails if we want to be happy .
But being less materialistic does n't necessarily mean we have to once more embrace the incredible claims of religion .
There are other ways to be philanthropic that do n't involve taking orders from priests .
Many non-believers work in hospitals , welfare services and voluntary groups .
They get a lot of personal satisfaction from such work that goes well beyond the ( usually miserly ) pay packet .
Yes , we need to make a real effort to take our eyes off the computer monitor and set them on to real people .
To do our communication face - to - face rather than through the keyboard .
There is something truly uplifting about a good conversation with someone we like , and in solving problems together in person .
Rabbi
Sacks thinks we should all troop back to church / synagogue and all the problems would be solved .
We would stop splitting into ever smaller interest groups , he says .
But then , he was talking to the Anglican Communion , so they would be able to understand precisely with what he 's saying .
Practice Violates Religious Freedom Of Academy 's Midshipmen
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
BALTIMORE – The American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Maryland are urging the U.S. Naval Academy to stop forcing midshipmen to participate in the Academy 's compulsory " noon meal prayers . "
In a letter sent May 2 to Vice Admiral Jeffrey L. Fowler on behalf of a group of midshipmen who object to the prayers , Deborah A. Jeon , Legal Director for the ACLU of Maryland , asked that the Academy discontinue its requirement that all midshipmen stand in attendance at the daily " noon meal prayer , " a practice that violates their religious freedom and rights of conscience .
In the letter , Jeon makes clear that the ACLU opposes compulsory religious services mandated by the government , not voluntary religious exercises by Academy midshipmen .
" Members of the military have a right to pray or not pray as they personally see fit , and that right is protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution .
It is one of the fundamental rights they put their lives on the line to defend in service to their country , " said Jeon .
" But the government should not be in the business of compelling religious observance , particularly in military academies , where students can feel coerced by senior students and officials and risk the loss of leadership opportunities for following their conscience . "
In its letter , the ACLU documents how first - year midshipmen find themselves in a difficult position if their conscience dictates that they do not join in prayer , because they are expected to adhere as strictly as possible to official practices and not " stand apart " as nonconformists .
" Members of the armed services should never be coerced to engage in religious exercises in violation of their conscience , " said Col. Mike Pheneger , U.S. Army ( ret. ) , a member of the ACLU 's Board of Directors .
" The Academy should ensure that midshipmen understand the requirements , expectations and core values of officers , but it should not prescribe or even recommend that religion is the medium for achieving them . "
For First Classmen , being forced to participate in compulsory prayers can be particularly problematic .
One midshipman told the ACLU that a squad leader who objects to the prayers is put in an unacceptable position of either violating his or her conscience or standing apart and setting a discordant example for subordinates .
" The military should be protecting rights of conscience , and not abusing those rights , " Pheneger said .
In response to complaints filed by several midshipmen , the Naval Academy earlier this year issued a document entitled , " FAQs about the USNA Noon Meal Prayer " that ignores the constitutional standards identified in a 2003 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit , which struck down as unconstitutional " supper prayers " at Virginia Military Institute ( VMI ) .
The Navy 's FAQs do not attempt to explain any legally significant difference between the Naval Academy 's noon meal prayer and VMI 's supper prayer .
As the court 's decision made clear , " While the First Amendment does not in any way prohibit [ cadets or midshipmen ] from praying before , during , or after [ meals ] , the Establishment Clause prohibits [ military academies ] from sponsoring such a religious activity . "
" The ACLU respects the important place religious faith holds among many in the military , and we have defended the fundamental right of religious communities , families , and individuals – including those in the armed services – to practice their faith freely and openly and without compulsion , " said Daniel Mach , Director of Litigation for the ACLU Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief .

The core group also includes Gregory B. Craig , a former top official in the Clinton State Department who served as the president ’s lawyer during his impeachment trial ; Richard J. Danzig , a Navy secretary in the Clinton administration ; Mark W. Lippert , Mr. Obama ’s former Senate foreign policy adviser , who just returned from a Navy tour of duty in Iraq ; and Mr. McDonough .
Mr. McDonough and Mr. Lippert are paid by the campaign and based in Chicago , and the rest are outside advisers who volunteer their time from Washington .
The group no longer includes Samantha Power , the Pulitzer Prize - winning Harvard human rights expert who resigned in March after she was quoted calling Mrs. Clinton a “ monster . ” But Mr. Lake still talks to Ms. Power , and Mr. Obama sent a long personal tribute that was read at her wedding in Ireland this month .
Mr. Obama ’s Republican rival , Senator John McCain of Arizona , has a far smaller and looser foreign policy advisory operation , about 75 people in all , and none are organized into teams .
In 2004 , the Democratic presidential nominee , Senator John Kerry , had a foreign policy structure similar in scale to Mr. Obama ’s , but it had limited influence on the candidate , who had spent 20 years in the Senate , former advisers said .
Mr. Obama is not yet receiving the government intelligence briefing that is typically made available to a presidential candidate upon becoming his party ’s nominee .
Mr. Obama ’s infrastructure funnels hundreds of e-mail messages and reams of position papers and talking points each day to members of the core group , who in turn seek advice or make requests for more information to team members down the line .
Dennis Ross , the Middle East envoy for Mr. Clinton and the first President Bush and a member of the Obama campaign ’s Middle East team , is frequently asked by Ms. Rice , Mr. Lake or Mr. McDonough for help on framing Mr. Obama ’s comments on Iran ’s nuclear program and its potential threat to Israel .
“ They ’ve asked for substantive help : ‘ Can I take a look at language on Iran ? ’ ” Mr. Ross said .
“ Or sometimes I ’ve been asked questions to explain the administration ’s approach on Iran . ” Mr. Ross participated in a conference call last week with Mr. Obama and other advisers to prepare for the senator ’s foreign trip , and he will travel with Mr. Obama in Israel and the West Bank city of Ramallah and at other stops .
Mr. Ross described Mr. Obama in the conference call as focused on “ drilling down ” into the issues on the trip .
Another person who has contributed outside advice is former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell , whom Mr. Obama has been wooing .
Mr. Powell , a Republican , has a friendship of decades with Mr. McCain , but friends say he has felt excluded from Mr. McCain ’s foreign policy operation and was impressed when Mr. Obama called on him in June .
Mr. Powell also met around the same time with Mr. McCain .
Verdict
The Acer Aspire One is n't the only 8.9 - inch mini-notebook on the block , but at $ 379 it's a pretty good bargain -- if you can live with short battery life .
However , prospective buyers may prefer the $ 399 Windows XP version , which sports a larger 120GB hard drive and 1GB of RAM , Others may prefer the longer endurance of the ASUS Eee PC 901's six - cell battery and its 1GB of RAM , although its $ 599 price and cramped keyboard will give some pause .
The 8.9 - inch HP 2133 Mini-Note PC has a sleeker , more durable design , but the Linux version is n't nearly as consumer - friendly as what Acer or ASUS offers .
In the ever - growing field of mini-notebooks the Aspire One is a decent buy for those on a tight budget looking for a secondary PC for getting online .
It 's a better deal than the more expensive 7 - inchEee PC 4G .
Acer Aspire one Performance
The Aspire One uses the same 1.6 - GHz Intel Atom processor as the Eee PC 901 , but it comes with a relatively small 512MB of RAM compared with the Eee PC's 1GB .
Additionally , the RAM on the system cannot be upgraded easily , since the RAM is secured to the motherboard .
Nevertheless , programs loaded relatively quickly even when we had several others running in the background .
( Keep in mind that we were testing the Linux version of the Aspire One . )
We were able to listen to music , surf the Web , and write a document in OpenOffice Writer all at the same time with no hang - ups .
The mini-notebook packs an 8 GB solid state drive , which helps boot the system in a quick 20 seconds .
However , despite the durability and speed of the SSD , we were disappointed by its limited 8 GB of storage space , of which only 6.4GB is available to the end user .
By comparison , the Linux version of the Eee PC 901 comes with a 20 GB SSD .
To its credit , Acer does include two card slots , both of which accept SDHC Cards .
Interestingly , when a card is slid into the dedicated SD Card slot , the computer treats it not as separate storage but as part of the hard drive .
During testing , the Aspire One got a bit hot on the underside of the unit on the left side ( toward the exhaust ) , measuring about 107 degrees .
The rest of the system felt only a little warm on our lap , however , with most other areas measuring 87 to 94 degrees .
Shorter Endurance , Good Wi-Fi
With its Intel Atom processor and a three - cell battery , we expected the Aspire one to last longer on a charge .
We managed to squeeze about 2 hours out of the battery with Wi -Fi on .
Because of its Linux operating system , we could not run any standard battery run-down tests , but with regular use , including surfing the Web , listening to music over Pandora , and word processing , the mini - notebook got 1 hour and 58 minutes of runtime .
You 'll want to keep the AC charger at arms ' length .
The Eee PC 901 delivered double the runtime with 4 hours and 38 minutes of battery life using a six - cell battery .
Acer will offer an optional six - cell battery upgrade , which should double the endurance .
The Aspire One's 802.11 b/g Wi-Fi radio connected easily to our WPA - protected access point .
It never dipped below 92 percent signal strength in a 50 - foot radius , and we experienced no dropped connections .
Web pages loaded quickly on our office network ; NYtimes.com loaded in 5 seconds , and Laptopmag.com in 8 seconds .
We also had no problem streaming video from Hulu.com ; Party of Five had minimal video pauses and audio skips .
Excellent Interface , Hard to Tweak
Similar to ASUS ' customized Xandros Linux , Acer hides its Linpus Lite operating system by organizing applications into four distinct sections : Connect , Work , Fun , and Files .
Under the Connect heading , you 'll find Firefox 2.014 ; an instant - messaging client that supports AIM , Google Talk , MSN Messenger , and Yahoo Messenger ; Skype ; and a few other Internet shortcuts .
Work contains the OpenOffice suite , Contacts , Calculator , Notes , and Calendar .
Fun houses the Media Master multimedia player , Photo Master picture manager , and a slew of causal games .
The Files section is home to the My Documents , My Music , My Pictures , My Videos , My Downloads , and My Files folders .
Though most of the essential programs come packaged with the system , adding applications is a challenge .
Acer hid both the Linux terminal and add / remove programs section , so novice users will have a nearly impossible time adding open source programs to the system .
We recommend the XP version of the Aspire One for those who want to run additional applications .
Decent Display and Speakers
The 8.9 - inch glossy display has a native resolution of 1024 x 600 .
The colorful desktop looked bright , and Web pages fit to size on the screen ( so you do n't have to scroll horizontally ) .
We were even able to keep a Web page and a document in OpenOffice open side by side .
While a clip from Saturday Night Live streamed from Hulu.com looked extremely clear and detailed , tilting the screen back 45 degrees caused a distracting glare .
The horizontal angles were better , but sharing the screen with another viewer to watch a YouTube clip was a struggle .
The integrated 0.3 - megapixel webcam worked when we initiated a video chat over Meebo , but our face looked a bit washed out .
The microphone , located to the left of the webcam , picked up a bit of background noise , but our caller could hear us quite well without having to speak up .
The speakers , located on the bottom of the system , produced a loud yet tinny sound ; we could hear Coldplay 's " Viva la Vida " from a 6 - foot distance , but we prefer the ASUS Eee PC 901's fuller , Dolby - powered speakers .
Mini-notebooks are getting bigger and more elaborate by the day , but Acer enters the crowded market with a simple yet solid miniature laptop for only $ 379 .
The Aspire One sports a classic look and its Intel Atom processor gives it a decent amount of power for surfing the Web and light multimedia use .
Taking a cue from ASUS ' well - received custom Linux interface , Acer packages the system with a lightweight , customized Linpus Lite Linux operating system .
We just wish this netbook lasted longer on a charge .
Check out our hands - on video of the Acer Aspire one here
Sleek , Small Design
The pearl white Aspire One ( also available in navy blue , pink , and black ) looks far from cheap .
Similar to theASUS Eee PC 901 , the Aspire One 's white lid sports a glossy finish that is resistant to fingerprint smudges .
Though it 's a small design addition , the neon orange plated hinge adds a little pizzazz to the overall look .
Compared with other 8.9 - inch systems , such as the Eee PC 901 ( $ 599 ) and HP 2133 Mini-Note PC ( $ 729 ) , the Aspire One is both slimmer and lighter .
Measuring 9.8 x 6.7 x 1.1 inches and weighing just 2.2 pounds - - 4 ounces lighter than the Eee PC 901-- the Aspire One 's portability alone makes it compelling .
With its included pleather sleeve , the system was perfect for tossing into a shoulder bag or slim briefcase .
It 's only 3 pounds with the AC adapter .
Decent Typing Experience , Cramped Touchpad
The keyboard , 89 percent of full size , is a shade smaller than those on the HP Mini-Note and the MSI Wind , but it is big enough for comfortable touch typing .
It 's certainly bigger and more firm than that of the ASUS Eee PC 900/901 ; it had no bend or flex to it .
The keys were quite responsive and offered nice tactile feedback .
Measuring 2.5 x 1.2 inches , the trackpad on the Aspire One is disappointingly small and vertically very narrow .
The result is a lot of back - tracking .
Similar to the trackpad on the HP Mini-Note , it is vertically straddled with the right and left mouse buttons , forcing us to use both hands to access the buttons .
The Aspire One is well equipped with ports ; VGA , three USB , Ethernet , headphone , and microphone jacks surround the system .
Acer includes both a 5 - in - 1 card reader ( for transferring photos , music , and other files ) and an additional SD Card slot so you can expand the measly 8 GB of storage capacity on the system .
When The Ranger was young he enjoyed greatly the diverting summer sport of tossing hapless invertebrates into spiders ’ webs and seeing the ensuing fight .
Even today I ’m not above the odd experiment , just to see what happens .
Of course , we all know what ’s likely to happen .
That ’s why it ’s such fun .
But putting flies in webs is relatively easy compared to watching the more peripatetic spiders making a kill .
It was nearly twenty years , for example , before I got to see the bizarre spitting spider , Scytodes , in action .
It ’s not surprising , then , that when spiders make an appearance on a nature documentary , it ’s often these hunters tracking down their prey that feature – fast , spectacular action .
That ’s what we want to see , and of course the spiders are more than happy to deliver .
Take this clip from an American National Geographic documentary :
What a dramatic adventure !
Was there ever any doubt of the result ?
Well , if you believe the commentary , possibly there was .
Watching this film put me in mind of an interesting contrast that I have often noticed between natural history films intended for the US market , and those intended for the British ( Sorry , but other English - speaking nations will have to chip in on the comments , I ’ve never watched any others ) .
There was a time when those kind folk at Warner Brothers gave a series of US DVD prizes for The Ranger to give out to lucky competition winners .
Many of these were BBC films , and of course , I watched them first , and was amazed by how very different US wildlife films are – even when made by the BBC .
Now , US readers are probably wondering what on earth I mean .
So , for comparison , here is Sir David Attenborough narrating a comparable clip from the BBC production Life in the Undergrowth :
More - or - less the same story – but what a different presentation .
It ’s a wholly different style , calculated very much for education rather than entertainment .
Now , as it happens , both BBC and National Geographic clips are highly educational and entertaining , but it ’s instructive to see how they place their emphasis .
The NG clip emphasises the drama of the process , with prominent music building to a crescendo – taking a short diversion into eerie alien sounds when close - ups of the spider ’s eyes are shown .
The chuckling commentary is unashamedly anthropomorphic , aiming to make the audience identify with the protagonists and feel the action for themselves .
“ The jumping spider packs a ton of skulking pouncing killing fire - power in its tiny body . ”
“ If this were a slasher film , the audience would be screaming , ‘ Look out behind you ! ' ”
“ How ’d you like to stare into these eyes , with your life on the line ?
Ha ! Yikes ! ”
Compare that with Attenborough ’s quiet , almost abstract delivery :
“ A white crab spider sits , almost invisible , on a white flower , waiting in ambush .
And it catches a bee . ” “ … ultra - violet markings on some flowers serve to guide insects to nectar . ”
“ Honey - bees seem more likely to visit flowers with crab spiders on them than those without . ”
The music , such as it is , is almost imperceptible .
The quiet buzzing of the insects mostly drowns it out .
And even the flowers are apparently real flowers in a real field , as opposed to the quite obviously artificial scenario in the NG clip .
And yet both clips were superbly photographed , both accurately explained some quite complex information , and both clearly provided good entertainment to their viewers .
So why are they so different ?
It seems as though the difference lies in the vehicle which the programme - makers choose to deliver their message .
In the case of Attenborough , both presenter and writer , he uses a simple scientific process in this clip : he makes observations , he forms a hypothesis .
He does n’t even present his conclusion as fact , saying only “ Honey - bees seem more likely to visit… ” .
For Attenborough , the drama of the on - screen struggle speaks for itself .
This is often the approach he takes , and BBC natural history films almost invariably follow this pattern , or at least this style .
The NG film , by contrast , sets out to deliver a short , Hollywood - style set piece , as might be seen at the start of a James Bond film .
Whether you understand what a retina is or not , you ’ll enjoy this fast - paced action , with camera work that borrows heavily from the human world of movie - making .
As well as the narrator ’s jocular style , the long approach of the bee in flight ; the view of the bee through the petals ; the slow - motion jump of the spider – all are calculated to draw the viewer into the unfolding scene using visual cues that will be familiar and well - understood .
To my British eyes , this American clip seems almost patronising and childish in its presentation .
And yet the content is little different ; the difference is purely stylistic .
It represents another interesting cultural difference across the Atlantic .
And of course , I am forced to wonder , what do viewers in the US and elsewhere think of the BBC ’s Attenborough style of natural history presentation ?
Do they find these scholarly discourses dull and dusty ?
Do they long for the commentator to chuckle in an avuncular manner or say “ Whooa ! ” ?
Perhaps readers from outside the UK can enlighten us .
Hillary Clinton sat down with Bill O'Reilly yesterday because she apparently feels no compunction about encouraging him .
The result was a reasonably reasonable interview , especially for Bill — which is not entirely surprising , as he usually saves his bullying for people who are easily bullied .
He called her a socialist , yes , and then he called Teddy Roosevelt a socialist as well .
At the end of the interview ( which continues today ) O'Reilly tried to goad Hillary into trashing NBC news .
It might 've worked !
Bill hates MSNBC because their Keith Olbermann subjects him to the sort of personal abuse that Bill specializes in .
Hillary hates MSNBC because their Chris Matthews compulsively says terrible sexist things about her .
Sadly , Clinton backed down from the fight .
Later today , they 're gonna talk waterboarding !

When it comes to thinking and working internationally , scientists do n't always do as well as other professions .
Scientists trained in the developing world often relocate to the US , Europe or other industrialized nations , taking with them their expertise .
The New York Academy of Sciences is determined to do something to help less - well - off nations strengthen their scientific institutions and development , and it's harnessing the internet to make it happen , through a site called Scientists without Borders .
The rise of social networking has been one of the major influences of what some people call web 2.0 .
Instead of being passive readers , users of sites interact with each other , form relationships , collaborate , and generally make productive use of the wonderful things that modern telecommunications technology makes possible .
A great example of this would be Facebook or Linked In , sites where users can connect with old friends or like - minded individuals for social or professional reasons .
Scientists Without Borders might best be thought of as similar to LinkedIn ; it 's a professional networking site , not somewhere to congratulate your bro for drinking that 49th shot of jaeger , but in some ways it also incorporates ideas from sites like Donors Choose .
Individual scientists , projects , or organizations can post profiles detailing the skills they can either offer or are looking for .
The site can identify related entries , and obviously there is a search function .
So , if you 're looking for an editor for a project ongoing in Ghana ( for example ) , Scientists without Borders might help you connect with someone who is nearby , or willing to travel .
The focus is firmly on the developing world , with the aim of creating a more joined - up , interconnected scientific community across the globe .
The site only went live yesterday , so browsing through it right now essentially gives a flavor of what they expect to accomplish .
As more users sign up and participate , the database of available and needed skills will become more and more useful .
It 's certainly a laudable goal .
I was a participant at AAAS 's Science and Technology Policy Forum last week in the nation 's capitol ( look for coverage coming soon at Nobel Intent ) and one theme that was repeated by several speakers was the need for much better global action by the scientific community to address the mounting problems we 'll all be facing in the coming decades ( climate change , resource shortages , overpopulation and so on ) .
The Millennium Development Goals , a list of 8 important goals identified by 189 nations in 2000 , are supposed to be met by 2015 , a mere 7 years away , and success in those goals will have a huge impact in increasing the quality of life on the planet for the bulk of the world 's population .
Not meeting them , on the other hand , will mean a more overcrowded planet where people fight each other for access to basic resources .
The scientific community in theory ought to be working for the greater global community as a whole .
An effort such as Scientists without Borders could be an important step in helping science make a difference for all the nations on the planet , not just the rich ones .
I was n’t going to participate in the ICFP 2008 programming contest this year because I was at a workshop .
However , this contest problem was flexible enough that one could create a reasonable entry in a few hours .
Therefore , after the workshop , I woke up very early Monday morning ( due to jet lag ) and started writing a parser for the rover protocol .
Soon I was able to parse the entire protocol , and , by always sending the acceleration command , I had a rover that was off and running and bouncing into walls .
The next task was to implement turning .
The most straightforward approach would be to always head towards the home base .
At first I had some bugs due to not handling working with angles modulo 360° properly .
I fixed this by the natural approach of using ( unit ) vectors for everything until the very end when I use atan2 to decide if I should turn left or right .
Even that probably ought to be removed and done directly with outer and inner products .
So I submitted this program , left the hotel , and thought about how to avoid boulders and craters while waiting for my train .
I remembered a very simple method of guiding objects around by using potential functions .
By placing a potential function throughout the world , one can try follow the gradient decent to try to get to one ’s goal .
High potentials can be placed around obstacles to avoid them .
This method seemed simple enough to implement on the train from Pregarten to Munich .
Automatic Differentiation makes finding the gradient a snap , if you know how to use the library .
gradient :: (( Dif a 1 , Dif a ) -> Dif b ) -> ( a1 , a ) -> ( b , b ) gradient well ( x , y ) = ( dx , dy ) where dx = deriv ( \x -> well ( x , dCon y ) ) x dy = deriv ( \y -> well ( dCon x , y ) ) y
The above Haskell code finds the gradient of a potential function , well , at the point ( x , y ) simply by computing the partial derivatives .
In the end , I used a simple linear potential pulling the rover to the home base , and then added repelling wells from boulders and craters based on the inverse distance squared to the rim and the radius cubed of the hazard .
Martians were ignored .
The gradient gave a desired velocity .
Then I turned , braked , or accelerated to try to bring my current velocity closer to my desired velocity .
That was all there was to my navigation .
With some more thought , I think I could come up with more reasonable potentials .
At the moment the units of my potential do n’t make any sense .
However , if I had more time , I would have used a different method of hazard avoidance all together .
In the end , what I submitted seemed fairly reasonable .
It sometimes avoids craters , especially the big ones .
It sometimes even manages to make it to the homebase , all in less than 200 lines of Haskell and in less than one day .

A view of the ground underneath NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander adds to evidence that descent thrusters dispersed overlying soil and exposed a harder substrate that may be ice .
The image received Friday night from the spacecraft 's Robotic Arm Camera shows patches of smooth and level surfaces beneath the thrusters .
" This suggests we have an ice table under a thin layer of loose soil , " said the lead scientist for the Robotic Arm Camera , Horst Uwe Keller of Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research , Katlenburg - Lindau , Germany .
"
We were expecting to find ice within two to six inches of the surface , " said Peter Smith of the University of Arizona , Tucson , principal investigator for Phoenix .
" The thrusters have excavated two to six inches and , sure enough , we see something that looks like ice .
It 's not impossible that it 's something else , but our leading interpretation is ice .
" The Phoenix mission is led by Smith at the University of Arizona with project management by NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , and development partnership at Lockheed Martin , Denver .

An unprecedented internet campaign waged on the frontline and in the US is exposing the real risks for troops in Iraq .
Paul Harris and Jonathan Franklin report on rising fears that the conflict is now a desert Vietnam
Susan Schuman is angry .
Her GI son is serving in the Iraqi town of Samarra , at the heart of the ' Sunni triangle ' , where American troops are killed with grim regularity .
Breaking the traditional silence of military families during time of war , Schuman knows what she wants - and who she blames for the danger to her son , Justin .
' I want them to bring our troops home .
I am appalled at Bush 's policies .
He has got us into a terrible mess , ' she said .
Schuman may just be the tip of an iceberg .
She lives in Shelburne Falls , a small town in Massachusetts , and says all her neighbours support her view .
' I do n't know anyone around here who disagrees with me , ' she said .
Schuman 's views are part of a growing unease back home at the rising casualty rate in Iraq , a concern coupled with deep anger at President George W. Bush 's plans to cut army benefits for many soldiers .
Criticism is also coming directly from soldiers risking their lives under the guns of Saddam Hussein 's fighters , and they are using a weapon not available to troops in previous wars : the internet .
Through emails and chatrooms a picture is emerging of day - to - day gripes , coupled with ferocious criticism of the way the war has been handled .
They paint a vivid picture of US army life that is a world away from the sanitised official version .
In a message posted on a website last week , one soldier was brutally frank .
' Somewhere down the line , we became an occupation force in [ Iraqi ] eyes .
We do n't feel like heroes any more , ' said Private Isaac Kindblade of the 671st Engineer Company .
Kindblade said morale was poor , and he attacked the leadership back home .
' The rules of engagement are crippling .
We are outnumbered .
We are exhausted .
We are in over our heads .
The President says , " Bring 'em on . "
The generals say we do n't need more troops .
Well , they 're not over here , ' he wrote .
One of the main outlets for the soldiers ' complaints has been a website run by outspoken former soldier David Hackworth , who was the army 's youngest colonel in the Vietnam war and one of its most decorated warriors .
He receives almost 500 emails a day , many of them from soldiers serving in Iraq .
They have sounded off about everything from bad treatment at the hands of their officers to fears that their equipment is faulty .
The army - issue gas mask ' leaks under the chin .
This same mask was used during Desert Storm , which accounts for part of the health problems of the vets who fought there .
My unit has again deployed to the Gulf with this loser , ' ranted one army doctor .
Some veterans have begun to form organisations to campaign to bring the soldiers home and highlight their difficult conditions .
Erik Gustafson , a veteran of the 1991 Gulf war , has founded Veterans For Common Sense .
' There is an anger boiling under the surface now , and I , as a veteran , have a duty to speak because I am no longer subject to military discipline , ' he said .
A recent email from Iraq passed to Gustafson , signed by ' the Soldiers of the 2nd Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division ' , said simply : ' Our men and women deserve to see their loved ones again and deserve to come home .
Thank you for your attention .'
Another source of anger is government plans to reverse recent increases in ' imminent danger ' pay and a family separation allowance .
These moves have provoked several furious editorials in the Army Times , the normally conservative military newspaper .
The paper said the planned cuts made ' the Bush administration seem mean - spirited and hypocritical ' .
Tobias Naegele , its editor - in - chief , said his senior staff agonised over the decision to attack the government , but the response to the editorials from ordinary soldiers was overwhelmingly positive .
A further critical editorial is planned for this week .
' We do n't think lightly of criticising our Commander - in - Chief , ' Naegele said ' The army has had a rough couple of years with this administration . '
Mainstream veterans ' groups too are angry about cuts being proposed at a time when politicians have heaped praise on the army 's performance in Afghanistan and Iraq and want to launch a recruitment drive .
Veterans plan protests to highlight the issue .
' We are going to show them that veterans are people who know how to vote , ' said Steven Robinson , a veteran and executive director of the National Gulf War Resource Centre , one of the websites where veterans ' issues are raised .
Susan Schuman too is planning a protest .
This week she plans to join members of a new group , Military Families Speak Out , who will travel to Washington to make their case for their sons , daughters , husbands and wives , to be brought home from Iraq .
With soldiers dying there almost daily , comparisons have already been drawn with the Vietnam war and the birth of the protest movements there that divided America in the Sixties and Seventies .
Political scientists , however , think the war will have to get much worse before anything similar happens over Iraq .
' To put it crudely , I think the country can accept this current level of casualties , ' said Professor Richard Stoll , of Rice University in Houston , Texas .
That is little comfort to Schuman , who says she just wants to see her son , Justin , return alive from a war she believes is unjust .
' It is a quagmire and it is not going to be easy to get out , ' she said .
' That 's where the parallel with Vietnam is . '
The next day were ' up and at it early .
It only starts feeling like a trip to me if the day starts with me waking up on the ground somewhere next to my bike .
The day starts out with no plan to reach any place in particular .
Let me explain .
The route we are planning on following is the source of most of my concerns .
It goes through a wilderness area where we need to be self sufficient in all respects .
Depending on terrain , we expect it to take 4 - 6 days to reach civilisation again .
This presents 4 problems .
1 - Fuel .
We would have to carry a full tank plus an extra 30l each .
That 's a shitload of weight and space .
One solution would be to take a backup vehicle .
None of us were keen on that idea though .
It is after all a BIKE trip .2 - Food .
We would have to carry enough food for a week .
This is not too difficult .
Generally one can survive comfortably on a tin of canned food a day .
So each rider just have to carry 6 or so tins of bully beef or chilli sardines ( for the gourmets ) or whatever tickles your fancy .
3 - Water .
This is a bigger problem .
Riding would require you to have at least 4 - 5 litres of water per person per day .
There 's just no way you can carry that on top of the fuel load .
And fuel gets preference .
And when you are short of water things can turn very unpleasant .
What we do is each rider carries 5l of water .
That 's enough for one day or maybe even two if the riding is easy .
Our route will take us to the mouth of the Kunene river where we can stock up on river water .
We figure we could reach the river mouth ( Foz do Cunene ) at the end of day two .
( We were wrong of course , it took us 4 days . ) 4 - Medical emergency .
There is always a possibility of getting hurt on any trip .
Here however , help was going to be far far away .
We were able to obtain a couple of ampules of Pethadine for that crushed - pelvis - with - bones - protruding situation .
We also hoped to be able to secure a satelite phone , this however did n't happen .
So if you were not able to ride out , you were going to have to wait at least 5 days for someone to come get you .
I do n't deal well with pain .
So that 's why we are n't going anywhere in particular .
With all the beer drinking yesterday we know we have no chance of reaching Foz do Cunene by nightfall .
So we are just going to ride to where we get to .
The morning ride is excellent , varying from splendid sightseeing to some more challenging stuff .
We meet some locals along the way .
They have good looking cattle .
But the people are even better looking .
This girl is bringing the cattle to drink .
We take a break here and try the water but our stomachs would never make it .
We have some lively discussion regarding where we are going to sleep .
There is a road ( I use the term loosely ) heading down to the Kunene river .
There is also a track leading from the river which intersects the road we are on some ways further .
It would be good to sleep at the river and it would n't hurt filling up our water supplies .
On the other hand , the track leading from the river has this warning on it .
If we can follow this track we wo n't have a problem .
If we can't and have to backtrack , we may run out of fuel before we get to Tombwa ( civilisation ) .
Why do we believe that we may be able to follow this track ?
Next installment will explain all .
DENVER 
Under increasing public pressure over its decision to temporarily halt all new solar development on public land , the Bureau of Land Management said Wednesday that it was lifting the freeze , barely a month after it was put into effect .
The bureau had announced on May 29 that it was no longer processing new applications to build solar power plants on land it oversees in six Western states after federal officials said they needed first to study the environmental effects of solar energy , a process that would take two years .
But amid concerns from the solar power industry , members of Congress and the general public that the freeze would stymie solar development during a particularly critical time for energy policy , the bureau abruptly reconsidered .
“ We heard the concerns expressed during the scoping period about waiting to consider new applications , and we are taking action , ” the bureau ’s director , James Caswell , said in a statement .
“ By continuing to accept and process new applications for solar energy projects , we will aggressively help meet growing interest in renewable energy sources , while ensuring environmental protections . ”
( William Seidman is the former chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp. , the agency Congress set up in the 1980s to clean up the savings - and - loan lending mess .
He ’s also a former chairman of the FDIC .
He spoke with Reuters this week on the housing rescue plan taking shape in Congress and on the state of banking in the United States . )

How important is this Senate housing rescue plan ?
The Senate plan will certainly be some help .
It will take a part of the problem in the financial system and perhaps cure 25 percent of it .
It is n’t an answer to all the problems we have .
Were you expecting to see a lot more , at least coming from Washington ?
I think it ’s as much as they can do with the subprime mortgage issue .
The real job will be to get the financial system back on its feet and that ’s going to be largely a private sector exercise , I think , with a substantial number of bank failures .
Where are we on that curve now ?
Generally banks start to fail about a year after the events which cause the trouble .
We ’re probably about seven or eight months down that year .
So before the end of the year , we ’ll probably see a number of bank failures , particularly in Florida , Texas , California , Nevada , where the housing boom was .
So these are local or regional banks attached to the local residential or commercial markets ?
Exactly
Compare what ’s happening now and what you saw in the S&Ls crisis in the 1980s .
What ’s happening now has only one thing in common with what happened back then and that ’s loans not being repaid .
The problem with the S&Ls is that loans were in the failed banking and S&L institutions .
They were not securitized and passed on all over the world the way they are in the present problem .
What we had then was more easily handled because we had our hands on all the bad loans .
Could there be more bank failures now than there were in the 80s ?
Nowhere near .
In the 80s , with the S&Ls , we had somewhere over 15,000 institutions fail .
I do n’t think we ’re going to see anything like that in this case because most of these bad loans were securitized and sold outside of the banking system .
For the banks that are in trouble , some of them bought these securitizations and some were financing the housing bubble .
Is there more Washington or the Fed should do ?
The Fed has got to get themselves out of the business of loaning on second - class security and get themselves out of the position where they ’re creating money through making these loans that they may not want to do because of inflation .
The Fed ’s assignment is to get themselves out of this as quickly as possible .
The FHA ’s assignment ( Federal Housing Administration ) is to refinance all the loans that they can get the lenders as securitizers to bring in and make a one - by - one private deal with them .
The FDIC ’s job is to go out and make sure that all the banks that are in a failing position are closed and are liquidated .
There are a lot of parts of the government that have to work on this to clean things up .
The signs are they ’re getting to it ?
The signs are that they are starting to get to it .
The Fed is starting to figure out what to do with this huge amount of lending that it ’s done .
The FHA legislation has not even been agreed upon in the Senate yet .
The FDIC is just in the process of looking at all the banks and deciding which ones will need to be closed .
Finally , I think there are a lot more loans that are going to go bad and that have not yet reached the foreclosure stage ...
I do n’t think we ’ve seen as much of the trouble in the home mortgage area yet as we ’re going to see .
I do n’t think we ’re even half way through that .
What are some of the milestones that will show we ’re turning the corner or are starting to turn the corner ?
You have to look at how many home mortgages have been refinanced .
You have to look at how many banks have been closed .
You have to look at whether the securitization market has opened up again .
It ’s totally closed now .
You have to see when the financial system starts working again .
It is really not working now , or great and large parts of it are not working .

GENEVA ( Reuters ) - Drought in Ethiopia has caused food shortages , killed livestock and more than doubled the number of people needing urgent humanitarian aid to 5 million , the United Nations said on Friday .
“ Seasonal rains have been poor or have failed in many parts of Ethiopia with dramatic effects on harvests in crop- producing areas , ” said Elisabeth Byrs , a spokeswoman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs .
The United Nations is seeking $ 325 million to provide nearly 400,000 tonnes of food aid as well as health and other assistance through November to people in Ethiopia ’s hard - hit south and southeastern regions , which border Somalia and Kenya .
Some 4.6 million people are now in need of assistance , compared to 2.2 million before the drought took hold , Byrs said .
As many as 75,000 children are already suffering from acute malnutrition and illness as a result of the drought , which the United Nations said has compounded pressure on poor Ethiopians squeezed by an increase in the global prices of cereals and other foods .
Nanosolar HQ ( TGW ) – Nanosolar unveiled Wednesday its thin film coater that it says can coat 1 gigawatt worth of solar cells a year , the solar industry ’s largest coater .

The tool , which cost $ 1.65 million , can ink 100 feet of solar cells a minute .
The ink used is Nanosolar ’s trademark nanoparticle ink .
The machine delivers solar cell with efficiencies of up 14.5 % efficiency .
Company CEO
Martin Roscheisen said the speed can be increased to up to 2000 feet per minute .
“ At the 100 feet - per - minute speed shown in the video , that ’s an astonishing two orders of magnitude more capital efficient than a high - vacuum process : a twenty times slower high - vacuum tool would have cost about ten times as much per tool , ” he also said , in a press release .

Some of my earliest TV memories were of watching Jeopardy with my mother .
The current incarnation of show is 24 this year , and I ’m 34 , and I actually remember the media blitz when they launched the new , Alex Trebek - hosted version .
This is because at the age of 10 I was susceptible to advertising - driven excitement over corporate products , but also because I was , and remain to this day , a nerd .
I love trivia .
I do n’t necessarily mean that I seek out trivia - themed competition — though I ’m always up for Trivial Pursuit , I was never in Quiz Bowl or did bar trivia night .
No , I mean that I enjoy learning trivial information for its own sake .
I read Wikipedia for fun .
I tell “ interesting anecdotes ” about long - dead kings that have caused the occasional eye to glaze over .
Pretty much from the beginning , people told me “ You should be on Jeopardy ! ” I believe I actually sent in a 3 x 5 card one year in an attempt to get into the teen tournament ; I never heard back .
As I grew into adulthood , I stopped watching the show on any sort of regular basis , but it was always in the back of my mind — if I were ever going to do any kind of game show , that would be the one .
And this year , it actually happened .
There seems to be some kind of rule that if you go on Jeopardy , you write about it on the Internet — I found plenty of narratives as I was preparing to be on the show — so here ’s my contribution .
Getting on
As was the case for most things in this life that I ’ve done that have been impressive , it was my wife Amber who convinced me to actually do something about it .
A little research showed that the first stage of the tryouts is now online .
You sign up to be contacted when the test is given , and you wait for what seems like an eternity , and then Sony Pictures ( the show ’s ultimate corporate parent ) e-mails you a precise time when you need to log on to their site for the test .
For me , this was in February of 2007 .
It consisted of 50 short trivia questions , which you have something like 15 seconds apiece to answer ( and no , you do n’t have to do it in the form of a question ) .
I was pretty pleased at how that test went —
I felt like I knew the bulk of the answers for certain and had reasonable guesses for most of the rest .
You also tell them where you ’d be willing to travel to to try out in person ( I said Philly and DC ) and then you wait some more .
Three months later , I was headed to the Mayflower Hotel in DC for the tryout .
In the interim , of course , I had been scouring the Internets for information about what to expect , and what I should be doing to prepare .
Apparently ( so went the consensus ) passing the trivia test essentially told them that you were smart enough ( or at least trivia - addled enough ) to make a good showing in that regard .
What they wanted to see at the tryout was how telegenic you were .
Do you speak up and make eye contact with your fellow human beings , or do you mumble into your shoulder ?
I am embarrassed to admit that on the train down to Washington , I was feeling kind of smug about my chances .
I imagined that my competitors would all be borderline Aspergers cases , while I would wow them with my good looks and social graces .
In fact , everyone else in my tryout group — there were about twenty , and we were the third group of the day — was funny , personable , attractive , and , of course , terrifyingly smart .
This obviously made me nervous , but it was still a fun event .
Jeopardy ’s team of contestant wranglers , led by Maggie and Robert , are really great — funny and nice and warm .
And why would n’t they be ?
They have a great job .
They put us through our paces , playing a fake game , doing a fake interview - with - Alex segment ( “ Tell us what you ’d do with the money … not anything boring ! ” ) , and generally assessing our TV - worthiness .
We also had to take another written trivia test ( the logic being that you could have had all of your smart friends in the room with you when you took the online version ) , which I felt pretty much the same about as I did the online test .
Then they staple your paperwork to a Polaroid of you and bid you good luck .
I was in the pool for the next 18 months , and if I had n’t heard from them in a year , I could sign up to take the online test again .
Do n’t call us , we ’ll call you .
I headed back to the Baltimore not sure how to feel — I thought I had done well , but I did n’t feel like I was an incredible standout .
I knew that they had hundreds of other potentials from around the country .
I knew that one of the other people at my DC tryout was there for his second go - round .
I hoped I ’d get on , but at some level I did n’t think it would happen , and as the months went on , I resigned myself to signing up against next year .
Then , in March , I got The Call .
It ’s really happening !
Maggie was very calm on the phone ( which may have been the only time I heard her calm ) .
“ We just want to make sure this information we have is still correct , ” she said , and I sort of half - thought they were just keeping their files up to date .
But at the end , she very casually said , “ So , we want you to come out to Los Angeles to film Jeopardy on April 22 . ”
This was barely a month away !
Fortunately , my wife was able to take time off of work .
We made arrangements to fly to LA ( frequent flier miles , huzzah ! ) and decided to make a little mini-vacation out of it , staying with friends for all except the two nights just before filming , when we booked rooms in the hotel just up the street from the studio .
I ’m given to understand that back in the day , they paid for your travel and accommodations ; now , it ’s up to you to arrange all that , but , instead of a year ’s supply of TurtleWax or a vacation to somewhere you do n’t want to go , the third place winner gets $ 1,000 and the second place $ 2,000 , which ought to cover your trip .
( UPDATE : Since writing this , I ’ve spoken to a couple of people who were on the show in the days before cash prizes for losers , and have learned that they never paid for you go out to LA .
So huzzah for rule changes ! )
Before I left , though , I did two very important things .
I started watching the show every night , using a click pen as a buzzer substitute .
And I hashed out Final Jeopardy betting strategies with my good friend and faithful reader Zipper the Mule .
She ’s both a gambler and math whiz , and she guided me through the rather confusing set of rules about how much you should bet if you really want to win , and printed up a cheat sheet for me .
I was pretty sure I had it down .
Spending time in LA with Amber and our friends for a few days was actually kind of relaxing — it distracted me a little bit and stopped me from getting too worked up .
I knew also that taking a mysterious vacation would arouse suspicions in my readers , so I took my laptop and blogged from the road , so none of you were the wiser !
On Monday night , we checked into the Radisson in not - so - scenic Culver City ; Tuesday morning , it was on .
What it ’s like
OK , this is the part where I stop with all this personal reminiscing and get on with it and tell you what it ’s like to be on the show already .
The packet I got from the Jeopardy staff said that I needed to bring three changes of clothes ( nice clothes — they used the phrase “ these are the sort of upscale looks we ’re looking for ” ) , and that I should be prepared to be at the studio both Tuesday and Wednesday .
Contestants have to be at the studio at 8 am sharp , but your guests ca n’t arrive until 10:30 , so they run a courtesy shuttle from the hotel .
You might think that this would be a hotbed of mutual animosity , seeing as we would soon be going head - to - head for serious cash money , but in fact everyone was very cheerful and friendly , and , as you might imagine , we all had certain qualities in common .
Once we arrived and it was determined that none of us were trying to sneak a gun onto the set , we hung out in the green room for most of the morning , going through the legal paperwork , learning about how to do our dreadful “ Hometown Howdy ” ( the promo you need to film for your local media market ) , and finding out about the various rules and quirks to the game .
( For instance : in the first round , you ’re allowed one instance of forgetting to respond in the form of the question , and in Final Jeopardy , you can misspell your answer as long as you do so phonetically . )
Then you ’re led onto the set , which is an amazing experience in and of itself .
My grandfather had seen the Price Is Right filmed once , and every time that show came on TV , he had to mention how small the set was in real life ; I now understand why , because it does seem ludicrously cramped compared to how you imagine it .
They take you on a little tour , introduce you to the golden voiced Johnny Gilbert , and then let you play a mock game , or part of one , against your opponents .
This is when I finally encountered the thing I had been dreading all this time : the buzzer .
That damn buzzer
You know how sometimes you ’re watching the show at home , and one of the contestants just never seems to ring in , and you think , “ Gee , they ’re not so smart , how ’d they get on this show ? ”
I will pretty much guarantee you that they ’re having problems with the buzzer .
Buzzing in is not just a matter of being fast ( which is just as well , as I would n’t have done well with that either ) .
The clues are very easy to read from where you stand behind the podium , so you ’re probably going to finish reading in your head it before Alex ’s mellifluous voice gets even halfway through it .
But you ca n’t just buzz in and interrupt him ; that would be rude !
And if you tried , nothing would happen .
There ’s a real live person sitting at the judge ’s table , and he or she throws a switch that activates your buzzer once Alex is done talking .
This also turns on a set of lights on either side of the board , which you ca n’t see at home ; that ’s your cue to buzz in , though some people on the Internet advise just listening for the last word in the clue instead .
If you buzz in too early , you ’re blocked out for a half - second or so , which is invariable enough time for someone to beat you to it .
You ’re supposed to pump the buzzer repeatedly rather than just pressing and holding it .
The whole thing just made me anxious .
The practice game does n’t last all that long — as they tell you in advance , they only leave you in long enough to get a hang of it , then give someone else a chance — and I thought I did OK , but not great .
Then it was back to the green room ( note : not actually green ) for makeup and a last - minute pep talk , and then back to the set .
It was nearly 11 and the filming was about to begin .
This … is … Jeopardy !
At no point during any of this , by the way , are you laughing it up with Alex Trebek .
In fact , the man is nowhere to be seen .
This is no doubt because they have to make sure that there ’s no hint of partiality from him .
In fact , other than the people who are specifically delegated for the care and feeding of contestants , they do n’t want you having contact with anyone .
If you have to leave the set to go to the bathroom , someone goes with you .
Even though your guests are sitting only a few feet away from you , you ’re not allowed to wave at them ( a rule I broke when I saw my wife , and was gently admonished over ) .
Anyway , all the contestants arrived on the set , and two names ( neither of them mine ) were drawn at random to face the returning challenger , who had been keeping a low profile .
( Because she had filmed her earlier show some weeks before , her return trip was paid for . )
Alex only emerged onto the set — from a hidden door behind part of the big board , which no doubt leads back to his Fortress of Alextude — as the famous opening theme music played .
Then the action started .
Remember , the show is only half an hour long .
It goes fast .
They try to film more or less in real time , though if there are disputes or goofups , they can stop tape , or re-record audio during the commercial breaks .
( I only saw the latter happen twice — once when Alex mispronounced a word , and once when a clue actually had the wrong year in it . )
In keeping with the attempt to keep things quick and in real time , the breaks in filming between rounds are actually as long as the real commercial breaks when the show is broadcast — the show is sent to local stations with these blank spots where ads can just be dropped in .
During these breaks ,
Alex takes Q&A from the audience , and it ’s from these moments that I can get as close as I can to answering the question that everyone asks me , which is “ What is Alex Trebek really like ? ”
As far as I can tell , he ’s really nice .
His kind of pompous on - air personality ( which I do n’t find as off - putting as some apparently do ) drops away immediately ; he ’s funny , does random little accents for no reason , and most of his jokes are self - deprecating ( and often involve his love of booze ) .
But as for his actual interaction with the contestants , that ’s limited entirely to what you see on screen during the broadcast of the actual show — again , no doubt to keep any worries about collusion at bay .
So after half an hour , the show is done filming .
What comes next ?
Another show !
They film five shows — an entire week ’s worth — in one day of filming .
There are about ten minutes between shows , during which , if you ’re the champ , you run back to the green room and change clothes .
( As the contestant wranglers say , “ If Alex can do it , so can you . ” )
At the end of each show , they drew two more names — and each time my name was n’t called .
I sat through a whole week ’s worth of shows in one afternoon and was one of only two people not called — they have extras , in case someone fails to show up or everyone ends the game with negative money or something , I guess .
I would be coming back the next morning .
So the whole thing repeated on Wednesday , with a new batch of contestants .
I actually was n’t that broken up about it — I felt like sitting through the previous day had been good for acclimating me to the situation , and a good friend of mine was in town for a conference and would be able to keep Amber company at the studio on Wednesday .
We went through the whole routine again ( and I got another practice round with the buzzer ) , and I was told that I ’d definitely be on one of the shows filmed that day , which was actually the last filming day of the season .
( Jeopardy only films on Tuesday and Wednesdays ; most of the technical people also work on Wheel of Fortune , which films on the adjacent set on Thursdays and Fridays . )
In the five shows I had seen filmed the previous day , there had been no repeat champions — everyone who won one game lost the next .
The winner of the final show , the one that broadcast Friday , July 18 , was a guy names Mark Wales .
He was really nice and personable , and we had chatted for bit on the bus coming over that morning — he lived in Buffalo , my home town .
As soon as his first game started , it was obvious that he was really good at the buzzer .
He jumped out to an early lead , then hit the first Daily Double , bet it all — and got it wrong .
Then he got a couple of other answers wrong , and was at - $ 1,000 by the first commercial break , and I remember thinking to myself , “ That ’s it , he ’s done . ”
He was n’t .
He ended up storming back to win the game pretty handily .
For the first show filmed the next day , my name once again was n’t called .
That game turned out to be an epic struggle , with a groovy hippie grad student named Dan almost beating Mark , but getting the Final Jeopardy question wrong .
It was clear at that point that Mark was really good — smart , good with the buzzer , and cool under pressure .
Naturally , I was tapped to face him next .
This is really happening
The game itself is still something of a blur to me — when I watched it later , I was surprised at how little of it I actually remembered .
But what I definitely remember was how hard it was for me to buzz in .
It took what was probably only three or four minutes , but what felt like me to be an eternity , to get my first chance to answer a question , and that threw me .
Once I got started , though , I did OK .
I answered several high - value clues in the first round and ended up in second place at the end of it — closer to Joanne , our third opponent , than to Mark , but still in second .
In the middle of the first round comes that awkward moment when you have to make small talk with Alex .
The chat is very structured — you have to submit a set of interesting anecdotes before hand , and you can pick one that you ’d like most to talk about , though Alex might pick a different one .
( He has them on index cards for reference . )
I picked the blog , naturally , and though I was n’t allowed to actually say the name on the air , I hope it served as a suitable shout out .
I also was n’t really able to convey this site ’s somewhat jaundiced view of the comics ; there are no doubt about 20 million people out there who think that I love ( in fact , I think the phrasing I used was “ LOOOoooove ” ) Rex Morgan , M.D. , with a total absence of irony .
Anyway , the second round was more of the same : I did better than Joanne , but not as well as Mark , and Mark slowly pulled away from me , helped by the fact that he found ( and got right ) all three Daily Doubles .
At the end of the Double Jeopardy round , I gave my first wrong answer , in the “ State Fish ” category : I said “ swordfish ” when I should have said “ sailfish . ”
Yes , I do know the difference , and I swear the thing I was visualizing in my head was a sailfish , but there it was .
This had me frantically checking my score ( which you can see , by the way , above and to the left of the game board ) .
I was worried that by losing that $ 2,000 , my score had dipped to below half of Mark ’s — which would have meant that I would be unable to catch him unless he bet very stupidly in Final Jeopardy , something he had shown no inclination to do to that point .
Fortunately , the round ended with me at $ 12,800 and him at $ 25,200 .
If I got the Final Jeopardy clue right and he got it wrong , I would still win .
I have n’t actually said anything about what my emotional state was like while all this was going on .
While I was in the thick of the game , I actually felt pretty calm .
I was kind of irritated because I could n’t buzz in as often as I liked , but I was n’t having any of those dreaded mental blocks on clues were you know that at some level you know the answer but ca n’t summon it .
Most of the clues I knew the answers to ( whether I could buzz in and answer them was a different story ) , a few I was unsure of and did n’t buzz in .
But during the commercial breaks , I became very aware of how much adrenaline was pumping through me , and how nervous I actually was .
It comes down to this
This all came crashing down on me when it came time to bet on Final Jeopardy .
You get to see the category before you bet , and they give you scratch paper to do your math .
The category was “ World Leaders ” — right up my alley !
I love politics , I love international politics , I even wrote a damn satirical column about world leaders for Wonkette !
And yet when it came time to do my betting , I realized that my brain — or at least those parts not dedicated to trivia — was completely fried .
All the math and strategy I had studied with Zipper the Mule was gone .
The situation was n’t difficult to parse : Mark had almost twice as much as me , so I had to bet almost everything to have a chance of winning , which I did — all but $ 1 ( because you ca n’t win with $ 0 , so you might as well hedge against something totally wacky happening ) .
I wrote down my bet , and then pressed the little button that registers it , after which there is no going back .
And this is the terrible part .
Sometimes , when I leave the house and walk away , I am suddenly convinced that I have failed to lock the door behind me and have to go back and check .
Or sometimes I think I have locked the door , but have forgotten to bring my key , and have to reach into my pocket check that .
It ’s not rational , but it ’s something I experience often .
And it was a similar sort of feeling I got when I hit that button — I suddenly became convinced that betting all but $ 1 was the wrong thing to do , that it would leave me a dollar short even if I got the clue right and Mark got it wrong , that I had screwed up and done something incredibly stupid and there was no way to fix it .
It totally deflated me .
Then , some other random part of my brain convinced me that by leaving off that dollar , Mark and I would end up tied if I got the final clue right and he was wrong , and we would go on to the next game together .
This perked me up a bit , though the thought of competing against him again was pretty worrisome .
As anyone who can do basic arithmetic knows , both of these assumptions were completely off - base .
Mark would obviously bet at least $ 400 to guarantee that he would win if we were both right .
If he did that , and I was right and he was wrong , I would end up with $ 25,599 and he would end up with $ 24,800 , and I would win outright .
But this comforting math was beyond my capabilities at the time .
I was rattled , and I ’d like to think anyway that this affected what came next .
When the clue was finally revealed , this was it :
Born in Kiev & later a U.S. citizen , this leader became Prime Minister in 1969 of a country founded in the 20th century .
This is in many ways a typical Jeopardy clue , in that it ’s packed with information — there are at least four different data points in it from which to construct your guess .
And I drew a blank .
I saw “ Kiev ” and “ country founded in the 20th century ” and my mind immediately went to the ex-USSR .
Then I saw “ 1969 ” and knew that that could n’t be right , but my mind stubbornly refused to leave Eastern Europe .
What Eastern European countries were founded in the 20th century and existed in 1969 ?
Poland , but I could n’t think of any Polish prime ministers ; Yugoslavia would have also fit the bill , but it did n’t occur to me at the time .
What about Czechoslovakia ?
1969 … Prague Spring … maybe Alexander Dubcek , the reformist Communist leader who was ousted by the Soviet invasion and replaced by people more loyal to Moscow ?
As that famous music , which I was hearing for the seventh time in two days , was hitting its last note , I scrawled his name out as fast as I could .
I should say that , even as I went through this chain of circumstantial logic , I knew — knew with absolute certainty — that I was wrong .
And in fact later research revealed that Alexander Dubcek met virtually none of the requirements of the clue .
He had never been a U.S. citizen ( though he was conceived in the United States ) ; he was n’t born in Kiev ; he was n’t Prime Minister ( his title was “ First Secretary of the Communist Party ” ) ; and he came to power in 1968 , not 1969 .
But at least I wrote down something .
And it actually brought up one of my favorite moments of the show .
I ’ve heard a lot of people make fun of Alex Trebek , saying that he acts so superior but is just reading all the answers off of a cue card , so how smart can he be ?
As you can see above , I only had time to write the man ’s last name ; when Alex saw it , he murmured “ Ah , Alexander Dubcek . ”
He knew who I was talking about !
And this was someone so far off base that there was no reason to encounter his name when researching this particular clue .
For some reason that really tickled me , even as he informed me regretfully that I was wrong and my total dropped down to $ 1 .
I ended up in third place .
Joanne had n’t gotten the answer either , but had bet small ( smart , in her position ) .
Mark , as he had been doing all week , got it right : the answer was Golda Meir .
Golda Meir !
The Jewish guy , the one obsessed with history and politics , had missed Golda Meir !
Oy vey !
Aftermath
For much of the rest of the afternoon , I was pretty bummed , which was exacerbated by the fact that I was experiencing an adrenaline crash .
But by the end of they day , I was feeling better about it .
This was helped by the fact that Mark had gotten the Final Jeopardy question right , which meant that even if I had been able to summon up Golda ’s name , he would have still won .
And the experience overall had been really great .
This was something I had been dreaming about for most of my life , and I had really done it !
I got to talk about Rex Morgan on TV !
Alex had said something nice about my tie !
And hell , because we flew out on frequent flier miles , once I got that $ 1,000 check I ’d still come out ahead a bit financially , even after the hotel and the rental car and the posh dinners in which I drowned my sorrows .
The hardest part of the next three months was having to keep the results secret .
We did tell a select few — our parents , Amber ’s brother , some close friends — but everyone wanted to know , and we kept our mouths shut .
( The Jeopardy folks ask that you try to keep things secret for the most part , because if word gets too far around it spoils the fun . )
Amusingly , there were a couple of things we did that convinced people that I had actually hit it big .
We left for a two - week vacation in Italy ( which we had been saving up for for two years ) ; and we bought a new car ( which we had to buy because our 14 - year - old Toyota had finally bit the dust , and which we paid for in classic American fashion by financing it ) .
Right away it became clear that a lot of people wanted to watch the show with us , to the point that we knew we would n’t be able to have a party at our house .
We talked to the folks at a bar up the street , which had tons of TVs typically tuned to ESPN ; turns out they were Jeopardy fanatics and more than happy to have a big crowd on a Tuesday night .
As the days ticked down to the actual show , I got nervous all over again .
Did I really want to see myself on TV surrounded by people I knew ?
What if I had some horrible facial or vocal tic that everyone else knew about but I did n’t ?
What if they were disappointed ?
In the end , about fifty people I knew showed up — family , friends , and even faithful readers wolfdog and yellojkt , the latter of whom wrote about the experience on his own blog — and there were probably another fifteen or so who just happened to be there .
It was a blast .
Everyone cheered when I got things right and booed my opponents .
One of my wife ’s coworkers even ran a pool on how much I won ( another coworker , borrowing a strategy from the Price is Right , bet on $ 1 and went home with $ 55 ) .
Even when I lost , they all cheered .
I felt like a hero .
As of this writing , Mark is still the champ , having won five days and counting — I wish him luck , because if you ’re going to be beaten , you should lose to the best .
If you ever feel like trying out for a game show , I heartily recommend it — it ’s a blast !
Especially Jeopardy , because everyone — everyone ! — involved is just really nice and warm and funny and smart .
Oh , and I was told that I could n’t try out for Jeopardy again — for as long as Alex hosts the show .
On the day my show was broadcast , he turned 68 .
Maybe it ’s time to think about retiring , is n’t it , Trebek ?
Who knows , maybe I ’ll be back .

Controversial theory proposes that tectonic activity fertilized cyanobacteria .
The clashing of supercontinents billions of years ago may have been responsible for the oxygen - rich atmosphere that sustains much of the life on Earth today .
Computer artwork showing the break - up of the supercontinent Pangea around 200 million years ago .
CHRISTIAN DARKIN / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY
That ’s the controversial theory proposed in a paper published today in Nature Geosciences1 .
Geochemists at the Australian National University ( ANU ) in Canberra have suggested that as tectonic plates smashed into each other , reshaping supercontinents such as Pangaea , it set off a chain of events leading to increased oxygen in the atmosphere .
The Earth had almost negligible oxygen levels until the ' great oxidation event ' roughly 2.5 billion years ago .
Today , oxygen makes up about 21 % of the atmosphere .
Rising oxygen levels have been linked to the evolution of bilaterally symmetric animals , animals ’ move onto land , and increased body size2 .
Oxygen 's origins
Cyanobacteria , the first organisms to emit oxygen , inhabited Earth at least 2.7 billion years ago , and geochemists have struggled to explain why oxygen levels remained low until 200 million years later .
Most theories propose that the oxygen was being consumed , either by reacting with volcanic gases or by being trapped in the Earth through reactions with iron or sulphur .
By around 2.5 billion years ago , such theories suggest , these oxygen sinks were full up , suddenly allowing the gas to accumulate in the atmosphere .
ANU ’s Charlotte Allen and Ian Campbell propose instead that the trigger for oxygenation was the collision of tectonic plates .
These collisions would push up land to form mountains — the same process that created the Himalayas , for example , when the Indian subcontinent met Eurasia .
As those mountains eroded , it washed nutrient - rich sediments into the sea , which helped the oxygen - producing cyanobacteria to grow in vast numbers .
At the same time , organic carbon fell to the ocean floor and was buried there .
The extra oxygen , lacking the carbon it would normally react with to create carbon dioxide , remained in the atmosphere .
The scientists , whose main focus is not atmospheric sciences , had originally set out to understand continental growth by dating about 7,000 zircon crystals .
Sifting through the scientific literature , they realised that more zircon crystals had been formed when several land masses were squashed together into a supercontinent ; and that those time periods matched increases in atmospheric oxygen .
“ We had no inkling there would be a correlation with atmospheric oxygenation , ” Allen says .
Successive rises
The researchers go on to link seven separate tectonic events to stepwise increases in atmospheric oxygen levels .
“ I think the possible connection between tectonic events and biogeochemistry and the rise of oxygen is intriguing , and will get people thinking , ” says Ariel Anbar , a geochemist who studies the history of oxygen in Earth ’s atmosphere at Arizona State University in Tempe .
However , others are not convinced .
James Kasting , a geochemist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park who studies atmospheric evolution , says the theory is based on a faulty premise that organic carbon burial increases with time .
“ I am in total disagreement with this paper with regards to the oxygen maximum on Pangaea , ” adds Robert Berner , professor emeritus of geology at Yale University .
“ They have ignored the terrestrial carbon cycle , the rise of trees on the continents and the increased burial of resistant organic matter derived from wood . ”
Nujood complained repeatedly to her husband ’s relatives and later to her own parents after the couple moved back to their house in Sana .
But they said they could do nothing .
To break a marriage would expose the family to shame .
Finally , her uncle told her to go to court .
On April 2 , she said , she walked out of the house by herself and hailed a taxi .
It was the first time she had traveled anywhere alone , Nujood recalled , and she was frightened .
On arriving at the courthouse , she was told the judge was busy , so she sat on a bench and waited .
Suddenly he was standing over her , imposing in his dark robes .
“ You ’re married ? ” he said , with shock in his voice .
Right away , he invited her to spend the night at his family ’s house , she said , since court sessions were already over for the day .
There , she spent hours watching television , something she had never known in her family ’s slum apartment , which lacks even running water .
When Nujood ’s case was called the next Sunday , the courtroom was crowded with reporters and photographers , alerted by her lawyer .
Her father and husband were also there ; the judge had jailed them the night before to ensure that they would appear in court .
( Both were released the next day . )
“ Do you want a separation , or a permanent divorce ? ” the judge , Muhammad al - Qadhi , asked the girl , after hearing her testimony and that of her father and her husband .
“ I want a permanent divorce , ” she replied , without hesitation .
The judge granted it .
Afterward , Ms. Nasser , the lawyer , took Nujood to a celebratory party at the offices of a local newspaper , where she was showered with dolls and other toys .
Nujood lived with her uncle for a time after the ruling but then insisted on returning to her father ’s house .
“ I have forgiven him , ” she said .
She swears she will never marry again , and she wants to become a human rights lawyer , like Ms. Nasser , or perhaps a journalist .
Despite the victory , Ms. Nasser and other advocates say they are worried about the lack of legal means to fight early marriage .
Nujood ’s case only reached the court because she took such a wildly unusual step and happened on a sympathetic judge .

“ I came here to roleplay a rape , and all the guys just want to hold my hand !
Do I have to beg ? ”
by Wendell Holmer
Through the hobnailed oak doors of an old monastery , I saw three women huddled around a bar .
Their whispers echoed across the stone floor .
“ Anyway , hun , ” Mary was saying , “ the reason you ca n’t just go home is that the mansion is full of girls from all over the world that have been kidnapped and brought here against their will . ”
“ My boyfriend ? ” said the new girl , shaking her head as if to clear it .
“ He SOLD me ? ”
“ Nice boyfriend , ” Jane said bitterly .
“ So what goes on here is highly illegal , ” Mary went on .
“ If one girl gets out alive and brings back the authorities , the whole place crashes down on the cartel ’s head .
That ’s why you ca n’t leave . ”
“ I would dump your boyfriend , ” Jane said .
“ Yes , ” I said , walking over to join them .
“ Once they sell you into slavery , that ’s a sure sign the relationship is in trouble . ”
No reporter had ever made it this far .
There were just rumors .
All these movie actresses and prom queens were disappearing .
I had seen some blurry footage on YouTube , but it could have been a hoax .
Months in Singapore ’s seedy waterfront bars had finally led me the Human Trafficking Mansion ( Oraenji 31,39,609 ) .
I was in .
I was trying to pose as a customer without actually raping anyone .
That was harder than I thought .
The first thing they gave me was a notecard that said , “ Have fun .
This is a forced fantasy site , if you see a captive girl you like , do n’t be ashamed to grab , rape , abuse , or humiliate her . ”
The card went on , “ Women , if you are not wearing an observer , predator , or OOC title your avatar may be subject to rape , torture or humiliation at anytime . ”
Although I did n’t want to rape anyone , they tagged me with the title , “ Cartel Rapist . ”
Note to self : remove the tag the next time you go to a fashion show .
As a man , I do n’t understand why women fantasize about rape , but there ’s no doubt that many do .
" Rape does for a woman ’s sexual fantasy what the first martini does for her in reality : Both relieve her of responsibility and guilt , ” Nancy Friday wrote in My Secret Garden .
“ She gets him to do what she wants him to do , while seeming to be forced . "
The victims approach that fantasy in two different ways .
Some abjectly submit .
“ The more i’m used the more i want to be used , ” one admitted .
“ It ’s addictive for me .
i’m into about anything , especially public use .
i love to be stripped of my shame and self - respect . ”
The other sort are fighters .
“ I do like the idea of a little force being used , ” one said .
“ I do n’t want to surrender .
I want to fight tooth and nail and sometimes lose .
“ My RL boyfriend and I take turns , ” she went on .
“ He controls one day .
I control the next .
A little play slapping some gentle choking .
Is it really being forceful if I ask for it ? ”
The fighters resent being captives .
They are rude and contrary .
Their goal is to get you so fed up that you want to bitch - slap them .
But I could n’t bring myself to hit or rape anybody .
One night I sat with a girl who was bewildered and frightened .
I comforted her , reassured her , talked about escape .
Eventually , she broke character and sighed , “ I came here to roleplay a rape , and all the guys just want to hold my hand !
Do I have to beg ? ”
She patiently explained that the Human Trafficking Mansion is not primarily about sex .
It ’s about improvising a scene .
“ Do you think I sit in my living room and masturbate ? ” she asked me .
She works hard to make the scenes realistic , then prints out the chat logs and red-pencils them .
The experiences turn her on , but she spends her personal , private moments with the transcript , not in front of the monitor .
Members receive tips on roleplaying .
Do n’t decide everything that happens , but let the other players make choices consistent with their characters .
Keep a complete thought in a discrete paragraph , but avoid posts that are too long .
Stay in character .
A notecard concludes , “ Be realistic .
You are human , in this sim .
You can not ejaculate 4 times in a row or shoot gallons of semen , you cannot see behind you unless you turn your head … . ”
It ’s a distracting environment .
Someone is always getting raped or tortured nearby .
Meanwhile , in the interest of verisimilitude , the trainers are giving advice .
It sounds like this :
Victim : mmmm
Rapist :
You can enjoy being a whore if you accept it .
Victim : oooohhhh
Victim : ooohhhhhhhhhhh
Victim : mmmmmmmmmmm
Victim : oooohhhh
Rapist bites her neck as he accelerates his pounding .
Enforcer–from a different floor of the mansion : ( ( please keep the oooh ’s and aaah ’s to a minimum , use words ! ) )
Victim : hmmmm
Victim : oooohhhhhhhhh
Victim : mmmmmmmmmmmm
Victim : aaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Enforcer : ( ( Victim , no more mmmhs and ooohs , try using sentences ! ) )
Victim : ok ……
Enforcer : ( ( thank you ) )
Edicts are always coming down from Father Bracken , who seems to be in charge .
Recently , he wrote : “ Let me remind you that escaping from the compound would be DAMN near impossible .
There are 20 foot walls , armed guards , and a frozen wasteland beyond that stretches for miles and miles .
You ’d die .
That ’s it .
On top of that most of the prisoners and trainees are wearing very brief clothes and high - heeled stilettos .
Not even Rambo could pull it off in an outfit like that .
So knock it off . ”
Wait a minute .
This is Singapore , right ?
But I reminded myself that life in the mansion is all about acting .
If someone like me could be a convincing rapist , I should be able to envision a frozen wasteland in a tropical country that is largely rain forest .
I squared my shoulders , curled my lip into a cruel sneer , and walked into the mansion .
I was going to mess somebody up good .

USA Today reports on June 6 , 2008 :
Body - scanning machines that show images of people underneath their clothing are being installed in 10 of the nation ’s busiest airports in one of the biggest public uses of security devices that reveal intimate body parts .
and according to the TSA :
“ It ’s the wave of the future , ” said James Schear , the TSA security director at Baltimore / Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport , where two body scanners are in use at one checkpoint .
this is how it works :
The scanners bounce harmless “ millimeter waves ” off passengers who are selected to stand inside a portal with arms raised after clearing the metal detector .
A TSA screener in a nearby room views the black - and - white image and looks for objects on a screen that are shaded differently from the body .
Finding a suspicious object , a screener radios a colleague at the checkpoint to search the passenger .
and for entertainment purposes , the TSA explains what ‘ protecting privacy ’ means :
The TSA says it protects privacy by blurring passengers ’ faces and deleting images right after viewing .
Yet the images are detailed , clearly showing a person ’s gender .
“ You can actually see the sweat on someone ’s back , ” Schear said .
really , you can trust the TSA , that ’s why they do n’t mention that they are taking your naked picture :
Passengers scanned in Baltimore said they did not know what the scanner did and were not told why they were directed into the booth .
Magazine - size signs are posted around the checkpoint explaining the scanners , but passengers said they did not notice them .
Darin Scott of Miami was annoyed by the process . …
When he asked a screener technical questions about the scanner , “ he could not answer , ” Scott said .
TSA spokeswoman Sterling Payne said the agency is studying passenger reaction and could “ get more creative ” about informing passengers .
“ If passengers have questions , ” she said , “ they need to ask the questions . ”
by all means , ask .
they wo n’t tell you anything , but ask away .

Advertisement The British business tycoon Sir Richard Branson has unveiled an aircraft in the US that will be used for his project to launch tourists into space .
The high - altitude jet will act as the mothership for a spacecraft , releasing it in mid-air to take two crew and six passengers on sub-orbital flights .
More than 250 people have already paid $ 200,000 ( £ 100,000 ) each to be among the first making the tourist trips .
Sir Richard predicts the maiden space voyage will take place in 18 months .
It represents ... the chance for our ever - growing group of future astronauts and other scientists to see our world in a completely new light

In pictures : Space tourism jet A crowd of engineers , dignitaries and space enthusiasts gathered inside a hangar in the Mojave Desert in California for the unveiling of WhiteKnightTwo " Eve " .
Virgin Galactic has contracted the innovative aerospace designer Burt Rutan to build the mothership and spacecraft at his Scaled Composites factory in California .
But some hurdles remain before Virgin Galactic customers can experience zero gravity .
WhiteKnightTwo must undergo a rigorous flight testing programme , beginning in the autumn .
The mothership is a white , four - engined jet designed to cradle SpaceShipTwo under its wing and release it at 50,000 feet ( 15,200 m ) in the air .
Once separated , SpaceShipTwo will fire its hybrid rocket and climb some 60 miles ( 100 km ) above the Earth .
Engineers still need to finish building SpaceShipTwo , which is now about 70 % complete , according to Virgin Galactic .
Sir Richard said the name of the WhiteKnightTwo reflected the pioneering spirit of his space tourism venture .
" We are naming it Eve after my mother , Eve Branson , but also because it represents a first and a new beginning , the chance for our ever - growing group of future astronauts and other scientists to see our world in a completely new light , " he said .
Rutan and Branson have high hopes for WhiteKnightTwo , and its carbon composite technology , that go beyond merely lofting SpaceShipTwo to its launch altitude .
Scaled and Virgin have set up a new joint venture , called The Spaceship Company , which will exploit the wider capabilities of the aircraft .

The capabilities of this mothership are unbelievable , " Sir Richard told the BBC .
" For instance , we could put satellites in space at a fraction of the price that satellites are currently put up there .
It has enormous weight capability , so if there were a [ humanitarian ] crisis in Africa it could carry enormous loads [ for aid ] . "
SpaceShipTwo should be finished in about a year 's time .
Sir Richard said he intended to take his family into space but would not fly them until a thorough testing programme had " been completed and every box has been ticked " .
Longer - term , Sir Richard envisages many tens of thousands of people taking holidays in space .
" Let 's go 20 years forward , if all of this goes to plan , I hope that we will have a hotel in space ; and in that hotel I hope we will have small spaceships that can go around the Moon - an excursion , " he explained .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
It 's all too clear that the economy is in a rough patch .
The dollar 's weak , energy and food costs are high , the stock market is down , oil is at record levels , and housing values have lost years of gains .
What 's next ?
Marshall Loeb :
In a few words , Irwin , please describe our current economy .
For example , a few years ago , when everything was going well , experts dubbed it the " Goldilocks Economy " -- not too hot , not too cold , but just right .
Irwin Kellner :
Well , you can call it the " Murphy 's Law Economy " -- if anything can go wrong it will .
Q : Are we near a bottom ?
A : We are bumping along a bottom .
But it is really amazing that bumping along a bottom is all that 's happened , given the one - two punch that was doled out to us .
I am talking , of course , about the bursting of the housing bubble , and the resulting credit crisis from the securitization of the housing market -- packaging mortgages so they could be re-sold to investors .
But I do n't think the housing market has bottomed .
Housing prices have farther to fall .
For example , South Florida can go down another 10 % to 15 % , as can Las Vegas , Arizona and the whole state of California .
Q : What other consequences will the continuing housing decline have on the broader economy ?
A : All this is affecting the consumer .
Falling housing prices dissuade builders from building , and they affect individual perceptions .
People are feeling less rich than before because their homes are worth less .
This will take another one year or more to unwind .
Q : Meanwhile , what other forces may give some strength to the economy ?
A : What is offsetting the housing slump is spending by business on technology to make its operations more efficient and lower costs .
But the resiliency of the U.S. economy in the face of the housing bubble is amazing .
It is a testament to the Federal Reserve for doing such a good job at dealing with a difficult situation .
But for every action , there is a reaction .
The Fed has flooded the economy with money , and this has depressed the value of the U.S. dollar .
This boosts inflation .
Inflation is no longer well anchored , to use Bernanke 's term .
This is going to be felt much more today than it was in the 1970s , partly because of how companies interact with their employees .
In the 1970s , companies were willing to pay their employees a few percentage points more to beat inflation .
But today in the era of downsizing and outsourcing , this has not happened .
Q : What is your forecast for U.S. economic growth ?
On Christmas Day , will the economy be higher or lower than it is today ?
A : My prediction is the economy will be growing at the same rate as today , about 1 % .
I do n't see what will push the economy higher .
We will still be under pressure from similar forces that wo n't be completely worked out yet .
We have to take into account rising energy prices , which act like another tax .
Q : What should our energy policy be ?
A : We need a policy that takes our reliance off oil .
Clean coal plants are one suggestion .
There is also a slew of other alternatives : geothermal , solar , nuclear , and even a hydrogen car is being made .
Government should give incentives to entrepreneurs who are experimenting with new , clean technologies .
... We have moved to too much dependence on oil and too many geopolitical problems .
Q : How do you think the stock market will perform in the next six to twelve months ?
A : The market has n't fully discounted the hit to corporate profits that the one - two punch has dealt .
...
But , at worst , I believe the Dow can sink another 5 % to 10 % or so from current levels .
At best , it will stay flat , always looking over its shoulder for bad news .
We will continue to have plenty of days when the Dow is down 1 % to 2 % , and then up the same amount .
Q : How about individual asset allocation ?
How should the intelligent investor allocate his assets ?
A : I 've always believed that a person should have the same amount as his or her age invested in fixed income securities .
And by fixed income I mean government bonds .
If you are aged 70 , you should have 70 % of your wealth invested in bonds .
Q : What effects do you expect the national elections will have on the economy ?
A : I believe the differences between the candidates in this election are as great as the differences between conservative Ronald Reagan and liberal Jimmy Carter in 1980 .
Historically , the economy performs better when a Democrat is in the White House than when a Republican is president .
Here are some examples , by my calculations , for full four - year periods from 1948 through 2004 :
Unemployment has averaged 4.6 % when a Democrat is in the oval office and 6.2 % under a Republican administrator .
The stock market has risen 46 % under a Democratic president and 32 % with a Republican in the Oval Office .
The U.S. budget deficit has averaged $ 11 billion under a Democratic president , compared with $ 163 billion when the president was a Republican .
The trade deficit has averaged $ 83 billion when a Democrat was in the White House and $ 117 billion under a Republican president .
To the average person on the street , the economy feels and looks better under a Democrat .
For a company , it is slightly better off under a Republican .

In a revolutionary leap that could transform solar power from a marginal , boutique alternative into a mainstream energy source , MIT researchers have overcome a major barrier to large - scale solar power : storing energy for use when the sun does n't shine .
Until now , solar power has been a daytime - only energy source , because storing extra solar energy for later use is prohibitively expensive and grossly inefficient .
With today 's announcement , MIT researchers have hit upon a simple , inexpensive , highly efficient process for storing solar energy .
With Daniel Nocera's and Matthew Kanan 's new catalyst , homeowners could use their solar panels during the day to power their home , while also using the energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for storage .
At night , the stored hydrogen and oxygen could be recombined using a fuel cell to generate power while the solar panels are inactive .
Graphic / Patrick Gillooly , MIT
Requiring nothing but abundant , non-toxic natural materials , this discovery could unlock the most potent , carbon - free energy source of all : the sun .
" This is the nirvana of what we 've been talking about for years , " said MIT 's Daniel Nocera , the Henry Dreyfus Professor of Energy at MIT and senior author of a paper describing the work in the July 31 issue of Science .
" Solar power has always been a limited , far - off solution .
Now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon . "
Inspired by the photosynthesis performed by plants , Nocera and Matthew Kanan , a postdoctoral fellow in Nocera 's lab , have developed an unprecedented process that will allow the sun 's energy to be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gases .
Later , the oxygen and hydrogen may be recombined inside a fuel cell , creating carbon - free electricity to power your house or your electric car , day or night .
The key component in Nocera and Kanan 's new process is a new catalyst that produces oxygen gas from water ; another catalyst produces valuable hydrogen gas .
The new catalyst consists of cobalt metal , phosphate and an electrode , placed in water .
When electricity — whether from a photovoltaic cell , a wind turbine or any other source — runs through the electrode , the cobalt and phosphate form a thin film on the electrode , and oxygen gas is produced .
Combined with another catalyst , such as platinum , that can produce hydrogen gas from water , the system can duplicate the water splitting reaction that occurs during photosynthesis .
The new catalyst works at room temperature , in neutral pH water , and it 's easy to set up , Nocera said .
" That 's why I know this is going to work .
It 's so easy to implement , " he said .
' Giant leap ' for clean energy
Sunlight has the greatest potential of any power source to solve the world 's energy problems , said Nocera .
In one hour , enough sunlight strikes the Earth to provide the entire planet 's energy needs for one year .
James Barber , a leader in the study of photosynthesis who was not involved in this research , called the discovery by Nocera and Kanan a " giant leap " toward generating clean , carbon - free energy on a massive scale .
" This is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind , " said Barber , the Ernst Chain Professor of Biochemistry at Imperial College London .
" The importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem . "
' Just the beginning '
Currently available electrolyzers , which split water with electricity and are often used industrially , are not suited for artificial photosynthesis because they are very expensive and require a highly basic ( non-benign ) environment that has little to do with the conditions under which photosynthesis operates .
More engineering work needs to be done to integrate the new scientific discovery into existing photovoltaic systems , but Nocera said he is confident that such systems will become a reality .
" This is just the beginning , " said Nocera , principal investigator for the Solar Revolution Project funded by the Chesonis Family Foundation and co-Director of the Eni-MIT Solar Frontiers Center .
" The scientific community is really going to run with this . "
Nocera hopes that within 10 years , homeowners will be able to power their homes in daylight through photovoltaic cells , while using excess solar energy to produce hydrogen and oxygen to power their own household fuel cell .
Electricity - by - wire from a central source could be a thing of the past .

No More Wesley Clark to Kick Around
It looks as if Wesley Clark is waving the white flag -- sort of -- in an attempt to avoid more discussion of his remarks on " Face the Nation " a week ago suggesting that John McCain 's military experience did n't at all qualify him to be president .
When the former general and 2004 Democratic presidential candidate was criticized for those remarks , he dug in and defended them .
Then members of his own party begged him to get off center stage .
" On a scale of 1 to 10 , Clark 's words were a 10 in terms of unhelpfulness , " a prominent Democratic consultant told Politico.com .
So Mr. Clark is suddenly unavailable to the media .
An aide says he is " moving on " and taking a break from campaign appearances as a part - time surrogate for Barack Obama .
He will now " devote his time to the business affairs which pay the bills . "
That sounds like the functional equivalent of announcing he is leaving the campaign trail " to spend more time with his family . "
It may be true , but it's also a convenient way to avoid discussion of the real reason for his sudden exit from the stage .
As for Mr. Clark 's position on the Obama short list of potential vice presidential candidates , I 'm told his rank is now somewhere below that of Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel , a renegade Republican , but still above that of the Rev. Al Sharpton .
In other words , Mr. Clark should n't wait by the phone .

Mr Black later said his remarks were " inappropriate " A top adviser to John McCain has apologised for saying a terrorist strike on the US would benefit the Republican presidential candidate .
Charlie Black said he regretted the remarks to Forbes magazine in which he said a new attack on US soil would be a " big advantage " for Senator McCain .
Mr McCain said he found it hard to believe Mr Black had made such comments with which he " strenuously disagreed " .
Democrat Barack Obama 's campaign said Mr Black 's comments were a " disgrace " .
Followers of Mr McCain - a former US Navy pilot and Vietnam prisoner - of - war who has travelled the world while serving in the Senate - say his extensive grounding in foreign affairs gives him an advantage over the less experienced Mr Obama .
Thus , they argue , he benefits any time national security matters are the news of the day .
I agree a terrorist attack would benefit John McCain but with one proviso ... that this may well be the aim of the terrorists
Justin Webb
BBC North America editor
Read Justin's thoughts in full But questioned about Mr Black 's comments , Mr McCain told reporters : " I can not imagine why he would say it .
It 's not true .
" I 've worked tirelessly since 9/11 to prevent another attack on the United States of America .
My record is very clear . "
Mr Black said : " I deeply regret the comments .
They were inappropriate .
" I recognise that John McCain has devoted his entire adult life to protecting his country and placing its security before every other consideration . "
Mr Obama 's spokesman , Bill Burton , said : " The fact that John McCain 's top adviser says that a terrorist attack on American soil would be a ' big advantage ' for their political campaign is a complete disgrace , and is exactly the kind of politics that needs to change . "
Hillary returns
The row came as Mr McCain tried to focus on energy issues .
He said that if elected , he would offer a $ 300 m ( £ 150 m ) reward to anyone who developed a more efficient electric car battery .
Meanwhile , Mr Obama 's team has announced that he will be attending a campaign event with his former rival for the Democratic presidential nomination , Hillary Clinton , in New Hampshire on Friday .
In what observers say is an attempt to bring the party together after the divisive primary battle between the two candidates , the event will be taking place in the town of Unity , where both Mr Obama and Mrs Clinton received 107 votes in January 's New Hampshire primary .
The rally will be the first time Mrs Clinton has appeared on the campaign trail on behalf of Mr Obama since she ended her presidential bid on 7 June .

This is part of my RPG series of entries here at SOB .
See the inaugural entry in the series for more details .
I have some pet peeves in RPG design — things that show up in games all the time , and annoy the heck out of me when I run across them .
These are the sorts of things that I tend to eject from games I ’m running , for reasons of smoothing out game play , unifying systems , improving suspension of disbelief , and so on .
1. calculations with division in them
Any game mechanic that requires you to use division is a broken mechanic .
This is mostly the case because of the rounding problem — one has to figure out whether to round up or down .
For some reason , it seems most game designers prefer rounding down in the majority of cases , which only makes things worse by making players feel like they ’ve been robbed ; the best handling I ’ve ever seen of the rounding problem is to say that any time a higher number helps the PCs , round up , and any time it hurts , round down .
Players like to feel like they ’re favored over nameless bit -part NPCs sometimes .
There are other problems with the rounding problem than simple confusion over which way to round ( which is of course compounded in games where for some stats you round up and for others you round down ) and the idea that your players may feel put - upon by rounding down .
For instance , division often takes longer than other arithmetic operations , especially when you ’re dividing by some value other than two .
It also introduces problems with complex arithmetic formulae , such as when trying to remember whether a bonus is added before or after the division ( if the rules even specify it at all ; I ’ve seen some that do n’t ) .
Another problem is just the tedium of it , and the fact that if some part of the formula changes , the division needs to be recalculated .
Finally , there ’s the metagaming problem : when you divide some number to get some other number , and that is the number used to determine success or failure , you create a situation where players are motivated to min/max their stats more .
If you have a stat of 10 , and another of 11 , and both of them are divided by two to yield a bonus added to some common types of rolls , you ’re subtly encouraged to increase the 11 rather than the 10 by the simple fact that improving the 10 by one point wo n’t make any difference if the rule is to round down .
If the rule is to round up , the relative encouragement for increasing each stat is reversed .
2. unsmooth progressions
When some modifer progresses in a manner that is n’t smooth — such as in D&D 3.5 ’s attribute modifiers , where you get a +1 for every two points the attribute increases — you run into that metagaming problem again .
You ’ll be subtly encouraged by the way the rules work to favor improving odd attribute numbers , rather than even numbers .
This problem often manifests at character creation , too , particularly if your game uses point - buy to generate starting attributes rather than random die rolls .
3. closed progressions
A point I made in a previous SOB entry , Open Ended Rolls , is that closed progressions are often problematic from a number of perspectives .
Negative effects I might mention include :
damage to suspension of disbelief because of the unnatural form of closed progressions and the effect they have on probabilities the frustration of being literally unable to succeed at some tasks ( and similarly of someone literally being unable to fail ) in some cases or , alternatively , two characters of wildly divergent skill levels being equally likely to succeed or fail in some circumstances the annoyance ( in the case of closed stat progressions , as opposed to roll progressions ) of not being allowed to continue improving a given stat
In the case of both rolls and stats , it is far better to use a system that makes progression past a “ sweet spot ” range very difficult than to simply apply an arbitrary limit to how far you can go .
Rather than use a closed d20 roll the way D&D does , employ a system that allows the roll to be expanded in exceptional cases , such as my Nd9 critical system .
Rather than letting a character spend one skill point to increase a skill by one rank , with an upper limit of 5 ( for instance ) , increase the cost of skill improvements for each rank above 0 so that progression cost becomes prohibitive after 5 , but a sufficiently motivated player can still increase the skill if that fits the character concept .
4. discontinuous progressions
If you have an open ended progression , do n’t make it discontinuous .
Rolling 1d10 and adding another 1d10 if you happen to roll a 10 , as in the case of 7th Sea ( for instance ) , is a bad idea .
An even worse example is Rifts ’ treatment of attributes that are 16 and higher .
Such discontinuous progressions break probability curves in ways that can prove problematic for suspension of disbelief and smoothness of game play .
I discussed this in the Open Ended Rolls entry as well , under the section heading “ some problematic open rolling systems ” .
5. fragmentary systems
To the extent that a game does n’t tend to use a centralized system , it can cause problems .
One of the best ( worst ? ) examples of this is the scattering of unrelated systems for special combat maneuvers in D&D 3E .
The grapple rules are the crowning achievement on that heaping pile of crap .
Perhaps the single most important thing Pathfinder RPG has done , in terms of fixing D&D rules , is to unify most ( if not all ) the special maneuvers rules into a single system based on a Combat Maneuver Bonus .
While the D&D 3E grappling rules are a broken mess of bad idea all by themselves — so much so that , as printed in the books , the grapple rules are literally unusable — the fragmentary nature of the special maneuvers rules in general are a huge problem .
6. overly complex systems
Here we go with the grapple rules from D&D 3E again .
Aside from the fact that it ’s just one of many fragments in the special maneuvers rules for combat , it is in and of itself so damnably complex that the guys who wrote up the rules for the D&D 3.5 Player ’s Handbook seem to have lost track of what they were doing halfway through writing up the system and ended up with a system that does n’t actually work .
I do n’t just mean that it works in a way that breaks game play ; I mean there literally is not a complete system .
By making certain assumptions about what the writers must have meant , a system can be gleaned from the text in the book ( and the SRD ) , but I ’m not really 100 % certain that the resulting system is exactly the system that was intended .
I ’m not even entirely sure the various writers and editors had the same thing in mind when they agreed on the final form of the grapple rules in the PHB .
The system goes on from that point to require many , many repeated rolls , and much of the time the result is that you have hurt your chances of achieving your aims , even if you succeed .
Yeah , this system is far too complex .
7. arbitrary systems
Obviously , all systems are going to be “ arbitrary ” in terms of design decisions , to some extent .
There ’s arbitrary , though , and there ’s Arbitrary , with a capital A , some bold letters , and some oblique emphasis .
A mild form of “ abitrary ” is demonstrated in the choice of , say , a d20 to resolve contests of skill .
A more severe , and problematic , form of “ Arbitrary ” , is the Vancian magic system used in D&D , where nobody can come up with any reasonable explanation for why you can cast three first level spells and one second level spell — and that second level spell ca n’t be given up to provide more first level spells , or vice versa .
It ’s stupidly arbitrary .
It breaks suspension of disbelief for no good reason , unless you think “ Well , I ’m too lazy to think this through any better ! ” is a “ good ” reason .
8. dragon stuff
Dragons are supposed to be something special .
They ’re gigantic , fierce , mighty beasts , possessed of great power , shrouded in mystery , rare and frightening like nothing else in the world .
They ’re iconic , and slaying one is a Big Fucking Deal .
. . . unless you ’re using one of the scores of stupid additions to D&D that have cropped up .
Everywhere I look , I see dragon this , dragon that , all kinds of dragon things all over the place .
You can team up with a Dragon Shaman , fight a Dracotaur , or even be a Dragonborn Paladin at first level .
There are so many different types of dragons that , assuming there are enough of each type for them to be able to breed and propagate the species over the millennia , there must be literally millions of dragons in the world .
It even started really early , with the Dragon Disciple in the DMG .
This is n’t really a complaint about all the dragon - wank in D&D .
Well , not specifically .
The dragon nonsense just makes for a handy example , and a particularly egregious example at that .
The real problem is that of utterly failing to capitalize on the real strengths of the core mood - setting tropes of your RPG genre .
Dragons should be immensely powerful , frightful beings whose motives cannot be fathomed , creatures rare and mysterious , opponents only the greatest of heroes or of fools would ever dare face in combat ; they should n’t be the parents of 50 % of your adventuring party .
Magic is similarly a thing of mystery , a powerful force , dangerous to wield and even more so to oppose when facing the evil wizard at the end of an epic adventure ; it should n’t be a commonplace component of things you can buy and sell in the corner store , like the integrated circuits in an iPod or disposable cellphone today .
Most of the time , the “ coolest ” stuff in your game should also be among the rarest — otherwise it ceases to be “ cool ” , and instead becomes merely “ common ” .
9. incomplete explanations
In some of the later Monster Manuals , descriptions of the creatures ended up being mostly neglected , in favor of a picture and an italicized bit of flavor text that utterly fails to provide a generalized overview of the way the creature would come across .
Many of the fire spell explanations in the game never touch on the possibility of igniting flammable materials .
The actual relationship between the Spheres and coincidental uses of magic in Mage : The Ascension was very much undefined in the books , leading to in - depth discussions of the philosophical and game mechanics underpinnings of coincidental magic — and , while those discussions were interesting and often fun , they lost a lot of that fun when they devolved into flame wars , and they were only necessary because there simply was n’t any “ official ” explanation to which the rules interpretation of one ’s game could adhere .
Finish what you start .
10 . playing favorites
We all have our favorite game concepts .
I really like orks ( when done right ) , for instance , and I ’m not a big fan of mainstream D&D gnomes ( or Dragonborn ) .
If I include both orks and halflings as core races in a game or an expansion product for a game , though , I sure as heck am not going to do so in a way that does the Mary Sue dance with orks and makes a mockery of the very concept of halflings .
Sometimes , I feel like I ’m the only person who thinks that way , though .
In D&D 4E , dwarves are the gimpy red-headed stepchildren of the game while Dragonborn and the three ( count ’em , three ) elfish races available to players are obviously designed to showcase their kewlness factors .
The fact that White Wolf basically buggered every single Vampire : the Masquerade player who liked Clan Ravnos just because Justin Achilli never liked the clan was petty and lame ( and this is coming from someone who never really cared much for Clan Ravnos — I tried playing one once , and got bored rather quickly ) .
If you ’re going to just love or hate something out of proportion with everything else , and ca n’t keep that separate from your game development efforts , do n’t try to present it as an “ equal ” to the rest of the options .
Do n’t like dwarves ?
Make them monsters only , or just exclude them from the game .
Think dragonborn are just the bee ’s knees ?
Same thing — or just make a game where everybody plays a dragonborn , and stop pretending you ’re trying to provide other options on equal footing .
Playing favorites like that can come across as amazingly passive - aggressive .
Just do n’t do it .
More ?
I might come up with some more peeves like these in the future .
There are , of course , other things people often do when designing a roleplaying game that should , simply put , never be done ( but often are ) .
People seem to like lists of ten things , though .

An " e- mail " message from aliens inhabiting the Altair solar system could reach Earth within 7 years , some astronomers suggest .
The alien message would come in response to a radio - wave signal sent toward Altair 25 years ago by Japanese astronomer Hisashi Hirabayashi , who suggests we may receive a reply as early as the year 2015 if intelligent aliens received , decoded and responded quickly to the message .
Altair is located approximately 16 light - years from Earth .
Hirabayashi , a former researcher at the University of Tokyo Astronomical Observatory ( now known as the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan ) , along with colleague Masaki Morimoto , sent the message via a US radio telescope in 1983 on the Tanabata holiday , a traditional Japanese star festival celebrating the annual meeting of two stars -- Vega ( which represents the goddess Orihime ) and Altair ( which represents the god Hikoboshi ) -- in the night sky .
The message , which is believed to have reached Altair in 1999 , consisted of 13 binary - encoded images ( 71 x 71 pixels each ) that showed , among other things , the characteristics of our solar system , the location of our planet , the known chemical elements , whole numbers , human characteristics , and the basic structure of DNA .
Their message also attempted to explain biological evolution with a depiction of mammals evolving from primeval life forms ( see the image above of the fish crawling onto land ) .
Hirabayashi theorizes that if the aliens are intelligent enough to receive radio - wave signals , they should recognize that the data consists of 13 images and they should be able to send a reply .
But Hirabayashi is not holding his breath .
" I believe aliens exist , but they are difficult to find , " he says .
" We have n't even observed any planets around Altair , so it is highly unlikely we will receive a response . "
Hirabayashi's original illustrations , which went missing for many years , were recently discovered at the Nishi - Harima Astronomical Observatory , where Morimoto works as an advisor .
Strangely , one of the pictures sent to Altair includes the molecular formula for ethanol along with the kanji characters for kanpai ( the Japanese toast of " cheers ! " ) and the English word " TOAST . "
" I came up with that idea while drinking , " Hirabayashi playfully admits .
" The aliens probably wo n't understand that part . "

The Reluctant Astronaut
The Reluctant Astronaut Movie – Don Knotts & Fred Gifford Cast
The Reluctant Astronaut is a movie which was released in 1967 .
It was directed and produced by Edward Montagne , written by James Fritzell Everett Greenbaum , edited by Sam E.Waxman , and released under Universal Pictures .
This movie starred Don Knotts and was based on a storyline which was all about a carnival ride operator that got a job at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston .
After finding himself working as a janitor at the Manned Spacecraft Center , the carnival ride operator finally gets on a journey into space .
The lead role in this movie was played by Don Knotts , a comedian who had already won several awards for his role as the deputy to the sheriff of a small town in The Andy Griffith Show , a television sitcom which was aired between 1960 and 1968 .
Although this show was on from 1960 to 1968 , Don Knotts left the show after being on it for five years .
His reason for this was to chase a career with Universal Pictures .
The Reluctant Astronaut was not Don Knotts ’ first role with Universal Pictures .
It was his second just after The Ghost and Mr. Chicken which as released in 1966 .
What Reception did it enjoy ?
The Movie “ The Reluctant Astronaut ” was premiered on the 25th of January , 1967 in Houston , Texas .
This premiere occurred two days before three astronauts died in the Apollo fire .
While Universal Pictures already had plans of putting out a comedy which was centered on space travel shortly after the release of The Reluctant Astronaut , it hesitated to release this comedy because of the incident with the astronauts involved in the Apollo 1 fire incident .
Although the release of The Reluctant Astronaut just before the incident with astronauts that were affected in Apollo 1 fire affected the level of popularity it enjoyed , it was still loved by children and was usually shown in the afternoons during weekends .
The Reluctant Astronaut Awards
Don Knotts was the lead actor in the movie “ The Reluctant Astronaut ” .
Due to his efforts in this movie , he never won any awards .
He , however , got a nomination in 1967 for the 1967 Golden Laurel Male Comedy Performance Award .
Furthermore , away from the movie scene , Don Knotts was named an “ Honorary Recruiter ” by NASA for publicizing some of NASA ’s program .
That ’s not all .
Due to the level of success of this movie among children , Baskin - Robbins introduced the “ Reluctant Astro - Nut ” ice cream .
Casts in the Reluctant Astronaut
While Don Knotts was famous as the lead actor in the Reluctant Astronaut , this movie featured other people in supporting roles .
Some of those featured in this movie include ;
Look , it 's Ron Paul !
But what is he doing in New York , the fancy magazine for elites , alongside establishment finance types like a former Morgan Stanley economist and a famous investor ?
Is n't he sort of " kooky ? "
Everyone ( who did n't live in a basement or was n't a furry ) laughed at Paul 's quest for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination , especially since Paul wanted to get rid of the Federal Reserve and take America back to the gold standard , in which money is backed by something other than the worthless promises of filthy bankers and shiftless bureaucrats .
But now it looks like the Fed 's board of governors may be leading us into depression , and even that capitalist bible the Wall Street Journal ran an article this weekend speculating that the thinking behind the gold standard , if not the standard itself , " will have its day again . "
So Paul 's stock is rising !
Let 's hear what terrible things he has to say about our future :
" I think we are maybe 10 percent into this crisis .
The economic distortions have been building for longer than we 've seen in the history of the world .
Never have we had such confidence falsely placed in a reserve currency . "
Ha ha , you know what 's funny about that Ron Paul quote ?
It 's probably the least disturbing one in the entire New York charticle .
The people from inside the financial system sound far more depressing .
Here 's the former Morgan Stanley chief economist :
" The American consumer is toast .
We 're talking a multiyear adjustment , at least two or three years , maybe more .
Does that mean America is over ?
Does that mean we have a whole new world order ?
The jury 's out on that
If you really want to ruin your Monday , go ahead and click through and read the other two quotes .
The short version is that you 'll soon be starving in the street , but in the meantime do n't stop reading , because there 's this new tapas place New York would like to tell you about !

With the growing number of Ruby implementations , it is not only interesting to compare the compatibility with a set of tests ( read more about the RubySpec Project ) , but also to benchmark the different implementations .
Antonio Cangiano has started the Ruby Benchmark Suite project .
We talked to Antonio to learn more about the benchmark suite , what kind of code he plans to include in the benchmark and how others can contribute .
We asked Antonio about his plans for the Ruby Benchmark Suite :
The idea behind the Ruby Benchmark Suite is that we currently lack a standard set of benchmarks that we can use to measure the performance of Ruby implementations .
In my previous shootouts , I used the set of benchmarks that I took from the Ruby 1.9's repository because it was convenient .
Those tests alone are admittedly unsuitable though to surmise conclusive performance evaluations from .
Having a Virtual Machine run an empty loop faster than another VM does n't really tell us much about how these two will compare when running system administration scripts or Rails applications .
Hence the aim of the standard benchmarks is to be general enough so as to be representative of a variety of aspects that are typical of real world Ruby applications .
Currently , we classify the benchmarks into the following categories :
core - features : benchmarks that strictly exercise language features , with little need for library classes beyond basic arithmetic .
benchmarks that strictly exercise language features , with little need for library classes beyond basic arithmetic .
core-library : benchmarks that specifically exercise Ruby 's core library classes and methods .
benchmarks that specifically exercise Ruby 's core library classes and methods .
standard - library : benchmarks that specifically exercise Ruby 's standard library classes and methods .
benchmarks that specifically exercise Ruby 's standard library classes and methods .
micro-benchmarks : small benchmarks that are general but still far from real applications .
Examples of these , are the benchmarks that were imported from The Computer Language Benchmarks Game or a few classic algorithms .
small benchmarks that are general but still far from real applications .
Examples of these , are the benchmarks that were imported from The Computer Language Benchmarks Game or a few classic algorithms .
real - world : perhaps the most interesting category , it includes macro - benchmarks that could be extracted from real world programs .
For example , a good log processing script would fit perfectly in this folder .
From the feedback received so far and the interest shown by several developers of alternative Ruby implementations ( including developers from GemStone , Microsoft , Engine Yard and Sun ) , I believe this project has a good chance of doing well .
We also asked how he organizes the benchmarks , to which Antonio replied :
Right now they are just a series of standalone benchmarks , but I plan to have a script that is able to run them and report on several metrics , including CPU time and memory usage .
It is likely that for the next shootout only the execution time will be analyzed , but the long term plan does n't ignore memory consumption , which is a particularly important aspect for servers .
Tim Bray already revived his RX Ruby tokenizer to contribute it to the benchmark suite .
Antonio also asks for others to contribute to the suite :
The project is Open Source and released under the MIT license , so anyone is welcome to contribute .
We 're currently hosted on GitHub and regular contributors will be granted writing access to the repository as well .
Those who are not too familiar with GitHub or Git , can always contribute by sending benchmarks to me by email ( acangiano at gmail dot com ) or directly to our Google Group
The best benchmarks are always your own programs , so the most appreciated contributions are those extracted from real programs , independently from their type ( text processing , XML processing , number crunching , etc. ) .
The log processor mentioned above is just one possible idea .
For example in the real - world folder , we have Mr. Borasky 's matrix benchmark because it 's essentially real code in the field of numeric computing ( if it was n't for the fact that many would opt for fast C libraries instead ) .
Classic algorithms and other micro-benchmarks are welcome but , as already hinted at , we need benchmarks that give us a better indication of how all these Virtual Machines perform in the real world , because there is no point in claiming that , for example , Yarv is 3 times faster than Ruby 1.8.6 , if real applications only show ( say ) an average 50 % performance increase .
On a side note , the standard - library folder needs some love too , as we need to improve our standard library classes and methods coverage .
Also interesting to know is whether the suite concentrates on the Ruby core and standard - library or if external libraries are benchmarked as well :
I plan to , at least to a certain extent , given that we do n't want the suite to become huge .
We need to keep in mind that many Ruby programmers rely on libraries like ActiveRecord or ActiveSupport and would like to be able to see how well each VM performs with these .
As a matter of fact , in future shootouts it would n't be a bad idea even to test popular frameworks like Rails or Merb .
Less mature VMs wo n't be able to run them , but this is also an important bit of information for the user who 's interested in evaluating alternative Ruby implementations .
The last Ruby shootout was performed in December 2007 , so we asked about the timeframe for the next one :
( Natural News ) Physical exercise can decrease the risk of developing lung cancer by up to 45 percent in former smokers , while proper diet can decrease it even further , according to research presented at the American Association for Cancer Research 's Sixth Annual International Conference on Frontiers in Cancer Prevention Research in Philadelphia .
Researchers studied 3,800 non-Hispanic white women and men using a pairing system that sorts people according to smoking status .
Therefore , smokers with lung cancer would only be compared to smokers without lung cancer , with the same pairing taking place for former smokers and those who have never smoked .
Researchers compared those who had not developed lung cancer based on a variety of factors including exposure to secondhand smoke , dust exposure , family cancer history , personal respiratory history , diet and exercise .
Exercise was determined based on whether the participants gardened or not .
According to researcher Michele Forman , " gardening is one of the few activities that people with lung cancer report doing .
" Former smokers who gardened reduced their lung cancer risk by 45 percent , while current smokers who gardened reduced their risk by 33 percent .
Former smokers who gardened and who also ate four or more salads per week reduced their risk by 67 percent .
Among current smokers , the risk reduction from both gardening and high salad intake was 71 percent .
According to Forman , salad consumption " is a marker for consumption of many vegetables . "
" We are trying to understand what components of lifestyle can reduce lung cancer risk in people who have quit smoking , which has been a neglected field of study , " Forman said .
She noted that further research is needed to make sure that exercise from gardening is actually the cause of the correlation , rather than gardening being associated with some other risk - reducing factor , such as low alcohol consumption .

Microsoft today announced that it would update Microsoft Office 2007 to natively support ODF 1.1 , but not to implement its own OOXML format .
Moreover , it would also join both the OASIS ODF working group as well as the ISO / IEC JTC1 working group that has control of the ISO / IEC version of ODF .
Implementation of DIS 29500 , the ISO / IEC JTC 1 version of OOXML that has still not been publicly released will await the release of Office 14 , the ship date of which remains unannounced .
The same announcement reveals that Office 2007 will also support PDF 1.1 , PDF / A and Microsoft 's competing fixed - text format , called XML Paper Specification .
XML Paper Specification is currently being prepared by Ecma for submission to ISO / IEC under the same " Fast - Track " process by which OOXML had been submitted for consideration and approval .
Yesterday afternoon was when I first began to hear news through the grapevine that Microsoft 's Jason Matusow ( director of corporate standards ) and Doug Mahugh ( senior product manager for Microsoft Office ) would announce native support of ODF .
later in the day , I started to get email from journalists who had been alerted that Microsoft would make a format - related announcement , and were trying to figure out what it would say .
Now that the announcement has been made and the first press reports are beginning to surface , there may be more questions to ask about ODF support now than there were yesterday .
In this blog entry I 'll review what has been said , what has not , and what questions remain .
The first reporter to break the story , according to a Google search , was David Worthington , writing for Software Developer Times .
Worthington also reported that Microsoft will also join ISO Technical Committee 171 , the working group responsible for PDF , and also offer an API that developers can use to develop Office plug in converters that would permit users to select another format , such as ODF , as their desired default save format .
Worthington 's story includes quotes from Matusow and Mahugh that provide intriguing insights into how the decisions were made .
After noting that saving to the OASIS ODF 1.1 format would now be possible , Worthington writes :
However , the company is not quick to embrace its own creation .
Mahugh stated that Microsoft would not implement the final ISO version of OOXML until Office 14 ships at an unstated date in the future .
This variant of OOXML was designated ISO / IEC 29500 at the time it was certified as an ISO International standard in April .
“ One way to look at it is the prioritization of formats , ” Mahugh explained .
“ We reach a point in time where we have to decide whether to continue to invest in a previous version [ of Office ] or to cut the cord and move forward . ”
ODF support was a priority for Microsoft , Mahugh noted , adding that “ real world ” customers say that there is a pressing need for PDF [ AU : ODF ? ] support .
“ At this point there are no products using [ ISO / IEC 29500 ] in the marketplace . ”
When will Microsoft support its own file format ?
Worthingon quotes Gartner Research 's Michael Silver on that question as follows :
“ Customers that are expecting true document fidelity from XML - based , ISO - standard document formats will continue to be disappointed . "
Silver observed that the most compatible formats to use today are Microsoft ’s legacy binaries , and he believes that Microsoft will be unlikely to convince customers to move to OOXML in the foreseeable future .
So what exactly does this all mean ?
Let 's start with what we still do n't know .
When will the ODF feature be available ?
We do n't know .
I 've heard through the grapevine that we might be looking at 6 - 9 months .
A formal planned ship date would obviously be useful to receive .
[ Update :
The press release posted later in the day to the Microsoft Web site ( reproduced in full below ) states that Service Pack 2 ( SP2 ) , which will include support of the additiona formats , is " scheduled for the first half of 2009 . " ]
What will the source of the function be ?
There are two obvious possible sources .
One would be the CleverAge open source project conversion code generated by the long - running project at Source Forge funded by Microsoft .
The other would be internal development .
While either is possible , in comparing notes with others there are indications that development work may have been ongoing for some time to enable this function .
Under what terms will the API be made available ?
Until Microsoft announces to the contrary , the most logical assumption would be Microsoft 's existing Open Specification Promise ( OSP ) .
That commitment is fine for proprietary vendors and non-commercial open source use , but incompatible with commercial open source products .
Finally , and most intriguingly , Why has this announcement been made now ?
Clearly , Microsoft could have provided native support at any time over the last several years .
Office already supports dozens of formats , and the development work for a company of Microsoft 's size would be trivial .
Until now , avoiding native support has helped limit the spread of ODF - compliant software , due to the fact that documents created using such products could not as easily be exchanged with ubiquitous Office users .
And while several plugins have been available for some time , adding them requires effort to locate , download and configure .
Individual users are not likely to go to the bother ( or may not be sophisticated enough to do so ) , while enterprise CIOs have more than enough to deal with already , and would be unlikely to bother until a critical mass of requests for ODF capability had built up .
Once Office users can easily open , edit and reexport files that were originally created in ODF , however , there will be less business and social pressure against creating such files .
Given the quality of open source office suites such as OpenOffice , the long - delayed advent of Linux on the desktop , support for ODF in other products such as WordPerfect , and government and open source community enthusiasm for ODF - compliant products , the frequency of ODF - based files popping up in the work flows of Office - based shops can now be expected to increase much more quickly .
So that still leaves the question , why now , especially since ISO / IEC JTC1 is one formality step away from adopting OOXML as DIS 29500 ?
Here 's where the other part of the announcement comes in : Microsoft has decided that it will not attempt to implement DIS 29500 until Office 14 , the arrival date for which remains in ( at least public ) limbo .
What to do , then , about government customers that require an ISO / IEC approved product ?
That 's a problem .
Alex Brown , the Convenor of the Ballot Resolution Meeting for OOXML in Geneva in February , confirmed yesterday that Ecma delivered a revised specification to ISO on March 29 , but that draft remains closeted behind ISO 's doors , despite the fact that the final voting period expired at the end of March , and now even the two month appeal period is rapidly reaching a close - this despite a requirement under the applicable Directives that the release of a final draft to National Bodies should have occurred weeks ago .
Until the final draft is finalized and released , final programming work cannot begin to implement it .
So what can Microsoft do to meet its customers ' requirements ?
Notwithstanding the pedal to the floor pressure to push OOXML through the formal standards approval process , Microsoft will lack the ability to deliver a product that complies with an ISO / IEC - approved version OOXML for the indefinite future .
Moreover , investigations by the European Commission are continuing regarding Microsoft 's practices , including its conduct during the adoption of OOXML .
The most it can do , therefore , is to provide native support to that other format - ODF .
A silver lining is that any added appeal for Office 2007 will provide a welcome boost for a product that continues to lag Microsoft 's originally projected sales .
One possible flaw in the above reasoning is the fact that Microsoft has announced that it will support ODF 1.1 , the current OASIS version , rather than DIS 26300 , the ISO - adopted specification based on OASIS ODF 1.0 .
Presumably this is a reflection of the fact that ODF 1.1 will be the foundation for the next version of the ISO standard , as well as the practical reality that all other ODF products in the marketplace will be built to 1.1 , due to the additional functionality that it supports .
Presumably government users will be more interested in buying and being able to exchange documents created using the most useful products available , rather than those that are limited by the constraints of an already dated standards release .
Suddenly , it appears , Microsoft has found that indeed its customers really do want usseful native ODF support - something that it had steadfastlly denied for years .
Regardless of the motivation , today 's announcement is indeed good news for everyone that believes in open document formats in general , and in ODF in particular .
Once Office users can round trip documents with ODF users and vice versa , the frequency of that process should begin to increase .
Hopefully , Microsoft 's years - long delay in agreeing to participate in the ODF working group will allow better interoperability as well over time .
All of which , for now , must remain on the " wait and see " list .
Here 's what to watch for in the months ahead :
1 . A release date for the service pack with ODF support and for the API .
2 . Whether the API will be available as open source
3 . More specifically , whether the API can be used in GPL situations
4. Reviews of how good a job the upgraded suite does in round tripping ODF - generated documents of all types ( text , spreadsheet and presentation ) .
That 's all for now .
I 'll update this entry as further facts become available .
Updated 5/21/08 3:45 PM
EDT : Scott M. Fulton , III , who has followed the ODF - OOXML saga from the early days , has posted an article with additional details , based on interviews with Jason Matusow and Doug Mahugh , including the following :
Beginning with Office 2007 Service Pack 2 -- which for the first time , Microsoft acknowledged this morning will be available during the first half of 2009 -- users will be presented with an option , both during installation and through options settings , enabling them to choose ODF as the default save format for spreadsheets , documents , and presentations .
In a remarkable move that also shows how much Adobe 's format has become an independent standard in its own right , PDF format will also be offered as an optional default , as well as Microsoft 's XML Paper Specification ( XPS ) portable format .
This goes many steps beyond the ability to export documents to what would be considered foreign formats .
With one - time settings , users will be able to say their own native format is not Office Open XML , the current default format of Office 2007 , but one of these three other formats instead .
This puts Office in direct functional competition not only with distributors of the OpenOffice suite such as Novell and Sun , but with Adobe 's Acrobat Professional as well .
Users will still be able to save in other formats , through a selection made from the Save as type combo box in the Save as dialog box .
The full story is here .
Scott indicates that he will have more information to pass along shortly .

Microsoft Expands List of Formats Supported in Microsoft Office
Move enhances customer choice and interoperability with Microsoft ’s flagship productivity suite .
REDMOND , Wash . — May 21 , 2008 — Microsoft Corp. is offering customers greater choice and more flexibility among document formats , as well as creating additional opportunities for developer and competitors , by expanding the range of document formats supported in its flagship Office productivity suite .
The 2007 Microsoft Office system already provides support for 20 different document formats within Microsoft Office Word , Office Excel and Office PowerPoint .
With the release of Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 2 ( SP2 ) scheduled for the first half of 2009 , the list will grow to include support for XML Paper Specification ( XPS ) , Portable Document Format ( PDF ) 1.5 , PDF / A and Open Document Format ( ODF ) v1.1 .
When using SP2 , customers will be able to open , edit and save documents using ODF and save documents into the XPS and PDF fixed formats from directly within the application without having to install any other code .
It will also allow customers to set ODF as the default file format for Office 2007 .
To also provide ODF support for users of earlier versions of Microsoft Office ( Office XP and Office 2003 ) , Microsoft will continue to collaborate with the open source community in the ongoing development of the Open XML - ODF translator project on SourceForge.net .
In addition , Microsoft has defined a road map for its implementation of the newly ratified International Standard ISO / IEC 29500 ( Office Open XML ) .
IS29500 , which was approved by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) and International Electrotechnical Commission ( IEC ) in March , is already substantially supported in Office 2007 , and the company plans to update that support in the next major version release of the Microsoft Office system , code - named “ Office 14 . ”
Consistent with its interoperability principles , in which the company committed to work with others toward robust , consistent and interoperable implementations across a broad range of widely deployed products , the company has also announced it will be an active participant in the future evolution of ODF , Open XML , XPS and PDF standards .
Microsoft will join the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards ( OASIS ) technical committee working on the next version of ODF and will take part in the ISO / IEC working group being formed to work on ODF maintenance .
Microsoft employees will also take part in the ISO / IEC working group that is being formed to maintain Open XML and the ISO / IEC working group that is being formed to improve interoperability between these and other ISO / IEC - recognized document formats .
The company will also be an active participant in the ongoing standardization and maintenance activities for XPS and PDF .
It will also continue to work with the IT community to promote interoperability between document file formats , including Open XML and ODF , as well as Digital Accessible Information System ( DAISY XML ) , the foundation of the globally accepted DAISY standard for reading and publishing navigable multimedia content .
Microsoft is also committed to providing Office customers with the ability to open , edit and save documents in the Chinese national document file format standard , Uniform Office Format ( UOF ) .
The company does so today by supporting the continued development of the UOF - Open XML translator project on SourceForge.net , and will take additional steps to promote the distribution and ease of use of the translator .
As UOF develops and achieves market adoption in China , Microsoft will distribute support for this format with Office to its customers in China .
“ We are committed to providing Office users with greater choice among document formats and enhanced interoperability between those formats and the applications that implement them , ” said Chris Capossela , senior vice president for the Microsoft Business Division .
“ By increasing the openness of our products and participating actively in the development and maintenance of document format standards , we believe we can help create opportunities for developers and competitors , including members of the open source communities , to innovate and deliver new value for customers . ”
Microsoft recognizes that customers care most about real - world interoperability in the marketplace , so the company is committed to continuing to engage the IT community to achieve that goal when it comes to document format standards .
It will work with the Interoperability Executive Customer Council and other customers to identify the areas where document format interoperability matters most , and then collaborate with other vendors to achieve interoperability between their implementations of the formats that customers are using today .
This work will continue to be carried out in the Interop Vendor Alliance ( http://www.interopvendoralliance.org), the Document Interoperability Initiative ( http://www.microsoft.com/interop), and a range of other interoperability labs and collaborative venues .
“ Microsoft ’s support for ODF in Office is a great step that enables customers to work with the document format that best meets their needs , and it enables interoperability in the marketplace , ” said Roger Levy , senior vice president and general manager of Open Platform Solutions for Novell Inc .
“ Novell is proud to be an industry leader in cross- platform document interoperability through our work in the Document Interoperability Initiative , the Interop Vendor Alliance and with our direct collaboration with Microsoft in our Interoperability Lab .
We look forward to continuing this work for the benefit of customers across the IT spectrum . ”
“ The demand for a document format that everyone can use is something I hear from our customers on a regular basis , ” said John D. Head , framework manager at PSC Group LLC , a Chicago headquartered information - technology and professional services consulting firm .
“ I am very pleased that Microsoft is enabling Microsoft Office to support ODF directly from the software .
This will allow us to develop solutions that create documents that can be edited by any user , regardless of what software or operating system they use .
In a world where software companies want people to select one software package for their entire user base , the reality is that different user groups and types need options .
Microsoft is now enabling users to make that choice .
This is a very smart move by Microsoft , and one that lets the most important person — the customer — be the winner . ”
This work on document formats is only one aspect of how Microsoft is delivering choice , interoperability and innovative solutions to the marketplace .
Microsoft will continue to work with its customers and partners and the rest of the industry to continue advancing in the area .

TRIPOLI , Lebanon ( Reuters ) - The Lebanese army deployed on Saturday to halt two days of heavy sectarian fighting in the northern city of Tripoli which medical sources said had killed nine people .
Soldiers , backed by armored vehicles , took up positions between Sunni and Alawite districts of the city in an effort to stop clashes which have wounded at least 68 people and forced residents to flee their homes .
The sides exchanged heavy grenade and machinegun fire until dawn .
In the past two months , at least 22 people have been killed in the predominantly Sunni city in sectarian fighting blamed by politicians and analysts on political turbulence in Lebanon .
The Lebanese army , which often takes on a policing role , said in a statement it would not tolerate any security violations “ even if that requires the use of force in all its means ” .
One soldier was among the wounded .
The dead included a woman , a boy and a man who was struck by a rocket - propelled grenade while driving his taxi .
“ It ’s unacceptable for Tripoli and its poor and deprived districts to keep paying the price of escalating internal political crisis , ” Economy Minister Mohammed Safadi , a Sunni politician from Tripoli , said in a statement .
The bouts of violence in the city since late June have been linked to lingering disputes between the Sunni-led parliamentary majority bloc and a rival alliance led by Shi’ite Hezbollah , which is close to Alawite groups in the north .
A protracted political conflict between the sides was largely resolved in May by a Qatari - mediated deal .
But they are now at odds over the policy statement of a national unity government which was finally formed on July 11 after weeks of wrangling over portfolios .
Language in the policy statement regarding Hezbollah ’s guerrilla army is the main area of disagreement .
Hezbollah , which is backed by Syria and Iran , used its weapons in May to briefly seize Beirut and rout supporters of the anti-Damascus majority bloc .
The move helped Hezbollah impose the opposition ’s terms for a settlement with rivals including Sunni politician Saad al - Hariri -- a strong opponent of Syrian influence in Lebanon who has wide influence in Tripoli .
The Alawite faith is a small offshoot of Shi’ite Islam and its adherents are mostly based in Syria which is ruled by President Bashar al - Assad , himself an Alawite .
Their numbers are small in Lebanon but they gained some political influence during an era of Syrian dominance that came to an end in 2005 after international pressure forced Damascus to withdraw troops from the country .

The initiative has fatal flaws in its strategy ; instead of leading to a stable binational relationship and peaceful border communities , its military approach will escalate drug - related violence and human rights abuses .
Mexico and the United States face a joint challenge in decreasing transnational organized crime and they must cooperate to strengthen the rule of law and stop illegal drug and arms trafficking over the border .
This misguided policy will result in an inability to achieve its own goals and will waste taxpayers ’ money .
It will also seriously undermine the U.S. - Mexico relationship and Mexican stability .
Soon the U.S. Congress will vote on the Initiative , popularly called “ Plan Mexico . ”
The little - known appropriations request has been tagged on to the multi-billion dollar Iraq supplemental bill and has been presented as an unprecedented effort to fight burgeoning drug trafficking and violence related to organized crime in Mexico .
But the “ regional security cooperation initiative ” goes far beyond cooperation in stopping the flow of illegal drugs .
It would fundamentally restructure the U.S. - Mexico binational relationship , recast economic and social problems as security issues , and militarize Mexican society .
Over half of the packet would go to Mexican military and police forces accused of documented and yet legally unresolved human rights violations .
At the same time , no money is allotted for drug treatment and harm reduction in either country , and the colossal “ cooperation ” package completely ignores the serious problems that exist within the United States , including to the entry of illegal drugs , widespread sale and consumption , crossborder gun-running and money laundering .
This aid packet would place the United States ’ binational relationship with one of its closet and most sensitive allies in the realm of vaguely defined security issues .
While mandating a huge increase in aid to Mexico , it includes no funds to finally address the poverty gap and development needs of our southern neighbor .
To begin a public debate on the dangers inherent in Plan Mexico , first it is important to understand what it is .
What is Plan Mexico ?
Plan Mexico , or the Merida Initiative , was presented after months of anticipation and hermetic negotiations as a three - year , $ 1.4 billion “ Regional Security Cooperation Initiative . ”
Members of the U.S. Congress immediately complained that the Bush administration provided no information to Congressional committee members until the deal was done .
The request for fiscal year 2008 for $ 550 million has been attached to the Iraq Supplemental Appropriations Bill , to be voted on in Congress in the coming weeks .
$ 50 million dollars are earmarked for Central America , while the remaining half - billion goes to Mexico , primarily for military and police equipment and training .
Although the proposal has not been presented to the public in the United States or Mexico , leaked documents [ 1 ] reveal the military logic and nature of “ Plan Mexico . ”
Under the rubric of “ Counter Narcotics , Counter Terrorism and Border Security “ the initiative would allocate $ 205.5 million for the Mexican Armed Forces .
Over 40 percent of the entire packet goes to defense companies for the purchase of eight Bell helicopters ( at $ 13 million each , with training , maintenance and special equipment ) for the Mexican Army and two CASA 235 maritime patrol planes ( at $ 50 million each , with maintenance ) for the country ’s Navy .
Most of the $ 132.5 million allocated to Mexican law enforcement agencies also lines the pockets of defense companies for purchase of surveillance , inspection and security equipment , and training .
The Mexican Federal Police Force receives most of this funding , with Customs , Immigration and Communications receiving the remainder .
The rest of the 2008 appropriations request is comprised of $ 112 million in the “ Rule of Law ” category for the Mexican Attorney General ’s Office and the criminal justice system .
This money is earmarked for software and training in case - tracking and centralizing data .
The initiative would also give $ 12.9 million to the infamous Mexican Intelligence Service ( CISEN ) for investigations , forensics equipment , counterterrorism work , and to other agencies including the Migration Institute for establishment of a database on immigrants .
The U.S. government allots $ 37 million of the packet to itself for administrative costs .
The proposed 2009 budget of a reported $ 450 million to Mexico is much the same , with a larger share going to the police assuming that by then the notorious corruption among those agencies will have been at least partially remedied — a dubious assumption at best ( $ 120 million to the armed forces and $ 252 million to the police and other law enforcement agencies ) .
All of these programs are directed to the goals of supply interdiction , enforcement and surveillance – including domestic spying – according to the “ war on drugs ” model developed in the United States in the early seventies under then - President Richard Nixon [ 2 ] .
This military model has proved historically ineffective in achieving the goals of eliminating the illegal drug trade and decreasing organized crime , and closely related to an increase in violence , instability and authoritarian presidential powers .
The NAFTA Connection The “ Merida Initiative ” received its name from a meeting between Presidents Bush and Calderon in Merida , on Mexico ’s Yucatán Peninsula , in March 2007 .
The official story is that President Calderon , already committed to a “ war on drugs ” that relies heavily on the use of the army in supply interdiction , requested U.S. assistance at the Merida meeting and , after negotiations on the details , the U.S. government acceded .
With the emphasis on counter - narcotics efforts , in the lead - up to the October announcement of the package , both governments marshalled studies and statistics to support the contradictory thesis that drug - trafficking and related violence in Mexico had reached a crisis point , and that Calderon ’s offensive against the drug cartels was working .
This is not the real story of the Plan ’s origins .
The Bush administration ’s concept of a joint security strategy for North America goes back at least as far as the creation of the Security and Prosperity Partnership ( SPP ) as an extension of the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) .
[ 2 ]
When the three North American leaders met in Waco , Texas in March of 2005 , they put into motion a secretive process of negotiations between members of the executive branches and representatives of large corporations to facilitate cross - border business and create a shared security perimeter .
Subsequent meetings including the April 2008 trilateral summit in New Orleans [ 4 ] extended these goals amid mounting criticism .
Through the SPP , the Bush administration has sought to push its Northern American trade partners into a common front that would assume shared responsibility for protecting the United States from terrorist threats , promoting and protecting the free - trade economic model and bolstering U.S. global control , especially in Latin America where the State Department sees a growing threat due to the election of center - left governments .
While international cooperation to confront terrorism is a laudable and necessary aim , the Bush national security strategy [ 5 ] entails serious violations of national sovereignty for its partner countries , increased risk of being targeted as U.S. military allies , and threats to civil liberties for citizens is all three countries .
Moreover the counterterrorism model , exemplified by the invasion of Iraq , has by all accounts created a rise in instability and terrorist activity worldwide .
Extending the concept of North American economic integration into national security matters through the closed - door SPP process raises grave questions about how security is defined and who does the defining .
Thomas Shannon , Sub-Secretary of Western Hemisphere Affairs for the State Department put it bluntly in a speech on April 8 , saying that the SPP “ understands North America as a shared economic space and that as a shared economic space we need to protect it , and that we need to understand that we do n’t protect this economic space only at our frontiers , that it has to be protected more broadly throughout North America .
And as we have worked through the Security and Prosperity Partnership to improve our commercial and trading relationship , we have also worked to improve our security cooperation .
To a certain extent , we ’re armoring NAFTA . ” [ 6 ]
The SPP effort seeks to lock in policies that do not have consensus and have not been debated among the public and within Congress .
Citizen groups in all three countries have called for a halt to SPP talks due to the lack of representation of labor , environmental , and civilian representation , and transparency to the public .
On the security front , the Bush administration ’s concept of military rather than diplomacy and social policy - based security is strongly questioned in the United States and outright rejected among the vast majority of Mexicans and Canadians .
In this context , instead of reviewing polices and opening them up to public debate , the Bush administration has launched its boldest advance yet within the SPP context — Plan Mexico .
Speculation was that the Plan would be announced at the Montebello SPP meeting in August of 2007 , but perhaps because of the presence of SPP protestors at that meeting President Bush delayed the official unveiling of the “ Merida Initiative ” several months .
However , the last two SPP meetings have included discussions of Plan Mexico and the State Department has been clear about the link .
It is important to understand the roots of Plan Mexico in the Bush administration ’s deep integration agenda .
The Plan implies much more than a temporary aid program for fighting drug cartels .
It structurally revamps the basis of the binational relationship in ways meant to permanently emphasize military aspects over much - needed development aid and modifications in trade and investment policy .
The scope of the Regional Security Cooperation Initiative demonstrates that it goes far beyond a joint war on drugs and cements into place failed policies on immigration enforcement , militarization of the border , economic integration policies , counterterrorism attacks on civil liberties and the intromission of security forces into social policy and international diplomacy .
To do this , the outgoing Bush administration has relied on the support of two economically dependent allies to try to assure that its policies will be irreversible under a Democratic presidency in the United States . [ 7 ]
What ’s Wrong with Plan Mexico Plan Mexico embodies a logic of confrontation that can be criticized on the following eleven points :
1 ) The “ war on drugs ” model does n’t work .
Mexico has a serious problem with illegal drug trafficking and drug - related violence .
But there is more than one way to go about solving it .
The Merida Initiative departs from the mistaken logic that interdiction , enforcement and prosecution will eventually stem illegal crossborder drug - trafficking .
Studies have shown that treatment and rehabilitation are 20 times more effective in decreasing the illegal drug trade .
[ 8 ]
Yet the Merida Initiative contains not one penny [ 9 ] for treatment or rehabilitation in either country .
Contrary to the stated goal of decreasing the binational drug trade , the Bush Administration recently cut back funds for domestic treatment and prevention programs .
This approach moves in the wrong direction .
The supply - side model fails for one obvious reason : where there ’s a buyer there will be a seller .
And since it ’s a black market , the seller must be a member of organized crime and stands to make an enormous , tax - free profit .
The experience of Plan Colombia reveals the pitfalls of the Plan Mexico now before Congress .
Plan Colombia is a similar U.S. military aid package designed to fight the drug war .
Since its inception in 2000 , it has contributed to entrenched violence and corruption in that South American country while failing to reduce drug flows to the United States .
Over the past seven years of Plan Colombia the United States government has spent some $ 6 billion dollars supposedly to fight the war on drugs ; 76 percent of that has gone to the Colombian military .
The results are well known : Colombia remains the primary source of cocaine on the U.S. market , the price has gone down and the purity has risen .
Despite environmentally devastating fumigation campaigns , numerous studies show that the surface area planted in coca has increased or remained constant .
As a result of crackdowns , drug cartels have adopted more sophisticated equipment and forms of organization — and closer relations with Mexican cartels .
In a balloon effect , a new route opens up when an old one is closed off and new drug lords rise up through the ranks when existing leaders are imprisoned or killed In addition to its failure to detain drug production , processing and transit of cocaine , Plan Colombia has spread into aid for the Colombian rightwing government in its war against leftwing guerrilla insurgents .
The U.S. government ’s involvement in counter - insurgency efforts was authorized by Congress in 2003 , when it agreed to formally broaden the scope of Plan Colombia to authorize the use of military aid beyond counternarcotics activities and lift previous restrictions .
As a result , investigative journalist Frank Smyth wrote that by 2001 Colombia had surpassed El Salvador as the largest counterinsurgency effort of the U.S. since Viet Nam . [ 10 ]
With the arrival of arms and money for the Colombian armed forces , the violation of human rights , the displacement of entire communities and assassination of civilians has become so widespread as to be alarming even to proponents of Plan Colombia .
In the recent authorization of new funds for the plan , the House of Representatives approved a version that cuts military aid , reduces fumigation and conditions aid to more stringent human rights requirements .
The total aid to Colombia ’s government continues to be huge and largely military , but along with the likely rejection of the Free Trade Agreement with Colombia due to human and labor rights concerns , it marks a minimal recognition in Congress that the drug war model in that nation is simply not working as intended .
The upshot today is that a drug user has equal if not greater access to cocaine on the streets of U.S. cities and it ’s cheaper and more potent than ever . [ 11 ]
Colombia continues to be the Number - One source of cocaine to the U.S. market .
Over 300,000 people have been displaced from their communities , paramilitary groups responsible for 80 % of human rights violations run rampant and Colombia is a militarized society trapped in internecine violence .
This experience should be carefully analyzed before replicating a failed model with heavy collateral damage to the social fabric of an allied nation .
Although Mexico is a very different country — there is no civil war or widespread guerrilla activity — many of the lessons of Plan Colombia are worth taking into consideration on the eve of Plan Mexico .
The failure of the drug war model in Colombia , and Afghanistan , would seem to warrant at the very least a cautious attitude toward applying it in other countries — especially one as geographically and economically close as Mexico .
2 ) Providing equipment and resources to Mexican security forces in the current context of corruption and impunity will deepen the problems , reduce civil society ’s role in reform , and inhibit construction of democratic institutions .
Unfortunately , Mexican security forces are presently often more part of the problem than the solution .
The State Department 2007 report on human rights [ 12 ] in Mexico notes , “ Corruption continued to be a problem , as many police were involved in kidnapping , extortion , or providing protection for , or acting directly on behalf of organized crime and drug traffickers .
Impunity was pervasive to an extent that victims often refused to file complaints . ”
Ranking members of Mexican security forces on local and national levels maintain close links to drug traffickers , working for them directly in many parts of the country .
The army has traditionally been more independent of this dynamic , but its deployment within the country in the drug war is increasing its involvement and leading to human rights violations .
Many armed forces deserters , that totalled 17,000 last year alone , receive counternarcotics training and then pass it along in service to high - paying drug cartels .
The infamous Zetas ( a drug trafficking network comprised of former law enforcement and military agents ) illustrate the lethal capacity of military - trained groups that operate with drug cartels .
Military equipment also ends up in the hands of the cartels .
The U.S. Office of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms reports that 90 % of arms decommissioned from organized crime in Mexico came from the United States , many registered to the U.S. Army . [ 13 ]
Senator Alfonso Sanchez Anaya reported to the Mexican Congress that 15 million arms circulate illegally in Mexico . [ 14 ]
In Iraq an investigation revealed the existence of thousands of “ missing ” arms thought to be in the hands of insurgents and delinquents .
The black market in arms is booming .
Given this situation , the likelihood that U.S. military equipment end up in the wrong hands is more like an inevitability .
By excluding community prevention , treatment and rehabilitation programs , neighborhood watch initiatives and other measures that create a more active role for civil society , the initiative tends to convert the citizenry into a protectorate of the armed forces .
The redefinition of crime as a national security threat also removes it from the community realm .
The point is not to vilify the Mexican armed forces , police and government .
Many honest and brave individuals can be found among their ranks and some have given their lives fighting corruption .
Extreme statements like that of Tom Tancredo on November 8 , 2007 who said , “ The degree of corruption inside the government and the military is so great that it ’s hard to see where the government ends and where the cartels begin , ” respond more to a Mexico - bashing mentality than a serious concern for the real challenges Mexico faces .
But this is the reality of the situation and the challenge for U.S. binational policy is to support effective measures to clean up the corruption and end the impunity while developing mechanisms of cooperation in combating transnational crime .
Giving arms , military equipment , spy and surveillance capacity and training to security forces with a history of abuses that the justice system is unable or unwilling to check , is like pouring gas on a fire .
Ignoring root causes of criminal activity and market demand makes it very likely that military aid will empower delinquency and feed corruption .
3 ) Plan Mexico promotes the militarization of Mexican society with few legal or social controls .
The model of confronting the trafficking , sale and consumption of drugs with military means increases violence and weakens democratic institutions .
In countries where these are weak it can create serious obstacles to a transition to democracy .
The model of confronting the trafficking , sale and consumption of drugs with military means increases violence and weakens democratic institutions .
In countries where these are weak it can create serious obstacles to a transition to democracy .
Former UN High Commissioner on Human Rights Louise Arbour warned of using the army in the streets on her last visit to Mexico .
“ I understand there are those who say that at times you have to turn to a more powerful force such as the army , but it seems to me that in the long term it is frankly dangerous , ” Louise Arbour told television network Televisa .
“ The army should not be doing the job of the police . ” [ 15 ]
General José Francisco Gallardo , the major proponent of human rights guarantees within the Mexican Army and a Constitutional scholar who was imprisoned for his efforts states , “ Here what should be done is to form a national police force that carries out these functions and is not under the military …
The presence of the Army in matters that are not under their jurisdiction displaces the constitutional faculties of the civil , federal , state and municipal authority and goes against Art. 21 of the Constitution . ” [ 16 ]
When asked if the Calderon strategy of militarizing the drug war could lead to a return to the “ dirty war ” of the seventies , Gallardo — as a young soldier , one of the few members of the armed forces to protest the torture and assassination that marked that period — told the author , “ We are already experiencing a return to the dirty war . ” [ 17 ]
He cited the widespread practice of torture and arbitrary detentions as proof of systematic human rights violations in contemporary Mexico .
The 2007 report of the Mexican National Commission on Human Rights [ 18 ] recommended the gradual withdrawal of the army from the internal drug war .
Militarizing society by involving the army in internal functions beyond its constitutional mandate constitutes a threat to democracy .
As is well known in Latin America , the Cold War militarization of society and ideology paved the way for military dictatorships that murdered civilians and set back progress toward democracy by decades .
Human rights violations are expected to rise .
The corollary to increased military support in internal matters is the rise of uncontrolled paramilitary forces as has happened in Colombia .
In Mexico , the use of paramilitaries has been largely confined to attacks on Zapatista communities in the southern state of Chiapas . [ 19 ]
Since 2006 , paramilitary organizations have been used in the state of Oaxaca to repress social and indigenous movements there .
It is likely that an increase in militarization of Mexican society will lead to an increase in the scope and activity of these groups .
Both governments have been quick to defend the Plan stating that no U.S. troops will be deployed on Mexican soil .
An important difference between the domestic version of the war on drugs and that which the U.S. government has applied in other countries is the use of the Army .
When the war on drugs model began , military over - extension in Viet Nam , an unpopular draft system , and drug addiction among soldiers , as well as constitutional prohibitions , ruled out use of the Army .
The version for export has included both U.S. and home country armies .
Plan Colombia dispatched U.S. troops to Colombia but Congress has maintained a troop cap .
Today a similar situation of military over - extension , now due to the war in Iraq , places practical restrictions on the use of U.S. troops .
However , the deployment of U.S. troops cannot be the sole measure of militarization to evaluate the regional security cooperation initiative .
The war on drugs in Latin America is fought more by private - sector mercenaries and national armies trained by the U.S. military .
Plan Mexico follows this strategy , for the above reasons and particularly to avoid riling Mexican sensitivities regarding national sovereignty .
Militarization through building up national armies to fight within their own borders and sending in private companies such as Blackwater can be even more dangerous for Mexico than U.S. troop presence .
Accountability mechanisms are weak or non-existent .
Unless checks and balances appear that have so far not been revealed , Plan Mexico could contribute to the creation of a police state in Mexico .
This poses a particular threat to women .
Already in addition to Atenco , security forces have been involved in rapes and sexual torture in cases in Oaxaca , Zongolica and Coahuila .
4 ) The Initiative broadens Mexico ’s presidential powers , skewing a weak balance of powers .
The war on drugs model has always had this as an unspoken objective : to strengthen the executive power without effective counterbalances or transparency , subtracting powers from other levels of government and restricting citizen rights . [ 20 ]
In Mexico , barely emerging from decades of presidential authoritarianism , moving in this direction could erase years of building a more effective balance of powers .
Since his hotly contested election by half a percentage point in 2006 and accusations of irregularities upheld in part by the electoral institutions , President Felipe Calderon faces a challenge to consolidate his rule .
U.S. policies should encourage a process of political reconciliation , not reliance on the armed forces to booster presidential powers .
After taking office Calderon rapidly built an image of strength in arms .
He dispatched over 24,000 army troops to Mexican cities and villages , and created an elite corps of special forces under his direct supervision .
The message of a weak presidency bolstered by a strong alliance with the military has not been lost on Mexican citizens .
While some believe this is the only way to attack public insecurity , others have criticized [ 21 ] the repressive undertones , the danger of returning to presidentialism , increasing human rights violations , constitutional questions , and threats to civil democratic institutions .
For the Bush administration the war on drugs model serves to lock in pro-corporate economic policies and U.S. military influence in the region .
When the United States exports its “ war on drugs ” it becomes a powerful tool for intervention and pressuring other nations to assume U.S. national security interests as their own .
This global policeman role creates dependency on the U.S. military and intelligence services and militarizes diplomacy .
The Pentagon takes the lead in international policy , while relegating international law and diplomacy to a distant second place .
5 ) The war on drugs model invariably extends into repression of political opposition in countries where it has been applied , blurring the lines between the war on drugs , against terrorism and against political opposition .
A 2004 report documents the impact of U.S. increased military aid in Latin American and concludes that “ Too often in Latin America , when armies have focused on an internal enemy , the definition of enemies has included political opponents of the regime in power , even those working within the political system such as activists , independent journalists , labor organizers , or opposition political - party leaders . ” [ 22 ]
Persecution of dissidents has been well - documented for many periods of Mexican history including present day .
The International Civil Commission on Human Rights writes in its preliminary conclusions from a fact - finding tour in February 2008 : “ there have been widespread arbitrary arrests of members of social movements and , on occasion , of members of their families merely for being related to them .
It is normal for those who are arrested to be submitted to torture and physical abuse .
To justify the arrests false evidence is used … ” [ 23 ]
Journalists who report on state or drug - cartel related violence also become victims of selective silencing .
The Committee to Protect Journalists lists Mexico 10th in the world on its “ Impunity Index ” .
Colombia , after nearly a decade of Plan Colombia´s prescriptions for increasing rule of law , ranks fourth in the index for the unpunished assassination of journalists . [ 24 ]
6 ) The Merida Initiative indiscriminately replicates the Bush Counter - Terrorism model , placing at risk democratic institutions and civil and human rights in Mexico where the threat of international terrorism is practically non-existent .
Counter - terrorism measures included in Plan Mexico ignore the fact that the threat to the United States and the threat to Mexico are not equivalent in size or nature .
Nor are the political contexts .
Mexico is emerging from authoritarian rule , with many non-democratic institutions and practices still intact and increasing signs of a return to impunity and rule by political bosses .
Obliging Mexico to adopt emergency counter - terrorism measures including domestic surveillance , phone tapping , warrantless searches — the “ Gestapo law ” ( that ’s what the Mexican news media calls it ) proposed by the Calderon government that was defeated by popular outcry — , and definitions of social protest as a criminal activity could damage fragile civil liberties protections and democratic institutions .
The Mérida Initiative includes funding for espionage systems directed at national citizenry , and surveillance equipment .
Reforms probably dictated under the SPP have authorized house arrest and other measures considered a violation of rights but common in the U.S. now under the Patriot act .
Since the U.S. government ’s definition of “ terrorism ” is so broad and ambiguous , the counterterrorism model has led to mission creep and attacks on internal dissidence .
The regional security cooperation initiative provides a dangerous stepping stone in that process .
7 ) The Merida Initiative intensifies border conflict by viewing immigration through the same military lens as terrorism and organized crime .
By including “ border security ” and explicitly targeting “ flows of illicit goods and persons ” , the Initiative equates migrant workers with illegal contraband and terrorist threats .
This ignores both the root causes of Mexican out - migration and the real demand for immigrant labor in the United States . [ 25 ]
The Merida Initiative Joint Statement [ 26 ] reads , “ Our shared goal is to maximize the effectiveness of our efforts to fight criminal organizations — so as to disrupt drug - trafficking ( including precursor chemicals ) ; weapons trafficking , illicit financial activities and currency smuggling , and human trafficking . ”
The millions of dollars allocated to the immigration institute are focused on tightening Mexico ’s southern border through monitoring , biodata collection , and a Guatemalan guest worker program and border control .
Mexico has a history of offering refuge to Central Americans and accepting them into its society .
That has been changing as the U.S. government has pressured Mexico to intercept Central American migrants before they make it to the northern border .
Plan Mexico advances that process and increases Mexican participation in stopping its own migrants at the northern border too .
Putting immigration in the same basket as terrorist threats has already served to promote the U.S. government strategy of militarizing the northern border .
The U.S. - Mexico border provides a case study in how U.S. counter - terrorism programs lead to militarization , loss of national sovereignty and violations of human rights and even death of migrants .
For Mexican workers thrown out of a job by the U.S. - Mexico trade agreement , being snagged as criminals by their own government at the border is a cruel irony .
The problem of illegal immigration can never be resolved under this paradigm .
Resulting expenditures , loss of local labor , and increased hate and violence erodes communities and local economies , especially on the border .
A better policy would recognize immigration as a result of economic integration and adjust trade , investment and community development programs accordingly in both countries .
Job generation , local infrastructure development , programs aimed at regulating migratory flows and preventing conflict would go much farther to enhance border security in the short and long term .
8 ) Reforming the Mexican justice and prison systems requires political will in Mexico , not U.S. taxpayers ’ money .
The $ 112 million allocated for 2008 in the “ rule of law ” portion of the Merida Initiative to the Attorney General ’s Office and other criminal justice agencies includes mostly information technology systems for centralizing data collection , forensics labs , and training for the court system and law enforcement personnel .
Although viewed by some as the “ soft ” part of the initiative , these programs raise serious questions as to their efficacy and appropriateness .
First , to increase the “ rule of law ” what Mexico really needs is the political will — not additional resources — for reform to work .
To give an example : the murder of hundreds of women in Ciudad Juarez has become an internationally known case and received millions of dollars from the Mexican government and international agencies to resolve the crimes .
Numerous commissions have been formed and faded away without delivering results . [ 27 ]
A state - of - the - art forensics team called in to analyze the evidence that had n’t already been destroyed wrote up a report .
Although they concluded their investigation , the report has not been released .
Human rights activists close to the cases believe that they could implicate economically and politically powerful individuals .
Second , the Mexican laws and legal system are not the same as the U.S. system .
While police departments and other agencies have long - standing agreements for training and cooperation , a grand plan for the U.S. government to train and reform the Mexican legal system is viewed as negative intervention by many Mexican jurists .
Mexican judges from the Supreme Court and lower courts have publicly stated objections to U.S. funds for the court system .
For years , members of the judicial system have resisted attempts by international financial institutions to impose governance programs mandating reforms in the Mexican judicial system , not because the country does n’t need to improve in this area ( the justice system is notoriously bad ) but because only Mexico can revamp its judicial system .
Plan Mexico would break through that resistance and mandate U.S. plans and training in both the judicial and prison systems .
The U.S. government would do better to improve its own legal system in the joint effort to control the illegal drug trade and organized crime .
The fact that the United States is the largest market for illegal drugs indicates a dismal record in control of illegal drug retailing , distribution and consumption .
Moreover , measures such as mandatory drug sentencing have been proven to discriminate racially and economically ; consider that African - Americans make up 13 % of drug uses and 59 % of those convicted . [ 28 ]
Drug convictions , usually for users rather than dealers and leaders of organized crime , have led to over - crowding in U.S. prisons .
Although this method has not proven to be the most effective in dealing with the problem , the privatized U.S. prison system creates market incentives for imprisoning casual drug users and migrants — both of which form part of the Merida initiative .
This diverts resources and attention from going after leaders of organized crime and , given Mexico ’s already dangerously over - crowded prisons , could lead to violent riots .
9 ) The Merida Initiative does not represent real binational cooperation Several members of Congress have heralded the Merida Initiative as an unprecedented step toward binational cooperation .
They argue that the United States government implicitly recognizes U.S. responsibility for the transnational drug trade by offering the aid packet to Mexico to combat organized crime .
In fact , the Plan places the onus of the drug war on Mexico and includes no counterpart measures to reduce the U.S. market , improve customs control on the northern side of the border , reduce retailing and distribution , eliminate illegal arms traffic and prosecute money - laundering — all problems located firmly within the United States .
Moreover , although President Calderon has heralded the measure as an example that the U.S. government is willing to assume its part in fighting the illegal drug trade and rise in organized crime , the bulk of the budget for the initiative will never make it to Mexico .
In addition to the 40 % that will be spent on the military helicopters and surveillance planes , most of the rest of the budget goes to defense contractors and Information Technology ( IT ) firms in the form of outlays for intelligence equipment , software and hardware and training .
A huge part of this budget goes directly to U.S. private sector defense and IT companies and the U.S. government , not to Mexican security and government agencies .
As some attack the Plan for the resources destined to an “ undeserving ” Mexico , Plan Mexico could well end up being another defense company pork barrel .
10 ) Threat to Mexican sovereignty Plan Mexico includes training of Mexican police and army forces using U.S. techniques , technology and priorities .
Few nations would accept this arrangement in the vital area of national security .
As the network of U.S. anti-narcotics and customs agents and training units in Mexico grows , the ability of the country to apply policies based on its own national needs and priorities decreases proportionally .
Mexicans have always been protective of Mexican sovereignty .
U.S. government officials often regard Mexico ’s reticence to engage in joint military and police actions with the United States as if it were a hyper - nationalist flashback , but Mexico has guarded its neutrality in foreign affairs and public opinion views with scepticism U.S. foreign policy , especially since the invasion of Iraq , with the majority preferring a degree of autonomy from U.S. security interests .
The U.S. public would reject Plan Mexico if the roles were reverted .
Imagine the following news story in the morning paper : ‘ Plan United States , completely funded by the Mexican government , will place Mexican drug enforcement agents in border customs offices and key points in the interior , including Laredo , Kansas City , Miami and New York .
A new wiretapping system , produced by SPY - MEX and supervised by Mexican intelligence officers , will monitor private communications of U.S. citizens suspected of involvement with organized crime , while Mexican - made planes overfly communities thought to be located along drug trafficking routes .
The U.S. army , recently deployed to cities across the nation to fight the drug war , will receive arms and training from Mexico . ’
Newspapers and blogs would explode with cries of a Mexican re-conquest and the sacrifice of U.S. sovereignty .
Yet there is virtually nothing in this scenario that is not already on the table for Mexico .
When in her testimony before Mexican Senate committees , Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa mentioned the counter - terrorism activities “ to detect terrorists [ 29 ] who might try to attack our neighbor ” her comments drew fire from legislators as proof that the U.S. seeks to impose its own counterterrorism agenda .
Although U.S. troop presence in Mexico has been ruled out , Mexican civil society has begun to react to what they see as excessive U.S. intromission .
U.S. military training under Plan Mexico has raised concerns on both sides of the border .
The role of private contractors in implementing the package remains unclear and a source of dismay .
One security source says Blackwater will be likely be the major beneficiary , despite its tarnished reputation following its shooting of Iraqi civilians .
Corruption in contracts related to both training and equipment purchase seems a certainty given recent experience in Iraq . [ 30 ]
It also does n’t help that it was tacked on to the Iraq supplementary funding request .
Any linkage between Plan Mexico and the Bush U.S. security doctrine as applied in Iraq increases suspicions among Mexican politicians and public .
11 ) The Plan furthers a divisive geopolitical strategy For the Bush administration , Plan Mexico has an explicit role to play in its overall geopolitical strategy in the hemisphere .
Mexico is one of only two far - right governments among the major countries in the hemisphere .
The other , Colombia , has received billons of dollars of U.S. military aid , also originally as part of a war on drugs that soon broadened into an overall military alliance .
President Bush ’s insistence on pressuring the Democrats to pass the Colombia Free Trade Agreement in the context of the New Orleans North American Trilateral Summit the administration ’s underlying geopolitical aims in Latin America .
Under the Bush National Security Doctrine , this kind of alliance requires adhering to the premises of that doctrine including pre-emptive attacks , unilateral action and disdain for international law .
The Bush administration has developed a with - us - or - against - us policy toward U.S. neighbors in Latin America .
To varying degrees , it views the wave of center - left governments ( Brazil , Argentina , Uruguay , Venezuela , Nicaragua , Ecuador , Bolivia , Paraguay ) as a threat to its strategic interests .
Moves to modify international market economies , increase state involvement in redistribution of wealth and public control of natural resources and basic services , and constitutional reforms to recognize rights of indigenous peoples are generally considered counter to U.S. interests .
The administration and the rightwing think tanks that have developed the strategy explicitly formulate hemispheric security policy in terms of U.S. hegemony .
The American Enterprise Institute ’s Thomas Donnelly calls the Western Hemisphere “ America ’s third border ” [ 31 ] and argues that “ American hegemony in the hemisphere is crucial to U.S. national security . ” Stephen Johnson , [ 32 ] deputy assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere affairs in the Defense Department , recently made the connection between Plan Mexico and Washington ’s bid to recover its influence in a slipping geopolitical context .
“ While a groundswell seems to exist for greater engagement with the United States , there are challenge states such as Venezuela , Cuba , and to some extent Bolivia and Ecuador .
For now , Venezuela and Cuba are clearly hostile to the United States , western - style democracy , markets , and are actively trying to counter our influence .
Our challenge is not to confront them directly , but instead do a better job working with our democratic allies and friendly neighbors . ”
Plan Mexico is seen as an historic opportunity for the United States to gain military influence in Mexico and use it as a platform in the ideological battle for with Venezuela and Cuba et al .
This is a dangerous and wrong - headed strategy for international relations in the hemisphere , where mutual respect and self - determination should be the guiding principles for lasting peace .
It also compromises Mexico ’s relations with its southern neighbors .
Strong international relations should be based on mechanisms of cooperation between nations that have each established national security polices based on their own needs .
What has legislators and civil society worried on both sides of the border is the reach of Plan Mexico in recasting the binational relationship , to create what the Bush administration calls “ a new paradigm for security cooperation . ”
Opposition to Plan Mexico Despite a lack of public information , many organizations have come out against the Merida initiative .
In addition to doubts about the efficacy of the war - on - drugs model for eliminating traffic in illegal drugs , one of the strongest and most frequent criticisms relates to the poor human rights record and corruption of the Mexican security forces that would directly receive the aid .
Numerous human rights organizations on both sides of the border base their opposition to the plan on cases of blatant violations that have never been investigated or prosecuted in Mexico .
A few examples suffice to illustrate their concerns .
1 . In an April 30 , 2008 letter to William Delahunt of the International Organizations , Human Rights and Oversight Sub-Committee of the House of Representatives , the AFL - CIO stated its opposition to the Merida Initiative , citing “ systematic and often violent violations of core labor rights ” and specifically naming two cases .
The first is the assassination of the leader of the Farm Labor Organizing Committee in Mexico , Santiago Rafael Cruz , with no follow up on the part of authorities on evidence indicating a link between his union activities and his murder .
The second involves “ a full - scale attack on the National union of Mine and metal workers ” by the Calderon administration and the mining company Grupo Mexico , in which three union members have been murdered with no investigations or prosecutions , and the lack of follow - up on the company ’s responsibility in the death of 65 miners in an explosion at the Pasta de Conchos mine in February 2006 . [ 33 ]
The letter states , “ Without significant and concrete improvements in institutional mechanisms to weed out criminals provide training in human rights and establish effective civilian oversight additional funding to these security forces is likely to worsen corruption and violence . ”
2 . In 2006 protests by citizens of the southern Mexico state of Oaxaca — including unionized teachers , students , indigenous peoples and city - dwellers — were forcibly put down by state and federal security forces .
Paramilitary groups and snipers for hire also participated in an orchestrated effort to defeat the movement to remove the state governor accused of fraud and violence , and improve working conditions for teachers and living conditions in the communities they work in .
Human rights organizations documented the murder of 23 persons , and numerous cases of abuse , torture , arbitrary detention and wrongful imprisonment .
The murder of movement leaders has continued to date and brought the death toll to 62 , according to the International Civil Commission on Human Rights . [ 34 ]
Among the dead was U.S. journalist Brad Will whose assassins were caught on film .
Despite evidence , the state has refused to seriously investigate or prosecute the perpetrators of these crimes and the Federal Attorney General ’s office closed the case .
U.S. groups oppose appropriations to Mexican security forces on the basis of this unresolved case .
Other high - profile cases include the Ciudad Juarez murders ; the murders , and torture and rape of protestors in police custody in the farming community of San Salvador Atenco [ 35 ] in May of 2006 ; and journalist Lydia Cacho , who was arrested and threatened after writing a book that revealed the involvement of major industrialists and politicians in a pedophile ring .
Since being dispatched to wage the war on drugs , the Mexican Army has accumulated an alarming number of complaints of violations of human rights , including several incidents of fatal shootings at checkpoints , rapes , and brutality .
The 2007 Mexico Human rights Report of the U.S. State Department [ 36 ] notes reports of security forces involvement in “ unlawful killings by security forces ; kidnappings , including by police ; physical abuse ; poor and overcrowded prison conditions ; arbitrary arrests and detention ; corruption , inefficiency , and lack of transparency in the judicial system ; confessions coerced through physical abuse permitted as evidence in trials ; . . . corruption at all levels of government ; . . . violence , including killings , against women … ”
In February and March of 2008 the International Civil Commission on Human Rights investigated the status of human rights violations in the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca and the central farming community of San Salvador Atenco .
The commission carried out over 650 interviews with victims of abuses .
It concluded : “ The CCIODH holds that the cases of Atenco , Oaxaca and Chiapas exemplify a more widespread situation characterised by a pattern of continued and commonplace behaviour on the part of different federal , state and , in some cases , local authorities .
This model of behaviour can clearly be understood as the politics of the State . ”
The argument of groups opposing Plan Mexico is not that , given the deplorable state of its judicial and law enforcement systems , Mexico does not deserve the U.S. aid packet , as if this were a type of reward for good behavior .
The problem is the type of aid envisioned in Plan Mexico .
Empowering ( and enriching ) corrupt and abusive institutions before reforming them empowers abusers and potentially deepens and consolidates corruption .
One of Mexico ’s foremost human rights groups , the Miguel Agustin Pro Juarez Human Rights Center states , “ The Merida Initiative is characterized by a lack of a human rights perspective , a human security approach that mistakes the security of states for the security of human beings
…
It is time for the international community to stop supporting short - sighted policies such as this one . ”
The Need for a Different Plan Mexico is at a critical juncture .
Its weak democratic institutions have been shaken and discredited by their inadequate response to electoral polarization and to vast social inequality that destines millions to poverty or out - migration .
Human rights abuses still characterize much of law enforcement agencies .
The justice system remains bound to powerful interests , and lacks independence from the federal government and state and local governments .
Mexico can either take up the challenge to strengthen democratic institutions , or it can fall back into rule by force and authoritarianism .
At this critical juncture , the Merida Initiative would be a potentially devastating step backwards .
Despite the gravity of Mexico ’s condition it still lacks a careful diagnosis .
Faced with a real problem — the strength of drug cartels in Mexico and the United States — Plan Mexico proposes solutions that replicate the logic of force and patriarchal control that the drug cartels rely on .
Then it applies these solutions not only to a bloody frontal battle with drug traffickers , but to a multitude of complex security threats with roots deep in Mexican society .
Before putting the army in the streets — with all the legal , political and practical risks that entails — the dramatic increase in drug use should be treated as a health epidemic and addressed at once through education , options for young people and rehabilitation .
Calderon ’s war on drugs includes construction of treatment centers but focuses on supply and enforcement and Plan Mexico proposes exclusively enforcement actions .
The main result so far has been to unleash violence in most regions of the country .
The death , arrest or extradition of ringleaders has set off battles for succession and renewed turf wars .
Meanwhile , it ’s not clear that the price and availability of illegal drugs have been affected on U.S. or Mexican markets .
Both the United States and Mexico should reject appropriations that place the emphasis on a military solution to their shared drug dependency .
Ironically , the one part of Nixon ’s drug policy that actually worked — expansion of treatment services — is the one part that has been the least emulated .
The military - police arm , the “ war on drugs ” , has proved to be not only a failure but a threat to the same social values it claims to defend .
The priority should be to develop national plans and mechanisms of binational coordination that work , and whose side effects — like militarization , human rights abuses and the sophistication of criminal elements — do not cancel out the benefits .
If anything is known about arming conflict , it ’s that no matter which side you arm — and the guns invariably end up on both sides — it escalates violence .
The sheer scope of the Merida Initiative reflects the Bush administration ’s military / police focus in international security issues , just when those strategies have hit a low point in popularity within the United States .
Any incoming administration should have the freedom to develop new and more effective polices with one of its closest neighbors , instead of being locked into failed and unpopular policies by the outgoing administration .
Major human rights organizations in Mexico and the United States have already come out against the Merida Initiative .
It will soon be voted on in the U.S. Congress .
To avoid the pitfalls of this policy , a more effective binational plan would address root causes , develop mechanisms of binational coordination , and assume U.S. responsibilities and obligations .

We are the only country that has not gone through a political transition yet , but we will shortly .

Earlier this week , several media outlets chose to dip their hands into the sensationalist journalism cookie jar a second time , and for all of the wrong reasons .
About a month ago , an exciting story broke about how photographs of an uncontacted tribe living near the Brazil - Peru border had been taken for the first time .
Now some media outlets , following the lead of the British newspaper The Observer , are calling the story a hoax .
Unfortunately for these media outlets , they have only shamed themselves by doing lousy reporting .
Here ’s what Mike Krumboltz from Yahoo news said :
“ Even in an age when cynical sleuths can hyper - analyze stories for truth and accuracy , the occasional hoax still slips through the cracks .
Such was the case with a so - called ‘ lost Amazon tribe . ’
A few months ago , mainstream news outlets ( including , ahem , Yahoo ! ) reported that a photographer had found a lost tribe of warriors near the Brazilian - Peruvian border .
Photos of the tribe backed up his claim .
As it turns out , the story is only half true .
The men in the photo are members of a tribe , but it certainly ai n’t “ lost . ”
In fact , as the photographer , José Carlos Meirelles , recently explained , authorities have known about this particular tribe since 1910 .
The photographer and the agency that released the pictures wanted to make it seem like they were members of a lost tribe in order to call attention to the dangers the logging industry may have on the group .
The photographer recently came clean , and news outlets , perhaps embarrassed at having been taken for a ride , have been slow to pick up the story .
Now , the word is starting to spread and articles in the Buzz are picking up steam .
Expect a lot more brutal truth in the coming days . ”
I hope you are ready for the brutal truth Mr. Krumboltz , because you certainly ai n’t a good reporter .
If Mr. Krumboltz had actually taken time to read some of the original articles published about the uncontacted tribes , then he would have understood that no one ever claimed that the tribes were ever “ lost , ” just uncontacted .
The reason for taking photographs of the tribe was to document their existence for those people who did not believe they existed , such as Peru ’s President Alan Garcia , and also to promote the danger these tribes face because of illegal logging in Peru .
Survival International , the organization that first published the pictures and who advocates for tribal protection , issued a press release several days ago effectively squashing the hoax claims .

Traveling the country these past five months while writing a book , I ’ve had my own opportunity to take the pulse , far from the campaign crowds .
My own totally unscientific polling has left me feeling that if there is one overwhelming hunger in our country today it ’s this : People want to do nation - building .
They really do .
But they want to do nation - building in America .
They are not only tired of nation - building in Iraq and in Afghanistan , with so little to show for it .
They sense something deeper  that we ’re just not that strong anymore .
We ’re borrowing money to shore up our banks from city - states called Dubai and Singapore .
Our generals regularly tell us that Iran is subverting our efforts in Iraq , but they do nothing about it because we have no leverage  as long as our forces are pinned down in Baghdad and our economy is pinned to Middle East oil .
Our president ’s latest energy initiative was to go to Saudi Arabia and beg King Abdullah to give us a little relief on gasoline prices .
I guess there was some justice in that .
When you , the president , after 9/11 , tell the country to go shopping instead of buckling down to break our addiction to oil , it ends with you , the president , shopping the world for discount gasoline .
We are not as powerful as we used to be because over the past three decades , the Asian values of our parents ’ generation  work hard , study , save , invest , live within your means  have given way to subprime values :
“ You can have the American dream  a house  with no money down and no payments for two years . ”
Wonders from the Bohemian Countryside
Part I
May 15 , 2008
When touring the Czech Republic ’s beery destinations , everyone goes through Prague and Pilsen , and heads for the renowned brewpubs and bars such as U Fleku , U Medvidku , U Zlatého Tygra , U Parkanu , etc .
The first time around , one cannot help but try out these immemorial drinking venues and see what they are really all about , right ?
That ’s what I felt compelled to do a few years ago anyway on my initial visit there , and I predictably fell in love with this beer culture .
This time around though , I ’d like to take you to areas of Bohemia you probably would n’t step foot in if there were n’t news of a potentially - great brewpub operation .
The following articles will thus feature highlights of my crew ’s favorite brewpub and bar experiences in Bohemia last March .
Some of them are not even close to the beaten path , but some are hidden in urban sprawls you might already be familiar with .
All of them were as exciting and deserving of gambrinal visitors as the classics you ’ve already read about .
Let ’s start with the countryside :
Domácí Pivovar Velkorybnický Hastrman , in Velky Rybnik
Upon approaching the brewpub door , we noticed a little boy was staring at us from the closed terrace window , face squished for a better distorted view .
He swiftly ran back inside yelling as soon as he understood we were going inside .
Sure enough , mama was waiting for us .
A few other patrons looked at us dumbfounded , perhaps with reason .
We stared around a few seconds , as this obviously new building and venture offered a sharp contrast with that of most brewing establishments we had visited throughout Bohemia .
But the homely feel made us lay back and order rather efficiently .
To our astonishment , this lost hamlet brewpub had 8 taps !!
That ’s perhaps 4 times more than the usual bar in these parts , in case you did n’t know .
They had 4 of their own , which is already amazing considering the number of visitors that must go through here , and 4 from Pivovar Cerna Hora , which has been expanding its horizons far out of their native Moravia in the past few years .
Oblivious of the room right in front of me which would yield answers to most of our arising questions , we eagerly dipped our noses into the pints which we had just ordered .
Sure enough , their 4 lagers were all in fine , fine form .
There was an 11 - degree Světlý Ležák , called Česká Klasika , a 12 - degree Světlý Ležák ( with no particular name ) , a 13 - degree Polotmavý , and a special which is brought out only on Easter and Christmas , Puškvorcový 14° .
The Česká Klasika was the first pint I had and the one I would go back to before leaving .
Its inspiring balance of honeyed hay and herbal hop minutia graced a chewy yet poundable mouthfeel intrinsic to many unfiltered Bohemian Pilseners .
Simply glorious , effortless drinking .
A pint Bohemian dreams are made of .
Meanwhile , impressed , my pal Dany got up and tried to grab one of the many glasses with the brewery logo which was sitting on a shelf high above our table .
For closer inspection , you see ?
He did n’t get very close .
With a terse blare , the matron convincingly commanded him to sit back down .
Dany immediately complied , a scared puppy fearing the worse .
This woman knew how to run the place .
Back to our mugs , the Světlý Ležák 12° proved to be the setting for a stylish waltz between dryish pils malt cookies and lovable peppery , spicy hops .
This was another charming quaffer , but perhaps not as personable a pint as the Klasika .
I had fallen in love with the latter , so I guess it was hard to take me out of that amorous daze .
That ’s when we finally noticed there were a few pots in the room in front of us .
Homebrew - size pots , that is .
We asked if we could check out the brewery and the landlady gladly accepted .
<IMG border=0 SRC=/images/features/VelkyRybnikBrewery1.jpg >
A few seconds later , we realized this brewing room doubled as their living room .
And the kid ran by on another secret mission .
<IMG border=0 SRC=/images/features/VelkyRybnikLivingRoom1.jpg >
Back to our table , and having obviously pleased the matron with our interest and thankfulness , I got to work on the Polotmavý Speciál 13° .
It had biscuity almonds and caramel - laced vanilla hugging the surfacing spicy , wooden hop finish for a complex and ever - so - friendly quencher .
Yep , this was another superbly crafted lager in tip - top shape .
Normally , these are the 3 beers being served at Velkorybnicky Hastrman , but it was Easter weekend and so we were lucky enough to get a fourth brew .
The Puškvorcový Velikonoční Speciál 14° was a subtle and cozy pint of Světlý Speciálni which provided honeyed hay maltiness once more gently overshadowing a wooden hoppiness .
We were expecting nothing less than high quality now , and this Easter special delivered .
Unfiltered , unpasteurised , clean , balanced , humble , and authentic .
All Velky Rybnik brews fit this description admirably .
<IMG border=0 SRC=/images/features/VelkyRybnikInside1.jpg >
A few PET bottles and a few glasses to go , and we were off to another adventure : finding the train which would take us back to Karlovy Vary .
We knew there were no buses left at this ungodly hour ( oh...7 pm ? ) , and that the train was the only option left .
Dany made a crude drawing of a train on a slip of paper and his half - drunken choo-chooing completed the picture for the locals .
They simply had no choice but to help us .
So off we went in pitch darkness to the sound of distant howling dogs on otherwise silent rural roads to find the place where the train would pick us up .
The locals had warned us though : we had to signal the train that we wanted to get on or else , it would not stop for us .
After finding the tracks , walking along them to find the train stop ( and in my case , stepping into a deep mud puddle ) , we understood why we had to wave the train down .
There was no light at all at this train stop !
We started jumping up and down when the train ’s nose appeared on the horizon .
We stopped bouncing when the train creaked to a full stop .
A memorable visit from beginning to end , this Velkorybnicky Hastrman was .
< U>How to get there : </u >
Take a bus from Karlovy Vary heading for Hroznetin , not Ostrov .
Even though the brewery address might lead you to believe the brewpub is in the town of Ostrov , you will not be able to get off anywhere near if you decide to take a bus to Ostrov .
On this ride to Hroznetin , pay attention to the buildings on the right - hand side .
25 minutes or so after departure from Karlovy Vary ’s Dolni Nadrazi , you should see the brewpub ’s pale yellow façade .
There is a bus stop literally three steps from the brewpub ’s door ( the stop ’s called Velky Rybnik ) .
Oh yeah , make sure you know when the last bus or train can take you back home ...
<IMG border=0 SRC=/images/features/VelkyRybnikDarkness1.jpg >
Minipivovar Velichov , in Velichov
<IMG border=0 SRC=/images/features/VelichovBrewery1.JPG >
This one - man operation lost in the Bohemian countryside is a wonder to behold .
If there were n’t such a quality brewing tradition in this country , you could easily worry about the beer that comes out of this homebrew - style contraption .
Its homemade sink - style mash tun and its accompanying direct - fired brew kettle , both built into a counter , send the nascent brew to a huge rusty fermenter of Polish origin which seems to have survived a few bombings .
<IMG border=0 SRC=/images/features/VelichovFermenter1.JPG >
<IMG border=0 SRC=/images/features/VelichovInside1.JPG >
As if these smoke - stained , garage - like surroundings ( with involuntary bathroom air conditioning provided by a broken window ) were n’t grim enough , their owner / brewer / server , Bohuslav Novak , might even enhance this impression and appear gruff at first glance .
His persistence in trying to communicate with us though and his generosity sure made up for the somewhat intimidating appearances .
And the beer ... oh , the beer !
There is only one available , and is it ever good .
Bohuslav brews a 10 - degree Světlý Výčepní which lots of people in this hamlet seem to adore .
Although there were few people in the unheated blue - collar pub watching the playoff hockey game , patrons kept coming in with empty PET bottles to get them filled with liquid goodness .
Understandably , this 3.7 % abv výčepní simply insists on becoming a staple of your daily diet .
Its heroic pilsener malts shape a fascinatingly sustaining body for the citrusy , herbal hops to groove with .
This unfiltered lager is so fresh and quaffable , one just can not get tired of it .
One more look at this environment is enough to remind you that there is a lot more to brewing quality than state - of - the - art metal .
<IMG border=0 SRC=/images/features/VelichovInnards1.JPG >
Bohuslav also brews a second beer , a Tmavé , but only for the Christmas season .
But with such a masterful výčepní , this pils - lover admits he does not see the need for a second regular beer at Minipivovar Velichov .
The 1.5 - liter PET bottle we took back to the hotel did n’t even survive the bus trip ...
<IMG border=0 SRC=/images/features/VelichovDrinking1.JPG >
< U>How to get there : </u >
This brewpub is also easily reachable from Karlovy Vary ’s Dolni Nadrazi .
A 35 - minute bus ride follows a gently sinuous river surrounded by a tall tree mix nearly all the way to the hamlet of Velichov .
From the town ’s main bus stop , you should see a closed Mexican - style restaurant in front of you .
There are n’t that many landmarks here , so I hope it ’s still there for you .
Take the unnamed street on the side of this old diner and you should see this :

The little card in the window says “ Minipivovar Velichov ” .
Like Velky Rybnik , make sure you know what time the last bus can take you back to wherever you are staying .
The last buses are usually very early in the evening ( 7 pm -ish ) .
And there are no trains to save you here ...

The report says adults are scared to volunteer as school sports coaches Many adults are afraid to interact with children for fear of being labelled as paedophiles , a report has claimed .
Think - tank Civitas said the " escalation of child protection measures " had made everyone from sports coaches to Santas seem like " potential child abusers " .
The Home Office said there was no evidence that vetting had deterred volunteers or eroded trust .
It plans to tighten the rules further , so all parents hosting foreign exchange students will face background checks .
In its report , Licensed to Hug , Civitas said that child protection regulations had " succeeded in poisoning the relationship between the generations " .
While in the past , adults would have helped children in distress or rebuked those misbehaving , there was now " a feeling that it is best not to become involved " , it said .
Report author Prof Frank Furedi , of Kent University , said : " From Girl Guiders to football coaches , from Christmas - time Santas to parents helping out in schools , volunteers - once regarded as pillars of the community - have been transformed in the regulatory and public imagination into potential child abusers , barred from any contact with children until the database gives them the green light . "
Instead of relying on Criminal Records Bureau ( CRB ) checks , adults should be allowed to use their " discretion and professional judgment " to decide who should work with children .
Foreign exchange A Home Office spokesman said the number of CRB checks on volunteers had grown year - on - year and in 2007 , they stopped 20,000 unsuitable people from " gaining work with vulnerable individuals " .

More from Today programme " There has to be a way to identify and weed out unsuitable people , but such checks do not mean an end to common sense , " he said .
Civitas called for child protection regulations to be relaxed , but the Home Office said that from October 2009 , a new Independent Safeguarding Authority would be created to tighten the rules even further .
Beverley Hughes , minister for Children , Schools and Families , said it would become a criminal offence for a parent to let a child stay at their home on a foreign exchange visit without having a CRB check .
HAVE YOUR SAY
If I 'm not with my wife , I do n't even look at a child , let alone smile at one steveL - G , United Kingdom " We also recommend that host families are given basic awareness of child protection issues and the contact details of the designated senior person within the school with responsibility for safeguarding issues , " she said .
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme , ChildLine founder Esther Rantzen said there were some examples of child protection legislation descending into " politically correct madness " .
But she said the correct response was to take a more " sensible " approach rather than change the law .
" I am a volunteer counsellor for ChildLine - I want checks , " she said .
" I was delighted to be checked .
There is nothing wrong with it .
" It does n't affect my approach to children , my feeling of empathy for children . "

Doctors from around the world have come together to help colleagues in Afghanistan
Facing a new disease such as Covid - 19 is particularly difficult for healthcare workers in low - resource and war - torn countries .
The charity Teleheal , is helping doctors in Afghanistan fight the coronavirus pandemic via telemedicine .
Doctors from the UK , US , Canada and Australia are volunteering for the charity , offering life - saving advice on their smartphones and laptops to their colleagues in Afghanistan .
They are sent patient reports , scans and x-ray images and respond with text messages or phone calls .
They discuss critical cases , send the latest World Health Organization guidelines and offer live weekly tutorials on coronavirus - related issues , including mental health and wellbeing .
The doctors are available 24/7 and are also operating in Syria , South Africa and Uganda .
The BBC spoke to Dr Waheed Arian , the founder of Teleheal and an emergency doctor for the NHS in the UK , Dr Mamosai Zewar , Senior Adviser to the Afghanistan Minister of Health , Dr Asif Arshad , a consultant anaesthetic and intensive care doctor for the NHS in the UK , and Teleheal volunteer and Dr Hayatullah Hemat , an ICU doctor in Kabul .

Lo spirito della danza non ha colore , né forma o dimensione ,
ma abbraccia il potere dell ’armonia , la forza e la bellezza che sono dentro di noi .
Ogni Anima che Danza , Giovane , Vecchia o che conviva con una disABILITÀ ,
crea e trasforma le idee in vita che si rinnova nell ’Arte del movimento .
La Danza è lo specchio che riflette l’impossibile e lo rende possibile .
Tutti possono toccare , sentire e vivere questa esperienza .
Risuona dal profondo del cuore , e l’Anima è il ritmo .
Ogni nostro movimento rivela la storia del genere umano .
È l’elemento dove lo Spirito Umano può abbracciare la completa Libertà .
Con un semplice tocco avviene qualcosa di meraviglioso .
Ciò che l’anima ricorda , il corpo lo esprime attraverso il movimento .
La Danza è la forza rigeneratrice alla quale tutti possono attingere .
Voi siete i miei occhi e io sono i vostri passi .
Celebrate il GIORNO INTERNAZIONALE DELLA DANZA .
Usate la Passione per la Danza come guarigione reciproca ,
Unificate la comunità della Danza
E soprattutto date il Meglio di Voi Stessi .
Il Potere e lo Spirito della Danza ci uniscono .

In chiusura di un mese dedicato alla danza e davvero densissimo di eventi ( qui la lista , siete ancora in tempo per assistere a tanti spettacoli ! ) si preannuncia davvero open la tre giorni per festeggiare quest ’arte in tutte le sue forme il 27/28/29 aprile 2008 con la chiusura in concomitanza della giornata internazionale delle danza proclamata dall ’UNESCO .
In città le iniziative sono dedicate a “ umani da zero a cent ’ anni ” come dichiarato dal manifesto
e sono OPEN persino i luoghi dove si svolgono inizaiative e performances : si va dal SACRO tempio , il Teatro alla Scala , ma anche gli Arcimboldi o la Scuola Paolo Grassi al PROFANO della piazzetta Dei mercanti , sotto la loggia , alla banchina del Tram di Corso Magenta 24 , allo spazio espositivo della Fabbrica del vapore .
Che dire di solito la settimana tra il 25 aprile e il 1° maggio , tra chiusure aziendali e pigrizia tipica primaverile , si decide di lasciare la città è fare l’ultima capatina in montagna , o quella gita nella capitale europea a prezzo scontato , ma stavolta non andate da nesuna parte .
Un mese così creativo e vivo , tra Fiera del mobile ed eventi dedicati al Design e apoteosi della danza Milano non lo ricordava da un pezzo… non resta che uscire di casa e godere di quello che offre la città !
Mi raccomando non perdetevi la mostra su Bacon a Palazzo Reale !
While some worry about the impact of John McCain ’s age on his physical health and his potential longevity in office , others are more concerned about his mental health .
The more than 1500 pages detailing McCain ’s medical information do not dispel the notion that the candidate ’s notorious temper may be related to his more than five years in a Vietnam prison camp .
Reporting on his health in May , the New York Times noted how McCain ’s doctors called him robust .
The end of the story also noted : “ As a prisoner of war , Mr. McCain told doc-tors , he had tried to commit suicide twice .
But by 1977 , he said he had ‘ all but forgotten the traumas of captivity . ’ ”
Yet Post - Traumatic Stress Syndrome ( PTSD ) — which is diagnosed in one of eight veterans returning from the hell that is Iraq — did not appear in the American Psychiatric Association ’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders until 1980 , seven years after McCain ’s release from Hanoi .
Anger and depression are two key symptoms of PTSD .
Much has been said about the government ’s failure to provide veterans with the medical help they need .
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that only 23 percent to 40 percent of soldiers suffering from PTSD seek help because of the stigma the military attaches to psychiatric treatment .
In John McCain : An American Odyssey ( Free Press , 2007 ) author Robert Timberg ( who knows , the candidate has said , “ more about me than I do ” ) calls McCain ’s legendary rages “ out of all proportion to the provocation . ”
He has also cited the sound of jangling keys as a trigger for McCain ’s POW - related nightmares .
Columnist Sidney Blumenthal has quoted McCain as calling colleagues “ asshole ” and “ fucking jerk ” on the Senate floor .
Even if this were considered “ normal ” behavior , it would be difficult to classify it as “ presidential . ”
As with Hillary Clinton ’s red telephone commercial , all this raises a question : if the call comes at 3 am , do voters want the awakened president to be prone to disproportionate rages or trauma associated with jangling keys ?
McCain ’s claim to superior “ foreign policy ” skills is based on his Vietnam War experience .
By that standard , the approximately 500,000 US soldiers who have served in Iraq would be quali-fied to become president , though roughly 80,000 of them will experience post - traumatic stress , and some of them try to commit suicide virtually every day .
In the end , the Arizona senator ’s undoing may not be his age , but very life experience that makes him — even to his critics — a war hero .
Some counter by noting that McCain ’s mental health is no worse than was Richard Nixon ’s — but that ’s hardly a ringing endorsement .
Presidential candidates vie for the faith and confidence of voters .
John McCain still has to show that he ’s up to the task — and he needs to do it without flying into a rage when someone asks a legitimate question about his mental health .

Is Barack Obama in some sense Clinton 2.0 when it comes to the public ’s perception of what the candidate could do for the economy ?
Just as Clinton benefited in 1992 from a feeling of economic malaise in the country , so too is is Obama getting advantages from the public ’s having announced to pollster ’s that the economy their number one concern .
Of course , the vast majority of Americans is convinced that the Iraq War has worsened the country ’s economic posture , so the two are not unrelated .
A Reuters / Zogby poll found :
‘ Dissatisfaction with U.S. economic policy continues to increase , with 89 % who now view the nation ’s economic policy as fair or poor , up from 84 % who said the same last month – 55 % now give U.S. economic policy a “ poor ” rating .
The vast majority of Democrats ( 96 % ) and political independents ( 91 % ) have a negative view of the nation ’s economic policy , while 80 % of Republicans now share those feelings , an increase from 71 % who said the same in June . ’
Republicans who think the relative decline in violence in Iraq will save their bacon should remember that the Gulf War was an unambiguous win for Bush Sr. , but he still lost to Clinton .
A lesser disaster following upon a major catastrophe is a much worse platform on which to campaign than the one Bush Sr. had .
Of course , the crisis in the Gulf was politically ambiguous because it had put back up petroleum prices ( they rose from $ 9 a barrel in 1986 to over $ 40 a barrel in 1991 ) .
In any case , in 1992 the American public was just not that concerned with the victory over Iraq in Kuwait ; they were worried about a real estate bust and a recession ( which was technically ending , but these things are never known for sure as they are happening . )
The Savings and Loan scandal , which cost the public $ 100 bn . and occurred because the Republican had fired the auditors of these financial institutions and coddled the white collar criminals who funded their campaigns , was fresh in people ’s minds .
McCain , of course , was close to a major figure in that S&L scandal .
The bank scandals ( deriving in part from the Republican Party ’s tendency to weaken or ignore regulations constraining corruption in big business , thus promoting fraud on a vast scale ) , the spike in oil prices , the anxieties around recession– all of this must strike any observer who lived through 1992 as eerily familiar .
There is even a third party challenge by Bob Barr that may take votes away from McCain just as Ross Perot took them 2 to 1 away from Bush Sr. rather than Clinton .
Zogby / Reuters report that :
‘ Democrat Barack Obama continues to maintain his lead over Republican John McCain in the race for U.S. President and is viewed as the candidate who could best manage the U.S. economy – even as nearly half of likely voters list the economy as their top election issue . . .
Obama leads McCain , 47 % to 40 % , with 13 % saying they prefer someone else or are not yet sure about their selection in the race — just a slight shift from June ’s survey , when Obama led McCain 47 % to 42 % .
While Obama maintains a significant lead among women , among men the candidates are now deadlocked at 44 % , erasing the six - point lead among men McCain held in June .
Both candidates receive strong support among voters from their own party , but the 22 - point lead among political independents Obama held in June has withered and now stands at 44 % for Obama , compared with 41 % for McCain . ’
A 7 point lead is well beyond the margin of error .
And so is the erasure of McCain ’s lead among men .
If the men are splitting their vote , Obama will win , since the women favor him by a significant margin .
Again , something like that happened with Clinton .
Clinton and Obama are both policy wonks and people it is clear you could trust an economy to ( unlike Bush and McCain , who are all about giveaways to the rich , their own social class ) .
But Clinton and Obama are also hunks , whom men admire for their lithe physicality and over whom women swoon .
In a bad economy , Americans seem to want to be saved not so much by a man on a white horse as by a brilliant hunk .
A team of Penn State scientists has discovered a new ultra-small species of bacteria that has survived for more than 120,000 years within the ice of a Greenland glacier at a depth of nearly two miles .
The microorganism 's ability to persist in this low - temperature , high - pressure , reduced - oxygen , and nutrient - poor habitat makes it particularly useful for studying how life , in general , can survive in a variety of extreme environments on Earth and possibly elsewhere in the solar system .
The work will be presented by Jennifer Loveland - Curtze , a senior research associate in the laboratory led by Jean Brenchley , Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Penn State , at the 108th American Society for Microbiology General Meeting in Boston , Massachusetts on 3 June 2008 at 10:30 a.m. ( Extreme Environments - I , poster N - 156 ) .
This new species is among the ubiquitous , yet mysterious , ultra - small bacteria , which are so tiny that the cells are able to pass through microbiological filters .
In fact , some species have been found living in the ultra - purified water used for dialysis .
" Ultra - small cells could be unknown contaminants in media and medical solutions that are thought to have been sterilized using filters , " said Loveland - Curtze .
The ultra -small size of the new species could be one explanation for why it was able to survive for so long in the Greenland glacier .
Called Chryseobacterium greenlandensis , the species is related genetically to certain bacteria found in fish , marine mud , and the roots of some plants .
The organism is one of only about 10 scientifically described new species originating from polar ice and glaciers .
To study the bacterium in the laboratory , the research team , which also includes Senior Research Associate Vanya Miteva , filtered the cells from melted ice and incubated them in the cold in low - nutrient , oxygen - free solutions .
The scientists then characterized the genetic , physiological , biochemical , and structural features of the species .
The team hopes that its studies of this species , as well as others living in the Greenland glacier , will reveal more about how cells survive and how they may alter their biochemistry and physiology over time .
" Microbes comprise up to one - third or more of the Earth 's biomass , yet fewer than 8,000 microbes have been described out of the approximately 3,000,000 that are presumed to exist , " said Loveland - Curtze .
" The description of this one species is a significant step in the overall endeavor to discover , cultivate , and use the special features held by these organisms . "

Some of the Strange Laws in the Bible
The inspiration for this section originates with Christians and Christian groups using the Bible to justify horrible actions , most notable in recent years has been gay bashing .
Rev. Fred Phelps protests any people who support gays , as well as homosexual funerals with colorful signs reading " God Hates Fags " or " Burn in Hell FAG !!! " .
Dr. Laura , a disgustingly boring radio personality , as well as failed TV personality ... not to mention a bad source of advice , also uses the Bible to justify her dislike of homosexuals .
The Ku Klux Klan uses the Bible to justify their actions , as well as abortion clinic bombers , mail bombers , and dictators / tyrants throughout history .
But what does the Bible really say about things like this ?
How does the Bible expect us to act ?
Let us find out .
Homosexuals MUST DIE !!!
The killing of homosexuals is condoned and encouraged in the wonderful laws of Leviticus .
Leviticus 20:13 clearly states " If a man also lie with mankind , as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them . "
Well there you have it , Homosexuality is wrong , and they must pay the ultimate price ...
IN THE NAME OF GOD !!!
Who else should n't people do ?
Do n't let cattle graze with other kinds of Cattle ( Leviticus 19:19 )
Do n't have a variety of crops on the same field .
( Leviticus 19:19 )
Do n't wear clothes made of more than one fabric ( Leviticus 19:19 )
Do n't cut your hair nor shave .
( Leviticus 19:27 )
Any person who curseth his mother or father , must be killed .
( Leviticus 20:9 )
Have you ever done that ?
If a man cheats on his wife , or vise versa , both the man and the woman must die .
( Leviticus 20:10 ) .
I wonder if Dr. Laura would like that one to be enforced ?
If a man sleeps with his father 's wife ... both him and his father 's wife is to be put to death .
( Leviticus 20:11 )
If a man sleeps with his wife and her mother they are all to be burnt to death .
( Leviticus 20:14 )
If a man or woman has sex with an animal , both human and animal must be killed .
( Leviticus 20:15 - 16 ) .
I guess you should kill the animal since they were willing participants .
Are they crazy ?
If a man has sex with a woman on her period , they are both to be " cut off from their people " ( Leviticus 20:18 )
Psychics , wizards , and so on are to be stoned to death .
( Leviticus 20:27 )
If a priest 's daughter is a whore , she is to be burnt at the stake .
( Leviticus 21:9 )
People who have flat noses , or is blind or lame , cannot go to an altar of God ( Leviticus 21:17 - 18 )
Anyone who curses or blasphemes God , should be stoned to death by the community .
( Leviticus 24:14-16 )
Do n't let cattle graze with other kinds of Cattle ( Leviticus 19:19 )
One must wonder why there are so many people wanting to site Leviticus for gay bashing , but they never mention these rules .
How strange .
It is common that a Christian will blow off these old rules with " Jesus came to change the laws , so these are outmoded , and we do n't need them " , but throughout Leviticus God states that these laws are to be followed forever .
Hmmm .
The Ten Commandments
The Ten Commandments are very famous examples of Biblical rules , but it can be amazing how few people know what 's included in them .
Let 's recap .
1 . You are to have no other gods before God
2 . You are not to make any graven images .
3 . Do n't use the Lord 's name in vain
4. Keep the Sabbath holy
5 . Honor your mother and father
6 . Do not kill
7 . Do not commit adultery .
8 . Do n't steal
9 . Do n't bear false witness .
10 .
Do n't covet the neighbor 's house .
Here are some things you may not know were included within the commandments .
People seem to think the second commandment says you are n't supposed to make a graven image of God , and that 's it .
But you are not to make any graven images of anything in heaven , in the earth , or in the water .
This would include no graven images of fish , moles , worms , birds , shrimp , ants , and all sorts of things .
One must wonder why God was so worried about these things that he felt the need to put these ahead of murder and stealing .
In the third commandment , people think that means we should n't work , but just go to church on the Sabbath .
But NOBODY is to do any work , including your employees , your cattle , nor anyone who is visiting you .
While you are not coveting your neighbor 's house , also refrain from coveting other things he owns , like his wife , ass , and ox .
The Often Overlooked Rules in Deuteronomy
The book Deuteronomy also lays some laws down , but nobody ever mentions them , but why not take a look at those laws also ?
Anyone who dreams or prophesizes anything that is against God , or anyone who tries to turn you from God , is to be put to death .
( Deuteronomy 13:5 )
If anyone , even your own family suggests worshipping another God , kill them .
( Deuteronomy 13:6-10 )
If you find out a city worships a different god , destroy the city and kill all of it's inhabitants ... even the animals .
( Deuteronomy 13:12 -15 )
Kill anyone with a different religion .
( Deuteronomy 17:2 -7 )
This shows you that it really is scary that people want to make the Bible part of the law .
Not to mention it sheds light on why Christians are so overly oppressive to those who do n't share their belief .
Sick , sick , sick .
It can also be said that any person who uses the Bible to justify beating a homosexual , is a hypocrite if he does n't adhere to all of these laws .

Seaweed could be about to play a key role in solving Ireland 's growing energy crisis .
It has traditionally been seen associated with upmarket cosmetic firms or subsistence farming in Gaeltacht communities .
However , Dr Stefan Kraan , manager of the Irish Seaweed Centre in Galway has claimed that " a frenzy of interest " is developing over the potential role " of seaweed in the field of energy production " .
Ireland 's Communications Minister Eamon Ryan said that while it was not anticipated '' that there would be a Klondyke - or Clontibret - style gold rush down to the beaches , serious people in the energy world are now saying seaweed biofuels are a real runner . "
At the recent Energy Ireland conference it was revealed that the nation was so far behind in the cultivation of biofuels that a country which has marketed itself as the garden of Europe may have to import biofuels from overseas .
So far the attempt to cultivate new sources of energy has concentrated on wind and wave power .
However , Minister Ryan said : " Ireland will certainly be at a serious advantage if someone does crack the seaweed conundrum .
The one thing we do have after all is a lot of ocean out there . "
Scientists from the Irish Seaweed Centre share the minister 's optimism over the possibility of seaweed and algae becoming the second generation of biofuels .
Up to now biofuels have been sourced from crops such as sugar cane and corn , but scientific advances mean brown seaweed could become a major source of energy .
In a recent keynote address at a conference in Galway titled Algae and Biofuels : Quo Vadis , Professor Michael A Borowitzka of the Murdoch University in Australia said that " compared to other bio-energy crops such as rapeseed , canola , peanut and oil palm , a number of species of algae have higher oil content and can grow in saline waters ' ' .
At the same conference Dr Kraan noted that the use of algae would have the additional benefit of not having the negative image " of terrestrial biomass resources " .
The growing amount of crops being grown to supply fuel has been blamed for the increase in world food prices , water use and the destruction of the national landscape .
In contrast , seaweed is a rich sustainable marine resource which does not impact on the use of agricultural land .

It was probably unintentional , but “ The Incredible Hulk ” is much more than a summer afternoon ’s escape ; it ’s clearly a satire , a perfect depiction of Washington ’s boneheaded belief that firepower can resolve any problem .
Although the creature is obviously bulletproof , soldiers shoot him anyway .
They get bigger guns , then tanks .
He survives .
They get cannons .
They shoot and shoot .
The Hulk sulks for a bit and then is fine .
Unfortunately , combative redundancy is also our strategy for fighting drug trafficking .
In South America , we throw money , military equipment and aerial fumigation at the problem , and as a result , coca growers relocate , regroup and production thrives .
We repeat the cycle .
Yes , there may be occasional dips in production after a particularly successful mission ( the Hulk sometimes goes for months “ without incident ” ) , but inevitably the coca growers , cocaine producers and drug traffickers return .
A recent report by the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime found that , despite billions of U.S. dollars spent on intensive aerial fumigation , manual eradication and aggressive interdiction efforts , coca growth in Colombia rose 27 % between 2006 and 2007 .
Colombian farmers have planted coca in a combined acreage roughly equal to the gargantuan sprawl of Los Angeles .
U.S. officials are shocked .
Although this is proof that neither fumigation nor manual eradication work -- farmers develop herbicide - resistant strains of coca or simply scatter their operations -- here ’s betting that Washington will continue to help Colombia fumigate and manually eradicate .
In other words , it will just keep shooting and shooting at the bulletproof monster .
Meanwhile , almost every other government in the region is united in opposition to this summer - blockbuster approach to drug suppression .
They understand , as ours seems incapable of doing , that rural aid to farmers is the best weapon against coca cultivation .
Not guns , not planes , not poison dropped from the sky .

Eight years and $ 5 billion .
To be fair , all that money has had some positive effects .
Colombia is a more stable country .
President Alvaro Uribe has seriously weakened the leftist rebels who threatened to overrun the country and who finance themselves through drug trafficking .
What it has n’t done , however , is halt cocaine production and trafficking in the Andean region .
Our two main allies , Colombia and Peru , are also the world ’s top two cocaine traffickers .
In the grand scheme of hit movie plotting , it makes sense that the Hulk is n’t easy to kill -- his indestructibility sets up Parts II and III .
But Washington is now on Revenge of the Drug War Parts VIII and IX .

Paris Hilton Shoe Collection Launch Photos
has always suggested that she is a business woman with multiple irons in the fire .
She may have gained some believers yesterday when she launched the Paris Hilton Shoe Collection at several Las Vegas venues .
She made appearances at Macy's and Caesers Palace to meet customers and introduce the new footwear line .
The celebrity is normally joined at the hip with boyfriend Benji Madden .
The Good Charlotte guitarist is also part owner in a clothing line called DCMA Collective .
We have recent photos of Benji and Paris in matching outfits - odd but true .
Check out more Paris poses below .

Actually , he ’s “ The Waiter ” behind the anonymous ( until now ) four - year - old blog Waiter Rant , and he ’s got a new book of the same name out in stores today chronicling his nine - year career waiting tables in the city ’s affluent suburbs ( he wo n’t divulge the true identity of “ The Bistro ” ) .
Anthony Bourdain has called it “ the front - of - the - house version of ‘ Kitchen Confidential , ’ ” his stomach - churning restaurant exposé that changed the way New Yorkers ordered food .
What Kind of Tipper Are You ?
When Waiters Deserve Bad Tips
Similarly , whether you fear Dublanica or sympathize with him , you may think twice before treating him – or any other waiter – shabbily again .
Because if you still insist on stiffing him after reading his book , he ’ll just put a friendly little note ( “ customer ’s an a – – hole , ” perhaps ) under your name in the Open Table reservation system .
Good luck getting that 8 p.m. table next Saturday night .
Lesson No. 2 : “ If you never get the table you want at your favorite restaurant . . . someone at the restaurant does n’t like you . ”
Because if there ’s anything to be learned from “ Waiter Rant , ” it ’s that there are consequences to behaving like a self - entitled jerk .
“ I think a misconception people have of me is that I treat everyone askance – that I give a hard time to every customer – but that ’s not true , ” says Dublanica over dinner one evening at Danny Meyer ’s Eleven Madison Park .
Dublanica , 40 , is dressed in preppy khaki pants and a navy blazer .
“ I would give a hard time only to the ones who deserved it . ”
Among the folks who have “ deserved ” to see Dublanica ’s “ thousand - yard waiter stare ” are those who call him names , those who feign food poisoning to get out of paying the bill and those who make “ unreasonable demands ” ( “ ‘ Hi waiter , I want sushi . ’
‘ Um , we ’re an Italian restaurant , ma’am , we do n’t have sushi . ’
‘ But you have tuna , do n’t you ? ' ” ) .
Foodies are particularly irksome , according to Dublanica , “ because they ask questions they already know the answers to . ”
( “ You do n’t have super - fancy balsamic vinegar , do you ? ” )
Lesson No. 3 : “ It ’s gotten to the point where I can tell how much money I ’m going to make off a customer within 10 seconds of meeting them . ”
Of course , as any diner who has been treated unfairly in a restaurant knows , not everyone always gets the same level of service .
And profiling diners based on age , sex and race is still rampant in the industry .
“ I try not to fall into that trap , ” says Dublanica .
“ I ’ve had waiters say to me , ‘ this group does n’t tip well ’ – whatever .
I do n’t believe that .
The people who have given me the worst tips of my life have been white Anglo - Saxon males . ”
Lesson No. 4 : “ Restaurants are places where people struggle to make a living . ”
At Eleven Madison Park , a small army of servers caters to our every whim .
Why would anyone want to ruin this bit of dinner theater with the sordid backstage details contained in Dublanica ’s book ?
For Dublanica , the answer boils down to responsibility .
If you care whether the pig you are eating was humanely raised , should n’t you also care about the people preparing it ?
“ You need to know where your food comes from , ” he says .
“ The same thing holds true for restaurants .
You should know that the waiter does n’t make a salary and a tip [ or ] that a good percentage of restaurants do n’t treat their employees well .
“ You ’re always gonna have people who say [ that ] you should be lucky you get 10 percent – and those people are lousy customers and you do n’t want them anyway .
Then you ’re gonna have people who genuinely do n’t know [ what goes on in the restaurant industry ] and are interested and maybe they ’ll be annoyed , like with Anthony Bourdain ’s book . ”
But even perfectly nice customers like “ The Waiter ” have to deal with the occasional dining snafu :
When it ’s time to leave Eleven Madison Park , we notice a charge for a $ 75 glass of dessert wine that was never ordered and is eventually removed from the bill .
Lesson No. 5 : “ Always examine the check ! ”
We leave in excess of 20 percent anyway .
Maybe the waiter was just having a bad night .
Tonight at 7 , Dublanica will sign copies of “ The Waiter ” at Borders Columbus Circle , at the Time Warner Center ; ( 212 ) 823-9775 .

Update ( README CAREFULLY ) :
I am starting to see hyperlinks to his post with only some of the findings being treated as the link title ( eg. X is 100 times faster than Y , X faster than Z ) .
I emphasise once again that I have carefully indicated in the original post that this is but one of many possible microbenchmarks and that you should treat the results as one of many data points .
Given the comments
I 've received and some of the links I 've seen to this post , if I was to make this posting anew , I would choose to assign the title of this post as " Implementing an identical object oriented solution to the Josephus Problem in Java / C++ / Ruby / JRuby / Python / Jython / Groovy and measuring the performance results thereof . "
This post compares performance across various languages for a specific micro benchmark ( actually it is n't really a microbenchmark - it is simply a benchmark for a specific piece of logic - but thats the closest word I could think of ) .
Last week , while preparing for a presentation - Contrasting Java and Dynamic Languages , I came across this interesting Perl / Python / Ruby Comparison which focused on comparing the code style of different languages .
I thought it would be interesting to use the same to get some actual benchmarks based on the same .
Note that you could also use the code segments below to get a feel for different syntactic flavours .
However since I have strived to keep the code as similar as possible to each other , some of the advanced syntactic sugar of the dynamic languages is not on display here .
Problem Statement
Quoting from the post linked to above :
Flavius Josephus was a roman historian of Jewish origin .
During the Jewish - Roman wars of the first century AD , he was in a cave with fellow soldiers , 40 men in all , surrounded by enemy Roman troops .
They decided to commit suicide by standing in a ring and counting off each third man .
Each man so designated was to commit suicide ... Josephus , not wanting to die , managed to place himself in the position of the last survivor .
In the general version of the problem , there are n soldiers numbered from 1 to n and each k- th soldier will be eliminated .
The count starts from the first soldier .
What is the number of the last survivor
Design
I actually changed the design of the solution as compared to the original post .
Instead of using the deeply recursive calls as used in the earlier post , I decided to split the logic into two classes , and use loop iteration instead of recursion .
It is my belief that we tend to do loop iterations far more frequently than recursions , and the resultant class design having two classes - one to indicate a Chain and one reflecting a Person seemed more appropriate to me .
Logic
The Chain object contains a reference to one person ( first ) who is but one member in a circular linked list .
Each person object has a reference to its previous ( prev ) and next ( next ) person in the circle .
When the kill loop starts , it sets a threshold ( nth ) .
The count starts with 1 from the first person .
Each person when asked to shout , checks if the shout count ( shout ) is less than the threshold ( nth ) .
If less , the person just returns an incremented count .
If the two are same , the person in effect commits suicide .
In doing so the person , updates the next reference of its prev , and prev reference of its next to take himself off the circle and keep the circle consistent , finally returning a shout of 1 ( which is what the next person in the list will shout ) .
The code does not have any comments ( sorry ! ) and all the console outputs have been removed so that the benchmarking activity is not interfered with by the IO overheads .
The results
All the results are as observed on my notebook with the following config OS : Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon 7.10 Kernel : 2.6.22-15- generic CPU : Intel ( R ) Core ( TM ) Duo CPU T2600 @ 2.16GHz RAM : 2GB

Updates :
Ken suggested syntactic improvements ( see comments below ) which lead to even faster ruby execution times : jruby : 80 microseconds , ruby 1.9 : 89 microseconds , ruby 1.8.6 : 380 microseconds .
The table above has been updated
Cato requested a run using Groovy 1.6 beta 1 - have updated the same .
Big improvement
Nicholas Riley suggested introducing slots and using " is not " and " is " in the if conditions for the python code .
Updated the results to reflect the figure of 192 and 632 micro seconds for CPython and Jython .
The figure was 182 microseconds for CPython and 131 microseconds for Jython if I did not use the new style classes , however I did not reflect the same , since most new code is likely to be using new style classes .
However this does indicate one possible performance optimisation if your code does not depend upon new style classes .
Moreover makes me really interested in waiting for the Jython performance optimisations for new style classes that Nicholas suggests are on their shortlist .
Tim Fountain in a comment below indicates that on his hardware ( core 2 Quad ) with Ubuntu Hardy Heron , Ruby 1.8.6 ( same version as above ) performs somewhat faster ( 15 % ) whereas upgraded version of Python and PHP run much faster ( 63 % for python and 83 % for ruby ) .
Another difference in config- he is running 64 bit .
python - version 2.5.2 : - 138 microseconds ruby - 1.8.6 ( 2007-09 - 24 patchlevel 111 ) [ x86_64-linux ] :321 microseconds PHP - 5.2.4-2ubuntu5.1 with Suhosin - Patch 0.9.6.2 ( cli ) : 323 microseconds .
Peter Lupo requested a reduction in line count for Java since the conventional way is to have the opening braces not on a separate independent line .
Given the fact that it is a fair comment , I have reduced the line count of java to 86 ( did n't physically change the code - 86 = 101 - 15 opening curly braces ) .
Added another finding of using python with psyco
C++ - Added results using Alberto Bignotti's alternative code with customised memory reuse management
Summarisation
The following are the results .
Given the long code blocks , I am presenting the summarisation first followed by the code .
Note :
This can only be treated as one particular benchmark .
The results are a little atypical with respect to my general understanding .
Advise caution against drawing broad conclusions based on this benchmark alone but would suggest that you could treat this as one data point amongst many .
People better versed than me in the details of language runtimes might be able to suggest why some of the results seem surprising or atypical .
Java / C++ Rock :
The performance of Java and C++ was head and shoulders beyond other languages ( nearly 100 times faster ) .
My thought is that while a difference of 10 x was only to be expected - this difference was just way too massive
Java is faster than C++ :
Though I had read about other microbenchmarks reaching the same conclusions , it is the first time I actually ran one where Java was faster .
There are many others I have run where C++ beats Java quite handsomely .
More importantly - the performance of C++ worsened by almost 40 % once I added code which started freeing memory that was being allocated ( there 's still a small memory leak in the code - there is no Chain destructor which will clean up first ) .
I would later definitely want to look at the impact of garbage collection in this context , and whether the Java garbage collector simply was much faster than the hand crafted new - delete calls in C ++.
Update : Using the customised memory management ( which is not used in any of the other examples ) but the same algorithm as in the code written by Alberto , C++ is much faster than Java
Ruby 1.9 is twice as fast as Python :
While it has been known for a while Ruby 1.9 is much faster than Ruby 1.8.6 , heres one more supporting data point .
I was expecting ruby 1.9 to give python a run for its performance money .
But at least in this particular context it seems to be much much faster .
JRuby is faster than Ruby : Even ruby 1.9 .
Very interesting indeed .
Jython still has some catching up to do :
Though in the ballpark as the other languages , it was the slowest in the pack .
Overhead of dynamism is dominant : I have no idea if JRuby ran much faster because of the java bytecode or because of its implementation ( though its performance was not even remotely close to that of Java ) .
However even after I compiled groovy code , to java bytecode , it still ran much slower than python and ruby .
It seems the overhead of supporting dynamic constructs is much more dominant than any benefits that one gets out of compilation ( whether to java byte code or to intermediate compiled files ) .
I think the argument that because something compiles to java bytecode it is likely to be fast should be looked at a little carefully .
PHP stays at the rear end :
Though I benchmarked PHP for the first time , I was n't completely surprised by the fact that PHP could only manage to be faster than Jython .
Update :
There are many comments to this post including those from cwilbur who benchmarks perl using a idiomatic method , Paddy3118 who offers an optimised algorithm for python , and peter lawrey who offers an optimised algorithm for Java .
I would like to state that each of their solutions offer superior performance than that what has been described here .
However I believe any benchmark comparison should compare apples to apples .
Should these contributions be taken into account and be reflected in the table above ?
I certainly believe there is a case to do so as an exercise using a different algorithm .
However to ensure that it is a fair comparison , one has to modify all the code in all other languages also to reflect the same algorithm .
Only then can we get an apple to apples comparison .
That is probably an exercise for another post .
Is the algorithm I have chosen the fastest - No .
However I believe it is a very readable algorithm and if one ignores the IO with networks and databases and files , it is probably close to the kind of code many programmers write ( and maintain ) on a day to day basis .
It has been consistently implemented in all the languages .
Readers should be aware that there are algorithms which will deliver much superior performance - but they will also make the performance superior in all the languages ( perhaps to slightly differing extents and thus possibly somewhat different results ) .
The code
For all you who are either interested in running it for yourself or would like to perhaps explore this in more detail , .. here 's the code .
Note that I am not equally competent across all languages .
So if you believe there is something that could be more appropriate way to code the same , do post a comment .
One of the things I have tried to do is to ensure that the code remains more or less similar across all languages .
Also I have used getter - setters or skipped them based on my understanding of the generally accepted convention for users of the language .

The Pueblo County Sheriff 's website , which pictures Sinclair under the word ' Wanted , ' cites felony theft and forgery charges .
Obama accuser has long rap sheet
Larry Sinclair is wanted in Colorado , but you can catch him today at the National Press Club .
Sinclair is familiar to political junkies and reporters as the source of outlandish allegations about Senator Barack Obama , tales that began with sex and drugs and moved on to murder .
Advertisement
The Duluth , Minn. , resident is the sort of figure who appears at the margins of every presidential campaign , and both Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton had their own obscure accusers with dramatic allegations .
But as the old media ignores him , Sinclair has taken full advantage of the Internet , and a video in which he makes his claims that have been viewed more than 900,000 times on YouTube .
This afternoon , he 's reserved the Holeman Lounge at downtown Washington 's National Press Club
to try to lend his story the legitimacy that comes with national media attention .
Sinclair 's biography , though , may get in the way of that pitch : Public records and court filings reveal that he has a 27 - year criminal record , with a specialty in crimes involving deceit .
The record includes forgery charges in two states , one of which drew Sinclair a 16 - year jail sentence .
The Pueblo County , Colo. , Sheriff 's Office also has an outstanding warrant for Sinclair 's arrest for forging an acquaintance 's signature and stealing her tax refunds .
" It is what it is , " said Sinclair 's spokesman , Montgomery Blair Sibley , of his client 's criminal record .
" He 's not hiding from it , he 's not denying it . "
Sinclair has , however , addressed elements of his criminal past on his own blog and in court filings punctuated by unusual spellings and capitalizations .
Addressing the Pueblo County theft charges , Sinclair swore in a 2004 affidavit that his " ALLEGED VICTIM SEEKS TO USE DEFENDANT AS SCAPE GOAT FOR HER HUSBANDS AND BROTHERS PROBLEMS WITH MEXICAN DRUG DEALERS . "
Sinclair 's affidavit , which he posted to his blog , accompanied a request to a Colorado judge to dismiss the warrant on the grounds that Sinclair was " disabled with [ a ] severe spine injury and nerve damage , " that returning to Colorado would put his life in danger , and that he was " terminally ill . "
Sinclair , who is still alive , is 46 , stands 5 ' 7 " , and weights 168 pounds , according to arrest records .
Colorado records list him with 13 aliases , including " Larye Vizcarra Avila " and " Mohammed Gahanan . "
His story has generally been ignored by the mainstream media , because he 's been unable to substantiate his allegations .
He has come to public attention recently , however , because his planned appearance at the National Press Club drew complaints from a wide array of prominent liberal bloggers , led by Firedoglake 's Jane Hamsher .
Their petition to prevent Sinclair from renting space at the club – which bloggers feared would lend him credibility – drew more than 11,000 signatures .
Press Club President Sylvia Smith said Sinclair had rented space at the club , which does n't censor speakers .
" I 'm not aware that we 've ever turned anybody away for content , " she said , adding that Sinclair 's allegations " do n't seem very credible . "
Politico is n't reprinting Sinclair 's allegations because they are unsubstantiated .
This February , the website Whitehouse.com reportedly offered Sinclair $ 100,000 if he could pass a polygraph test verifying his claims .
He took them up on it , and the site said in a press release that the polygraph organizers said his results " indicated deception . "
Sinclair then suggested the polygraph 's sponsors had been bribed to skew the results against him , an allegation his lawyer , Sibley , said he would expand on at his press conference .
Sibley is best known as the lawyer for the " D.C. Madam , " the late Deborah Jeane Palfrey .
Earlier this year , the Florida Bar Association suspended Sibley 's license to practice law , in part for being a " vexatious litigant , " a suspension that applies in Washington , D.C. , as well .
Wednesday , Whitehouse.com has scheduled a competing press conference outside the National Press Club to discuss the results of the polygraph .
Sinclair 's brushes with the government long predate his recent interest in Senator Obama .
The details of his criminal record surfaced after he filed a defamation suit in federal court in Washington , D.C. , against three anonymous online critics with names like TubeSockTedD who had written , among other claims , that he was living in a mental institution at the time he allegedly met Obama .
Sinclair denies the claim .
In response to his suit , a lawyer for the anonymous bloggers hired local attorneys and private investigators , and dug up details of Sinclair 's criminal record from Colorado , Florida , and South Carolina .
The lawyer , Paul Levy of the nonprofit Public Citizen Litigation Group , provided his client 's filings in federal court , which are publicly available , to Politico .
The records tell the story of an itinerant life of small - time crime and bad checks , punctuated by stretches of jail time in two states .
He was first arrested on a larceny charge in 1981 in Denver , according to his Colorado arrest record , as filed in federal court .
In 1985 , he was convicted of theft and of forging a check in Florida , and sentenced to a year in jail , according to Florida records filed in federal court .
After the Florida episode , according to the records , he returned to Colorado , where he faced check fraud and credit card charges in 1986 .
Then , in 1987 , he was convicted in Colorado on more serious forgery charges , and sentenced to 16 years in jail .
In prison , according to state records filed in federal court , Sinclair was disciplined 97 times for infractions including assault , threats , drug possession , intimidation , and verbal abuse , most recently in
1996 .
" He has not institutionalized well , " a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Corrections , Liz McDonough , told the Denver Post in 1996 after a month - long Sinclair hunger strike .
She said he had served time in prisons in Buena Vista , Delta , Limon and Canon City before being transferred to the state 's maximum security penitentiary in 1993 .
In the summer of 1996 , according to Colorado 's state court database , he began proceedings to formally change his name from LA Rye Viz. Avila to Larry Wayne Sinclair .
By 1999 , according to a mention in a local newspaper , he was out of jail and living in Pueblo , Colo .
The Public Citizen investigator in Colorado stated that Sinclair 's outstanding legal troubles there appear to date from 2001 , and that Sinclair 's effort to convince the judge in 2004 to dismiss those charges failed .
The Pueblo County Sheriff 's website , which pictures Sinclair under the word " Wanted , " cites felony theft and forgery charges .
Sinclair was also arrested and charged with disorderly conduct in South Carolina last September , according to state records filed in federal court .
Sinclair has said that he tried to contact Obama in 2007 to discuss his claims and was ignored , forcing him to go public .
On January 18 , 2008 , a one - minute - and - 42 - second video was posted to YouTube .
It features Sinclair , speaking in a high voice and wearing a red shirt and blue baseball cap , reciting his allegations and addressing Obama .
" I challenge you to take a polygraph test , " he says in the video .
Since then , he 's promoted and elaborated on his claims , and engaged in intense online exchanges with infuriated Obama supporters on his blog and in federal court , where Sinclair and Sibley 's defamation claim has suffered a series of legal setbacks .
Obama 's spokesman declined to comment on any aspect of Sinclair 's story , or his appearance at the press club .
Despite the warrant for Sinclair 's arrest , he appears likely to stay out of jail , as long as he stays out of Colorado .
Pueblo County Undersheriff J.R.
Hall said that the warrant does n't allow for extradition from out of state .
" I doubt very seriously we 're going to be in that jurisdiction tomorrow , " Undersheriff Hall said of Washington , D.C .
Sinclair 's notoriety , and his scheduled press conference , however , has drawn the interest of the Colorado authorities .
" We 've notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation , and they will investigate , " Hall said .
Disclosure : Public Citizen , which represents the bloggers Sinclair sued , also represents Ben Smith in an unrelated case .
前回に引き続き、今年も友人＆奥さん＆犬連れでアップルストア総本山のパロアルト店に並んでゲットしました、iPhone
3G 。
もうiPhone自体についてはあちこちで語り尽くされていますし、今さら私が何かを付け加えたところで、いつも言ってることの繰り返しになってしまうのですが、もう一度あらためて伝えたいことがあります。
i Phoneは 、1980年代にパーソナルコンピュータが登場して以来の、約30年ぶりに登場したパラダイムセッターであり、コンピュータ業界、ソフトウェア業界、ウェブ業界、モバイル業界、果てはゲーム業界まで、あらゆる関連セクタの向かう先をたった一つのプロダクトで決定づけてしまったモンスターデバイスです。
おい、そりゃいくらなんでも言い過ぎだろう、と言いたくなる方が多いのはわかります。今のiPhone 3Gを使ってみて、まぁそれなりに綺麗だし使い心地もいいしデザインもいいけど、普通に使ってる分には別に取り立ててここがダントツにスゴイ！みたいなものはないし、そこまで言い切るほどのものか？そう感じるのが普通でしょう。
でも、たぶん、あなたと私とでは見ている部分が違うのです。
私は、現時点のiPhoneには、製品としてそれほどとんがった部分があるわけではないと思っています。フツウの人に使いやすくデザインされた、ひねたところのない、純粋に「使いやすさ」と「クオリティ感」で勝負している完成度の高いスマートフォンのようなもの、という理解をしたければしてもいい。たしかに、その方向性においてもiPhoneはずば抜けているのですから。しかし、それは30年に一度の奇跡と呼べるほどの本質ではないのです。「能ある鷹は爪を隠す」ということわざは、iPhoneにこそふさわしい。鷹は爪を隠していてもなお美しい。
ではiPhoneの本当のスゴさとは何か。それは、「ネットに常時接続されているモバイル端末はどうあるべきか？という長年の問いに、いきなり究極解を出してしまった」ということです。ここで、なぜiPhoneが究極解といえるのかについては、もう少し説明が必要でしょう。
まずはその準備として、ひとつ大きなクエスチョンに白黒つけておく必要があります。
「 電話」の登場 と 「 インターネット」の登場では、どちらが後世、たとえば100年後に大きな歴史的事件として記憶されるでしょうか？
おそらく、いや間違いなく、 「 インターネット」でしょう。
私は、たとえば100年後の未来では、みんなが使っているのは「モバイル・インターネット端末」であり、「音声通話」は数多あるアプリケーションのうちの一つでしかない、という逆転が間違いなく起きていると信じています。今は通信キャリアの存在感が大きすぎるのでにわかには想像できないかも知れませんが、物理的なネット回線の敷設は電気やガスと同じで、ますます公共性を帯びた地味なインフラになっていくという長期的なトレンドについては、さほど異論のないところでしょう。
マイクロソフト がWindowsでもたらした革命の本質は、ハードウェアとアプリケーションをアンバンドルしたことでした。富士通のマシンでしか動かないOASYS、日本電気のハードでしか動かない一太郎の時代から、WindowsというOSが媒介となって、日立のパソコンでも東芝のパソコンでも、一太郎だろうがWordだろうが何でも動くようになったのです。
ひるがえって、インターネットは、ハードウェア（電話回線）とアプリケーション（音声通話）をアンバンドルする起爆剤となった、と後世に伝えられることでしょう。そして、ハードウェアとアプリケーションが一体だった「電話」の時代は静かに忘れ去られていき、「インターネット」だけが生き残る。
だとするならば、その100年後の未来の世界では、おそらく「携帯電話」の登場よりも、「携帯インターネット端末」の登場こそが大きな歴史的事件として刻まれていることでしょう。
そしてほかでもないiPhoneは、まさにいま、
「携帯インターネット端末」の代表たる歴史的地位を確立しつつあるのです。StarTACの栄光は人々の記憶から忘れ去られても、iPhoneは長く語り継がれていくことでしょう。
そして 、Macとともに誕生しWindowsで完成したパーソナルコンピュータという概念が、とうとうiPhoneの登場によって携帯電話と合流してしまったのです。
パーソナルコンピュータにとっての携帯電話とは、典型的な「イノベーションのジレンマ」ですが、アップルは、この決して当事者には克服できないと予言されたジレンマを乗り越えてしまいました。メールやちょっとした調べ事など、ほとんどの日常的な用事が携帯端末だけで完結するようになり、ヘビーデューティーな限られた用途でしかパソコンが使われなくなっていくであろう未来を先取りし、自ら先手を打ったのです。技術経営的な観点からみても、お見事というほかありません。
つまり、iPhoneと は 「パソコンの側からアプローチしたパソコンへのアンチテーゼ」なのです。この一見矛盾した言い回しを正しく理解してもらうためには、まず「パソコン」を「パソコン」たらしめているものが何であるか、という部分をきちんとおさらいしておく必要があります。
ところで、「 iPhoneはアップル的なデザインの良さからくるマーケティング戦略の成功に過ぎない」と考えている人は、このあたりを根本的に勘違いしています。言っちゃ何ですけど、マーケティングごときにそんな歴史を動かすほどの力はありません。真に時代を動かすのは常に「本物の技術革新」であって、マーケティングはその影響力を何倍だかに増幅する手段に過ぎず、本当に良い物を作らなきゃゼロは何倍してもゼロなのは算数の初歩です。
では、iPhoneの進歩性とは何か。iPhoneには、パソコン同様、MacOS Xに相当する最新かつフルスタックのオペレーティングシステムが搭載されています。この意味するところは、単にモダンなカーネルが載っているとかそういうことではなくて、あらゆる高機能なネイティブ・アプリケーションがこのOSの上で安定的に記述可能になっているということです。これはアップル自身にもメリットとなったし、今ではアプリ開発者も同じメリットを享受しています。
i Phone OS では、加速度センサーやカメラ、GPS、ローカルのデータベースなど、内部のありとあらゆる機構に一般のアプリケーション開発者がアクセスすることを許しています。開発者の自由度を高めることで、開発者の情熱を引き出す。こういうオープン性がもたらす開発者コミュニティにおける化学反応こそが、官僚的なスーツ主体の組織では絶対に不可能な戦略であり、だからこそ他社が簡単に真似できない決定的なアドバンテージになることを、アップルはMacの経験から知っていました。
そして、実はこれこそが 「 パソコン 」 を「パソコン」たらしめているパラダイムの本質なのです。「パソコンの側からアプローチしたパソコンへのアンチテーゼ」を克服する、パソコン的なるものの本質とは、アプリケーション開発者の自由度を高めるオープン性、あるいは「テクノロジーの民主化」とでもいうべき思想にあったのです。
開発者の自由度を高めることはセキュリティ・リスクを増大させてしまうというトレードオフに直結していることも、技術ドリブンの企業でなければオープン戦略をとることが不可能である大きな理由のひとつです。落としどころの技術的な判断がつかないまま、会議室で議論すればするほど、より自分たちが安全な、より開発者を締め付ける方向にしか行けないのです。
さらに、iPhoneは妥協のない最高のユーザ体験をもたらすために現実世界のハードウェアの制約を含むあらゆるディティールと戦っています。これは、対抗馬となるAndroidなどにみられる理論上・コンセプト上で美しいアーキテクチャを目指す世界観とは対極に位置する、ある意味では泥臭い「本当にきちんと動いてナンボ」のアプローチです。このリアリティは、先月行われたWWDC
2008のセッションで、いかにしてリソースを節約しながら高速に動作するネイティブ・アプリケーションを書くか、というノウハウのセッションがものすごく多かったことが如実に物語っています。テーブルのセルを画面の外に出た瞬間に回収して再利用したり、再描画するエリアを最小化したり、メモリリークをとことん排除するためのツールが提供されていたり。
これらはソフトウェアのアルゴリズムがどうとかそういう大上段な話ではなくて、ユーザが実機で使ったときに「ちょっとでもスクロールがもっさりしてはいけない」というような、学者肌で理論派の開発者が苦手とする、言葉での説明が難しく、たいてい安易に妥協されがちな「フィーリング」の部分です。私は、その非言語的な価値に徹底的にこだわるその姿勢に、アップルの真骨頂をみました。そして何よりも、こうした問題が場当たり的に解決されるのではなく、ベストプラクティスがソフトウェア的に蓄積されていくというのが、汎用のOSやライブラリを持っていることの真の意義なのです。
さらにこの先には、ウェブアプリの革新が控えています。App Storeで色々なアプリをダウンロードして試された皆さんも同様のことを思われたかも知れませんが、娯楽モノ以外の多くの実用系アプリは何らかの形でウェブ・サービスと連携しており、そのサービスのクライアントとして動作します。つまり、オフラインモードやローカルデータベースをサポートするHTML
5が現実のものになってくれば、あえて気合いを入れてObjective-Cでネイティブ・コードを書かなくても、Safari上で同じ動作をするクライアントが書けるようになる3-4年後の未来が読めたはずです。
たとえばアニメーションや3Dレイアウトなど、ダイナミックなものでもCSSで宣言的に書けることはなるべく（JavaScriptを使わずに）CSSで書くようにすれば、GPUによる高速化のメリットを享受できるようになっていたり、ウェブアプリ方面でもiPhoneの技術革新への仕込みは抜かりありません。というか、そちらの界隈もアップルがSafariでリードしており、もはや独走状態です。ここまで全方位的に革新的だと、もうぐうの音も出ません。
勘違いしている人も多いのですが、あらゆる革新的な製品は垂直統合モデルから誕生します。いかに最後は負ける運命であっても、OASYSが載った富士通や一太郎が載った日本電気のようなモデル、つまりハードウェアからアプリケーションまで一体化された斬新な体験によって、新技術に突破口が開けるのです。まだ世の中に存在しない斬新なものの価値を信じて何かを作り上げることは、多くの関係者が寄り集まらないと何もできない水平分業モデルでは不可能なことです。そして、多くのトライアンドエラーと死屍累々の中から生き残り、大きなマーケットを作り上げた本物の技術だけが、反復作業を繰り返す学習効果によって徐々にモジュール化されコンポーネント化されて水平分業へと移行していき、増大する市場スケールに対応できるようになっていくのです。この順番だけは、過去一度も狂ったことがありません。垂直統合で生まれたMacがなければWindowsは存在しなかったし、水平分業のWindowsが登場しなければパソコンというものの一般への普及はなかったでしょう。そのどちらかだけに重きを置くのは誤りですが、鶏と卵のどちらが先かといえば間違いなく卵です。
だから、ハードウェアからアプリケーションまでの全レイヤーの技術を全てインハウスでカバーする、垂直統合型企業のアップルでなければ、iPhoneという技術革新は生み出せなかったのです。ハードウェアにはハードウェアのリアリティがあり、アプリケーションにはアプリケーションのリアリティがある。ただの専門バカの寄せ集めでは、iPhoneのような完成度のものは、たとえ思いついても絶対に作れない。
この点に関して、ITの世界には面白い構図があります。ハードウェアのエンジニアとOSのエンジニアは互いに互いのことをちょっとバカにしており、「お前は××の最適化の難しさも知らないくせに」と思っています。OSのエンジニアとライブラリのエンジニアは互いに互いのことをちょっとバカにしており、「お前はこれを××にも移植できるように作ることの難しさを知らないくせに」と思っています。ライブラリのエンジニアとアプリケーションのエンジニアは互いに互いのことをちょっとバカにしており、「こんなくだらん役立たずを作りやがって」と思っています。アプリケーションのエンジニアとウェブサービスのエンジニアは。。。と以下、延々と続くのです。一言にエンジニアといっても、担当するレイヤーが変わればカルチャーも用語も何もかもが違い、むしろ仲が良くないのが普通です。これらの異文化な人々をぜんぶ垂直に束ねて新しいものを作ることがいかに難しいか、おわかりでしょうか。
私は、6歳になる頃にはもうプログラムを書いてゲームなんかを作っていましたし、製品開発プロジェクトのマネジメントも長年やってきたし、今では会社の経営もやっています。もうこの世界とはかれこれ25年以上の付き合いがありますから、少々のことでは驚きません。何か新製品が出てきても、その開発プロセスがどういうものだったか、実際にモノを見ればたいてい想像がつきます。
しかし、これだけの圧倒的な複雑さと規模をもつiPhoneという製品が、いきなり最初からこれだけの完成度で、しかもアップルにとって全く先行的な経験もない状態で誕生したことは、技術経営の難しさをそれなりに知る私から見るともはや奇跡としか思えません。発売後すでに一年が経過した今でも、その思いは変わりません。
そして何よりも、iPhoneが今まさに行おうとしている革命は、かつてアップルがIBMに対して行ったのと構図も規模もそっくりな「テクノロジーの民主化」の革命なのです。
私たちはいま 、 「パーソナルコンピュータの誕生」に匹敵する歴史的瞬間を目撃しているのです。そのことに気付いていますか？iPhoneの本質は、セクシーなルックスにあるのではありません。その奥の深い中身と、未来に開かれた歴史的意義にこそ、その本質は潜んでいるのです。
さぁ、みなさんもつべこべいわずiPhoneを手に入れましょう。あなたが技術の世界で今後もずっとやっていくつもりなら、歴史の目撃者となる千載一遇のチャンスを見逃したことを、今後数十年にわたって後悔するのはイヤでしょう？
私はかつて、パソコンの黎明期に若すぎたことを悔しく思っていました。ただの小学生では、ソフトウェアを書くことはできても現実世界に影響を与えるほどのことは何もできず、華やかな世界を指をくわえて見ているほかなかったからです。
しかし、今この時代になって、iPhoneの誕生という歴史的なイベントを目撃できていることを、天に感謝しているのです。ようやくツキが巡ってきたぞ、と。

Avi Dichter was head of Shin Beth when Israel killed Saleh Shehada
The foreign ministry said an " extreme leftist " organisation was likely to file a legal complaint against Public Security Minister Avi Dichter .
He was the domestic intelligence agency chief in 2002 when Israel bombed a Hamas military leader 's house killing him , his bodyguard and 15 civilians .
British law allows private citizens to file complaints of alleged war crimes .
" Minister Dichter has cancelled this trip following threats of him being arrested in Great Britain .
This is an intolerable situation , " said his spokesman Barak Sari .
He had been invited to London as keynote speaker at a counter terrorism seminar at Kings College .
The visit was called off after the UK government had been unable to guarantee him immunity , his office said , in the event of a private citizens complaint leading to an arrest warrant for war crimes .
' Mistaken attack '
The Shin Beth agency , headed by Mr Dichter between 2000 and 2005 , helped plan the assassination of Hamas military commander Saleh Shehada in July 2002 .
Nine children were killed in the raid .
A one - tonne bomb was dropped on Mr Shehada 's house .
The dead included his wife and his three children .
In the face of international condemnation , including Israel 's main ally the US , Israel conducted an investigation and concluded that the raid had been a " mistake " .
In 2006 , the Israeli army scrapped plans to send one of its generals to a course at a British military academy over fears he could be arrested on war crimes charges .
A year earlier , former Gen Doron Almog narrowly avoided arrest for his involvement in the Shehada assassination .
He refused to leave his aircraft after a tip - off by Israeli diplomats .
Correspondents say this is the first time an Israeli minister has cancelled a visit over fears of a private citizen 's complaint .
Here ’s another article in the Enumerating Enumerable series , in which I attempt to improve upon RubyDoc.org ’s documentation for the Enumerable module , which I find rather lacking .
If you ’ve missed the previous articles in the series , I ’ve listed them below :
This installment covers a method that goes by two names : detect or find .
I personally prefer find , as it ’s shorter and the term I tend to use for its function .
Enumerable #detect / Enumerable #find Quick Summary
In the simplest possible terms
What ’s the first item in the collection that meets the given criteria ?
Ruby version 1.8 and 1.9 Expects
A block containing the criteria .
An optional argument containing a proc that calculates a “ default ” value — that is , the value to return if no item in the collection matches the criteria .
Returns
The first item in the collection that matches the criteria , if one exists .
If no such item exists in the collection , detect / find returns : nil is returned if no argument is provided
is returned if no argument is provided the value of the argument , if one is provided .
RubyDoc.org ’s entry Enumerable #detect / Enumerable #find
Enumerable #detect / Enumerable #find and Arrays
When used on an array without an argument , detect / find passes each item from the collection to the block and …
If the current item causes the block to return a value that does n’t evaluate to false , detect / find stops going through collection and returns the item .
, / stops going through collection and returns the item .
If no item in the collection causes the block to return a value that does n’t evaluate to false , detect / find returns nil .
In the examples that follow , I ’ll be using the find method .
detect does exactly the same thing ; it ’s just that I prefer find .
# Time to establish my " old fart " credentials classic_rock_bands = [ " AC/DC " , " Black Sabbath " , " Queen " , \ " Ted Nugent and the Amboy Dukes " , " Scorpions " , " Van Halen " ] => [ " AC/DC " , " Black Sabbath " , " Queen " , " Ted Nugent and the Amboy Dukes " , " Scorpions " , " Van Halen " ] #
Of the bands in the array , which is the first one # whose name is longer than 8 characters ?
classic_rock_bands.find { |band| band.length > 8 } => " Black Sabbath " #
Which is the first one whose name is exactly # 5 characters long ?
classic_rock_bands.find { |band| band.length == 5} => " AC / DC " #
The order of items in the array can affect " find " 's result .
#
Let 's put the array into reverse sorted order : classic_rock_bands.sort!.reverse! => [ " Van Halen " , " Ted Nugent and the Amboy Dukes " , " Scorpions " , \ " Queen " , " Black Sabbath " , " AC / DC " ] # Again : which is the first band whose name # is longer than 8 characters ? =>
" Van Halen " # Again : which is the first band whose name # is exactly 5 characters ? => " Queen " #
If no band in the array meets the criteria , # " find " returns nil .
#
There are no bands in the list with names shorter # than 5 characters ...
classic_rock_bands.find {|band| band.length < 5 } => nil 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 # Time to establish my " old fart " credentials classic_rock_bands = [ " AC/ DC " , " Black Sabbath " , " Queen " , \ " Ted Nugent and the Amboy Dukes " , " Scorpions " , " Van Halen " ] = > [ " AC / DC " , " Black Sabbath " , " Queen " , " Ted Nugent and the Amboy Dukes " , " Scorpions " , " Van Halen " ] #
Of the bands in the array , which is the first one # whose name is longer than 8 characters ?
classic_rock_bands . find { | band | band .
length > 8 } = > " Black Sabbath " #
Which is the first one whose name is exactly # 5 characters long ?
classic_rock_bands . find { | band | band .
length == 5 } = > " AC / DC " #
The order of items in the array can affect " find " 's result .
# Let ' s put the array into reverse sorted order : classic_rock_bands . sort ! . reverse ! = > [ " Van Halen " , " Ted Nugent and the Amboy Dukes " , " Scorpions " , \ " Queen " , " Black Sabbath " , " AC / DC " ] # Again : which is the first band whose name # is longer than 8 characters ? = > " Van Halen " # Again : which is the first band whose name # is exactly 5 characters ? = > " Queen " #
If no band in the array meets the criteria , # " find " returns nil . #
There are no bands in the list with names shorter # than 5 characters ... classic_rock_bands . find { | band | band .
length < 5 } = > nil
Using the optional argument is a topic big enough to merit its own section , which appears later in this article .
Enumerable #detect / Enumerable #find and Hashes
When used on a hash and a block is provided , detect / find passes each key / value pair in the hash to the block , which you can “ catch ” as either :
A two - element array , with the key as element 0 and its corresponding value as element 1 , or Two separate items , with the key as the first item and its corresponding value as the second item .
When used on a hash without an argument , detect / find passes each item from the collection to the block and …
If the current item causes the block to return a value that does n’t evaluate to false , detect / find stops going through collection and returns the item .
, / stops going through collection and returns the item .
If no item in the collection causes the block to return a value that does n’t evaluate to false , detect / find returns nil .
years_founded = { " AC / DC " => 1973 , \ " Black Sabbath " => 1968 , \ " Queen " => 1970 , \ " Ted Nugent and the Amboy Dukes " => 1967 , \ " Scorpions " => 1965 , \ " Van Halen " => 1972} # Ruby 1.8 re-orders hashes in some mysterious way that is almost never # the way you entered it .
Here 's what I got in Ruby 1.8 : => { " Queen " => 1970 , " AC/ DC " => 1973 , " Black Sabbath " = > 1968 , " Scorpions " = > 1965 , " Ted Nugent and the Amboy Dukes " => 1967 , " Van Halen " = > 1972 } # Ruby 1.9 preserves hash order so that hashes keep the order in which # you defined them .

Which band is the first in the hash to be founded # in 1970 or later ?
years_founded .
find { | band | band [ 1 ] >= 1970 } # In Ruby 1.8 , the result is : = > [ " Queen " , 1970 ] #

Here ' s another way of phrasing it : years_founded .
find { | band , year_founded | year_founded >= 1970 }
Using Enumerable #detect / Enumerable #find with the Optional Argument
detect / find ‘s optional argument lets you specify a proc or lambda whose return value will be the result in cases where no object in the collection matches the criteria .
( Unfortunately , a complete discussion of procs and lambdas is beyond the scope of this article .
I highly recommend looking at Eli Bendersky ’s very informative article , Understanding Ruby blocks , Procs and methods . )
I think that the optional argument is best explained through examples …
# Once again , the array of classic rock bands classic_rock_bands = [ " AC/DC " , " Black Sabbath " , " Queen " , \ " Ted Nugent and the Amboy Dukes " , " Scorpions " , " Van Halen " ] #
Let 's define a proc that will simply returns the band name # " ABBA " , who are most definitely not considered to be # a classic rock band .
default_band = Proc.new { " ABBA " } # Procs are objects , so using a proc 's name alone is n't sufficient to invoke its code -- doing so will simply return the proc object .
default_band => #< Proc:0x00553f34@( irb ) :31 > #
( The actual value will be different for you , but you get the idea . ) #
To call a proc , you have to use its " call " method : default_band.call =>
" ABBA " #
What we want to do is use " default_band " as a proc that # provides a default value in the event that detect / find does n't # find a value that matches the critera .
# detect / find calls the " call " method of the object you provide # as the argument if no item in the collection matches the # criteria in the block .
#
There * is* a band in the array that comes after # " Led Zeppelin " alphabetically : Queen. classic_rock_bands.find(default_band ) { |band| band > " Led Zeppelin " } => " Queen " #
The last band in the array , alphabetically speaking , # is Van Halen .
So if we ask detect / find to find a band that # comes after Van Halen , it wo n't find one .
#
Without the argument , detect / find returns nil , # but * with * the argument , it will invoke the " call " # method of the object you provide it .
classic_rock_bands.find(default_band ) { |band| band > " Van Halen " } => " ABBA " # Let 's try something a little fancier .
This time , we 'll use a lambda .
#
The differences between procs and lambdas are very fine -- I suggest # you check Eli Bendersky 's article for those differences .
#
Let 's create a lambda that when called , # returns the name of a randomly - selected pop singer .
random_band = lambda do fallback_bands = [ " Britney Spears " , " Christina Aguilera " , " Ashlee Simpson " ] fallback_bands[rand(fallback_bands.size ) ] end #

#
There * is * a band in the array that comes after # " Led Zeppelin " alphabetically : Queen .
classic_rock_bands . find ( default_band ) { | band | band > " Led Zeppelin " } = > " Queen " #
The last band in the array , alphabetically speaking , # is Van Halen .
So if we ask detect / find to find a band that # comes after Van Halen , it won 't find one .

Without the argument , detect / find returns nil , # but * with * the argument , it will invoke the " call " # method of the object you provide it .

In the months and years ahead , with the engineered deconstruction of the economy , a “ domestic security force ” possibly the size of the U.S. military will be required to “ to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals , ” as Rockefeller functionary Brzezinski might describe it .
It appears candidate Obama , if elected , fully intends to recruit young citizens into something he calls a “ national security force , ” apparently a large paramilitary group “ just as powerful , just as strong , just as well - funded ” as the U.S. military .
Obama made passing reference to this disturbing idea in a speech delivered in Chicago on July 2 .
As should be expected , the corporate media , with the exception on the Chicago Tribune , completely ignored the statement and its implications .
It was picked up by the real media , that is to say the bloggers , and Joseph Farah of WorldNetDaily .
“ If we ’re going to create some kind of national police force as big , powerful and well - funded as our combined U.S. military forces , is n’t this rather a big deal ? ” asked Farah .
“ I thought Democrats generally believed the U.S. spent too much on the military .
How is it possible their candidate is seeking to create some kind of massive but secret national police force that will be even bigger than the Army , Navy , Marines and Air Force put together ? ”
Farah should know there is little to no difference between Democrats and Republicans — they both take orders from the Council on Foreign Relations , the Bilderbergers , David Rockefeller ’s globalist coterie , the Trilateral Commission , and various one - world foundations and cliques .
It is no secret Obama ’s top advisor is Zbigniew Brzezinski , a close Rockefeller protégé , a founding member and former director of the Trilateral Commission , and a CFR member .
Obama ’s wife , Michelle , is a member of the Chicago branch of the CFR .
Big donors to the Obama campaign basically constitute a who ’s who of corporate and Wall Street banking interests , including JP Morgan Chase & Co. , Goldman Sachs , Lehman Brothers , and Citigroup .
Disgraced former Obama advisor , James A. Johnson , former Fannie Mae CEO and consummate Washington insider , is a member of the American Friends of Bilderberg , the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations .
Farah seems unwilling to make crucial differences when it comes to Democrats and Republicans , but in this instance we can forgive , at least for the moment , because he is asking all the right questions .
“ Are we talking about creating a police state here ? ” he asked in a July 15 article posted on the WND website .
The U.S. Army alone has nearly 500,000 troops .
That does n’t count reserves or National Guard .
In 2007 , the U.S. Defense budget was $ 439 billion .
Is Obama serious about creating some kind of domestic security force bigger and more expensive than that ?
If not , why did he say it ?
What did he mean ?
Obama — or rather his handlers , consisting of dedicated minions who work for the global elite , the international bankers , the corporate fascists — are serious , dead serious , about creating a “ domestic security force . ”
It has nothing to do with al - Qaeda , either , a phantom force Joseph Farah and his neocon buddies believe pose a serious threat to America .
It has everything to do with subduing those of us who may resist an accelerated move toward fascist corporate globalization , one - world government , and the effort to turn the planet into a slave labor gulag where half the population exists on less than a dollar or two a day .
It ’s all about forcing us to accept the New Serfdom at gunpoint .
In the months and years ahead , with the engineered deconstruction of the economy , a “ domestic security force ” possibly the size of the U.S. military will be required to “ to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals , ” as Rockefeller functionary Brzezinski might describe it .
Something of this size and scope will be required , especially with the very real prospect of foods riots and civil unrest as America is reduced to a third world cesspool , an eventuality if the NWO has its way .
In the meantime , after Obama is elected – or McCain , it really makes no difference – they globalists may be recruiting your neighbors or kids to do their bidding .

THE ‘80s have been mined so thoroughly , so deeply , it ’s come to this : Hypercolor is back .
Generra Sportswear created the craze in ’ 91 , with heat - sensitive T - shirts that changed colors like magic .
Touch a purple shirt and leave a pink fingerprint ; boogie down and your green tee would be splotched with bright yellow hot spots .
Small - screen cameos on MTV and “ Beverly Hills , 90210 " propelled Hypercolor into style stardom .
The tees sold out across the country , and fluorescent tops bearing the Hypercolor logo became a major status symbol among school - age followers .
But the novelty faded as quickly as pink back to purple , Generra filed for bankruptcy , and Hypercolor became a forgotten fad .
Until now .
This time around , the trend has a more fashionable spin .
The L.A. line Anzevino and Florence is making a racer - back tank dress ( $ 84 ) and cotton scarf ( $ 26 ) that start out aqua or lavender and turn yellow or pink .
British designer Henry Holland took inspiration from early ‘ 90s Vogue photos of Stephanie Seymour and Axl Rose for his heat - activated T - shirt ( $ 110 ) , mini - dress ( $ 236 ) and denim shorts ( $ 150 ) , all in a neon print befitting Will Smith ’s reign as the Fresh Prince .
American Apparel offers a hyper spinoff with a unisex tee ( $ 34 ) , and bodyfaders.com has tank tops in a rainbow of changing colors ( $ 24.95 ) .
But the most updated version is Puma ’s sneakers ( $ 65 ) -- if , of course , you do n’t mind your hot , sweaty feet dictating the color of your kicks .
Just remember :
The gear is dyed with a heat - sensitive pigment , so it ’s washable in cold water -- but iron it , bleach it or dry it in a steaming - hot machine and your shirt wo n’t last the 15 minutes this trend is destined for .

Nadia received this letter from her boyfriend ’s cousin , Amy , who recently relocated with her boyfriend from Saskatoon to Victoria , B.C …and have been shacking up with Nadia and her boyfriend even since .
Over the past month , roomie relations have become a bit strained , to say the least .
“ We had to send a stray cat she was harboring to a friend ’s house temporarily ( my allergies were killing me ) , ” Nadia says , and Amy proceeded to pout for three days straight .
A minor - blow out ensued , which was then followed by this untitled composition .
Nadia and her boyfriend are scheduled to move out on Wednesday .
Adds Nadia : “ A friend of mine ( a B.A. in professional writing and linguistics ) and I ( a high school science and math teacher with a zoology degree and a B.Ed. ) corrected all of the mistakes in the letter . ”
Then , fighting ire with ire , they posted it on the fridge .

Anti-abortion group wins free - speech ruling SAN FRANCISCO
Free speech gives them right to show disturbing photos
A federal appeals court gave an anti-abortion group the go - ahead Wednesday to drive trucks with enlarged photos of aborted fetuses past California schools , saying the Constitution protects the display of disturbing messages .
Los Angeles County sheriff 's deputies interfered with free speech by ordering the driver of one such truck to move away from a middle school , said the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco .
The deputies had cited a state law barring disruptive activities near public school grounds .
" The government cannot silence messages simply because they cause discomfort , fear or even anger , " said a panel of three judges - Harry Pregerson , Marsha Berzon and William Fletcher , all considered liberals .
To be constitutional , the state law can prohibit speech that is disruptive because of the way it is expressed - for example , through a blaring loudspeaker - but not because of its content , said Pregerson , the author of the ruling .
A lawyer for the anti-abortion group , the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform , called the ruling " a tremendous victory for the pro-life movement . "
" They can get out their message that reveals the horror of abortion , " said attorney Robert Muise of the Thomas More Law Center , a conservative Christian organization .
He said the trucks would be sent to middle schools and high schools , where students , he contended , are already being targeted by advocates of contraception and abortion .
John Allen , a lawyer for the school administrator who called the sheriff 's deputies , said his client had n't decided whether to appeal .
The case dates from March 2003 , when an employee and a volunteer of the anti-abortion group drove the truck and an escort vehicle around Dodson Middle School in Rancho Palos Verdes before classes began .
They left about two hours later after deputies and the school administrator told them they were violating the law , and have visited only one other school in the county since then , their lawyers told the court .
Allen said that with traffic heavy outside the school and some students talking about throwing rocks at the truck , the school administrator had decided that the display " was creating an imminent danger of physical harm to the students . "
" If we had failed to call police and children were injured , we would face liability for that , " Allen said .
A lower court upheld the school 's and deputies ' actions .
But the appeals court said free expression in a public area , such as a city street , can't be suppressed because listeners or viewers object to its content .
Although schools are entitled to prevent activities that disrupt learning , Pregerson said , any disruption in this case was due to " the audience 's reaction to the content of the speech . "
That speech was constitutionally protected , he said .
The case was argued in February 2007 , four months before the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an Alaska principal 's decision to punish a student for unfurling a banner outside a high school that read , " Bong Hits 4 Jesus , " a message that the court said could be read as promoting drug use .
The appellate panel did not mention that ruling Wednesday .

Children who were taught Nazi ideology by their parents were taken to the authorities to have a permanent custody of the kids .
A couple from Manitoba province , Canada lost custody of their children when it was found about their attempts to impose Nazi beliefs and racists feelings on their children .
Two children , a seven - year - old girl and a two - year - old boy were removed from their parents and are cared by the local Child and Family Services .
The court ruled in favor of the government authorities , who wanted to preserve the children 's emotional well - being from their white supremacist parents .
Winnipeg Free Press announced that the case was revealed after the event happening on March 25 , when a girl appeared in school with a sign of swastika and Nazi markings " 14/88 " on her arms and one leg .
The numbers had a Nazi symbolism with 14 referring to a 14 words slogan : " We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children " , while 88 refer to the " Heil Hitler " words .
The man is known to be a white supremacist , who cared for his stepdaughter and his son .
In 2005 he was presumed to be involved in " hate crimes " related to children .
He told that he has dedicated his entire life to being a skinhead and is not going to change .
His wife , who called herself a " white nationalist " , was considered by court to be unfit for parenting .

10 Easy Ways To Improve Your Cooking
I woke up yesterday around 6 am , and all I could think about was food .
Of course it was Thanksgiving , and there was so much to do .
In spite of the strike , my friend David did manage to arrive just in time for dinner , a little sleep , and a early - morning trip to the outdoor market to load up on everything for a full day of cooking .
And to explain to a lot of French people what Thanksgiving was all about .
We bought every kind of root vegetable we could find .
And l’autre David , who ’s also a cook , insisted on roasting each one individually then combining them .
I ’m not sure that was necessary , but they were sure good since later on I happily ate my words .
Our chestnut stuffing was another hit ;
French people do n’t eat big mounds of stuffing but hardly a bit was leftover .
But what ’s not to like about buttery cubes of levain with roasted chestnuts , leeks , pruneaux d’Agen , and lots and lots of fresh sage and thyme ?
It got me thinking about what makes a good cook since Thanksgiving food is some of the simplest fare there is .
Take mashed potatoes .
There ’s very few ingredients .
But if you have good russet potatoes , terrific butter , fromage blanc , sea salt , and freshly - cracked white pepper , you really ca n’t go wrong .
Indeed , one of the non-secrets of good cooking is to buy good ingredients and do as little to them as possible .
You do n’t need me to tell you a nice ripe peach tastes much better than a hard , out - of - season one .
Or freshly - made mashed potatoes tastes better than those goofy flakes from the box .
I ’ve been thinking about this a lot lately since Michael Ruhlman , whose just released a new book book Elements of Cooking , and who began a new blog as well — Elements of Cooking , got me thinking .
In his words , he writes in his new blog …
“ ( it ’s ) … not a recipe blog–I ’m interested in what does n’t change , what ca n’t change , what is permanent , what is fundamental to the act of cooking .
I am interested in not needing recipes . ”
His superb treatise on why you should make your own stock is a must read , especially if you have holiday bird bones leftover .
( I felt uncomfortable dragging a big , greasy turkey carcass across Paris on the way home last night .
But this morning , I deeply - regretted it after reading his stock - making tips . )
One you understand how things work , many dishes are variable .
While baking does require recipes and exactitude ( my personal cross to bear … ) in many instances , we should n’t be slaves to recipes .
If a recipe for a salad dressing calls for 1 teaspoon of salt and you do n’t think it ’s salty enough , do you just stick with the recipe or do you add more salt to taste ?
Of course , you ca n’t simply add another cup of flour to a cake recipe , but you can learn more about your ingredients ; how they work and what they do .
Armed with that knowledge , you ’ll wo n’t be so stressed about substituting ingredients , calculating baking times for your particular oven , and you ’ll be able to use recipes as a jumping - off point instead of hard - and - fast rules .
And take it from one who knows all too well , you do n’t need an arsenal of fancy equipment either .
Since moving to France , even though I spent a lot of time cooking professionally , I learned a whole new vocabulary about cooking here .
Because of the nature of shopping in Paris , where you spent time talking with shop owners and food vendors , you can learn a lot more about cooking than you can imagine if you ’re willing to take the time .
And because my kitchen is … shall we say — modest , at best … I ’ve learned to work around any obstacles .
And in fact , I can now multitask making chocolates while drying my socks .
How ’s that for good ‘ ol American ingenuity ?
Here ’s 10 easy things you can do to improve your cooking .
I ’ve touched upon a few before and some apply to baking , some to savory cooking .
They ’re ways that I ’ve personally improved my cooking and stocked my pantry , and all of these things are within the reach of everyone .
They ’re all pretty simply and actually kind of fun to implement , and I hope they ’ll making cooking and baking far more enjoyable and rewarding for you , as they have for me .
1. Use Fresh Herbs
You do n’t need me to tell you that a humble baked potato is ever - so - much better with some freshly - chopped chives sprinkled over it .
( And bacon and sour cream and butter too , mais oui !.)
But people forget how delicious just - chopped thyme smells , or the scent of a chiffonade of fresh , leafy basil strewn over a platter of tomatoes and oily - black olives turns it into something fragrant and marvelous .
In France , fresh herbs are relatively cheap .
But no matter where you live , a big bunch of flat - leaf parsley or sprigs of thyme are a great investment since a little fistful will bring food alive .
I grew my own on the roof , until I noticed one day a family of pigeons was using the pot to take their afternoon nap in , so I stopped .
Fortunately they do n’t seem to be as fond of chocolate as I am .
The bunch of chives I bought for 1 € for the Salmon Rillettes the other day enlivened five other dinners and salads ; such a deal !
Experiment with new and unfamiliar herbs , like pungent tarragon or tender , anise - like chervil leaves , which really is one of the great , underutilized , herbs .
UPDATE : In the comments , someone inquired about extending the life of fresh herbs .
A new device just came out , which the San Francisco Chronicle testers used … and the results ?
“ Well , we were blown away .
After nearly three weeks in the Herb Savor , our sage and parsley looked fresh as a daisy , while the same stuff — one bundled in the wet towel and the other stored in a glass of water — was wilted , dry and brown . ”
I ’m going to get one to use myself and see how it works .
2. Upgrade Your Oil
Please people , for all that is good in the world , it ’s okay to spend a little extra money on nice olive oil on yourself , for something that you ’re going to parsimoniously drizzle over your food .
For cooking and frying , it ’s fine to use a less - expensive olive oil .
But it was n’t until I moved above a huilierie , an olive oil store , that I started buying better oils made from various kinds of olives and blends .
Quelle difference , my friends .
Do n’t be concerned with fancy labels or super high - prices .
Good oil is n’t necessarily expensive ; the two bottles I ’m using right now , one cost 5 € and the other 12 € each is going to last me a couple of months .
Tasting is really important , not necessarily the label or origin .
As they say , “ Buy your oil where the Italians get theirs — in Spain “ , which alludes to the widely - held belief that much of the olive oil that ’s marketed as Italian is actually shipped over from Spain , whose oil is often less - expensive and sometimes better .
Nut oils are great , if they ’re of good - quality .
A spoonful along with a sprinkle of coarse salt will dress an entire salad .
What could be easier , or more economical ?
If there is n’t a shop near you locally , a good source for good oils that ships is Zingerman’s .
Their site is a wealth of information too .
3 . Use shallots .
Lots and lots of shallots .
In France , almost everyone uses shallots .
But in America , you have to kneel down under the shelves at the produce aisle and fish out those little bags covered with red plastic netting to grab one .
Oh , the humiliation !
I never understood the sheer brilliance of shallots until now .
They ’re like oxygen to a cook ; you ca n’t live without them once you ’ve had your first taste .
Finely - chopped and raw , they find their way into every vinaigrette I make .
I also sauté zucchini or another favorite vegetable with them .
Shallots are a must have and once you use them , you ’ll find them irreplaceable in your kitchen .
4 . Keep a good amount of decent bittersweet or semisweet chocolate on hand .
Not only is this good for snacking ( guilty ! ) , but like that Little Black Dress , some good chocolate can be chopped up and made into a instant chocolate sauce mixed with milk or water and used to drizzle over any dessert .
Or a quick batch of mousse au chocolat .
And that great stand - by , a batch of brownies , can be whipped up with ingredients you already should have on hand ; flour , sugar , butter and eggs if you have chocolate .
And there ’s my simple , four - ingredient Chocolate Orbit Cake , too .
Good dark chocolate lasts for years if stored correctly , and buying it in bulk is more economical if that ’s a concern .
5. Salt
One of those kind and gentle folks at one of those not so kind and gentle online food sites criticized me for saying that fleur de sel is the “ greatest salt on earth ” .
I ’m not sure why , but I hope that person is condemned to a lifetime of eating bitter , acrid table salt with anti-caking agents .
While I love fleur de sel de Guérande , it ’s pricey if you do n’t live in France .
But anyone can buy good salt no matter where they live or what their budget .
A huge box of kosher salt is … what , a couple of bucks ?
And how long is that going to last ?
Seriously , if you ’re eating that much salt , you should n’t be .
Go get yourself a box — it ’ll last you years .
6. Try Lentilles de Puy
This is my stand - by dish that I make whenever I do n’t know what to make that ’s quick and versatile .
But unlike those mud-brown lentils that get made into a murky winter soup , lentilles de Puy cook up crunchy and nutty , and do n’t fall apart unless you really cook the heck out of them .
Lentilles de Puy are grown in a region with rich , volcanic soil , which gives them a pleasant , mineral -y taste because they ’re dried on the plant .
They cook in less than 30 - minutes , and can be tossed in a simple dressing of oil and vinegar with some salt and pepper , or cooled them mixed with tomatoes and crumbled feta cheese .
I ’ve written about them before , but am adding them here since to me , they ’re a ‘ must - have - on - hand ’ in any kitchen .
They ’ve become readily available in the US and elsewhere , but look for ‘ de Puy ’ on the label for the best - quality green lentils , which really do taste better .
7. Re-think Your Vinegar
Since you ’re upgrading your oil , why not your vinegar at the same time ?
In France , sherry vinegar ’s quite popular , which is what I reach for 98 % of the time since it ’s milder and less - tangy than red wine vinegar .
I do n’t use what ’s labeled balsamic vinegar anymore since my visit to Modena , where the real stuff is made , and I ’m horribly spoiled .
You ’d be too if you had one sip of the real stuff .
It ’s terrible , since I ’m now ruined for life .
A small splash of vinegar is usually all that ’s used , so why not use good stuff ?
And if you really want to use that other balsamic vinegar , it ’s fine .
I wo n’t tell .
8. Try Whole Wheat Pasta
I am crazy for whole - wheat pasta .
Erase any memories you have of grainy , leaden tubes of starch and taste some of the new varieties out there .
I do n’t know if it ’s available in the US , but Barilla is now making their own .
And I ’m a big , big fan of Latini farro pasta , which is made of faro , and I bring some back when I go to Italy .
But it ’s admittedly pricey and you can do fine in your local natural - foods store , as I do .
My very favorite quick and easy dinner is whole wheat pasta , sun-dried tomatoes , red chili flakes , chopped sausage , some greens tossed in all topped with crumbled feta .
And a little drizzle of olive oil , of course .
9 . Wine
“ Hey , it ’s two - buck Chuck !
Ha - ha - ha… ! ”
I have n’t been able to figure out why people are willing to pay more for a latte than on wine ?
It was no accident that I moved to a country where daily drinking - wine is pretty inexpensive .
But there ’s plenty of decent wines around that come in at less than $ 10 a bottle which are very drinkable .
That $ 2 stuff is really awful , and I ’m not sure I understand why people bragging about how little they ’re willing to spend on themselves .
Look around at good retailers like Best Cellars or searching a few wine blogs , where you can discover wines under $ 20 or even $ 10 .
You do n’t need to drink expensive wine to enjoy wine .
I do n’t buy fancy wines , and you do n’t have to go into debt to enjoy wine either .
Another option is to buy by the case if a discount is offered .
And price is n’t always an indication of quality ; drink what tastes good to you .
10 .
Get thee some decent cookware .
Yes , good cookware is more expensive than the flimsy stuff .
But who liked charred cookies or spending hours scrubbing burnt spots off saucepans ?
One does not need a complete batterie de cuisine to cook ; a medium - sized saucepan , a large non -stick skillet , a spatula or wooden spoon and a good , solid baking sheet are sufficient for most tasks .
Many of the top brands now offer lesser - priced models if you ’re really tight , but I ’ve had the same All - Clad pans for over twenty years and I still use them every day .
And it has a lifetime warranty which means no matter what , they ’ll replace it forever .
I ’ve even spectacularly dropped mine and it fared beautifully , far better than the chocolate in it .
In a solid saucepan , with thick sides , things are less - likely to burn , handles wo n’t get hot , and things will cook evenly .
Similarly , if you ’ve ever baked cookies on one of those tissue - thin baking sheets , you know how frustrating it is to pull out a batch of cookies that are blackened on the bottom and raw on top .
All - Clad Starter Set :
An investment , but well worth it .
Starter sets are very reasonable ways to own All - Clad .
Heatproof Spatula : I use these for everything in the kitchen .
The best tool .
Ever .
Kaiser Baking Sheet : Non-warping insulated baking sheet
KitchenAid 5 - qt Mixer :
Not essential for everyone , but a great deal — now on sale for just $ 149 .
Calphalon Baking Sheet : Another insulated baking sheet that I use .
Magic Line 9 ″ Cake Pan :
These inexpensive cake pans are what professionals use .
I love them .
T- Fal Non-Stick Skillet : In France , T - Fal is de rigeur in the kitchen .
I reach for mine daily , and their low price makes them easy - to - own .
Last time I was in the US , my pal Wendy dragged me to Marshall ’s — okay … she did n’t have to drag me —nd I was stunned to find so much high - quality cookware so reasonably prices .
Oxo tools , KitchenAid pans , and Le Creuset casseroles were on offer .
It was n’t like a cookware store where they have absolutely everything , but I did a little bit of damage .
( Although the clothes were a bust .. who wears all those pants that have a 52 ″ waist and 28 ″ inseam ? )
Or scan garage sales .
I ’ve sold lots of great pastry - making tools at mine when I moved abroad , thinking I ’d never use them again .
( Ha !
Which , of course , I had to buy all over again . )
Happy cooking !

NEVADA DESERT
PRODUCER FRANK MARSHALL immediately proves his commitment to using CGI " only when necessary " by featuring completely necessary CGI prairie dogs in the first shot of the movie .
A bunch of cars drive through the DESERT to AREA 51 .
HARRISON FORD'S SHADOW , then HARRISON FORD'S SHOE , then HARRISON FORD'S ARM , then HARRISON FORD'S HAT and finally HARRISON FUCKING FORD are eventually revealed .
HARRISON FORD
Alright folks , let 's get this show on the road .
I want to make it to Country Buffet by four .
CATE BLANCHETT
Pryvet , Harrison .
I am evil Soviet .
You vill help me find Moose and Squirrel , yes ?
HARRISON FORD
Holy Christ , you 're not going to talk like that the whole movie are you ?
CATE BLANCHETT
Da .
You vill help locate MacKuffin now .
HARRISON FORD
Fine .
The thing you 're looking for is super magnetic , so if we just throw this gunpowder into the air it will lead us to the MacGuffin .
RAY WINSTONE
Nineteen years to write this movie and that 's how it 's going to start ?
Really ?
I think I 'm going to write myself out of this movie as much as possible by revealing myself to be a double agent .
RAY turns on HARRISON .
CATE escapes with the MACGUFFIN and HARRISON gets away , only to find himself in the middle of a NUCLEAR TEST SITE that is apparently located within walking distance of AREA 51 .
HARRISON FORD
Holy shit , a nuclear bomb !
I 'll hide in this lead - lined fridge to protect myself from the radiation that will permeate the area shortly after the ten-million degree heat generated by the blast is done obliterating every single object in a 5 mile radius !
Somehow , this WORKS .
HARRISON FORD emerges from the fridge with his face covered in black soot , holding a sign that reads " ouch . "
INT .
MARSHALL COLLEGE
HARRISON teaches his film class entitled " How To Ruin Millions Of Childhoods In 2 Hours " when he is interrupted by the DEAN , JIM BROADBENT .
JIM BROADBENT
Sorry Harrison , I have to let you go .
The government thinks you might be a Soviet .
Apparently someone rented " K - 19 : The Widowmaker " and panicked .
HARRISON FORD
Bullshit , nobody saw that movie .
HARRISON packs up props from the prior films , but is interrupted by SHIA LABEOUF .
SHIA LABEOUF
Hey , my mother and John Hurt have been kidnapped .
My mom said you 'd help me because every great adventure film needs an insufferable douchebag sidekick .
HARRISON FORD
Your mom knew me ?
Well it seems painfully obvious that you 're going to turn out to be my son , then .
SHIA LABEOUF
And yet , that 's going to be mentioned later in the movie as though it 's some kind of shocking revelation .
Suddenly , more CARTOONY SOVIETS show up and try to kidnap SHIA and HARRISON .
SHIA LABEOUF
Shit , they have guns .
What do we do ?
HARRISON FORD
Just wait until the movie gets re-released in a few years and they 'll be replaced with walkie - talkies .
SHIA and HARRISON escape on a motorcycle .
Crazy stunts are performed in order to evade the SOVIETS .
SHIA LABEOUF
Are we really expecting audiences to put up with this ?
We 're violating like ten thousand laws of physics here .
HARRISON FORD
Are you joking , kid ?
That makes this the most realistic action scene in the movie .
EXT .
SOUTH AMERICA
SHIA and HARRISON go to SOUTH AMERICA to look for the next CLUE .
SHIA flips his knife around in his hand trying to look badass , but actually grabs it by the blade .
Twice .
Seriously .
HARRISON FORD
Alright , the walkthrough for the movie says that our next clue is in a spooky graveyard .
We should probably save our game here .
SHIA LABEOUF
Pick up MAP .
Use MAP on HARRISON FORD .
Walk To TOMB .
They travel to an underground tomb and find a CRYSTAL MACGUFFIN using its super - powerful magnetic properties .
SHIA LABEOUF
That crystal skull looks like an alien head .
And the Soviets were looking for an alien corpse stored in Area 51 .
Golly , there sure is a lot of alien stuff .
HARRISON FORD
If you 're trying to mentally ready the audience for the ending , do n't bother .
I 've read through the script , nothing can prepare moviegoers for what happens at the end .
Suddenly , SOVIETS show up and kidnap SHIA and HARRISON .
They bring them back to their camp , where HARRISON finds JOHN HURT and KAREN ALLEN .
CATE BLANCHETT embarrasses herself some more and eventually they all travel into the AMAZON FOREST .
HARRISON FORD
What are we doing in the Amazon ?
KAREN ALLEN
Cate wants to return the Crystal MacGuffin to the ancient City of Gold .
HARRISON FORD
City of Gold ?
Is n't that what Nicolas Cage was looking for in National Treasure 2 ?
Are we seriously getting the plot for our shitty sequel to Indiana Jones by ripping off the plot of a shitty sequel to a shitty knock - off of Indiana Jones ?
I feel like that should unravel the space - time continuum or something .
A caravan of vehicles , led by a giant tree - cutting machine , travels deep into the AMAZON FOREST .
HARRISON uses a CHEAT CODE to spawn a ROCKET LAUNCHER , then uses it to blow up the tree - cutting machine .
SHIA LABEOUF
I 'm pretty sure the audience came here to see more Shia LaBeouf , so I 'm going to fence Cate Blanchett in front of an obvious green screen .
HARRISON FORD
Wait , what are they chasing us through ?
Are there roads in the middle of the jungle ?
Why the hell did we bother showing that tree - cutting thing if we were just going to contradict the very thing it was trying to establish ?
KAREN ALLEN
That 's what 's so great about this movie - we can just do whatever the hell we want , because even glaringly obvious flaws like that are dwarfed by the sheer magnitude of failure that is the rest of the movie .
To illustrate this , SHIA LEBEOUF flies up into the FUCKING JUNGLE and swings like FUCKING TARZAN along the FUCKING VINES with a FUCKING ARMY of CGI FUCKING MONKEYS .
That actually FUCKING HAPPENS .
Everyone eventually winds up in the CITY OF GOLD .
INT .
CITY OF GOLD
HARRISON solves a few simple puzzles and gains access to the CITY .
Some natives show up and attack , but are quickly dispatched , making the AUDIENCE wonder why they were introduced at all .
HARRISON FORD
Alright , the aliens or whatever want me to return the crystal to some ridiculous alien throne room .
CATE BLANCHETT
Not zo fast .
I vill return skull instead .
HARRISON FORD
Should n't it have been taken as an indicator of a writing problem when the good guy and the bad guy in a movie have the exact same goal ?
CATE takes the skull and places it on a THRONE .
It then turns into an ACTUAL ALIEN and makes her head explode .
The ALIENS pile into a GIANT UFO and fly off into SPACE .

Wow .
Considering that the first movie revolved around a magical box made by God that melts faces when opened , it 's really astonishing that this movie managed to be so incredibly stupid by comparison .

A diligent Google search has failed to turn up a summer concert tour in promotion of the deep thought of Tommy Thompson or Mitt Romney , or an Internet radio station dedicated to the insight and erudition of Rudy Giuliani or Fred Thompson .
Ron Paul , as usual , is another matter .
Here are some recent initiatives that in my opinion deserve to be better known :
Freedom Tour ’08 .
Musician Marc Scibilia is heading up this 28 - city tour , which begins in just a matter of days , promoting the Ron Paul message via music and more .
See the brief video here .
It ’s impossible to imagine this not being a great time .
Revolution By Mail .
This project is designed to get Ron Paul ’s # 1 New York Times bestseller , The Revolution : A Manifesto , into the hands of as many Americans as possible , beginning with GOP delegates and then extending to many other sectors of society .
Check it out , and here ’s a YouTube .
The creator of Revolution By Mail , whom I do not know personally , intends to turn his attention in the near future to the forthcoming RevolutionBookClub.com , to promote the formation of book clubs all over the country and the world to discuss and learn from the Manifesto , as well as ( at some point ) other books belonging to the same tradition of thought .
Revolution March .
The rally in Washington , D.C. that Dr. Paul called for is taking place on July 12 , with the man himself as the keynote speaker .
The Freedom Tour concludes with a performance at this event .
If you ’re even slightly considering attending , go ahead and take the plunge , and bring a bunch of friends .
Can you actually imagine not enjoying yourself ?
RonPaulRevolutionBook.com .
This is a grassroots project to promote The Revolution : A Manifesto .
You ’ll find lots of things here , including promotional ideas , lower - than - Amazon pricing on bulk orders , and lots of neat merchandise .
Revolution Broadcasting .
In addition to its regular programming , this Ron Paul - inspired Internet broadcasting venture has provided live coverage of various Ron Paul events , and now carries the weekly National Ron Paul Conference Call .
I have a new program of my own there , as a matter of fact , which runs on Tuesdays for an hour at 2:00 pm Eastern .
( Episodes will be archived here and a podcast feed will go up in the relatively near future . )
My first guest will be Bill Kauffman , author of the excellent new book Ain’t My America : The Long , Noble History of Antiwar Conservatism and Middle American Anti-Imperialism .
There ’s no way that can be dull .
Republican Convention .
In this interview with Charles Goyette , Ron Paul calls for a " grand rally " in St. Paul at the time of the Republican Convention .
Rand Paul wants to see as many people get to St. Paul as possible .
The campaign website will have details soon .
Operation St. Paul .
The designer of the High Tide Ron Paul television commercial is proposing that the St. Paul area be blanketed with signs and ads promoting Ron Paul ’s message around the time of the Republican Convention in early September .
He describes the initiative and the rationale behind it here , where there ’s also a ChipIn link for donations .
Here are a couple of billboards he has designed for the occasion :
The main idea behind Operation St. Paul is to keep spreading the word about these ideas .
What ’s more , though , I think it ’d just be fun to pull off .
Lots of volunteers have put in countless hours on behalf of all these good causes .
Let ’s get the word out about them .
The Best of Tom Woods
The findings were published today in the Nature and Nature Genetics science journals .
One of the study 's authors , Professor Bryan Mowry , said while it was too early to develop genetic testing for schizophrenia , the findings were a major advance in scientists ' understanding of the illness .
Previously , there was no evidence of a genetic link to the disease .
" Schizophrenia is a devastating illness causing delusions , hallucinations and impairing social and cognitive behaviour , " he said .
Professor Mowry said the study , as well as similar concurrent studies overseas , " represent a landmark step forward in the effort to uncover the genetic basis for schizophrenia , with the hope to develop better treatment - hopefully in the near future " .
He said the Queensland team had celebrated its success but was now back at work , expanding on its research .
Professor John McGrath , Queensland schizophrenia expert and head of the Queensland Brain Institute 's schizophrenia group at the University of Queensland , praised the researchers for their " backbreaking work " , which had led to a greater understanding of the brain disorder .
" If you think about the human genetic code as a huge instruction manual , some mistakes involve tiny , single letter typographical errors within the word , " he said .
" Another type of mistake may involve deleting a whole paragraph , or repeating a sentence twice .
" The three papers published this week have reported findings that both of these types of genetic mutations increase the risk for schizophrenia . "
In Australia , approximately seven in every 1000 people will be diagnosed with some form of schizophrenia in their lifetime .
TrueCrypt's Deniable File System
Together with Tadayoshi Kohno , Steve Gribble , and three of their students at the University of Washington , I have a new paper that breaks the deniable encryption feature of TrueCrypt version 5.1a .
Basically , modern operating systems leak information like mad , making deniability a very difficult requirement to satisfy .
ABSTRACT : We examine the security requirements for creating a Deniable File System ( DFS ) , and the efficacy with which the TrueCrypt disk - encryption software meets those requirements .
We find that the Windows Vista operating system itself , Microsoft Word , and Google Desktop all compromise the deniability of a TrueCrypt DFS .
While staged in the context of TrueCrypt , our research highlights several fundamental challenges to the creation and use of any DFS : even when the file system may be deniable in the pure , mathematical sense , we find that the environment surrounding that file system can undermine its deniability , as well as its contents .
Finally , we suggest approaches for overcoming these challenges on modern operating systems like Windows .
The students did most of the actual work .
I helped with the basic ideas , and contributed the threat model .
Deniability is a very hard feature to achieve .
There are several threat models against which a DFS could potentially be secure : One - Time Access .
The attacker has a single snapshot of the disk image .
An example would be when the secret police seize Alice ’s computer .
Intermittent Access .
The attacker has several snapshots of the disk image , taken at different times .
An example would be border guards who make a copy of Alice ’s hard drive every time she enters or leaves the country .
Regular Access .
The attacker has many snapshots of the disk image , taken in short intervals .
An example would be if the secret police break into Alice ’s apartment every day when she is away , and make a copy of the disk each time .
Since we wrote our paper , TrueCrypt released version 6.0 of its software , which claims to have addressed many of the issues we ’ve uncovered .
In the paper , we said :
We analyzed the most current version of TrueCrypt available at the writing of the paper , version 5.1a .
We shared a draft of our paper with the TrueCrypt development team in May 2008 .
TrueCrypt version 6.0 was released in July 2008 .
We have not analyzed version 6.0 , but observe that TrueCrypt v6.0 does take new steps to improve TrueCrypt ’s deniability properties ( e.g. , via the creation of deniable operating systems , which we also recommend in Section 5 ) .
We suggest that the breadth of our results for TrueCrypt v5.1a highlight the challenges to creating deniable file systems .
Given these potential challenges , we encourage the users not to blindly trust the deniability of such systems .
Rather , we encourage further research evaluating the deniability of such systems , as well as research on new yet light - weight methods for improving deniability .
So we cannot break the deniability feature in TrueCrypt 6.0 .
But , honestly , I would n’t trust it .
There have been two news articles ( and a Slashdot thread ) about the paper .
One talks about a generalization to encrypted partitions .
If you do n’t encrypt the entire drive , there is the possibility — and it seems very probable — that information about the encrypted partition will leak onto the unencrypted rest of the drive .
Whole disk encryption is the smartest option .
Our paper will be presented at the 3rd USENIX Workshop on Hot Topics in Security ( HotSec ’08 ) .
I ’ve written about deniability before .

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - General Motors Corp Chief Executive Rick Wagoner is slated to announce the automaker ’s second major restructuring package in six weeks on Tuesday as the company looks to cut costs and win back investor confidence in the face of slumping sales .
General Motors Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Wagoner speaks during a news conference after the General Motors annual shareholders meeting in Wilmington , Delaware , June 3 , 2008 .

The cost - cutting will include widespread job cuts for white - collar workers , including engineers assigned to now - frozen efforts to develop GM ’s next generation of full - size SUVs and pickup trucks , people familiar with the plans said .
Analysts also expect GM to unveil a shake - up of its product portfolio to reflect steps intended to make the line - up more competitive on fuel efficiency .
In addition , GM is expected to detail steps to conserve cash -- including possibly eliminating dividend payments -- as it prepares to raise capital to carry it into 2010 when it will begin to capture large savings from a contract reached last year with the United Auto Workers union , analysts have said .
Shares of GM bounced higher by as much as 5 percent in after - hours trade after the news .
The stock has lost about 63 percent since the start of the year .
GM executives , including Wagoner , scheduled a series of briefings for employees , analysts and reporters starting at 8:30 a.m. EDT on Tuesday .
The company said those briefings would include executives responsible for GM ’s financial performance and its product line - up and would detail what GM is doing to “ align ” its operations to current market conditions .
The largest U.S. automaker has been under intensifying pressure to cut costs because of a rapid shift away from trucks and SUVs and a decline in overall sales .
“ I think it will be a pretty involved discussion , ” said David Cole , chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor , Michigan .
“ I would n’t expect them to leave much untouched . ”
David Healy , an analyst with Burnham Securities , said GM could cut “ several thousand ” white - collar jobs , make some temporary plant closings permanent and consolidate a vehicle line - up some analysts have criticized for overlapping too much between brands .
“ Given the situation of the car market , the radical change in mix of what people want to buy and the fact that GM will probably lose from operations -- not including write - offs -- six to seven billion dollars this year , I think they are going to shrink the company more , ” Healy said .
In early June , Wagoner announced GM would close four North American truck plants employing about 100,000 workers and would try to sell its Hummer brand in response to higher gas prices .
But market sentiment has darkened on GM and the auto sector in the weeks since that announcement , with most analysts no longer expecting a real recovery in U.S. auto sales in 2009 .
GM ’s U.S. sales were down 16 percent in the first half of the year , led by a 20 percent drop in sales of trucks .
CASH IS KING
The automaker ’s shares touched a 54 - year low last week as investors reacted to growing concern that the automaker would be forced to raise up to $ 15 billion in additional capital to ride out the downturn .
GM ended the first quarter with $ 31 billion in cash and undrawn credit .
Wagoner has said that is enough for GM to make it through any downturn this year , although he has also encouraged GM managers to focus on preserving cash .
Bankers and analysts have said GM needs to show more progress in cost cutting as a condition to any move to tap capital markets , including the syndicated bank loan market .
Cole said GM financial market concerns had forced GM to address questions about its cash position and steps it could take to shore up liquidity .
“ This was not an option of sitting this cycle out , ” he said .
“ They had to talk ... but they have a lot of options . ”
Last month , GM said it had suspended work on next - generation versions of its full - size trucks , which had been scheduled to launch in 2012 .
Other automakers including Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp have taken similar steps in recent weeks in reaction to the sharp decline in U.S. truck sales .
Because GM has concentrated its full - size truck product development in North America , the resulting job cuts from the shift away from those vehicles will hit the automaker ’s home market , a person familiar with the plans said .
Healy , who does not own GM shares , said the quick shift in GM ’s product plans away from trucks like the Silverado and the Yukon SUV presented an obvious cost - cutting target .
“ I think they have discontinued plans for replacement of big SUVs and some engineers have been reassigned to small - car projects , ” he said .
“ But with a smaller company and a thinner product line , that leaves them overstaffed . ”
Holocaust by hunger :
The truth behind Stalin's Great Famine
The demented Roman Emperor Caligula once mused that if all the people of Rome had one neck he would cut it just to be rid of his troublesome people .
The trouble was there were simply too many Romans to kill them all .
Many centuries later , the brutal Soviet dictator Josef Stalin reflected that he would have liked to deport the entire Ukrainian nation , but 20 million were too many to move even for him .
So he found another solution : starvation .
Now , 75 years after one of the great forgotten crimes of modern times , Stalin 's man-made famine of 1932 / 3 , the former Soviet republic of Ukraine is asking the world to classify it as a genocide .
The Ukrainians call it the Holodomor - the Hunger .
Millions starved as Soviet troops and secret policemen raided their villages , stole the harvest and all the food in villagers ' homes .
They dropped dead in the streets , lay dying and rotting in their houses , and some women became so desperate for food that they ate their own children .
If they managed to fend off starvation , they were deported and shot in their hundreds of thousands .
So terrible was the famine that Igor Yukhnovsky , director of the Institute of National Memory , the Ukrainian institution researching the Holodomor , believes as many as nine million may have died .
For decades the disaster remained a state secret , denied by Stalin and his Soviet government and concealed from the outside world with the help of the ' useful idiots ' - as Lenin called Soviet sympathisers in the West .
Russia is furious that Ukraine has raised the issue of the famine : the swaggering 21st - century state of Prime Minister Putin and President Medvedev see this as nationalist chicanery designed to promote Ukraine , which may soon join Nato and the EU .
They see it as an anti-Russian manoeuvre more to do with modern politics than history .
And they refuse to recognise this old crime as a genocide .
They argue that because the famine not only killed Ukrainians but huge numbers of Russians , Cossacks , Kazakhs and many others as well , it can't be termed genocide - defined as the deliberate killing of large numbers of a particular ethnic group .
It may be a strange defence , but it is historically correct .
So what is the truth about the Holodomor ?
And why is Ukraine provoking Russia 's wrath by demanding public recognition now ?
The Ukraine was the bread basket of Russia , but the Great Famine of 1932 / 3 was not just aimed at the Ukrainians as a nation - it was a deliberate policy aimed at the entire Soviet peasant population - Russian , Ukrainian and Kazakh - especially better - off , small - time farmers .
It was a class war designed to ' break the back of the peasantry ' , a war of the cities against the countryside and , unlike the Holocaust , it was not designed to eradicate an ethnic people , but to shatter their independent spirit .
So while it may not be a formal case of genocide , it does , indeed , rank as one of the most terrible crimes of the 20th century .
To understand the origins of the famine , we have to go back to the October 1917 Revolution when the Bolsheviks , led by a ruthless clique of Marxist revolutionaries including Lenin , Trotsky and Stalin , seized power in the name of the workers and peasants of the Russian Empire to create a Marxist paradise , using terror , murder and repression .
The Russian Empire was made of many peoples , including the Russians , Ukrainians , Kazakhs and Georgians , but the great majority of them , especially in the vast arable lands of Ukraine , southern Russia , the northern Caucasus , and Siberia , were peasants , who dreamed only of owning their own land and farming it .
Initially , they were thrilled with the Revolution , which meant the breakup of the large landed estates into small parcels which they could farm .
But the peasants had no interest in the Marxist utopian ideologies that obsessed Lenin and Stalin .
Once they had seized their plots of land , they were no longer interested in esoteric absurdities such as Marx 's stages in the creation of a classless society .
The fact is they were essentially conservative and wanted to pass what little wealth they had to their children .
This infuriated Lenin and the Bolsheviks , who believed that the peasantry , especially the ones who owned some land and a few cows , were a huge threat to a collectivist Soviet Russia .
Lenin's hatred of the peasantry became clear when a famine occurred in Ukraine and southern Russia in 1921 , the inevitable result of the chaos and upheaval of the Revolution .
With his bloodthirsty loathing for all enemies of the Revolution , he said ' Let the peasants starve ' , and wrote ranting notes ordering the better - off peasants to be hanged in their thousands and their bodies displayed by the roadsides .
Yet this was an emotional outburst and , ever the ruthless pragmatist , he realised the country was so poor and weak in the immediate aftermath of its revolutionary civil war that the peasants were vital to its survival .
So instead , he embraced what he called a New Economic Policy , in effect a temporary retreat from Marxism , that allowed the peasants to grow crops and sell them for profit .
It was always planned by Lenin and his fellow radicals that this New Economic Policy should be a stopgap measure which would soon be abandoned in the Marxist cause .
But before this could happen , Lenin died in 1924 and Stalin defeated all his rivals for the Soviet leadership .
Then , three years later , grain supplies dropped radically .
It had been a poor crop , made worse by the fact that many peasant farmers had shifted from grain into more lucrative cotton production .
Stalin travelled across Russia to inspect supplies and ordered forcible seizures of grain from the peasantry .
Thousands of young urban Communists were drafted into the countryside to help seize grain as Stalin determined that the old policies had failed .
Backed by the young , tough Communists of his party , he devised what he called the Great Turn : he would seize the land , force the peasants into collective farms and sell the excess grain abroad to force through a Five Year Plan of furious industrialisation to make Soviet Russia a military super power .
He expected the peasants to resist and decreed anyone who did so was a kulak - a better - off peasant who could afford to withhold grain - and who was now to be treated as a class enemy .
By 1930 , it was clear the collectivisation campaign was in difficulties .
There was less grain than before it had been introduced , the peasants were still resisting and the Soviet Union seemed to be tottering .
Stalin , along with his henchman Vyacheslav Molotov and others , wrote a ruthless memorandum ordering the ' destruction of the kulaks as a class ' .
They divided huge numbers of peasants into three categories .
The first was to be eliminated immediately ; the second to be imprisoned in camps ; the third , consisting of 150,000 households - almost a million innocent people - was to be deported to wildernesses in Siberia or Asia .
Stalin himself did not really understand how to identify a kulak or how to improve grain production , but this was beside the point .
What mattered was that sufficient numbers of peasants would be killed or deported for all resistance to his collectivisation programme to be smashed .
In letters written by many Soviet leaders , including Stalin and Molotov , which I have read in the archives , they repeatedly used the expression : ' We must break the back of the peasantry . '
And they meant it .
In 1930 / 1 , millions of peasants were deported , mainly to Siberia .
But 800,000 people rebelled in small uprisings , often murdering local commissars who tried to take their grain .
So Stalin's top henchmen led armed expeditions of secret policemen to crush ' the wreckers ' , shooting thousands .
The peasants replied by destroying their crops and slaughtering 26 million cattle and 15 million horses to stop the Bolsheviks ( and the cities they came from ) getting their food .
Their mistake was to think they were dealing with ordinary politicians .
But the Bolsheviks were far more sinister than that : if many millions of peasants wished to fight to the death , then the Bolsheviks were not afraid of killing them .
It was war - and the struggle was most vicious not only in the Ukraine but in the north Caucasus , the Volga , southern Russia and central Asia .
The strain of the slaughter affected even the bull - nerved Stalin , who sensed opposition to these brutal policies by the more moderate Bolsheviks , including his wife Nadya .
He knew Soviet power was suddenly precarious , yet Stalin kept selling the grain abroad while a shortage turned into a famine .
More than a million peasants were deported to Siberia : hundreds of thousands were arrested or shot .
Like a village shopkeeper doing his accounts , Stalin totted up the numbers of executed peasants and the tonnes of grains he had collected .
By December 1931 , famine was sweeping the Ukraine and north Caucasus .
' The peasants ate dogs , horses , rotten potatoes , the bark of trees , anything they could find , ' wrote one witness Fedor Bleov .
By summer 1932 , Fred Beal , an American radical and rare outside witness , visited a village near Kharkov in Ukraine , where he found all the inhabitants dead in their houses or on the streets , except one insane woman .
Rats feasted on the bodies .
Beal found messages next to the bodies such as : ' My son , I could n't wait .
God be with you .'
One young communist , Lev Kopolev , wrote at the time of ' women and children with distended bellies turning blue , with vacant lifeless eyes .
' And corpses .
Corpses in ragged sheepskin coats and cheap felt boots ; corpses in peasant huts in the melting snow of Vologda [ in Russia ] and Kharkov [ in Ukraine ] . '
Cannibalism was rife and some women offered sexual favours in return for food .
There are horrific eye - witness accounts of mothers eating their own children .
In the Ukrainian city of Poltava , Andriy Melezhyk recalled that neighbours found a pot containing a boiled liver , heart and lungs in the home of one mother who had died .
Under a barrel in the cellar they discovered a small hole in which a child 's head , feet and hands were buried .
It was the remains of the woman 's little daughter , Vaska .
A boy named Miron Dolot described the countryside as ' like a battlefield after a war .
' Littering the fields were bodies of starving farmers who'd been combing the potato fields in the hope of finding a fragment of a potato .
' Some frozen corpses had been lying out there for months . '
On June 6 , 1932 , Stalin and Molotov ordered ' no deviation regarding amounts or deadlines of grain deliveries are to be permitted ' .
A week later , even the Ukrainian Bolshevik leaders were begging for food , but Stalin turned on his own comrades , accusing them of being wreckers .
' The Ukraine has been given more than it should , ' he stated .
When a comrade at a Politburo meeting told the truth about the horrors , Stalin , who knew what was happening perfectly well , retorted : ' Would n't it be better for you to leave your post and become a writer so you can concoct more fables ! '
In the same week , a train pulled into Kiev from the Ukrainian villages ' loaded with corpses of people who had starved to death ' , according to one report .
Such tragic sights had no effect on the Soviet leadership .
When the American Beal complained to the Bolshevik Ukrainian boss , Petrovsky , he replied : ' We know millions are dying .
That is unfortunate , but the glorious future of the Soviet Union will justify it . '
Stalin was not alone in his crazed determination to push through his plan .
The archives reveal one young communist admitting : ' I saw people dying from hunger , but I firmly believed the ends justified the means . '
Though Stalin was admittedly in a frenzy of nervous tension , it was at this point in 1932 when under another leader the Soviet Union might have simply fallen apart and history would have been different .
Embattled on all sides , criticised by his own comrades , faced with chaos and civil war and mass starvation in the countryside , he pushed on ruthlessly - even when , in 1932 , his wife Nadya committed suicide , in part as a protest against the famine .
' It seems in some regions of Ukraine , Soviet power has ceased to exist , ' he wrote .
' Check the problem and take measures . '
That meant the destruction of any resistance .
Stalin created a draconian law that any hungry peasant who stole even a husk of grain was to be shot - the notorious Misappropriation of Socialist Property law .
' If we do n't make an effort , we might lose Ukraine , ' Stalin said , almost in panic .
He dispatched ferocious punitive expeditions led by his henchmen , who engaged in mass murders and executions .
Not just Ukraine was targeted - Molotov , for example , headed to the Urals , the Lower Volga and Siberia .
Lazar Kaganovich , a close associate of Stalin , crushed the Kuban and Siberia regions where famine was also rife .
Train tickets were restricted and internal passports were introduced so that it became impossible for peasants to flee the famine areas .
Stalin called the peasants ' saboteurs ' and declared it 'a fight to the death !
These people deliberately tried to sabotage the Soviet stage ' .
Between four and five million died in Ukraine , a million died in Kazakhstan and another million in the north Caucasus and the Volga .
By 1933 , 5.7 million households - somewhere between ten million and 15 million people - had vanished .
They had been deported , shot or died of starvation .
As for Stalin , he emerged more ruthless , more paranoid , more isolated than before .
Stalin later told Winston Churchill that this was the most difficult time of his entire life , harder even than Hitler 's invasion .
' It was a terrible struggle ' in which he had ' to destroy ten million .
It was fearful .
Four years it lasted - but it was absolutely necessary ' .
Only in the mind of a brutal dictator could the mass murder of his own people be considered ' necessary ' .
Whether it was genocide or not , perhaps now the true nature of one of the worst crimes in history will finally be acknowledged .
• Sashenka , a novel of love , family , death and betrayal in 20th century Russia , by Simon Sebag Montefiore , is out now .
" Hold your hands out to the sun .
What do you feel ?
Heat , of course .
But there 's pressure as well – though you 've never noticed it , because it 's so tiny .
Over the area of your hands , it only comes to about a millionth of an ounce .
But out in space , even a pressure as small as that can be important – for it's acting all the time , hour after hour , day after day .
Unlike rocket fuel , it 's free and unlimited .
If we want to , we can use it ; we can build sails to catch the radiation blowing from the sun . "
These words were spoken not by a NASA scientist but by a fictional character – John Merton – in Arthur C. Clarke 's short story The Wind from the Sun .
If all goes well , Merton 's prophetic words are about to become fact .
NASA researchers , thinking " out of the box " ( or maybe " out of the rocket " ) have long dreamed of the possibility of sailing among the planets with sails propelled by sunlight instead of by wind .
Except in works of fiction , though , no one has yet successfully deployed such a sail anywhere beyond Earth .
" There 's a first time for everything , " says Edward " Sandy " Montgomery of NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center .
Montgomery 's team and a team from Ames Research Center ( led by Elwood Agasid ) hope to make history this summer by deploying a solar sail called NanoSail - D .
It will travel to space onboard a SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket , scheduled for launch from Omelek Island in the Pacific Ocean during a window extending from July 29th to August 6th ( a back - up extends from August 29th to September 5th ) .
" NanoSail - D will be the first fully deployed solar sail in space , and the first spacecraft to use solar pressure as a primary means of attitude control or orbital maneuvering , " says Montgomery , who is NanoSail - D's payload manager .
" We are always on the lookout for opportunities .
Ames owns a slot on the Falcon 1 launch and asked us if we wanted to go along .
We said , ' Yes ! '
We 'll use the Poly Picosatellite Orbital Deployer , or P - POD , developed by the University of California Polytechnic Institute to deploy our sail . "
A few years ago , the Planetary Society attempted a mission like NanoSail - D called Cosmos I , but the launch vehicle failed and destroyed the undeployed spacecraft .
Montgomery and team believe that NanoSail - D , however , will unfurl four gossamer wings from its pod in the blackness of space like a butterfly from a cocoon : movie .
" The structure is made of aluminum and space - age plastic , " says Montgomery .
" The whole spacecraft weighs less than ten pounds .
We carry it around in a special suitcase -- airplane carry - on luggage size . "
Fully opened , the kite - shaped sail spreads out to about 100 square feet of light - catching surface .
" A success would be huge for the future of space exploration , " Montgomery believes .
Why so important ?
Solar sails could extend our reach as far as our dreams .
Because there 's no friction in space , once a solar sail starts moving , it can go on forever .
Indeed , long after a rocket would run out of gas and begin to coast , a solar sailship could still be accelerating , achieving speeds much faster and covering distances far greater than any rocket .
No rocket in existence could carry enough fuel to reach the outer solar system in as short a time .
And like a marine sail , a solar sail could also bring you home .
You could use the solar sail to tack your vessel , making it travel " against the wind , " back to Earth .
" It 's not so much about how far a sail will go compared to a rocket ; the key is how fast , " says Montgomery .
" The Voyagers have escaped the solar system , and they were sent by rockets , but it 's taken more than three decades to do it .
A sail launched today would probably catch up with them in a single decade .
Sails are slower to get started though .
So , for example , between the Earth and the moon , rockets might be preferred for missions with a short timeline .
It 's a trip of days for rockets , but months for a solar sail .
The rule of thumb , therefore , would be to use rockets for short hops and solar sails for the long hauls . "
All of this may sound like speculation , but NanoSail - D could show that solar sails are truly feasible .
And there 's an added bonus to this technology demo :
" Currently , micro-satellites in orbit above a few hundred kilometers can stay in orbit for decades after completing their mission , " explains Montgomery .
" This creates an orbital debris collision risk for other spacecraft .
NanoSail - D will demonstrate the feasibility of using a drag sail to decrease the time satellites clutter up Earth 's orbit .
Although our sail looks like a kite , it will act like a parachute ( or like a drag sail ) in the very thin upper atmosphere around Earth .
It will slow the spacecraft and make it lose altitude , re-enter the Earth 's atmosphere and burn off in a relatively short period of time .
A drag sail is a lighter alternative to carrying a propulsion system to de-orbit a satellite . "
And finally , the question everyone wants answered :
What does D stand for ?
" We chose the ' D ' in the name , not because it came after models A , B , and C , but because it can stand for demonstrate , deploy , drag , and / or de-orbit , " says Montgomery .
Soon , ' D ' may stand for something new : " DID IT ! "

Comedian Andy Dick arrested in drug , sex case
MURRIETA , Calif .  Comedian Andy Dick has been arrested in Riverside County for investigation of drug use and sexual battery .
The Sheriff 's Department says Dick , 42 , was arrested shortly before 2 a.m. Wednesday in the parking lot near the Buffalo Wild Wings Grill & Bar in Murrieta .
According to The Smoking Gun website , Dick " allegedly groped the breasts of a 17 - year - old girl and then pulled the teen 's tank top and bra down , exposing her breasts . "
A police search of Dick turned up a small amount of marijuana and a single Xanax pill for which he did not have a prescription , per the website .
The former co-star of the TV sitcom " NewsRadio " is being held on $ 5,000 bail .
In 1999 , Dick was arrested for possession of cocaine and marijuana after driving his car into a telephone pole in Hollywood .
He went into a diversion program .
Last year , he was cited in Columbus , Ohio , for urinating in public .
With wire services .
James Cridland , BBC radio new media über - lord left a comment on here recently , pointing out that , despite the fact that I was watching the telly at the time , I was one of the very , very few people to put their hand up and admit to coding in Perl during the recent TechCrunch UK / BBC debate at Broadcasting House .
The question arose because of the continual clamour that the BBC should release all production code under some sort of Open Source / Creative Commons / GNU GPL licence .
James was making the point that there may not be such a pent - up demand once the Wizard 's curtain was removed to reveal a whole bundle of Perl .
The reason that I ended up learning a smattering of Perl was precisely because I was at the BBC .
It was Perl that the development infrastructure supported , and it seemed ' the thing to do ' .
I continue to use it because , rather like the failed Compact Cassette vs DAT or DCC transition I mentioned earlier this week - Perl is mostly still good enough .
All I ever really need to do programatically these days is fetch a web page and see if there are certain links in it , or fetch a web page and extract a specific region from it , or grab an RSS feed and slightly alter the contents in some way .
These are all things that Perl is great for , as they basically boil down , one way or another , to manipulating a few bits of text .
I suspect that at some point down the line I might benefit from learning a bit of PHP or Python or Ruby or something , but seeing as I am not myself in the business of building scalable dynamic web applications - I just help to design them - at the moment I do just fine .
In fact one of the last and most useful pieces of advice given to me by my line manager when I left the BBC in 2005 was " do n't dabble in code " .
The thing with Perl is that nearly everything about it , from the syntax to the default variables , is all based around being as lazy as possible .
So , with that philosophy in mind , why would I buy reference books for a new language , and try and learn anything else ?
That just sounds like hard work .
In fact , now I come to think of it , if I could find a way to still use ZX Spectrum BASIC , and a rubber keypad with all of the possible commands you could use already printed on it , I would ...

Remember Bill Moyers ' deft handling of Bill O'Reilly ambush producer Porter Barry ?
I could n't wait to see how Billo would use the footage , knowing full well that he'd never allow the unedited version on his show to prove how superior Bill Moyers is -- professionally , morally , graciousness , and in all other ways -- to the whole of the FOXNews empire .
In fact , for fun , look at the comparison of coverage of this tête - à - tête between Billo and Olbermann , courtesy of FreePress.net .
Billo can hardly contain his disdain for the National Conference for Media Reform .
The concept of " media reform " being apparently a radically leftist idea that can only take shape with funding from George Soros and America - haters like MoveOn and Robert Greenwald .
( Have I got all the stereotypical smears in ? )
His proof that they are radical leftists ?
Their unanimous contempt for FOXNews .
( Bill , bubbeleh , NCMR wants to reform the media -- obviously the biggest violators of the separation between journalism and propaganda showing up to their conference to do the kind of smear job you proved you would do is going to bring out some hostility .
I would n't be offering you any m-fing iced tea if you showed up on my doorstep either ) .
How can you tell that FOX News has nothing to work with ?
They bring out the body language expert .
They actually try to claim that Moyers ' was physically dominating Porter Barry by patting him on the shoulder .
Scraping the bottom of the barrel , Bill .
FreePress 's Tim Karr thinks he knows what scares Bill O'Reilly so much .
During his Wednesday night broadcast Bill O'Reilly called Dan Rather 's attendance at this week 's Minneapolis conference proof positive that the former CBS anchor was farther than far left .
" These people are crazy !
Crazy ! "
O'Reilly said of the more than 3,000 people attending the conference .
" He 's hanging with real nuts ! "
What O'Reilly is afraid to admit is that the media reform movement encompasses everyone who thinks our mainstream media -- that means you , Bill -- could do a lot better .
Doing your job well and honestly ?
On Fox ???

Marinate your meat
The high temperature required to grill meat ( and broil and fry , for that matter ) creates compounds called heterocyclic amines that are linked to cancer .
These compounds may damage DNA enough to spur the growth of tumors in the colon , breast , prostate , and lymph cells .
One University of Minnesota study found that eating charred meat regularly can increase pancreatic cancer risk by up to 60 percent .
According to research in the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry , marinating red meat in beer or wine for two hours prior to cooking reduced the amount of these harmful compounds .
Kansas State University research found that rubbing rosemary onto uncooked meats blocks the formation of these cancer - causing compounds by up to 100 percent .
You can also rub a couple of cut kiwifruit on a low - fat cut of meat as a tenderizer to help protect the meat during grilling from those harmful cancer - causing compounds .
Make sure you know which cancer screening tests you probably do n’t need just yet .

When biologist Frank Fish spied a figurine of a humpback whale in a Boston gift shop and noticed the pointy bumps along its fins , he said , “ That has to be wrong . ”
But when the shop manager produced a photograph that showed the leading edge of the long fins was indeed serrated like the teeth on a saw , Dr. Fish was intrigued and decided to investigate .
He discovered that these bumps , called tubercles , are this creature ’s secret weapon , allowing a whale the size of a school bus to make tight turns and capture prey with astonishing agility .
Fish , a biology professor at West Chester University of Pennsylvania , is now using this technology perfected by nature to produce fans with serrated blades that use 20 percent less electricity than traditional models .
This finding contradicts conventional designs that strive for the smoothest possible edges .
To understand this phenomenon , imagine airplane wings .
Pilots increase the angle of the airfoil to provide more lift .
But when the angle gets too steep , the air current drags on the wing , suddenly reducing the lift and causing the aircraft to stall .
Fish found that humpback fins act a little differently .
He and his colleagues tested a scale model of the whale flipper in a wind tunnel .
To their surprise , the experiments revealed that significant drag occurs at a much steeper angle on the humpback fin than it does on a sleek flipper .
Each tubercle redirects and channels air over the flipper , creating a sort of whirling vortex that actually improves lift , Fish says .
Calling it “ simple aerohydrodynamics , ” he explains that “ we can get a higher angle with a higher lift force , ” giving the humpbacks more power and maneuverability than smooth - finned whales .
“ These bumps were thought of as anatomical anomalies , but they do modify the flow and they do it in ways that are beneficial to the whale , ” says Fish .
The technology can be used in a huge range of machines such as turbines , compressors , pumps , and fans that use blades or rotors – most anything that cuts through air , water , steam or oil , says Fish .
“ This can be applied to any lifting surface , like airplane wings or windmill blades or sailboat masts , ” he says .
The US Naval Academy participated with Fish in one study and is interested in possible applications for ship and submarine rudders .
Fish teamed up with a Canadian businessman to form WhalePower , a Toronto - based company that markets the technology .
Envira - North Systems , Canada ’s largest supplier of industrial ceiling fans , with 75 percent of the market , recently licensed the design for a new line of fans that measure up to 24 feet in diameter .
“ There was a 20 percent drop in energy use , a significant drop in noise decibels , and overall distribution of air was more even , ” says Envira - North CEO Monica Bowden .
The increased efficiency also means the new fans will have five blades instead of 10 , making them cheaper to manufacture .
Envira - North expects to start shipping in October and phase out production of conventional fans .
The company is fielding calls from potential customers in Britain , China , Saudi Arabia , and Brazil – all new markets for Envira - North .
“ Everybody is interested in green technology right now , ” says Ms. Bowden .
WhalePower cofounder Stephen Dewar says that while the 1 -½ - year - old company has n’t issued a single press release , they ’ve already been contacted by companies around the world – from computer manufacturers interested in putting tiny fans inside laptops to companies with immense server farms looking for cheaper cooling options .
“ We expect quite a wide range of fans to hit the market within a year , ” says Mr. Dewar .
We may even see humpback - inspired fans in our own homes one day .
The company is also developing wind turbines that produce more energy and are quieter than standard turbines .
Last year , WhalePower mounted a wind turbine with its patented serrated blades stretching 33 feet across at the Wind Energy Institute of Canada ’s testing site on Prince Edward Island on the Atlantic coast .
Final results wo n’t be released until year end , but Fish says , “ We can actually get more power out of the wind .
Boeing has just tested its new thin - disk laser , the most powerful solid - state laser ever made .
It fires at over 25 kilowatts , with the scalability proven to go up to a 100 kilowatt laser in the coming years .
A 100 kW laser would be the most powerful ever made , one that has a lot of challenges to overcome , including reducing the excess heat generated by such a powerful laser and maintaining the quality of the beam over distances .
But even a 25 kW laser is extremely powerful .
As the press release says , it " will damage , disable or destroy targets at the speed of light , with little to no collateral damage , supporting missions on the battlefield and in urban operations . "
Hit the jump for the full release .
Boeing Fires New Thin -Disk Laser , Achieving Solid - State Laser Milestone
ST . LOUIS , June 03 , 2008 — The Boeing Company [ NYSE : BA ] fired its new thin - disk laser system repeatedly in recent tests , achieving the highest known simultaneous power , beam quality and run time for any solid - state laser to date .
In each laser firing at Boeing 's facility in West Hills , Calif. , the high - energy laser achieved power levels of over 25 kilowatts for multi-second durations , with a measured beam quality suitable for a tactical weapon system .
The Boeing laser integrates multiple thin - disk lasers into a single system .
Through these successful tests , the Boeing team has proven the concept of scalability to a 100 - kilowatt - class system based on the same architecture and technology .
" Solid - state lasers will revolutionize the battlefield by giving the warfighter an ultra-precision engagement capability that can dramatically reduce collateral damage , " said Scott Fancher , vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems .
" These successful tests show that Boeing has made solid progress toward making this revolutionary capability a reality . "
The thin - disk laser is an initiative to demonstrate that solid - state laser technologies are now ready to move out of the laboratory and into full development as weapon systems .
Solid - state lasers are powered by electricity , making them highly mobile and supportable on the battlefield .
The Boeing laser represents the most electrically efficient solid - state laser technology known .
The system is designed to meet the rapid - fire , rapid - retargeting requirements of area - defense , anti-missile and anti-mortar tactical high - energy laser systems .
It is also ideal for non-lethal , ultra- precision strike missions urgently needed by warfighters in war zones .
" This accomplishment demonstrates Boeing 's commitment to advancing the state of the art in directed energy technology , " said Gary Fitzmire , vice president and program director of Boeing Directed Energy Systems .
" These successful tests are a significant milestone toward providing reliable and supportable lasers to U.S. warfighters . "
Boeing 's approach incorporates a series of commercial - off - the - shelf , state - of - the - art lasers used in the automotive industry .
These industrial lasers have demonstrated exceedingly high reliability , supportability and maintainability .
A high - power solid - state laser will damage , disable or destroy targets at the speed of light , with little to no collateral damage , supporting missions on the battlefield and in urban operations .
Sheehan , activists booted from Judiciary hearing Nick Juliano

Print This Email This Update : Veteran , other activists kicked out of hearing
At several points in Friday 's Judiciary Committee sort - of - almost - not - really impeachment hearing , members of the audience erupted in applause after one of the dozen - plus witnesses delivered a particularly incendiary indictment of President Bush .
The committee 's Republicans were none too amused by these displays , and they whined several times that such outbursts were inappropriate .
Rep. Lamar Smith ( R - TX ) , the committee 's ranking member , at one point asked Chairman John Conyers to clear the hearing room after one particularly rousing ovation from Code Pink activists .
They were responding as author Vincent Bugliosi outlined his case that the Justice Department should bring first degree murder charges against the president for illegally invading Iraq .
Conyers decided not to boot the boisterous activists from the room , but he did remind the entire audience to refrain from any demonstrations of approval or disapproval of the proceedings .
Less than an hour later , Bugliosi , a former Los Angeles County prosecutor who recently wrote The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder , fired up the crowd again .
" By taking this nation into war on a lie , all of the killings of American soldiers in Iraq became unlawful killings , and therefore murders ,  Bugliosi said .
Anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan had been sitting in the crowd , and she shouted , " Thank you Vince . "
Conyers seemed flustered , reminding Sheehan and others that some " members are urging me to take more action than merely reminding our audience , " before trying to move on to the next witness .
" I urge you to take action , " said Sheehan , who is among the most visible activists pushing for impeachment .
After losing her son in the Iraq war , Sheehan became famous for her roadside vigil outside Bush 's Crawford ranch in the summer of 2005 , and she has mounted a long - shot bid to unseat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in this year 's election .
" OK then , Sheehan , you 're out , " Conyers said , but the northern California native was already on her way out the door .
" Im going , " she said .
" Good - bye . "
Later in the hearing , Rep. Steve King ( R - IA ) complained about " the fifth time there 's been a reaction " when no response from the audience could be heard .
" You have ppl in the audience who have signs that are inappropriate to be here , and I wish the chairman would have the rules of the House respected and enforced , " King groaned .
Conyers instructed committee staff and Capitol police officers to " ask anyone with such signs to either remove them or leave the hearing room from this point on . "
This request kicked off more than three minutes of disruption and commotion as blue - clad police officers entered the crowd to escort out a man wearing camouflage fatigues and an button with an anti-war button .
" Your hassling a veteran for wearing a pin ?
That 's an outrage ! " another spectator shouted , before escorting himself from the hearing room .
Another woman in a pink T - shirt started to leave before declaring that she had done nothing wrong and retaking her seat .
A Capitol Police officer tried to grab her and force her from the room before abandoning the effort and letting her stay .
King at one point implored the Congress to simply recess the hearing if he was unable to obtain order .
With all the abuse the Republican president was taking throughout the day , perhaps this request had a dual motive .

WHO says farmers are inflexible ?
In rich countries , they have long justified farm hand - outs by pointing to low world prices for food ( never mind that low prices were partly caused by their own subsidised overproduction ) .
Without public cash , they said , farmers would desert the land , leaving meadows to brambly ruin .
Now that the world is running short of food , the farm lobby has deftly changed tack .
Prices for many crops are at record highs , the new line goes , and rich countries need to protect their farmers in order to ensure that their people get fed .
This mindless self - sufficiency is trotted out even in America , which is preparing a new farm bill .
And it has been backed by the United Nations rapporteur on the “ right to food ” , Jean Ziegler , a Swiss professor who once applauded Cuba 's agricultural policies .
But it is in Europe , with its notorious common agricultural policy ( CAP ) , that farmers are bleating especially loudly .
France , which has long scooped up more CAP money than any other country , leads the way .
Not long ago , President Nicolas Sarkozy seemed to support CAP reform , asserting that farmers should live off their earnings , not from subsidies .
But the French , who take over the EU presidency in July , are now pushing “ community preference ” — jargon for blocking food imports .
To get round world trade rules , they are suggesting that imports satisfy EU environmental , hygiene or animal - welfare rules — which give ample scope to rig markets .
Michel Barnier , the French farm minister , wants joint European action on “ food security ” , and insists that feeding people is too important a task to be left to the market .
Pledging “ complete agreement ” with French plans to recast the CAP , his German counterpart , Horst Seehofer , pours scorn on the idea that the developing world would be helped by reducing European farm protection .
He says he does “ not see how you can help the weak by hurting the strong . ”
Mr Seehofer thinks “ food conflicts ” lurk around the corner .
This is bad news for European consumers and taxpayers , who were promised a proper debate on CAP reform later this year .
They will have to continue paying ( €55 billion last year ) for this wasteful and wicked system .
It is terrible for poor - country farmers , who have long suffered from being shut out of rich - world markets , and having rich - world products dumped on them .
Now they can hear the gates of fortress Europe clanging shut just when world prices should be triggering an export boom .
And it is dreadful news for the hungry poor , because restricting trade in food exacerbates shortages .
The Europeans have made progress in reducing export subsidies and liberalising some markets ; next year , for example , the EU should become a net importer of sugar for the first time .
But reformers need to continue slashing import tariffs , which still average 23 % .
Now that European farmers are earning good money from what they do best — farming — there has never been a better time to reduce support .
If the EU sticks to its offer in the Doha trade round , its farm - import tariffs would drop by just over half .
Cutting them further would do more to ease hunger in poor countries than any foreign aid .
Fruit of the gloom
Defenders of the CAP and other rich - country farm policies cannot have it both ways .
They cannot demand more money when prices are low , and then ask for extra protection when they rise .
High food prices further undermine their already rotten arguments for support , and offer a golden opportunity to dismantle rich - country farm protection .
Governments would be mad as a British cow not to take it .
Cluster bombs contain hundreds of sub-munitions or " bomblets "
More than 100 nations have reached an agreement on a treaty which would ban current designs of cluster bombs .
Diplomats meeting in Dublin agreed to back an international ban on the use of the controversial weapons following 10 days of talks .
But some of the world 's main producers and stockpilers - including the US , Russia and China - oppose the move .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown called it a " big step forward to make the world a safer place " .
He announced earlier that Britain would be taking cluster bombs out of service .
The final draft of the treaty went before delegates from a total of 109 countries on Wednesday afternoon .
See how a cluster bomb works ' Bomblets '
Cluster bombs have been used in countries including Cambodia , Kosovo , Afghanistan and Lebanon .
They are made up of a big container which opens in mid-air , dropping hundreds of smaller individual sub-munitions , or " bomblets " , across a wide area .
Countries like the US , India , Pakistan and Israel claim such munitions are highly useful on the battlefield , but opponents say that where the bomblets fail to explode they leave a deadly legacy for civilians .

During the conference , delegates have heard first - hand accounts from survivors of cluster bomb attacks .
Speaking at Downing Street earlier , Mr Brown said : " I am delighted that the negotiations in Dublin have come to a successful conclusion and congratulate the Irish Government and all those involved .
" I am confident that this agreement is in line with British interests and values , and makes the world a safer place . "
The BBC's Paul Adams said he understood the agreement would outlaw the two types of cluster munitions currently held by UK forces , but would not prevent countries from developing future generations of weapons based on the concept of sub-munitions .
And he said it appeared the UK hoped other countries not present in Dublin , notably the US , might be persuaded to accept the treaty later .
Using British soil
One stumbling block for the treaty could be the stockpile of cluster munitions the US military keeps at bases on British soil .
It will be very difficult for the US to engage in operations with countries who have banned this weapon and continue to use them
Simon Conway
Cluster Munitions Coalition
The British representative in Dublin , John Duncan , said the UK would work with Washington to find a solution to the issue .
But in a statement , the Pentagon stood firm , saying : " While the United States shares the humanitarian concerns of those in Dublin , cluster munitions have demonstrated military utility , and their elimination from US stockpiles would put the lives of our soldiers and those of our coalition partners at risk . "
Some campaigners do believe countries like the US will change , however .
They cite the landmine treaty of 1997 that was never signed by the US , Israel , Russia or China , yet those nations have not used landmines since it came into effect .
Simon Conway , from the Cluster Munitions Coalition , said there would now be " massive " pressure on the US .
" We think now that all of America 's key allies have just renounced the weapon it will be very difficult for the US to engage in operations with countries who have banned this weapon and continue to use them , " he said .
Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Ed Davey said the prime minister must make clear whether he would continue to allow the US to store its own cluster munitions on British territory .
" If he is serious about ending the scourge of these weapons , he must bring this abuse of the ' special relationship ' to an end , " Mr Davey said .
HOW A CLUSTER BOMB WORKS 1 .
The cluster bomb , in this case a CBU - 87 , is dropped from a plane and can fly about nine miles before releasing its load of about 200 bomblets .
2 . The canister starts to spin and opens at an altitude between 1,000 m and 100 m , spraying the bomblets across a wide area .
3 . Each bomblet is the size of a soft drink can and contains hundreds of metal pieces .
When it explodes , it can cause deadly injuries up to 25 m away .

What are these ?
Conservative Sen. Jesse Helms , 86 , a truly great American and champion of freedom , died at 1:15 a.m. today .
Helms , who gave our country three decades of service as a U.S. senator from North Carolina , was ill in recent years .
Heritage President Ed Feulner ( pictured at right with Helms and his wife Dorothy ) presented Helms in 2002 with the Clare Boothe Luce Award , Heritage ’s highest honor , calling him a “ dedicated , unflinching and articulate advocate of conservative policy and principle . ”
In response to today ’s sad news , Feulner offered this statement :
Jesse Helms was one of the most consequential figures of the 20th century .
Along with Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan , he helped establish the conservative movement and became a powerful voice for free markets and free people .
The defeat of Soviet communism and the rise of Ronald Reagan would not have happened without his intrepid leadership at decisive times .
July 4 , 2008 , like July 4 , 1826 , and July 4 , 1831 , will long be remembered as a very special day in the history of American independence .
On the Fourth of July 1826 , John Adams and Thomas Jefferson both died .
On the Fourth of July 1831 , James Monroe died .
On the Fourth of July 2008 , another great American patriot , Jesse Helms , died .
He was the longest serving U.S. senator from North Carolina and a great friend to The Heritage Foundation .
Although America has lost a great Patriot , his legacy will live on .
UPDATE — 12:28 p.m. : Reflections on Helms ’ life are pouring in .
Ben Domenech has written a wonderful post on RedState , and I ’ve offered a few thoughts on my personal blog .
UPDATE — 6:40 p.m. : Heritage ’s Ed Meese , former U.S. attorney general in the Reagan administration , offered these remarks in remembrance of Helms .

CRITICAL THINKING
IQ , genetics , and racism PHIL GASPER discusses how the myths about biology and intelligence refuse to disappear SCIENTIFIC RACISM — the attempt to develop a spurious scientific justification for the claim that some racial groups are superior to others — is an intellectual corpse that refuses to stay buried .
In October 2007 , James Watson , who shared a Nobel Prize in 1962 for discovering the structure of DNA molecules , told a British newspaper that he is “ inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa ” on the grounds that “ all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours — whereas all the testing says not really . ”
Watson continued that while we would like to think that all humans are equal , “ people who have to deal with black employees find this not true . ”
Watson ’s comments rightly caused an uproar , and a tour of England to promote his latest book was called off .
A speech Watson was scheduled to give at London ’s Science Museum was cancelled and an official announcement described his remarks as “ beyond the point of acceptable debate . ”
In the U.S. , the Federation of American Scientists issued a statement declaring that it was “ outraged by the noxious comments of Dr. James Watson … [ who ] chose to use his unique stature to promote personal prejudices that are racist , vicious , and unsupported by science . ”
The 79 - year - old Watson soon apologized “ unreservedly ” for suggesting that Blacks are less intelligent than whites , claiming , “ This is not what I meant . ”
But Watson ’s comments were no off - the - cuff remarks , since in his new book he writes , “ There is no firm reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically .
Our wanting to reserve equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so . ”
As the controversy broke , Watson was suspended from his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island , and he resigned in disgrace a few days later .
That , however , has been far from the end of the controversy .
A few weeks after Watson ’s resignation , the New York Times reported that , “ fervid debates about race , genes and I.Q. have sprung up on the Web , in publications and in conference rooms . ”
Far - right groups , of course , had a field day with Watson ’s remarks , but soon after he made them , the influential libertarian Cato Institute hosted a debate on “ The IQ Conundrum ” in its online journal , in which Linda Gottfredson , a prominent University of Delaware sociologist , defended the view that differences in IQ scores between Blacks and whites may have a genetic basis .
Perhaps most shockingly , in November William Saletan , a science writer for the liberal Slate.com Web site , published a series of articles in which he argued that Watson ’s original comments were correct .
According to Saletan : Tests do show an IQ deficit , not just for Africans relative to Europeans , but for Europeans relative to Asians .
Economic and cultural theories have failed to explain most of the pattern , and there ’s strong preliminary evidence that part of it is genetic .
It ’s time to prepare for the possibility that equality of intelligence , in the sense of racial averages on tests , will turn out not to be true .
Saletan couched his argument in the context of much liberal hand - wringing about the possibility of maintaining a commitment to political equality in the face of biological inequality , ignoring the fact that the view he was defending shifts the blame for very real social and economic inequalities away from racist policies and practices .
Within a few days , however , Saletan issued a semi-apology , admitting that he had based his argument partly on the work of the Canadian psychologist J. Philippe Rushton , a notorious white supremacist who has long defended the idea of biological differences in intelligence between racial groups .
Rushton is president of the Pioneer Fund , the main funder of scientific racism in North America , which was originally founded by Nazi sympathizers in the 1930s and is still classified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group .
Slate.com was embarrassed enough to publish a critique of Saletan by another of its regular writers .
Defenders of the view that some racial groups are genetically more intelligent than others typically base their claims on the fact that some groups score better than others on IQ tests and on the assumption that IQ measures some inherent characteristic of the human mind .
But anyone aware of the history of intelligence testing knows how dubious this assumption is .
The first intelligence tests were developed by the French psychologist Alfred Binet a little over a century ago , with the aim of identifying children who were having difficulty in school and who would benefit from remedial education programs .
Binet attempted to identify intellectual tasks that an average child of a particular age in a given cultural environment could be expected to perform .
Children whose “ mental age ” was more than two years lower than their chronological age were deemed in need of special education .
Binet ’s view was that , with the rare exceptions of individuals suffering from brain damage and other mental disorders , all children could perform well in school if given the appropriate resources and support .
In other words he rejected the view that a person ’s intellectual level is something fixed and unchanging .
When Binet ’s tests crossed the English Channel and the Atlantic , however , and were taken up by leading British and American psychologists who embraced social Darwinism , their results were immediately given a hereditarian interpretation that claimed that the characteristic they measured was something given at birth and fundamentally unalterable .
The Stanford psychologist Lewis Terman refined the items on Binet ’s tests ( giving birth to the standard Stanford - Binet test ) , invented the term “ Intelligence Quotient ” ( IQ ) to refer to the ratio of mental age to chronological age , established a measurement scale with 100 representing average performance , claimed that IQs were not just a useful diagnostic tool for schoolchildren but a measure of general intellectual ability for adults , and relentlessly promoted a hereditarian view of intelligence , even though his own data revealed only a weak correlation between social status and IQ .
According to Terman : Practically all of the investigations which have been made of the influence of nature and nurture on mental performance agree in attributing far more to original endowment than to environment .
Common observation would itself suggest that the social class to which the family belongs depends less on chance than on the parents ’ native qualities of intellect and character … .
The children of successful and cultured parents test higher than children from wretched and ignorant homes for the simple reason that their heredity is better .
Whereas Binet ’s tests had required trained personnel to test individual children , Terman invented the mass IQ test that could be administered to large numbers of children at the same time and which accepted only one correct response for questions that could quite often be interpreted and answered in different ways , and which sometimes exhibited glaring social and cultural biases ( such as requiring knowledge of tennis , bowling , and the design of playing cards ) .
In contrast to Binet , Terman advocated a system of vocational training that would consign low - IQ children into unskilled and semi-skilled work .
Without it , he warned in 1919 , individuals with IQs of seventy to eighty - five would “ drift easily into the ranks of the anti-social or join the army of Bolshevik discontents . ”
Terman ’s views also reflected his own racist assumption .
He wrote of children in the seventy to eighty IQ range :
No amount of school instruction will ever make them intelligent voters or capable citizens … .
They represent the level of intelligence which is very , very common among Spanish - Indian and Mexican families of the Southwest and also among negroes .
Their dullness seems to be racial , or at least inherent in the family stocks from which they came .
The fact that one meets this type with such extraordinary frequency among Indians , Mexicans , and negroes suggests quite forcibly that the whole question of racial differences in mental traits will have to be taken up anew by experimental methods .
The writer predicts that when this is done there will be discovered enormously significant racial differences in general intelligence , differences which cannot be wiped out by any scheme of mental culture .
But as the biologist Stephen Jay Gould points out in his classic exposé of scientific racism , The Mismeasure of Man , Terman ’s arguments for his hereditarian conclusions were laughably weak .
For example , after determining that the average IQ of twenty children in a California orphanage was low , Terman attributed this to the fact that most were “ children of inferior social classes . ”
He dismissed the alternative explanation that living without parents in an institution might affect a child ’s development with the following assertion :
“ The orphanage in question is a reasonably good one and affords an environment which is about as stimulating to normal mental development as average home life among the middle classes . ”
As Gould notes , for Terman and like - minded psychologists hereditarianism was really not so much a conclusion to be argued for as a matter of unquestioned common sense .
Terman wrote , “ Does not common observation teach us that , in the main , native qualities of intellect and character , rather than chance , determine the social class to which a family belongs ? ”
But “ common sense ” is all too often simply a reflection of social prejudice .
When hereditarian views about intelligence were revived in the late 1960s and early 1970s by Arthur Jensen , Richard Herrnstein , and others , the philosopher of science Hilary Putnam argued that they are built on the assumption “ that there are a few ‘ superior ’ people who have this one mysterious factor — ‘ intelligence ’ — and who are good at everything , and a lot of slobs who are not much good at anything . ”
If this assumption seems plausible to some people , Putnam continued , it is only because we live in a society that is highly stratified .
But , in fact , “ ordinary people can do anything that it is in their interest and do it well when ( 1 ) they are highly motivated and ( 2 ) they work collectively . ”
As Putnam pointed out :
That motivation plays a decisive role in acquiring almost any skill is a matter of everyone ’s experience ....
The importance of working collectively is also evidenced in many ways .
The Black and Latin prisoners in Attica Prison are presumably part of [ what Herrnstein calls ] the low IQ “ residue . ”
But they organized brilliantly .
Every popular revolution in history makes the same point — that ordinary people in a revolution can perform incredible feats of organization , planning , strategy , etc .
Ever since IQ tests were invented , their results have been used to justify social and economic inequalities as a reflection of natural differences .
But such claims are based on a series of myths .
Myth #1 : IQ tests measure intelligence .
The simplest reason why this cannot be true is that in ordinary usage intelligence is an inherently vague concept and it has never been given an agreed upon precise scientific definition .
The behavioral psychologist E. G. Boring once proclaimed that intelligence is whatever IQ tests measure , but without some further justification this definition is purely arbitrary .
In fact the two ideas most commonly associated with intelligence by experts are ability to adapt to one ’s environment and ability to learn , but traditional IQ tests are not designed to measure either of these capacities .
According to a recent survey article in the journal of the American Psychological Association , “ traditional tests focus much more on measuring past learning , which can be the result of differences in many factors , including motivation and available opportunities to learn . ”
Does this mean that we should conclude that IQ tests measure nothing more than the ability to do well on IQ tests ?
There is probably more to it than that .
The tests have become more sophisticated over time ( the most obvious cultural biases have been removed , for example ) and some do imperfectly measure capacities that can be reasonably associated with intelligence , such as information comprehension and certain kinds of abstract reasoning and problem solving .
But such analytical skills at best represent only a part of what is normally understood by intelligence , which also includes practical and creative abilities that IQ tests ignore .
Indeed , the Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner has argued that there are as many as eight distinct forms of intelligence .
Thus IQ tests should be seen as no more than a way of assessing some aspects of one kind of intelligence .
Since intelligence encompasses a variety of distinct capacities , it is highly unlikely that overall intelligence can be meaningfully ranked on a single linear scale .
But even if it could be , a person ’s IQ score would not be that measure .
Myth #2 : IQ measures something innate , fixed , and unchangeable .
Whatever IQ tests measure , it is not something unchangeable , fixed forever by an individual ’s genetic inheritance .
The clearest evidence that shows this is the so - called Flynn effect ( named after the intelligence researcher James Flynn ) , which refers to the fact that IQ scores have been rising steadily and significantly since the first tests were devised , although periodically the average score is adjusted back to 100 .
For example , U.S. children with average IQ scores in the 1930s would only score around 80 on today ’s scale .
Since there has not been enough time for significant genetic change over this period , these results indicate that IQ can be dramatically raised by social and environmental factors .
Other researchers have noted that the analytical abilities that the tests measure are repeatedly instilled by Western - style education , indicating both that they can be improved and that the tests may be culturally biased .
Myth # 3 : Race is a biologically significant category .
Claims that racial differences in IQ scores have a genetic basis assume that race is a biologically useful category .
But the racial groups into which we commonly divide people — Black , white , Asian , etc. — do not correspond to any significant biological divisions .
The Marxist biologist Richard Lewontin demonstrated in the 1970s that there is much more genetic variation within such groups than there is between them .
From the biological point of view we can designate any local interbreeding population as a “ race ” if we like , but this concept has very little relation to the ordinary use of the term .
Since neighboring populations will differ in some degree with respect to their gene frequencies , they will count as different races .
Alternatively we could say that two groups count as the same race if the differences between their gene frequencies are not too great — but since the differences come in degrees , there is no biologically non-arbitrary place to draw the line .
This is why race is a social and historical construction , not a biological reality .
Myth # 4 : Group differences in IQ scores are genetic .
Within the U.S. , Blacks consistently score lower on IQ tests than whites .
Similarly , Africans score lower than Europeans .
Despite the fact that , as noted , race is not a biologically relevant category , there have been repeated claims that these differences are due to genetic differences between the relevant populations .
Given the genetic heterogeneity of all these populations ( because modern humans first evolved in Africa , there is in fact more genetic variation in Africa than in the rest of the world ) , these claims are initially highly implausible and there is no serious evidence in their favor .
After a recent survey of the available research , the distinguished University of Michigan psychologist Richard Nisbett concluded , “ The evidence most relevant to the question indicates that the genetic contribution to the Black - white IQ gap is nil . ”
On the contrary , the Black - white IQ gap in the U.S. has narrowed significantly over the past thirty years , suggesting that if environments and educational opportunities were truly equalized , it would disappear completely .
One study found that Black children adopted by white families that provided more educationally stimulating environments had IQs thirteen points higher than Black children adopted by Black families .
Another study of German children fathered by , respectively , Black and white American GIs during the post - 1945 occupation , found that there was no significant difference between their IQs .
Myth # 5 : Differences in levels of economic development reflect differences in intelligence .
Finally , despite the absence of any other credible evidence , the fact that there are enormous global inequalities in wealth and technology leads some people ( including , it seems , James Watson ) to conclude that these differences must be due to innate differences in intelligence between populations .
This myth is exploded by the biologist Jared Diamond in his book Guns , Germs , and Steel .
Diamond argues that people living in societies with Stone Age technology like , for instance , traditional New Guineans , need to be at least as intelligent as modern Europeans and North Americans in order to survive .
Civilization developed more rapidly on the Eurasian landmass not because its inhabitants were more intelligent , but because they had the good fortune to live in more favorable environments , which had more wild plants and animals that could be easily domesticated , and an East - West axis allowing the easier transmission of agricultural advances .
The technological advantages that accrued from this , together with a greater immunity to infectious diseases acquired from centuries of living in close proximity to domesticated animals , eventually allowed Europeans to invade , conquer , and colonize large portions of the globe , sucking out resources that gave a further boost to their economic development , leading to the vast inequalities we see today .
Myths about race and intelligence will persist as long as we live in a racist society .
They are one instance of the doctrine of biological determinism that has become an integral part of modern capitalism .
“ The problem for bourgeois society , ” notes Lewontin , is to reconcile the ideology of equality with the manifest inequality of status , wealth , and power , a problem that did not exist in the bad old days of Dei Gratia .
The solution to that problem has been to put a new gloss on the idea of equality , one that distinguishes artificial inequalities which characterized the ancien régime from the natural inequalities which mark the meritocratic society … .
Biological determinism …is part of the legitimating ideology of our society , the solution offered to our deepest social mystery , the analgesic for our most recurrent social pain .
The myths need to be refuted each time they emerge , but they will not finally disappear until we organize to change the society that gives rise to them .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) -
An Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites looks “ unavoidable ” given the apparent failure of sanctions to deny Tehran technology with bomb - making potential , one of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ’s deputies said on Friday .
“ If Iran continues with its program for developing nuclear weapons , we will attack it .
The sanctions are ineffective , ” Transport Minister Shaul Mofaz told the mass - circulation Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper .
“ Attacking Iran , in order to stop its nuclear plans , will be unavoidable , ” said the former army chief who has also been defense minister .
It was the most explicit threat yet against Iran from a member of Olmert ’s government , which , like the Bush administration , has preferred to hint at force as a last resort should U.N. Security Council sanctions be deemed a dead end .
Iran has defied Western pressure to abandon its uranium enrichment projects , which it says are for peaceful electricity generation rather than bomb - building .
The leadership in Tehran has also threatened to retaliate against Israel -- believed to have the Middle East ’s only atomic arsenal -- and U.S. targets in the Gulf for any attack on Iran .
Mofaz also said in the interview that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who has called for Israel to be wiped off the map , “ would disappear before Israel does . ”
A spokesman for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert did not address Mofaz ’s comments directly but said that “ all options must remain on the table ” and said more could be done to put financial pressure on Tehran .
“ Israel believes strongly that while the U.N. sanctions are positive , much more needs to be done to pressure the regime in Tehran to cease its aggressive nuclear program , ” spokesman Mark Regev said .
“ We believe the international community should be considering further tangible steps such as embargoing refined petroleum headed for Iran , sanctions against Iranian businessmen traveling abroad , tightening the pressure on Iranian financial institutions and other such steps , ” he added .
Mofaz ’s remarks came as he and several other senior members of Olmert ’s Kadima Party prepare for a possible run for top office should a corruption scandal force the Israeli prime minister to step down .
Iranian - born Mofaz has been a main party rival of the Israeli prime minister , particularly following the 2006 elections when Olmert was forced to hand the defense portfolio to Labour , his main coalition partner , at Mofaz ’s expense .
Mofaz , who is also designated as a deputy prime minister , has remained privy to Israel ’s defense planning .
He is a member of Olmert ’s security cabinet and leads regular strategic coordination talks with the U.S. State Department .
Israeli planes destroyed Iraq ’s nuclear reactor in 1981 .
A similar Israeli sortie over Syria last September razed what the U.S. administration said was a nascent nuclear reactor built with North Korean help .
Syria denied having any such facility .
Independent analysts have questioned , however , whether Israel ’s armed forces can take on Iran alone , as its nuclear sites are numerous , distant and well - fortified .

Long ago , in the beginning , a newspaper developed a Web site .
Hundreds followed that lead .
Now , one newspaper has only a Web site .
In the end , what will there be ?
And what will be the consequences for readers ?
A Wisconsin daily newspaper , whose readers have been increasingly shedding it , has now shed a significant expense â€ ” newsprint .
The Capital Times of Madison , whose circulation has fallen from more than 40,000 to 18,000 , said “ - 30 - ” to its printing press .
It has become an online information enterprise around the Madison.com portal .
The 90 - year - old newspaper â€ ” one of two serving Madison under a joint operating agreement â€ ” will only publish a tabloid - sized edition twice per week carrying some news , opinion and a weekly arts , entertainment and culture section .
It will be distributed in its home - delivered partner paper , the Wisconsin State Journal .
It ’s a dicey move , but critics like me have said for years that the Web - only newspaper will see its day come ( which does not mean we have argued that online - only is a good idea ) .
So what does this end - of - print mean for Madison and beyond ?
Capital Newspapers Inc. owns both the formerly evening Cap Times and the morning Wisconsin State Journal ( as well as 18 other newspapers and several niche publications in 17 counties ) .
Revenue shared equally between the Cap Times and the State Journal has allowed the Cap Times to withstand shrinking circulation without severe cuts in staff .
It remains an influential liberal paper , contrasted with the more conservative State Journal .
Not surprisingly , the State Journal reported that it had â€œsucceeded in garnering most of The Capital Timesâ€™s former subscribers and will see its average daily circulation rise from 89,000 to at least 104,000 …â€ 
About 20 jobs will be lost at the Cap Times and another 20 in the printing and distribution divisions of Capital Newspapers .
Here ’s what the paper ’s editor , Paul Fanlund , thinks :
To become a “ CNN.com for Madison , ” The Capital Times will have reporters posting breaking news items to its
Web site seven days a week , 18 hours a day , Fanlund said .
The Web site will also be hiring a staff member to improve its visual and audio content , he said .
“ I absolutely believe the Internet is the future , ” Fanlund said .
But many challenges exist for the remaining staffers ( who had little warning of the change ) who would presumaby provide that ’ round - the - clock coverage , according to Sue Robinson of the University of Wisconsin - Madison :
The introduction of new technologies to a staff that hitherto has not had much training across media platforms .
The welcoming of citizen interaction within the production process .
The 24/7 wire - service - like deadline .
What it means to maintain objectivity as a journalist who must be heard and seen in their audio recordings or video formats .
There is a going to be a significant adjustment period , no doubt , and at the end of it , the CapTimesâ€™ newsroom culture will be altered in a fairly fundamental way .
Given the content of the real CNN.com , why would Mr. Fanlund want the Cap Times to be a local version of that ?
That seems to be an inappropriate frame to be imposed on a local readership by a local journalism entity .
Is that the only model Mr. Fanlund has to present to serve Cap Times readers ?
He “ absolutely believes ” the Internet is future .
But how does he intend to articulate that future ?
And consequences for the Cap Times ‘ readers ?
Who will reading the Cap Times online ?
It had only 18,000 loyal hard - copy readers .
Most appear to have drifted to the State Journal .
A reader of an Internet “ newspaper ” such as the Cap Times must have an Internet connection , preferably broadband , and sufficient income to pay for that connection .
But the latter does not guarantee the former .
That ’s because broadband access is not universal , particularly in rural areas where newspapers are delivered .
( Well , used to be .
Many newspaper are cutting back on widespread circulation because of delivery costs . )
About 57 percent of the nation ’s approximately 105 million households have broadband access , according to an S&R interview with Andy King of Website Optimization , publisher of the monthly Bandwidth Report .
( Those households average about 2.6 people . )
Of those 18,000 loyal Cap Times print subscribers , how many have broadband access to retain their relationships with the newspaper ?
If locally oriented newspapers wish to succeed as online enterprises , they need to assure their local advertisers of eyeballs on the papers ’
Web sites .
Without much wider broadband coverage , how can they do that ?
That ’s why I ’ve argued for a broadband version of the Rural Electrification Act .
Without wider , affordable broadband access , the newspaper industry becomes complicit in a subtle form of redlining .
That ’s a practice commonly thought of in terms of refusing mortgages or insurance based on geography .
But a newspaper ’s decision to go online may in fact practice discrimination based not on geographic location but on the presence or absence of broadband .
Access is generally found in densely populated areas .
Rural areas require greater expense to provide broadband with less opportunity to generate revenue for the provider .
If a newspaper drops its print edition and goes online , what happens to the rural subscriber without broadband access ?
What would the journalism be like in an online enterprise focused on its broadband readers ?
Because newspapers , or online “ papers , ” are so starved for revenue , it ’s likely that their energies will be focused on the wants and needs of an urban , affluent , probably mostly Caucasian population .
That may make for a healthier balance sheet , but that ’s not necessarily healthy for a readership left behind by the switch to online publication .
Newspapers have seen their financial ability to produce a marketable product eroded by revenue losses and gutted by staff cuts in response to those losses .
Yet newspaper managers want their decreased staffs to adjust happily to a greater burden producing more ( and innovative ) news products .
That has consequences , according to John Morton , who writes about the newspaper business for the American Journalism Review .
In “ Enough is Enough , ” he says :
Still , even small newspapers are cutting back .
I recently had an e-mail colloquy with an editor of a small - town daily in the Southwest .
He loves his town and his newspaper , but he is troubled by a significant reduction in his staff at the same time his publisher is urging him to develop new editorial products to gain more readers and advertising .
“ How am I supposed to do this ? ” he asked ; he wondered if I knew how other small - town editors had coped in similar circumstances .
I had little comfort to offer .
I told him that his staff , in addition to the traditional burden of paltry pay , would now have the additional burden of being overworked .
Editors at large dailies have the same problem , but at least they are able to spread the burden over a larger number of staffers .
When the entire staff has ten or twelve people , there is much less running room .
Says Editor & Publisher ’s Joe Strupp about the Cap Times ‘ decision :
It ’s not a surprise because the Web has become such a major factor for newspapers and I think clearly the way they ’re going to survive is do more and more on the Web .
That does n’t necessarily mean everyone ’s going to go Web only in the next five to 10 years .
But has the Web become a major financial factor yet for newspapers ?
No , says Mr. Morton :
Newspaper executives point to the Internet as the future of newspapers , arguing that a combination of online and print products will assure newspapers of a profitable future .
Yet last year newspaper Internet revenue amounted to only 7 percent or so of total advertising .
Moreover , growth in Internet revenue , which in earlier years had been 30 to 40 percent a year , has dropped to about 20 percent .
What this portends is that a successful Internet - print future will be a long time coming .
And if newspapers embark on this future with lesser journalistic products , less circulation , less standing in their markets , the profits of the future likely will be much less than newspapers are accustomed to .
This is the economic and journalistic sea into which the managers of The Capital Times have leapt , perhaps blindly , perhaps too optimistically .
Let ’s check back in a year and see how they â€ ” and their readers â€ ” are doing .
The Bush Administration yet again demonstrates the depths of it ’s depravity :
The Justice Department sent a legal memorandum to the Pentagon in 2003 asserting that federal laws prohibiting assault , maiming and other crimes did not apply to military interrogators who questioned al - Qaeda captives because the president ’s ultimate authority as commander in chief overrode such statutes .
The 81 - page memo , which was declassified and released publicly yesterday , argues that poking , slapping or shoving detainees would not give rise to criminal liability .
The document also appears to defend the use of mind - altering drugs that do not produce “ an extreme effect ” calculated to “ cause a profound disruption of the senses or personality . ”
Although the existence of the memo has long been known , its contents had not been previously disclosed .
Nine months after it was issued , Justice Department officials told the Defense Department to stop relying on it .
But its reasoning provided the legal foundation for the Defense Department ’s use of aggressive interrogation practices at a crucial time , as captives poured into military jails from Afghanistan and U.S. forces prepared to invade Iraq .
Sent to the Pentagon ’s general counsel on March 14 , 2003 , by John C. Yoo , then a deputy in the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , the memo provides an expansive argument for nearly unfettered presidential power in a time of war .
It contends that numerous laws and treaties forbidding torture or cruel treatment should not apply to U.S. interrogations in foreign lands because of the president ’s inherent wartime powers .
“ If a government defendant were to harm an enemy combatant during an interrogation in a manner that might arguably violate a criminal prohibition , he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the al Qaeda terrorist network , ” Yoo wrote .
“ In that case , we believe that he could argue that the executive branch ’s constitutional authority to protect the nation from attack justified his actions . ”
Interrogators who harmed a prisoner would be protected by a “ national and international version of the right to self - defense , ” Yoo wrote .
He also articulated a definition of illegal conduct in interrogations — that it must “ shock the conscience ” — that the Bush administration advocated for years .
“ Whether conduct is conscience - shocking turns in part on whether it is without any justification , ” Yoo wrote , explaining , for example , that it would have to be inspired by malice or sadism before it could be prosecuted .
But only days ago , it seemed inconceivable that Mr. Gregory , who has run all of the firm ’s major capital markets divisions , would lose his job .
He and Mr. Fuld are so close that they often wander in and out of each other ’s offices , discussing both family and business .
Last Saturday , as Lehman scrambled to drum up new investors , the pair had dinner together with their wives .
This week , though , Lehman ’s stock plunged in a deluge of selling , despite the capital raising , which one person close to the firm said was over - subscribed .
Still , several analysts downgraded the company , and it became clear that a drastic step was necessary .
On Wednesday afternoon , Mr. Gregory and Mr. Fuld discussed their options .
Shortly before the market closed at 4 p.m. , the two decided Mr. Gregory would resign , said a person close to the situation .
He will remain at Lehman in an unspecified role .
Ms. Callan , feeling the pressure , resigned a few hours later , that person said .
She will return to work in Lehman ’s investment banking division .
It is a remarkable turnabout for Ms. Callan , who , unlike Mr. Gregory , played no significant role in Lehman ’s mortgage business .
A tax lawyer by training , she stepped into a storm when she became chief financial officer in December .
For months , she tried to dispel rumors that Lehman might run into trouble like Bear Stearns .
In recent weeks , she struggled to rebut criticism of Lehman by David Einhorn , a hedge fund manager who is betting against Lehman stock .
Now , it will fall to Mr. Fuld to persuade both investors and employees that Lehman is sound .
He plans to meet with the managing directors in New York and London next week to try to improve morale .
Lehman may yet sell part of itself to a strategic investor in South Korea , which would most likely buy the stake in the open market , said a person close to the talks .
On Thursday , Mr. Lowitt and Mr. McDade , known as Bart , received a standing ovation when they addressed employees on Lehman ’s trading floor .
Mr. Fuld tried to rally his troops with a speech over the bank ’s internal speaker system .
GAZA CITY ( IPS ) - Mohammed Omer , the Gaza correspondent of IPS , and joint winner of the 2008 Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism , was strip - searched at gunpoint , assaulted and abused by Israeli security officials at the Allenby border crossing between Jordan and the West Bank on Thursday as he tried to return home to Gaza .
Omer , a resident of Rafah in the south of Gaza , and previous recipient of the New America Media ’s Best Youth Voice award several years ago , was returning from London where he had just collected his Gellhorn Prize , and from several European capitals where he had speaking engagements , including a meeting with Greek parliamentarians .
Omer ’s trip was sponsored by The Washington Report , and the Dutch embassy in Tel Aviv was responsible for coordinating Omer ’s travel plans and his security permit to leave Gaza with Israeli officials .
Israel controls the borders of Gaza and severely restricts the entrance and exit of Gazans allegedly on grounds of security .
Human rights organizations accuse the Israelis of using security as a pretext to apply collective punishment indiscriminately .
While waiting in Amman on his way back , Omer eventually received the requisite coordination and security clearance from the Israelis to return to Gaza after this had initially been delayed by several days , he told IPS .
Accompanied by Dutch diplomats , Omer passed through the Jordanian side of the border without incident .
However , after arrival on the Israeli side , trouble began .
He informed a female soldier that he was returning home to Gaza .
He was repeatedly asked where Gaza was , and told that he had neither a permit nor any coordination to cross .
Omer explained that he did indeed have permission and coordination but was nevertheless taken to a room by Israel ’s domestic intelligence agency the Shin Bet , where he was isolated for an hour and a half without explanation .
“ Eventually I was asked whether I had a knife or gun on me even though I had already passed through the x-ray machine , had my luggage searched , and was in the company of Dutch diplomats , ” Omer said .
His luggage was again searched , and security then proceeded to go through every document and paper he had on him , taking down the names and numbers of the European parliamentary officials he had met .
The Shin Bet officials then started to make fun of the European parliamentarians , and mocked Omer for being “ the prize - winning journalist . ”
The Gazan journalist was repeatedly asked why he was returning to “ the hell of Gaza after we allowed you to leave . ”
To this he responded that he wanted to be a voice for the voiceless .
He was told he was a “ trouble - maker . ”
The security men also demanded he show all the money he had on him , and particular attention was paid to the British pounds he was carrying .
His Gellhorn prize money had been awarded in British pounds but he was not carrying the entire sum on him bodily , something the investigators refused to believe .
After being unable to produce the prize money , he was ordered to strip naked .
“ At first I refused but then I had an M16 [ gun ] pointed in my face and my clothes were forcibly removed , even my underwear , ” Omer said .
At this point Omer broke down and pleaded for an end to such treatment .
He said he was told , “ you have n’t seen anything yet . ”
Every cavity of his body was searched as one of the investigators pinned him down on the floor , placing his boot on Omer ’s neck .
Omer began vomiting , and fainted .
When he came round his eyelids were being forcibly opened and his eardrums probed by an Israeli military doctor , who was also armed .
He was then dragged along the floor by his feet by the Shin Bet officials , with his head repeatedly banging on the floor , to a Palestinian ambulance which had been called .
“ I eventually woke up in a Palestinian hospital with the doctors trying to reassure me , ” Omer told IPS .
The Dutch Foreign Ministry at the Hague told IPS that Foreign Minister Maxime Zerhagen spoke to the Israeli ambassador to The Netherlands and demanded an explanation .
The Dutch embassy in Tel Aviv has also raised the issue with the Israeli Foreign Ministry , which in turn has promised to investigate the incident and get back to the Dutch officials .
Ahmed Dadou , spokesman from the Dutch Foreign Ministry at the Hague told IPS , “ We are taking this whole incident very seriously as we do n’t believe the behavior of the Israeli officials is in accordance with a modern democracy .
“ We are further concerned about the mistreatment of an internationally renowned journalist trying to go about his daily business , ” added Dadou .
A spokeswoman at the Israeli Foreign Press Association said she was unaware of the incident .
Lisa Dvir from the Israeli Airport Authority ( IAA ) , the body responsible for controlling Israel ’s borders , told IPS that the IAA was neither aware of Omer ’s journalist credentials nor of his coordination .
“ We would like to know who Omer spoke to in regard to receiving coordination to pass through Allenby .
We offer journalists a special service when passing through our border crossings , and had we known about his arrival this would not have happened .
“ I ’m not aware of the events that followed his detention , and we are not responsible for the behavior of the Shin Bet . ”
In the meantime , Omer is still traumatized and in pain .
“ I ’m struggling to breathe and have pain in my head and stomach and will be going back to hospital for further medical examinations , ” he said .

「 解読不能は数学的に証明済み」、RSAを超える新暗号方式とは
すべての暗号はいずれ破られる。2000年前のシーザー暗号の時代から高度な暗号技術が一般化したデジタル通信の現代に至るまで、それが暗号通信の歴史が証明し続けた事実であると同時に、もっとも人口に膾炙したクリシェでもあった。例えば、鳴り物入りでリリースされたDVDのコンテンツ暗号技術「CSS 」（Content Scramble System）が、リリースからわずか数年で10代のノルウェー人ハッカーに破られたことは記憶に新しい。
【追記】（2008年4月15日）
この記事は取材に基づいて執筆したものですが、一部専門家らから「CAB方式暗号は解読不能」というのは誇大表現ではないかとの疑義が呈されています。アルゴリズムの公開や第三者による検証がない現在、この記事に登場するCAB方式が発案者・実装者の主張通り画期的な暗号方式で、本当に解読が不可能であるかどうか分かりません。現在、専門家の協力を呼びかけて東京理科大学の大矢雅則教授はじめ入山聖史博士に追加取材を依頼中です。記事中、不明瞭だった部分も含めて改めて続報を掲載させていただきます。
【追記】（2008年4月21日）
続報記事掲載は5月半ばを予定しております。
【追記】（2008年6月6日）
追加取材を5月29日に行いました。続報記事を予定していましたが、以下の理由で続報記事の掲載を延期させていただきます。
理由の1つは同席する予定だった暗号研究者が欠席したためです。その結果、当記事作成に当たった編集部の西村が単独で追加の取材を行う形となりました。追加取材の場では、再度、CAB暗号方式の概要および現在進めている安全性検証について話を聞きました。
また、ビジネス面での進捗や情報の公開準備についても確認しました。クリプト・ベーシック社が特許申請を今後3カ月程度をめどに行う予定で弁理士と検討を進めていること、それに引き続き早ければ年内から年明けにも、いずれかの学会で学会発表を行う予定もあることが判明しました。
このため、最短で3カ月、最長でも2年程度で、CAB暗号方式のアルゴリズムに関する情報がオープンとなることが分かりました（特許庁に出願した特許申請は、出願から1年半後に公開特許公報に掲載されて、パブリックになります）。実装のオープンソース化も視野に入れているとのことです。
以上のことから、肝心の発明部分が非公開の状態のままにさらなる追加取材を行うよりも、専門家が客観的判断を下せるだけの十分な情報が公開された段階で、追加取材および記事掲載を行うべきと判断いたしました。
今後もクリプト・ベーシック社の情報公開準備に関する進捗については、随時同社に問い合わせ、このページに追記していきます。
【追記】（2008年10月15日）
クリプト・ベーシック社に問い合わせたところ、現在数社と契約し、暗号アルゴリズムを組み込んだ製品のテストおよびデバッグを行っている最中との回答が得られました。製品完成時にパートナー企業と共同で特許取得を計画しており、来年初頭をめどに出願、アルゴリズム公開もその時期を考えているとのことでした。この予定通りに進めば、追加取材は2009年初頭に行います。
現在、ネット上の商取引や機密情報の扱いに広く使われている暗号方式の1つ、RSA暗号も原理的には解読が可能だ。RSA暗号は、大きな数の素因数分解の難しさに、その安全性の基礎を置いている。計算量が膨大になるため、事実上解読が困難だが、その困難さの度合いは利用する暗号鍵の長さに依存する。
鍵長を長くすれば解読は困難になる。しかし、鍵が長いと今度は鍵生成や暗号化、復号化の計算コストが大きくなる。このためRSA暗号は、計算コストと必要な暗号強度のバランスを取りながら運用し続けるという宿命を背負っている。暗号方式はRSAとは異なるが、DVDの暗号が破られたのも鍵長が40ビットと短かったことが1つの原因とされるが、それはDVDプレーヤーの限られた処理能力を考慮してのことでもあった。
偶然の出会いから生まれたアイデア
こうした暗号技術利用の常識を打ち破る、まったく新しい暗号方式が現れた。
「 われわれの開発した暗号方式は、数学的に解読が不可能であると証明されています」。
東京理科大学理工学部情報科学科教授 量子生命情報研究センター長 大矢雅則博 士 。1970 年、東京大学理学部物理学科を卒業。1976年、米ロチェスター大学大学院物理学専攻修了。計算科学フロンティア研究センター・センター長、情報教育・研究機構長、研究科長を歴任し、1987年から現職。数理物理と情報科学で米国と日本の博士号を取得。量子エントロピー、量子情報理論、情報遺伝学などを研究。
こう言い切るのは、ローマII大学のアカルディ教授とともに新暗号「 CAB方式」 （Crypto Alarm Basic：仮称）の基礎となる数学理論を考案した東京理科大学理工学部長 量子生命情報研究センター長の大矢雅則博士だ。従来の暗号のように「解読が困難」なのではなく「解読が不可能」だという。
「野球のピッチャーにたとえると、こういうことです。これまで行ってきた暗号アルゴリズム研究は時速140キロの記録を破って150キロ、155キロを目指すというものです。われわれの暗号方式は人間のピッチャーの代わりにピッチングマシーンを使って、いきなり時速200キロを出してしまったという感じです」。
東京理科大学情報科学科助教で東京理科大学量子生命情報研究センターの入山聖史博士はそう語る。従来の方式とはまったく異なる地平を開いたという暗号方式は偶然の出会いから生まれたという。
「 われわれはもともと数学研究者であって、暗号とかソフトウェアとは関係がないんです。ローマ大学のルイジ・アカルディ教授とある数学分野の共同研究をしてきたのですが、後にアカルディ教授からその数理を聞いたソフトの専門家であるマッシモ・レゴリー准教授が、これは暗号に使えるのではないかと言い出したんです。それが始まりです。暗号研究者たちが活発に議論している場所とは全然かけ離れた地点での研究が、偶然暗号に使えることが分かった。ですから、従来の暗号方式とは枠組みがまったく異なるのです」（大矢教授）
実験実装を行い、ベンチャーを起業
CAB方式の将来性に着目し、実験実装を行ったのが2006年。それから約2年間、学会発表やメディアへの公表、特許申請などは一切行わず、さまざまな用途に合わせたプロトコルの開発を進めてきたという。東京大学理学部を卒業後、米ロチェスター大学大学院へ進んだほか、ローマ大学、ハイデルベルグ大学など欧米の大学から招待を受けてきた大矢教授だが、その行動も欧米流だ。
「 学会で発表をして名誉だけを受けるという選択肢もありましたが、われわれはまず特許をとること、社会に出すことを考えました」（大矢教授）。
日本法人のクリプト・ベーシックは昨年の10月に起業。現在立ち上げの段階で、大矢教授、入山博士らは技術参与として携わっている。一方、2年前に設立したイタリアのクリプト・アラーム社は、銀行や通信キャリアとの共同開発、契約を進めており、あるヨーロッパの大手通信キャリアとは、すでに携帯電話端末のBluetooth通信でCAB方式暗号の実装を終えている。
現在、パフォーマンスの改善やアルゴリズム開発を日伊共同で研究しており、どういう形態でCAB方式暗号を世の中に出していくかを検討中だという。
ほかの公開鍵暗号方式 はCAB方式の特殊な場合
量子暗号など原理段階にとどまる基礎研究を除くと、現代の暗号研究は関数探しの競争となっている。
RSA 暗号は素数のかけ算と、その逆の素因数分解という1種の関数を利用した暗号方式だ。これは楕円曲線暗号やElGamalといった公開鍵暗号方式か、DESやAESといった共通鍵暗号方式かを問わず同じで、暗号化には何らかの関数を使う。
CAB方式では、その関数自体が無限個の中から利用者が自由に選べて、いつでも変えられるのだという。
「 例えば、xのm乗というのも1つの関数ですし、2xも関数です。実際には逆関数の計算が極めて難しい関数の集合を利用していますが、こうした関数からなる無限集合から鍵となる関数をピックアップします。盗聴者の探索しなければならない鍵空間は無限大ですから、鍵を推定できる確率はゼロです」（大矢教授）。
CAB 方式は、適当な初期値を取ることで任意の長さのランダムなバイナリ列を生成するアルゴリズムや、公開鍵分配アルゴリズムからなる。CAB方式で使われる公開鍵配分アルゴリズムは、Diffie-Hellmanやそれらの変形を包含する一般化とは異なる、はるかに複雑性の高いものだという。「ほかの公開鍵暗号方式は、表現方法や公開鍵の数を変えることでCAB方式に含まれることが数学的に証明されています。ほかの公開鍵暗号方式はCAB方式の特殊な場合なのです」（大矢教授）。
また鍵だけでなく、暗号に使う関数自体も毎回異なるため、攻撃者が任意のテキストを入力してそのアウトプットから関数やパラメータを推定する攻撃、いわゆるクリアテキストアタックもCAB方式暗号では無効だという。
解読困難と解読不能の違い
RSA 暗号では現在、一般的には1024〜2048ビットの鍵が用いられており、用途によっては十分な安全性がある。例えばRSAセキュリティ社自身が1991年から継続して行っていた暗号破りコンテストでは2005年に663ビットの鍵が破られているが、これには80台のOpteronサーバ（2.2GHz）を使い、3カ月を費やしたという。RSA暗号で最も広く使われている1024ビットの鍵（10進数で309桁の素数）については10万ドル（約1000万円）の賞金が掛けられていたが、誰も素因数分解に成功していない。
1000 万円では見合わないのだろう。しかし、数億円なら見合うかもしれない。2003年に2人の研究者が発表した理論上の専用解読器「TWIRL」を数億円かけて実際に製作すれば、1024ビットの鍵も解読できるかもしれない。このことから現在、RSA暗号では鍵は少なくとも2048ビット以上が望ましいとする暗号研究者がいる。
RSA セキュリティは2007年になって、この解読コンテストを終了させている。それは、解読コストが十分大きければ、必要な暗号強度は確保できるという社会的な認知が得られたからだという。
ただ、最終的に暗号技術の恩恵にあずかるべき消費者や一般市民にとって「事実上十分安全だ」という言い方しかできない現在の暗号技術では、心理的な不信感をぬぐうのは難しい。例えばSSLを使ったオンラインショッピングでクレジットカード番号の入力を躊躇するユーザーは、まだ多い。
1994年、アメリカ人研究者のピーター・ショアは量子コンピュータを使って素因数分解が比較的容易に解けることを理論的に示し、暗号研究者たちに衝撃を与えた。さらに2001年にはIBMの研究者らが「15＝5×3」という素朴な問題ではあるものの、量子コンピュータのプロトタイプを使って素因数分解を実演してみせたことで、RSA暗号は破られうると実証されている。
「 RSA 暗号では鍵長を長くして、例えばNASAのようなところでは解読に1億年かかるようなものを使っています。しかし、量子コンピュータというのは、例えば通常のコンピュータで2の100乗秒かかる計算を、100秒に短縮してしまうような技術ですから、1億年の1億倍のさらにその1万倍の時間が数十秒になるということです」（大矢教授）
もちろん量子コンピュータの実現は、まだ当面先の話だが、量子コンピュータを使っても解くことができないというCAB方式は、RSA暗号に取って代わる次世代の暗号方式なのだという。ムーアの法則に従ってコンピュータの計算能力が爆発的に上がっても、あるいは量子コンピュータが実現されても、それでも「解読不能」と言い切れるのがCAB方式の強みだ。
鍵生成や暗号化処理の軽さでストリーミングにも対応
暗号化の処理速度の速さもCAB方式のウリだという。
「例えば4MBほどある聖書のテキストを、その聖書に含まれるビット数と同じ長さの鍵を使って暗号化するのに、一般的なPCでも1秒もかかりません」（入山博士）
CAB 方式はブロック暗号だが、処理が高速であるためストリーミング映像への適用も可能だという。入山博士はデモンストレーションで一般的なノートPC2台を使って映像ストリーミングを実演。数MbpsのビットレートのMPEG映像を8ギガビットと非常に長い鍵を使って暗号化し、サーバ・クライアントで送受信してみせた。再生は滑らかで、CPU負荷も15％前後と映像コーデックの処理以上に高くない。
「デジタルコンテンツの保護強化や、企業のビジネス文書保護など、応用はいろいろと考えています。基本的にRSAで行っていることはすべてCABで代替できると思っています」（入山博士）
鍵生成も高速だ。RSA暗号における鍵生成は、大きな素数の組み合わせを見つける比較的重たい処理だ。鍵長が長くなればなるほど処理に時間がかかる。しかし、CAB方式では「10万ビットの鍵でも1秒未満で生成できます。携帯電話のように処理能力の低い端末にも向いています。例えば128ビットの鍵を生成するのに2MHzのプロセッサで60ミリ秒程度しかかかりません」（入山博士）。現在の実装はJavaによるもので、プログラムサイズは約60KBとコンパクト。非力なデジタルガジェットでも利用できるのがRSA暗号と比較したときのCAB方式の強みという。
長い鍵が簡単に生成できるため、任意のタイミングでユーザーは鍵を変えることができるのだという。
CAB 方式のデモンストレーション。ストリーミング映像に対して暗号をかけている。手前のノートPCから奥のノートPCにストリーミング。プロジェクタは受信側の画面。8ギガビットの鍵で数Mbpsの映像を楽に暗号化できるという
Windows上で実装したファイルの暗号化ツール。読み込みや書き込みの時間を除くと、約4MBのテキストファイルの暗号化がほぼ一瞬で完了する
プロセッサパワーが限られているような端末上でも処理の軽さが有効という。画面は2台の端末で相互認証をするアプリケーションの例
公開鍵暗号を超える暗号技術の革新となるか
CAB方式は、まだ実績がなく事実上未公表の技術だ。情報が公になっていくにつれて、専門家たちがどう反応するかは未知数だ。
また、その安全性についても、理論的裏付けがあるとはいえ今後は専門家による検証が欠かせない。ランダムな数列生成ではNIST（米国立標準技術研究所）で使われるテストで検証済みだが「今のところCAB方式を正当に評価できる方法や機関は存在しない」（大矢教授）のが現状だ。
専門家による検証やビジネスでの展開を考えると、どんなに早くても実利用がスタートするには、まだ数年かかるだろう。しかし、もし今後、「CAB方式は解読不能と証明済み」ということが第三者によって確かめられ、その実用性が認められれば、CAB方式は公開鍵暗号方式の発明に匹敵するインパクトをデジタル社会に与える可能性があるかもしれない。

There are two important financial headlines this evening and the futures are solidly red .
Let 's take a look at news regarding Wachovia and Bank of America starting with the former .
Wachovia Halts Wholesale Mortgages
Wachovia mortgage unit halting loans via brokers .
Wachovia Corp ( WB ) , the fourth - largest U.S. bank , on Monday said its main mortgage unit will stop offering home loans through brokers this week , joining a growing number of lenders to curb wholesale lending .
" We thought it was important to focus on customers who have relationships with the bank , and in geographies where Wachovia has branches , " spokesman Don Vecchiarello said .
" Based on that , we 've decided to discontinue doing business through our wholesale mortgage channel as of July 25 . "
Wachovia is assessing how many jobs will be affected by the decision , Vecchiarello said .
Bank of America Corp. , the biggest U.S. consumer bank and home lender , said second - quarter profit fell less than analysts estimated and predicted the purchase of Countrywide Financial Corp. will add to earnings this year .
The bank said Countrywide will add to profit this year , and that cost savings will be " significantly " more than the $ 670 million projected in January .
Bank of America Will Not Guarantee Countrywide Debt
Bank of America Corp. , the second - biggest U.S. bank , said it may not guarantee $ 38.1 billion of Countrywide Financial Corp .'s debt after taking over the mortgage lender , increasing the likelihood of a default .
" There is no assurance that any such debt would be redeemed , assumed or guaranteed , " the bank said in an April 30 regulatory filing , adding that no decision has been reached .
Investors had grown more optimistic the bank would back Countrywide debt .
Ratings firm Standard & Poor 's cut the mortgage - lender 's debt to junk today after saying it would raise the grade earlier this week .
The $ 4 billion purchase of Countrywide is scheduled to close in the third quarter .
Investors have speculated Bank of America may seek a lower price or cancel the deal because U.S. home prices and sales have deteriorated .
" This confirms how tenuous this transaction is , " said Christopher Whalen , managing director at Institutional Risk Analytics , a banking research firm in Torrance , California .

KALAMAZOO --
A handcuffed Kalamazoo teenager struggles with a Public Safety officer as he is led down a hallway toward a booking room when the officer shoves him into a wall , injuring his face , according to video of the incident released Tuesday .
The city of Kalamazoo released video of the May 22 incident after the Kalamazoo Gazette filed a Freedom of Information Act request .
Warning : Language contained in this video may be objectionable to some people .
The officer involved , Derek Nugent , has been placed on a 10 - day , unpaid suspension , Acting Public Safety Chief Jim Mallery announced Monday .
The teenager , who is African - American , lost three teeth .
In a complaint filed with the department , his family has alleged that Nugent , who is white , was harassing the youth because he is black .
The Gazette is not naming the teen because he is a minor and he has not been charged with a crime .
The video was taken from two security cameras inside Public Safety 's Crosstown Parkway headquarters .
The view from the hallway camera shows the teen enter the hallway accompanied by two Public Safety officers .
The video is shaky and much of the audio is unintelligible but it is clear the teen is yelling at the officers , one of whom repeatedly tells him to " face the wall . "
The teen shouts profanity and is eventually turned toward a wall as an officer appears to hold him by the back of his neck .
About two minutes into the video , Nugent begins walking the teen down the hallway toward a booking room when a tussle occurs and the teenager appears to jerk away from Nugent .
Nugent then shoves him into the cinder - block wall .
The youth immediately falls to the floor , begins crying and moaning , and asks Nugent why the officer had broken out his teeth .
The other officer , who has not been identified , stood at the other end of the hallway .
Nugent drags the youth , whose knees are on the floor , into the adjacent booking room where a second camera continues to record the incident .
The video from that camera shows the teen continuing to writhe in pain on the floor .
He repeatedly shouts , " You broke my teeth ! "
Another officer briefly peers into the booking room and then leaves .
After a few minutes , Nugent picks the teen up onto his feet and walks him back down the hallway as the youth remains doubled over at the waist .
Public Safety officials have said the teen was then transported to Bronson Methodist Hospital and later released to his legal guardian .
The teenager was originally arrested for allegedly violating rules at the Kalamazoo Transportation Center .
Since 2005 , 20 misdemeanor and felony charges have been brought against the teen , but he was not prosecuted for any of them because judges determined he was mentally incompetent to stand trial .
On Monday , Mallery said he believed Nugent did not intend to harm the teenager but said his actions " would not be condoned . "
Mallery publicly apologized to the teenager and his family .
Mallery said Nugent has been a Public Safety officer for nearly 10 year and this is his first excessive - force complaint .
The teen 's legal guardian , who is related to his father , said Tuesday she is unsatisfied by the suspension and wants Nugent criminally prosecuted .
Court records show the teen 's mother is in prison but do not make clear where his father is .
A Detroit - area attorney has said he may represent the family in a civil action .

And as the lies about this incident spread , there still has n't been a clear , compelling story offered to to the press about the Pentagon 's double - dealing and partisan sabogating by GOP - appointed flacks .
Pentagon officials , especially a GOP flack named Bryan Whitman , are behind the ongoing anti-Obama spin that his campaign declined the visit because he could n't bring his campaign staff or reporters with him .
Here 's how he works , as noted by Americablog .
Last February , Whitman sought to discredit Barack Obama 's true story about an American captain who told him about his under - manned platoon in Afghanistan that did n't have enough ammunition or Humvees -- and ended up relying on weapons they captured from the Taliban .
Fast forward to July of 2008 : Which Pentagon political hack is right smack in the middle of the latest manufactured controversy about Obama 's visit to the troops in Germany -- a political controversy being pushed by " The Pentagon " ?
That 's right .
Bryan Whitman .
Yes , apparently when the press talks about " The Pentagon " they mean Bryan Whitman -- and Whitman was quite happy to stir the pot on this one :
The Pentagon said on Friday that it did not prevent an Obama visit .
" Nobody denied Senator Obama the opportunity to visit our wounded being cared for at Landstuhl .
Obviously , as a sitting senator , he has an interest in that and can certainly visit in an official capacity , " said Bryan Whitman , a spokesman for the Pentagon , who added that there are " restrictions on what you can do as a candidate for political office , that stems from trying to maintain political neutrality and not have the military involved in politics . "
" The senator 's staff was informed of the limits on what the military can do with respect to a political campaign and how we could support a senator 's visit to Landstuhl and , quite frankly , I expected them to have the visit , " Whitman said .
Quite frankly , no one should believe anything Bryan Whitman says on behalf of " The Pentagon . "
He 's a GOP political operative who has done a lot of Bush , Cheney and Rummy 's dirty work from his press perch at the Pentagon for years .
The guy has no compunction about engaging in politics .
And , he 's the one pushing this latest fake controversy .
In February , Obama was right .
Whitman was wrong .
Same now .
The issue was muddied further while the Obama campaign waited at least a day to clarify that the scheduled visit was blocked by the Pentagon , and was still offering as late as Saturday a weak response that the candidate had , as Obama said , " a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political , " and , initially , that it would be " inappropriate " to spend campaign funds to make that hospital visit .
Such responses are politically lame and tin-eared .
The immediate response should have been a tough - minded assertion that they were blocked by the Pentagon , seemingly for partisan political reasons .
The Obama camp , after making clear that Obama wanted to visit , should have forcefully said the Senator 's planned meeting with wounded troops was blocked because of a last - minute invoking of rules by the Pentagon designed to thwart his visit , apparently for political reasons .
A London bank worker counts out euro bank notes as the first notes arrive in Britain 's high street banks , December 12 , 2001 .
REUTERS / Russell Boyce
BELGRADE ( Reuters ) - A Serbian bank clerk who stole nearly 1.5 million euros from his bank left a note reading “ I ’m sorry , ” buried the loot in a park and waited at a cafe for police to arrest him .
Aleksandar Spasic Saturday walked out of the Raiffeisen branch office in the central town of Kragujevac with the money stuffed in his briefcase , state news agency Tanjug reported .
“ I am sorry , but I had to do it , ” said the note he left for his boss .
Police found the money buried in six holes in a nearby park .
Spasic was arrested Saturday at a cafe after he called police and asked : “ How long do I have to wait for you ? ”
Police said Spasic was still being questioned Monday .
His motive was not immediately clear .
T Boone Pickens and Al Gore have proposed bold plans to radically reduce America 's addiction to fossil fuels .
These two gadflies just might provide enough bite to provoke the next president to swifter action .
Mr. Pickens argues that using wind power for electricity and powering vehicles with domestic natural gas can replace more than one - third of our foreign oil imports within 10 years .
If nothing is done , the conservative Texas oilman says , the US will send $ 10 trillion out of the country in the next decade , " the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind , " he says .
Building wind - powered generators in the heartland of America and new transmission lines would cost $ 1.2 trillion but it would make America the " Saudi Arabia " of wind power , he says .
Mr. Gore wants the US to commit to producing 100 percent of its electricity from renewable energy and other clean sources – also in 10 years .
His plan would cost $ 1.5 trillion to $ 3 trillion in public and private investment .
But the Democrat and former vice president argues that the money will be well spent in reducing the unknown future costs of oil .
His plan relies on a vast expansion of solar , wind , and geothermal power .
Nuclear generation stays at present levels .
" Clean coal " would be included if the industry brings carbon - capture technology on line .
Gore would tax fuels that emit carbon dioxide , which is much more likely to reduce carbon emissions than the much talked - about " cap and trade " system .
He would pair it with a deep tax cut to offset the effects on consumers .
" We should tax what we burn , not what we earn , " Gore says , calling this " the single most important policy change we can make . "
Both Pickens and Gore recognize that partisan politics must give way in the face of this pressing need , and both hope to enlist a wide array of Americans to help them hoist the issue to the top of the fall political campaign .
Gore 's plan quickly attracted fire from skeptics , who argue it is too aggressive and not possible in such a short time frame .
Yet the presidential candidates are not disputing Gore 's goal .
Republican hopeful John McCain has pledged to wean the US off foreign oil within 17 years .
And Democratic candidate Barack Obama would reduce US oil consumption by 35 percent by 2030 .
So the debate now is not whether there is a need to drastically reduce the burning of fossil fuels , which is given .
It 's about the speed and means of change , The questions are " Which way ? " and " How fast ? "
Those who hammer the Gore plan ought to recall Moore 's Law , in which computing power on a chip has doubled every two years .
Progress in solving a problem can move ahead exponentially .
Or what about Wikipedia , an invaluable destination for knowledge , with more than 2 million articles in its English version ?
It did n't exist just seven years ago .
Pickens and Gore express America 's can - do spirit .
Granted , they do n't have to pass legislation and face entrenched special interests that benefit from the status quo .
That extra burden must be recognized and carried by the next president .
Nothing less will do .
Leaders think beyond what looks possible now .
Poking holes in these plans can provide a vital vetting and a reality check .
But the foot - draggers must step to the rear .
THE Democratic nominee , Barack Obama , has surged to the lead in national polls and is now planning a campaign that will be a first for presidential politics : he will run operations in every state , even those considered safe Republican territory .
A Newsweek poll released on Friday shows Senator Obama with a substantial double - digit lead , 51 per cent to 36 per cent , over his Republican rival , John McCain .
A USA Today - Gallup poll echoed those results , showing Senator Obama with a lead of 50 per cent to 44 per cent .
The Obama campaign team announced over the weekend that it would open offices in every state and would run a massive voter registration drive in an effort to ensure groups that traditionally have low participation - such as African Americans and young people - vote in November .
There are already signs that Senator Obama may win states the Democrats have only dreamed of reclaiming .
Polls show him leading narrowly in Virginia and competitive in Georgia , thanks in part to the presence of a Libertarian candidate , Bob Barr , who is siphoning votes from Senator McCain .
And knowing the ages of Moon rocks , which can be computed to within 20 million years , has enabled scientists to establish a baseline that allows them to date geologic features throughout the solar system .
The surface of the Earth , one of the solar system ’s youngest topographies , is constantly changing , as it is faulted , folded , shaped and reshaped by eruptions , earthquakes and erosion .
By contrast , the Moon is as old as it gets .
“ It ’s hard to wrap your mind around a place where nothing ever happens , ” Mr. Allen said .
“ But the Moon is that place . ”
In recent years the rocks have also helped researchers to answer practical questions that have emerged since President Bush ’s 2004 proposal to return to the Moon by 2020 and set up a permanent outpost .
Planners are using the rocks to study the pernicious effects of regolith on machinery and astronaut health .
They are learning how to extract oxygen and other vital elements from lunar rocks and soil .
And they need to understand how to shield living spaces from the deadly radiation that eternally pounds the lunar surface .
The samples  2,200 of them  are kept in nitrogen - filled boxes in a stainless steel vault on the second floor of the 14,000 - square - foot repository , and are transferred to other parts of the lab in airlocks .
Technicians prepare shipments in glove boxes containing sterile tools and containers .
The samples are numbered and sorted by expedition .
All of the Apollo landings , beginning with Apollo 11 ’s historic mission in 1969 and ending with Apollo 17 in December 1972 , were at equatorial sites , but terrain differed each time and the samples reflect the differences .
The genesis rock was collected by Apollo 15 astronauts near Hadley Rille at the border between a lowland “ sea , ” or mare , and the lunar highlands .

The arrival of the first Moon rocks in 1969 was eagerly anticipated by scientists .
“ We had no idea what the Moon was made of , ” Mr. Allen recalled , and the first two decades of research focused on basic questions  the age and composition of the Moon rocks and the origin and evolution of the Moon ’s geology and salient topographical features .
The day the O.J. Simpson verdict was announced , I said to my then - teenage son , " David , please forgive me .
I am handing over to you a worse America than my father handed over to me . "
Unfortunately , I still feel this way .
With the important exception of racial discrimination -- which was already dying a natural death when I was young -- it is difficult to come up with an important area in which America is significantly better than when I was a boy .
But I can think of many in which its quality of life has deteriorated .
When I was a boy , America was a freer society than it is today .
If Americans had been told the extent and number of laws that would govern their speech and behavior within one generation , they would have been certain that they were being told about some dictatorship , not the Land of the Free .
Today , people at work , to cite but one example , are far less free to speak naturally .
Every word , gesture and look , even one 's illustrated calendar , is now monitored lest a fellow employee feel offended and bring charges of sexual harassment or creating a " hostile work environment " or being racially , religiously or ethnically insensitive , or insensitive to another 's sexual orientation .
Meanwhile , all employers in California are now prohibited by law from firing a man who has decided to cross - dress at work .
And needless to say , no fellow worker can say to that man , " Hey , Jack , why not wear the dress at home and men 's clothes to work ? "
An employer interviewing a prospective employee is not free to ask the most natural human questions :
Are you married ?
Do you have a child ?
How old are you ?
Soon " How are you ? " will be banned lest one discriminate on the basis of health .
When I was boy , what people did at home was not their employer 's business .
Today , companies and city governments refuse to hire , and may fire , workers no matter how competent or healthy , who smoke in their homes .
Sarasota , Fla. , the latest city to invade people 's private lives , would not hire Winston Churchill , Franklin Roosevelt or John F. Kennedy if they applied for a job .
When I was a 7 - year - old boy , I flew alone from New York to my aunt and uncle in Miami and did the same thing coming back to New York .
I boarded the plane on my own and got off the plane on my own .
No papers for my parents to fill out .
No extra fee to pay the airline .
I was responsible for myself .
Had I run away or been kidnapped , no one would have sued the airline .
Today , fear of lawsuits is a dominant fact of American life .
When I was a boy , I ran after girls during recess , played dodgeball , climbed monkey bars and sat on seesaws .
Today , more and more schools have no recess ; have canceled dodgeball lest someone feel bad about being removed from the game ; and call the police in to interrogate , even sometimes arrest , elementary school boys who playfully touch a girl .
And monkey bars and seesaws are largely gone , for fear of lawsuits should a child be injured .
When I was boy , I was surrounded by adult men .
Today , most American boys ( and girls , of course ) come into contact with no adult man all day every school day .
Their teachers and school principals are all likely to be women .
And if , as is often the case , there is no father at home ( not solely because of divorce but because " family " courts have allowed many divorced mothers to remove fathers from their children 's lives ) , boys almost never come into contact with the most important group of people in a boy 's life -- adult men .
The contemporary absence of men in boys ' lives is not only unprecedented in American history ; it is probably unprecedented in recorded history .
When I was a boy , we had in our lives adults who took pride in being adults .
To distinguish them from our peers , we called these adults " Mr. , " " Mrs . " and " Miss , " or by their titles , " Doctor , " " Pastor , " " Rabbi , " " Father . "
It was good for us , and we liked it .
Having adults proud of their adulthood , and not acting like they were still kids , gave us security ( as well as something to look forward to in growing up ) .
Today , kids are surrounded by peers twice , three , four times their age .
When I was a boy , the purpose of American history textbooks was to teach American history .
Today , the purpose of most American history texts is to make minorities and females feel good about themselves .
As a result , American kids today are deprived of the opportunity to feel good about being American ( not to mention deprived of historical truth ) .
They are encouraged to feel pride about all identities -- African - American , Hispanic , Asian , female , gay -- other than American .
When I was a teenage boy , getting to kiss a girl , let alone to touch her thigh or her breast ( even over her clothes ) was the thrill of a lifetime .
Most of us could only dream of a day later on in life when oral sex would take place ( a term most of us had never heard of ) .
But of course , we were not raised by educators or parents who believed that " teenagers will have sex no matter what . "
Most of us rarely if ever saw a naked female in photos ( the " dirty pictures " we got a chance to look at never showed " everything " ) , let alone in movies or in real life .
We were , in short , allowed to be relatively innocent .
And even without sex education and condom placement classes , few of us ever got a girl pregnant .
When I was a boy , " I Love Lucy " showed two separate beds in Lucy and Ricky 's bedroom -- and they were a married couple .
Today , MTV and most TV saturate viewers ' lives with sexual imagery and sexual talk , virtually all of which is loveless and , of course , non-marital .
When I was boy , people dressed up to go to baseball games , visit the doctor and travel on airplanes .
Today , people do n't dress up even for church .
When I was a boy , Time and Newsweek were well written and relied little on pictures and illustrations .
Today , those magazines often look like adult comic books by comparison .
They are filled with large illustrations and photos , and they dumb down the news with features like " Winners and Losers " and " Who 's Up and Who 's Down . "
And when I was a boy , it would have been inconceivable for Time to substitute anything , let alone a tree , for the flag planted by the marines on Iwo Jima .
One might argue that these are the same laments that every previous older generation has expressed -- " Ah , when I was young " But in America , that has not been the case .
In America , the older generations tended to say the opposite -- " When I was a kid , things were worse . "
Can we return to the America of my youth ?
No .
Can we return to the best values of that time ?
Yes .
But not if both houses of Congress , the presidency and the Supreme Court move the country even further leftward .
If that happens , many of the above noted changes will simply be accelerated : More laws restricting " offensive " speech will be enacted ; litigation will increase and trial lawyers will gain more power ; the American military will be less valued ; trees will gradually replace the flag as our most venerated symbol ; schools will teach even less as they concentrate even more on diversity , sexuality and the environment ; teenage sex will be increasingly accepted ; American identity will continue to be replaced by ethnic , racial , gender or " world citizen " identity ; and the power of the state will expand further as the power of the individual inevitably contracts .
It 's hard to believe most Americans really want that .
When you think of locations for penguins , Antarctica is probably your first guess .
If you know a bit more about penguins , you might point to Patagonia or even down my way , where the Fairy Penguins live at Phillip Island .
However I would very much hope that you would n’t predict that they could be making their way as far north as Bahia , one of the 26 states of Brazil .
According to Brazilian wildlife authorities on Wednesday , penguins have been “ washing up ” in far greater numbers this year in areas like Rio de Janeiro , where they are common , but not normally in these numbers .
“ This is unheard of .
There have even been reports of penguins washing up as far as Aracaju , ” said Adelson Cerqueira Silva of the federal environmental agency .
The capital of Bahia is Salvador , which resides just over 2,000 kilometers from the equator .
No one is really 100 % certain why the penguins are making it this far , but most experts believe that overfishing has extended the distance that penguins must swim to find food .
However not all of them are arriving under their own power , as the oft - used term “ washing up ” would signify .
Many arrive dead , and many more injured .
“ We ’re telling people if the penguins do n’t appear to be injured or sick to leave them alone so they can swim back , ” Silva said in telephone interview from the Bahia state capital of Salvador .
But a swamped triage center has been caring for the injured birds that are brought in .
This is not the first time that penguins have washed up this far from home .
We are however seeing the greatest quantity wash up than ever before .
P. Dee Boersma , a conservation biologist at the University of Washington who works with penguins in Argentina , noted that “ The last time that you got a lot of penguins was in 2000 , mostly in Rio but some further north .
That year the sea surface temperature was a degree lower than the 30 year average so the penguins just keep swimming in search of food without noticing where they ’re going . ”
So note this down as example # 1478 why humans were a bad idea for planet Earth .

Obama Does n’t Sweat .
He should .
by Greg Palast
In swing - state Colorado , the Republican Secretary of State conducted the biggest purge of voters in history , dumping a fifth of all registrations .
Guess their color .
In swing - state Florida , the state is refusing to accept about 85,000 new registrations from voter drives – overwhelming Black voters .
In swing state New Mexico , HALF of the Democrats of Mora , a dirt poor and overwhelmingly Hispanic county , found their registrations disappeared this year , courtesy of a Republican voting contractor .
In swing states Ohio and Nevada , new federal law is knocking out tens of thousands of voters who lost their homes to foreclosure .
My investigations partner spoke directly to Barack Obama about it .
( When your partner is Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , candidates take your phone call . )
The cool , cool Senator Obama told Kennedy he was “ concerned ”  about the integrity of the vote in the Southwest in particular .
He ’s concerned .
I ’m sweating .
It ’s time SOMEBODY raised the alarm about these missing voters ; not to save Obama ’s candidacy “ “ journalists should stay the heck away from partisan endorsements – but raise the alarm to save our sick democracy .
And that somebody is YOU .
Joining with US , the Palast investigative team .
Here ’s how :
We have been offered an astonishing opportunity to place the Kennedy - Palast investigative findings on a national , prime - time , major - network television broadcast .
Plus , separately , we have an extraordinary offer to create a series of reports for national network radio .
But guess what ?
The networks will NOT PAY for our public service reports .
We have to raise the start - up funds in the next two weeks to film it , record it and get it on the airwaves .
WE need YOU to fund the reports , DISSEMINATE the findings as we post the print , audio and video on the web ” “ and ACT on it .
So , for only the second time this year , I am asking each one of you to make a tax deductible donation to the non-profit , non-partisan Palast Investigative Fund of $ 500 , $ 150 or $ 100 .
Progressives have complained for years of no opportunity to get the hard , cold sweaty truth on the air .
Well , put your money where your heart and soul is .
Donate at least $ 500 , I ’ll send you every book I ’ve written and every film , signed .
Send $ 150 and I ’ll send you as a gift , a copy of John Ennis ’ film Free For All , the brilliant and funny film about the Theft of Ohio .
AND I ’ll send you , signed , a copy of my book , Armed Madhouse , plus a copy of the BBC / Democracy Now film investigations , The Election Files and a copy of the spoken word CD Live from the Armed Madhouse all signed .
Donate $ 100 , and I ’ll send you 3 copies , one signed to you , of “ The Elections Files , ” the best of our BBC / Democracy Now films “ “ including special never - broadcast interviews with Kennedy and fired prosecutor David Iglesias .
I know you ’re ponying up for your favorite candidates .
But what ’s the point of winning folks ’ votes IF NO ONE COUNTS THEM ?
Please make your donation “ “ today .
No corporation , no big foundation , is going to take on this emergency in our democracy .
The election ’s about to be stolen “ “ for a third time .
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT ?
Donate today ( for $ 1,000 minimum , we ’ll list you as a Producer of our next DVD , in gratitude ) .
Why ?
Because the only way to get the vote - chewing cockroaches out of the voting machinery is to turn on the lights “ “ tell the truth on them .
On prime time .
After our team busted the story of Katherine Harris ’ attack on innocent Black voters as “ felons , ”  the NAACP sued and won back their rights .
The truth CAN make the difference .
Yes , we can .
Indeed , we HAVE .
Think all votes should be counted in America ?
Then YOU stand up and be counted .
Do n’t expect networks or commercial sponsors to pay for your democracy .
Feed the truth , donate $ 100 right now and pass on a copy of the Elections Files to your dippy cousin who thinks Kerry lost fair and square .
Donations from our prior and only request already paid for some of our filming in the Southwest .

“ At first we were worried about MySpace , but then we realized that people use it differently from our site , ” an employee at social network Facebook told me over a year ago .
What he meant is that Facebook is a place for people to put their real lives online , providing factual information about themselves and having trusted interactions with their friends .
Meanwhile , rival MySpace is more of a place for people to live out their fantasy lives online , borrowing celebrity photos for their profile pictures , adding far - fetched biographical information and such — MySpace uses the term “ self - expression ” to describe this behavior .
These cultural differences are , of course , not true across the board but are generally obvious to anyone who uses both social networks .
And they ’re a huge deal , even though most coverage I ’ve seen does n’t acknowledge it .
Facebook ’s global user numbers have boomed from around 40 million monthly unique visitors in April , 2007 to 115 million unique monthly users this past April , with 62 million new users coming from outside the US .
Compare that to MySpace , which counts 73 million of its global users in the US and is now globally a close second to Facebook , having hardly grown anywhere over the past year .
In fact , another traffic measurement firm , Nielsen Online , says that MySpace had 4.7 million U.S. visitors in April , down 30 percent from last year .
[ Note :
This is a bizarrely low number , although the BBC and WebProNews are citing it — I ’m looking for confirmation from Nielsen .
I ’m sticking with comScore numbers for now . ]
Taking a deeper dive into Facebook ’s growth in regions around the world , it ’s important to note that in many places MySpace has never been dominant .
For example , another social network , hi5 — which has an interface more similar to MySpace ’s , has been the market leader in Spanish - speaking Latin American countries for years .
And while hi5 is still growing fast , Facebook has been busy catching up to it in a matter of months , especially after Facebook released a Spanish - language version of its site in March .
How Facebook is keeping it real
Facebook ’s growth is global in more ways than one .
While it continues to have a relatively white collar , college - based user population in the U.S. , it has seen uptake across all demographics in other countries .
For example , when the site took off in Canada in the winter of 2007 , two - thirds of the entire city of Toronto quickly joined , not just the rich kids .
Facebook employees tell me they ’ve seen the same pattern in every country outside of the U.S .
Facebook started as a college campus hit in the U.S. , with students using the service to share information like which dorm they lived in , what movies they liked , and who they hooked up with .
If they provided fake information , their friends from across the hall would simply leave comments saying so on their profile pages .
Facebook built this real - world community aspect into its site through local and regional networks that you join when you sign up — an idea it has gradually expanded on as it opens up to more and more people in the U.S. and around the world .
Now , put yourself in the mind of the average user in another country .
You ’re joining because you want to hang out with friends around you , or maybe friends who have immigrated to other countries , or maybe you want to meet new people in other countries because you ’re human and you ’re curious about people in general .
Let ’s say a friend who lives near you invites you to join .
You see your friend ’s real information , you mimic that by providing your own .
You start using the site and you see that basically most other users have also added their real information , confirming that you should continue to provide real information on the site .
Facebook also asks you to join a local network — which most new users seem to do — and you immediately get access to a bunch of other people a lot like you .
Now , let ’s say you start looking around the site .
You go to the profile page of a worldwide icon like English soccer club Manchester United , and see real users from around the world leaving comments .
Or say you ’re using a flirting application and start flirting with real people , also from around the world .
In either case , you friend these people because you find you have something in common with them , and would like to see their full profiles ( on Facebook , you normally have to either friend people or be in their network to see their full profiles ) .
They friend you back , and pretty soon you , the new user , has a large Facebook friend list that gives you a direct view into who people really are , everywhere .
Facebook users in many Middle Eastern countries and Facebook users in the US have been busy making friends and overcoming larger political and religious differences , as Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has noted — and as I have personally seen .
Meanwhile , join MySpace , and you ’ll encounter bewildering user profile pages dedicated to sub-segments of American pop culture that you do n’t understand or care about , that wo n’t help you easily find old friends and new ones .
Even though it lets you state things like what school you ’re in and where you live within your user profile , the site did n’t grow based on these definitions , and beyond American high school users on the site , local networks are weak - to - nonexistent .
Blogger Andrew Chen noted the culture issue in an April post looking at Facebook ’s worldwide growth rate , although he attributed the difference more generally to Facebook ’s relatively simple , “ utilitarian ” interface and not to the distinct user behavior that the interface and site evolution have together bred .
So , in this context , Facebook ’s growth and MySpace ’s lack thereof may help explain why MySpace is launching a new , cleaner interface , which you can read about here .
However , the changes , which include simpler site navigation options at the top of the site , better search , and more options for profile editing , do n’t appear to impact how users perceive the site .
MySpace will likely continue to be a leading social networking destination , especially for people looking mainly for self - expression .
It , and other social networks , have already ceded the real world to Facebook , though , and I do n’t see them doing anything to change that .
Okay , so what are all these users worth
Social network advertising — which is generally comprised of ineffectively targeted banner ads — is n’t making that much money , and so far , neither have virtual gifts and various other monetization ideas .
MySpace has had more trouble making money than it had hoped , as it made slightly less than the billion it was aiming for this past year .
However , it ’s shown promising progress in targeting ads to users based on user ’s own profile data ( example :
If you ’re a MySpace user who likes shoes , you ’re more likely to see ads for shoes ) .
Facebook , which is valued at $ 15 billion , expects to make up to $ 350 million this year , but that ’s at least offset by costs incurred through its growth .
It has been looking at fleshing out everything from targeted ads to video ads .
But the fact that monetization methods for social networks have n’t fully evolved yet is no reason to view this segment pessimistically .
Web market analysis firm eMarketer released a report last month in which it revised long - term revenue projections for social network advertising downwards from its earlier report .
But the report is based on what the firm ’s analysts read in the press and what they hear from companies .
A large chunk of the projections dip is likely based on the one - off report about MySpace not meeting its own high expectations
With the vast majority of social network revenues coming from US users ( it ’s currently the most lucrative advertising market in the world ) , it goes without saying that social network companies are dependent on growing out their US user bases quickly .
And MySpace might be right to focus so heavily on the U.S. market for now .
On the other hand , entrepreneurship involves taking risks to be early to new markets and nail them before your competitors .
There are plenty of economies currently growing much faster than the U.S. ’s , and as social networks catch on in those countries , social network advertising will grow .
So , gaining a global user base now is actually a land - grab among social networks , especially for the largest social networks , all of which have substantial funding to back them up as they continue to grow .
If you were a social network , would you want tens of millions of international users now , even if you figure you probably wo n’t make money on them for years ?
I would .

Oil prices could hit $ 300 a barrel if the T. Boone Pickens said Monday .
To prevent economic bankruptcy as a result of sending $ 700 billion a year overseas to unstable oil producers in the The Washington Times .
“ We are getting in trouble fast ” and the economy is “ already in the tank ” because the nation is importing 70 percent of the fuel it needs each day , he said .
“ The price of oil will be $ 300 a barrel if you sit here and let it go ” for another 10 years , said Mr. Pickens , chairman and chief executive officer of New York Mercantile Exchange .
“ We need a leader who understands the problem , ” said Mr. Pickens , who said that only one campaign aide for Republican presidential candidate Sen .
John McCain has called him to discuss the matter - for about four minutes .
“ We ’ve got to get General Patton .
George Patton is who you need .
Give him the tools and tell him to take the hill . ”
Mr. Pickens , who at 80 has amassed a fortune worth $ 4 billion producing and speculating in oil , said he has stopped giving to political campaigns and renounced his previous Republican affiliation in his drive to focus the nation ’s attention on the need for immediate , drastic action on energy .
In appearances on Capitol Hill and newsrooms as well as in advertising across the country , Mr. Pickens is pushing a plan to displace about 38 percent of oil imports by switching to a fleet of buses and trucks that run on natural gas .
But to accomplish that , the nation would have to stop using natural gas to produce electricity .
He proposes to replace the 22 percent of electricity fueled by gas with a new network of wind and solar power emanating from Great Plains and Western states where wind and sun are abundant .
Mr. Pickens said rural Plains state residents are enthusiastic about the wind projects he has started there , and would not resist building extensive wind farms and energy - transmission facilities there .
“ I ’m hoping we ’re going to elevate this issue in the presidential campaign , ” Mr. Pickens said , styling himself after H. Ross Perot , the Texas billionaire who put budget deficits on the radar in the 1992 presidential campaign .
“ We have our back against the wall now , ” and the nation is in a position where hostile nations can hurt us simply by attacking one of our principal oil suppliers , he said .
“ It ’ll be like war , ” Mr. Pickens said .
“ The American people will come together .
We ’ll pull in together and march in lockstep . ”
Mr. Pickens said the cost of carrying out a plan like his would be about $ 1 trillion - as much as the United States will soon spend importing oil each year without taking any action to prevent it .
All of the technologies in the plan are proven and can be adopted quickly , he said .
Mr. Pickens , who was a major contributor to President Bush in 2000 , gave Mr. Bush credit for trying to galvanize the country behind big changes in energy policy , including drilling in the Alaskan wilderness and offshore , although he faulted him for not pushing natural gas as an alternative fuel for transportation .
Mr. Pickens ’ plan draws from a recent Energy Department proposal that estimated the nation could generate 20 percent of its electricity with wind power .
“ Bush has tried , no question he ’s tried on energy , and they lock up ” in partisan bickering over the Bush ideas in Congress , he said .
“ Partisan politics , it drives me up the wall .
I ’m so fed up with this stuff . ”
In his new ecumenical role , Mr. Pickens said he was open to teaming up with former Vice President Al Gore , who is advocating a similar , dramatic switch to wind and other renewable energies as well as electric cars in his campaign to curb global warming .
“ I told Al , ‘ Look , I believe in global warming , ’” but Mr. Pickens said he sees climate change as a secondary problem to be addressed only after the country secures greater energy independence .
The nation should do “ everything ” in its power - from expanding drilling to ratcheting up conservation and fuel efficiency - to achieve that goal , he added .
And while he agrees with Mr. Gore ’s goal of replacing gasoline - driven cars with electric or hydrogen - powered vehicles in the future , he does not think the technology is advanced enough for that to occur right away .
Mr. Pickens ’ plan envisions using natural gas as a “ bridge ” fuel until better technologies emerge .
By a stroke of “ divine intervention , ” he said , the U.S. was able to double its once - scarce gas supplies using unconventional extraction methods from shale , so gas can now be used to help break dependence on foreign oil .
“ I do n’t have any problem with anything Al says except timing .
You ’ve got to have a bridge .
But that ’s a minor point . ”

The dark - haired 22 - year - old in black T - shirt , blue jeans and red Crocs is understandably hesitant as he sits at a picnic table in the incongruous setting of a beauty spot somewhere in Israel .
We know his name and if we used it he would face a criminal investigation and a probable prison sentence .
The birds are singing as he describes in detail some of what he did and saw others do as an enlisted soldier in Hebron .
And they are certainly criminal : the incidents in which Palestinian vehicles are stopped for no good reason , the windows smashed and the occupants beaten up for talking back – for saying , for example , they are on the way to hospital ; the theft of tobacco from a Palestinian shopkeeper who is then beaten " to a pulp " when he complains ; the throwing of stun grenades through the windows of mosques as people prayed .
And worse .
The young man left the army only at the end of last year , and his decision to speak is part of a concerted effort to expose the moral price paid by young Israeli conscripts in what is probably the most problematic posting there is in the occupied territories .
Not least because Hebron is the only Palestinian city whose centre is directly controlled by the military , 24/7 , to protect the notably hardline Jewish settlers there .
He says firmly that he now regrets what repeatedly took place during his tour of duty .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But his frequent , if nervous , grins and giggles occasionally show just a hint of the bravado he might have displayed if boasting of his exploits to his mates in a bar .
Repeatedly he turns to the older former soldier who has persuaded him to speak to us , and says as if seeking reassurance : " You know how it is in Hebron . "
The older ex-soldier is Yehuda Shaul , who does indeed " know how it is in Hebron " , having served in the city in a combat unit at the peak of the intifada , and is a founder of Shovrim Shtika , or Breaking the Silence , which will publish tomorrow the disturbing testimonies of 39 Israelis – including this young man – who served in the army in Hebron between 2005 and 2007 .
They cover a range of experiences , from anger and powerlessness in the face of often violent abuse of Arabs by hardline Jewish settlers , through petty harassment by soldiers , to soldiers beating up Palestinian residents without provocation , looting homes and shops , and opening fire on unarmed demonstrators .
The maltreatment of civilians under occupation is common to many armies in the world – including Britain's , from Northern Ireland to Iraq .
But , paradoxically , few if any countries apart from Israel have an NGO like Breaking the Silence , which seeks – through the experiences of the soldiers themselves – as its website puts it " to force Israeli society to address the reality which it created " in the occupied territories .
The Israeli public was given an unflattering glimpse of military life in Hebron this year when a young lieutenant in the Kfir Brigade called Yaakov Gigi was given a 15 - month jail sentence for taking five soldiers with him to hijack a Palestinian taxi , conduct what the Israeli media called a " rampage " in which one of the soldiers shot and wounded a Palestinian civilian who just happened to be in the wrong place , and then tried to lie his way out of it .
In a confessional interview with the Israeli Channel Two investigative programme Uvda , Gigi , who had previously been in many ways a model soldier , talked of " losing the human condition " in Hebron .
Asked what he meant , he replied : " To lose the human condition is to become an animal . "
The Israeli military did not prosecute the soldier who had fired on the Palestinian , as opposed to Gigi .
But the military insists " that the events that occurred within the Kfir Brigade are highly unusual " .

But as the 22 - year - old soldier , also in the Kfir Brigade , confirms in his testimony to Breaking the Silence , it seems that the event may not have been exceptional .
Certainly , our interview tells us , he was " many times " in groups that commandeered taxis , seated the driver in the back , and told him to direct them to places " where they hate the Jews " in order to " make a balagan " – Hebrew for " big mess " .
Then there is the inter- clan Palestinian fight : " We were told to go over there and find out what was happening .
Our [ platoon ] commander was a bit screwed in the head .
So anyway , we would locate houses , and he'd tell us : ' OK , anyone you see armed with stones or whatever , I do n't care what – shoot . '
Everyone would think it 's the clan fight ... "
Did the company commander know ?
" No one knew .
Platoon 's private initiative , these actions . "
Did you hit them ?
" Sure , not just them .
Anyone who came close ...
Particularly legs and arms .
Some people also sustained abdominal hits ... I think at some point they realised it was soldiers , but they were not sure .
Because they could not believe soldiers would do this , you know . "
Or using a 10 - year - old child to locate and punish a 15 - year - old stone - thrower : " So we got hold of just some Palestinian kid nearby , we knew that he knew who it had been .
Let 's say we beat him a little , to put it mildly , until he told us .
You know , the way it goes when your mind 's already screwed up , and you have no more patience for Hebron and Arabs and Jews there .
" The kid was really scared , realising we were on to him .
We had a commander with us who was a bit of a fanatic .
We gave the boy over to this commander , and he really beat the shit out of him ...
He showed him all kinds of holes in the ground along the way , asking him : ' Is it here you want to die ?
Or here ? '
The kid goes , ' No , no ! '
" Anyway , the kid was stood up , and could n't stay standing on his own two feet .
He was already crying ...
And the commander continues , ' Do n't pretend ' and kicks him some more .
And then [ name withheld ] , who always had a hard time with such things , went in , caught the squad commander and said , ' Do n't touch him any more , that 's it . '
The commander goes , ' You 've become a leftie , what ? '
And he answers , ' No , I just do n't want to see such things . '
" We were right next to this , but did nothing .
We were indifferent , you know .
OK .
Only after the fact you start thinking .
Not right away .
We were doing such things every day ...
It had become a habit ...
" And the parents saw it .
The commander ordered [ the mother ] , ' Do n't get any closer . '
He cocked his weapon , already had a bullet inside .
She was frightened .
He put his weapon literally inside the kid's mouth .
' Anyone gets close , I kill him .
Do n't bug me .
I kill .
I have no mercy . '
So the father ... got hold of the mother and said , ' Calm down , let them be , so they 'll leave him alone . ' "
Not every soldier serving in Hebron becomes an " animal " .
Iftach Arbel , 23 , from an upper - middle class , left - of - centre home in Herzylia , served in Hebron as a commander just before the withdrawal from Gaza , when he thinks the army wanted to show it could be tough with settlers , too .
And many of the testimonies , including Mr Arbel 's , describe how the settlers educate children as young as four to throw stones at Palestinians , attack their homes and even steal their possessions .
To Mr Arbel , the Hebron settlers are " pure evil " and the only solution is " to remove the settlers " .
He believes it would be possible even within these constraints to treat Palestinians better .
He adds : " We did night activity .
Choose a house at random , on the aerial photo , so as to practise combat routine and all , which is instructive for the soldiers , I mean , I 'm all for it .
But then at midnight you wake someone up and turn his whole house upside down with everyone sleeping on the mattresses and all . "
But Mr Arbel says that most soldiers are some way between his own extreme and that of the most violent .
From just two of his fellow testifiers , you can see what he means .
As one said : " We did all kinds of experiments to see who could do the best split in Abu Snena .
We would put [ Palestinians ] against the wall , make like we were checking them , and ask them to spread their legs .
Spread , spread , spread , it was a game to see who could do it best .
Or we would check who can hold his breath for longest .
" Choke them .
One guy would come , make like he was checking them , and suddenly start yelling like they said something and choke them ...
Block their airways ; you have to press the adams apple .
It 's not pleasant .
Look at the watch as you 're doing it , until he passes out .
The one who takes longest to faint wins . "
And theft as well as violence .
" There 's this car accessory shop there .
Every time , soldiers would take a tape - disc player , other stuff .
This guy , if you go ask him , will tell you plenty of things that soldiers did to him .
" A whole scroll - full ...
They would raid his shop regularly .
' Listen , if you tell on us , we 'll confiscate your whole store , we 'll break everything . '
You know , he was afraid to tell .
He was already making deals , ' Listen guys , you 're damaging me financially . '
I personally never took a thing , but I 'm telling you , people used to take speakers from him , whole sound systems .
" He 'd go , ' Please , give me 500 shekels , I 'm losing money here . '
' Listen , if you go on – we 'll pick up your whole shop . '
' OK , OK , take it , but listen , do n't take more than 10 systems a month . '
Something like this .
" 'I 'm already going bankrupt . '
He was so miserable .
Guys in our unit used to sell these things back home , make deals with people .
People are so stupid . "
The military said that Israeli Defence Forces soldiers operate according to " a strict set of moral guidelines " and that their expected adherence to them only " increases wherever and whenever IDF soldiers come in contact with civilians " .
It added that " if evidence supporting the allegations is uncovered , steps are taken to hold those involved to the level of highest judicial severity " .
It also said : " The Military Advocate General has issued a number of indictments against soldiers due to allegations of criminal behaviour ...
Soldiers found guilty were punished severely by the Military Court , in proportion to the committed offence . "
It had not by last night quantified such indictments .
In its introduction to the testimonies , Breaking the Silence says : " The soldiers ' determination to fulfil their mission yields tragic results : the proper - normative becomes despicable , the inconceivable becomes routine ... [ The ] testimonies are to illustrate the manner in which they are swept into the brutal reality reigning on the ground , a reality whereby the lives of many thousands of Palestinian families are at the questionable mercy of youths .
Hebron turns a focused , flagrant lens at the reality to which Israel 's young representatives are constantly sent . "
A force for justice
Breaking the Silence was formed four years ago by a group of ex-soldiers , most of whom had served in Israel Defence Forces combat units in Hebron .
Many of the soldiers do reserve duty in the military each year .
It has collected some 500 testimonies from former soldiers who served in the West Bank and Gaza .
Its first public exposure was with an exhibition of photographs by soldiers serving in Hebron and the organisation also runs regular tours of Hebron for Israeli students and diplomats .
It receives funding from groups as diverse as the Jewish philanthropic Moriah Fund , the New Israel Fund , the British embassy in Tel Aviv and the EU .
June 30 , 2008  -- WASHINGTON ( AP ) - President Bush on Monday signed legislation to pay for the war operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the rest of his presidency and beyond , hailing the $ 162 billion plan as a rare product of bipartisan cooperation .
" This bill shows the American people that even in an election year , Republicans and Democrats can come together to support our troops and their families , " Bush said in an Oval Office ceremony .
Bush made clear to thank members of both parties in Congress , singling out some sponsors of the long - delayed , compromise measure for praise .
His positive comments contrasted with the confrontational tone that has dominated the debate between Congress and his administration over Iraq .
The legislation will bring to more than $ 650 billion the amount Congress has provided for the Iraq war since it began more than five years ago .
For operations in Afghanistan , the total is nearly $ 200 billion , according to congressional officials .
" Our nation has no greater responsibility than to support our men in women in uniform - especially because we 're at war , " Bush said .
The package approved by Congress includes a doubling of GI Bill college benefits for troops and veterans .
It also provides a 13 - week extension of unemployment benefits , $ 2.7 billion in emergency flood relief for the Midwest , and tens of billions of dollars for food aid , anti-drug enforcement , Louisiana levee repairs and many other items .
The bill will fund the wars well into next year , when their fate will be in the hands of Bush 's successor .
It also gives the next president several months to set Iraq policy after taking office in January - and spares lawmakers the need to cast more war funding votes closer to Election Day .
The Democratic majority in Congress has tried , unsuccessfully , to force troop withdrawals and other limits on Bush 's ability to conduct the war .
Bush said the bill will allow troops to prevail in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" I appreciate that Republicans and Democrats in Congress agreed to provide these vital funds without tying the hands of our commanders and without an artificial timetable of withdrawal from Iraq , " Bush said , flanked by some of his top officials , including Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
Many war opponents in Congress , in fact , have expressed frustration and a sense of resignation at having to yield to the lame duck president .
No lawmakers attended the ceremony , White House press secretary Dana Perino said , because " they 're all out of town . "
Congress is in recess .
The new GI Bill essentially would guarantee a full scholarship at any in - state public university , along with a monthly housing stipend , for people who serve in the military for at least three years .
It is aimed at replicating the benefits awarded veterans of World War II and more than doubles the value of the benefit - from $ 40,000 today to $ 90,000 .
The GI Bill measure , authored by Sen. Jim Webb , D - Va. , had such extraordinary support from both Democrats and Republicans that White House objections were easily overridden .
The bill also allows veterans to transfer their benefits to their spouse or a child , an idea Bush has championed .
The White House tried much harder to kill the effort to extend unemployment benefits as part of the war funding bill .
But Bush 's administrational ultimately supported the compromise version , which requires people to have worked for 20 weeks in order to be eligible for the extended payments .

LONDON — Every day , it seems , there are more victims .
Shakilus Townsend , 16 , stabbed to death by a masked gang .
Ben Kinsella , also 16 , fatally stabbed during an argument outside a pub .
Victims in Bristol , Manchester and Glasgow .
Four people fatally stabbed in London in one 24 - hour period alone last week .
In a country where few people have guns or access to them , a spate of knife attacks , many involving teenagers , has forced the issue to the top of the domestic agenda .
The Metropolitan Police are so concerned , they said recently , they have made knife crime their top priority , along with terrorism .
Government and law enforcement officials are scrambling to produce plans to allay public fears .
On Monday , Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced a series of measures that he said would make it “ completely unacceptable to carry a knife . ”
The plan includes automatic prosecution for anyone over the age of 16 caught with a knife and doubling the maximum sentence for knife possession , to four years .
It also sets up a $ 6 million advertising campaign to discourage young people from committing crimes with knives and a program to force perpetrators to confront their actions by , for instance , attending courses that describe what happens to stabbing victims .
The prime minister also said the government would intervene directly with as many as 20,000 families whose children were considered at risk of turning to violence because “ the mother or father have lost control of their children and their whole life is actually in difficulty . ”
Parents who refused to accept the government intervention , he said , would be threatened with eviction from their homes .
If you ’re white and you like stuff , maybe you ’ve bookmarked the Internet blog Stuff White People Like .
The creation of Christian Lander , a 29 - year - old Culver City copywriter , it ’s an ever - growing list of the kind of privileged preoccupations that traditionally are coded “ white . ”
Examples include Not Having a TV ( “ the number one reason why white people like not having a TV is so that they can tell you that they do n’t have a TV ” ) , Indie Music ( “ To a white person , being a fan of a band before they get popular is one of the most important things they [ sic ] can do with their life ” ) and , a bit abstrusely , Awareness ( “ White people ... firmly believe that all of the world ’s problems can be solved through “ awareness ” ) .
To date , there are 99 items on Stuff White People Like .
Barack Obama , at No. 8 , was among the first entries .
Guess who is not on the list ?
Somehow , Hillary Rodham Clinton , whose campaign now coasts on the fumes of a particular variety of white voter ( the fuming kind ) , has failed to meet the rigorous standards of Stuff White People Like .
The reason , of course , is the same reason cliches such as mayonnaise and square dancing do n’t make the cut either .
The one thing Clinton has over Obama , which she has clumsily described as “ hardworking Americans , white Americans , ” is that certain white people like her more .
But , to borrow a phrase from Lander and company , they are “ the wrong kind of white people . ”
Could that mean they ’re barely “ white ” at all ?
Advertisement
Clinton ’s white voters lack the salient feature of the white experience -- privilege .
As Stuff White People Like suggests , privilege now functions as a rarefied club that excludes people based not on their skin color but on their economic status , personal tastes and aesthetic sensibilities .
The website tips toward progressive emblems of privilege ( public radio ) , but because plenty of Republicans like iPods and farmers markets , it ’s safe to say the actual cohort is bigger than that ( or at least could support a sister site about white love for McMansions , mega - churches and golf ) .
Yes , this club is still called “ white , ” but as time goes on , that whiteness becomes more conceptual than literal .
You do n’t have to be white to be “ white . ”
You just need enough disposable income and the desire to buy the lifestyle accessories and adopt the points of view that were once exclusively associated with it .
So where does that leave Clinton ’s last - ditch voting bloc ?
Barred from this new whiteness ( and apparently unwilling or unable to make common cause with others who are also outside the pale ) , the people who handed Clinton a decisive victory in West Virginia on Tuesday have been stripped of so much social currency over the last few decades that you wonder if a new racial category -- called “ off - whites ” perhaps ? -- is about to emerge .
How else to explain the air of irrelevance that swirled around Tuesday ’s primary ?
Granted , no one expected a nailbiter , but watching the media coverage , most notably the news clips in which one voter admitted to being “ sort of scared of the other race ” and another cavalierly insisted Obama was a Muslim , was to feel like the whole state had been written off as a one big trailer park through which Clinton would take a final joy ride .
Advertisement
Some of that dismissiveness may be the result of the near impossibility of Clinton getting the nomination .
But it also may be a reflection of the way that , in the last 50 years , white people without college educations have gone from being the most dominant segment of American society to the most ignored .
A recent Brookings Institution paper on the decline of the white working class points out that in 1940 , whites without a four - year college degree represented 86 % of the over - 25 population .
Last year , they accounted for less than half .
Moreover , in 1947 , 86 % of American families were white and earning ( in 2005 dollars ) less than $ 60,000 a year .
By 2005 , such families comprised only 33 % .
But in addition to their dwindling demographic presence and their diminished status , these people constantly battle another head wind : culturally sanctioned mockery .
Unprotected by the political correctness that makes deriding other minorities unacceptable or at least uncool , poor whites are often regarded not as people but as mullet - sporting , mobile - home - dwelling vessels of kitsch .
West Virginia had too few delegates at stake to matter much .
Still , it ’s been easy to get the feeling that some people , particularly those in the Stuff White People Like demographic , have concluded that the place is so backward it does n’t matter at all .
They were egged on by a media that appeared at times to be reporting on something as inconsequential as a homecoming queen election .
The problem is , voters like those in West Virginia do n’t see it that way .
They may represent a shrinking demographic , but , as all the campaigns know , there are still enough of them that they ca n’t be ignored .
The catch is that in an election in which race plays such a prominent role , the greatest tension may not be between black and white but white and off - white .

America ’s battered economy took center stage in the presidential race Tuesday as John McCain and Barack Obama offered sharply contrasting policies to anxious voters hit by soaring fuel prices , falling housing prices , the credit crunch and the weakening job market .
McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , delivered a speech to a trade group here touting his antitax credentials and highlighting his economic policy differences with Obama , his Democratic rival .
Obama , in turn , accused McCain of wanting “ to add $ 300 billion more in tax breaks and loopholes for big corporations and for the wealthiest Americans , and he has n’t even explained how he would pay for it . ”
The clash over economics came amid widespread concerns over average gasoline prices topping $ 4 a gallon , a fifth straight month of job declines and a plunging dollar .
Advertisement
Speaking to business leaders at the 2008 National Small Business Summit , McCain vowed to extend President Bush ’s income tax cuts when they expire in two years , an idea Obama opposes .
McCain also renewed his call for temporarily suspending the federal gas tax this summer , a proposal Obama has derided as a gimmick .
More broadly , McCain promised to reduce corporate tax rates , “ break down ” foreign trade barriers and push for a “ simpler , fairer and flatter tax code . ”
“ I do n’t want to send any more of your earnings to the government , ” McCain said .
At the same time , the Arizona senator told the business leaders that Americans “ are right to be offended ” by the “ extravagant salaries and severance deals ” of corporate officers who have engaged in “ reckless corporate behavior . ”
He promised to ensure that “ wrongdoing of this kind is called to account by federal prosecutors . ”

McCain ’s backers insist that Obama would raise taxes , crippling efforts to jump - start the economy and help consumers .
Democrats counter that McCain has embraced failed Bush administration policies and will plunge the nation further into debt , a charge the Republicans strongly deny .
Obama has proposed tax cuts for middle - income families and retirees , a $ 50 - billion economic stimulus package , a higher minimum wage and expanded unemployment benefits , along with help for homeowners facing foreclosure .
But McCain , in his speech Tuesday , focused on Obama ’s support for letting Bush ’s tax cuts expire in 2010 for households earning more than $ 250,000 a year .
He also said Obama would increase taxes on unearned income , including stock dividends and capital gains .
“ Under Sen . Obama ’s tax plan , Americans of every background would see their taxes rise -- seniors , parents , small - business owners and just about everyone who has even a modest investment in the market , ” McCain said .
Advertisement
Obama , speaking later to reporters after touring a hospital in St. Louis , called McCain ’s comments misleading .
The Illinois senator said he would cut taxes for 95 % of America ’s households , while letting the Bush tax cuts lapse on the highest - earning 5 % .
He also vowed to eliminate the capital gains tax “ for the small businesses and start - ups that are the backbone of our economy . ”
During the Republican primaries last spring , McCain faced heavy fire within his own party for initially opposing the Bush tax cuts .
At the time , he argued that the cuts unfairly favored the wealthy and were inappropriate while the nation was fighting two wars .
He now contends that allowing the tax cuts to expire would amount to raising taxes .
In promising to cut corporate income tax rates , McCain said he would reduce those levies “ from the second - highest in the world to one on par with our trading partners . ”
But that characterization of the nation ’s current corporate tax burden was disputed Tuesday .
Advertisement
Among the 30 most developed countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , the United States ’ official corporate tax rates are near the top .
But because of breaks or loopholes in the tax code , the corporate tax revenue actually collected in the U.S. was fourth - lowest among the 30 nations , according to the organization ’s data .
“ It ’s a bit misleading , ” said Bob McIntyre , director of Citizens for Tax Justice , a nonprofit , nonpartisan research and advocacy group in Washington .
“ The rate is high .
But most U.S. companies do n’t pay taxes on most of their profits . ”
Overall , he said , corporate taxes accounted for about half of all income taxes in the 1960s .
They now account for less than 10 % .
Advertisement
Still , McCain ’s corporate tax cut “ would cost $ 100 billion a year , ” said Jared Bernstein , a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington and an informal advisor to Obama ’s campaign .
“ And he has n’t come anywhere near explaining how he would pay for that . ”
In his speech , McCain also accused Obama of “ talking down ” the value of exports and trade agreements .
He specifically criticized Obama ’s pledge to renegotiate the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement .
Republicans credit the NAFTA agreement with Canada and Mexico with spurring record exports , while Democrats blame the agreement for causing job losses and sending industries abroad .
The issue has special resonance in Ohio , Indiana and other large Rust Belt states that have suffered economic dislocation in recent years .
“ We have a sharp disagreement here that I look very much forward to debating , ” McCain said .

The 2008 Perseid Meteor Shower
by Dr. Tony Phillips
Huntsville AL ( SPX ) Jul 24 , 2008
Mark your calendar :
The 2008 Perseid meteor shower peaks on August 12th and it should be a good show .
" The time to look is during the dark hours before dawn on Tuesday , August 12th , " says Bill Cooke of NASA 's Meteoroid Environment Office at the Marshall Space Flight Center .
" There should be plenty of meteors -- perhaps one or two every minute . "
The source of the shower is Comet Swift - Tuttle .
Although the comet is far away , currently located beyond the orbit of Uranus , a trail of debris from the comet stretches all the way back to Earth .
Crossing the trail in August , Earth will be pelted by specks of comet dust hitting the atmosphere at 132,000 mph .
At that speed , even a flimsy speck of dust makes a vivid streak of light when it disintegrates - - a meteor !
Because , Swift - Tuttle 's meteors streak out of the constellation Perseus , they are called " Perseids . "
( Note :
In the narrative that follows , all times are local .
For instance , 9:00 pm means 9:00 pm in your time zone , where you live . )
Serious meteor hunters will begin their watch early , on Monday evening , August 11th , around 9 pm when Perseus first rises in the northeast .
This is the time to look for Perseid Earthgrazers -- meteors that approach from the horizon and skim the atmosphere overhead like a stone skipping across the surface of a pond .
" Earthgrazers are long , slow and colorful ; they are among the most beautiful of meteors , " says Cooke .
He cautions that an hour of watching may net only a few of these at most , but seeing even one can make the whole night worthwhile .
A warm summer night .
Bright meteors skipping overhead .
And the peak is yet to come .
What could be better ?
The answer lies halfway up the southern sky : Jupiter and the gibbous Moon converge on August 11th and 12th for a close encounter in the constellation Sagittarius : sky map .
It 's a grand sight visible even from light - polluted cities .
For a while the beautiful Moon will interfere with the Perseids , lunar glare wiping out all but the brightest meteors .
Yin -yang .
The situation reverses itself at 2 am on Tuesday morning , August 12th , when the Moon sets and leaves behind a dark sky for the Perseids .
The shower will surge into the darkness , peppering the sky with dozens and perhaps hundreds of meteors until dawn .
For maximum effect , " get away from city lights , " Cooke advises .
The brightest Perseids can be seen from cities , he allows , but the greater flurry of faint , delicate meteors is visible only from the countryside .
( Scouts , this is a good time to go camping . )
The Perseids are coming .
Enjoy the show !
Just one and a half weeks since we started using the bge , and the progress has been insane .
There ’s way too much for one post .
GLSL is now integrated in the BGE , just enable it in the game menu to preview it in the 3d view , and it ’ll look exactly the same when you press P. Support for nodes , multiple uv layers , all blending modes , stencil maps for splatting , color ramps for that precious falloff , and much more .
One more week like this and my grin will be permanent .
Ever wanted shape keys to work in the game engine ?
Well support for shape keys has been added !
There ’s a brand new actuator called “ Shape Action ” .
Grab yourself an apricot build and go nuts .
And there ’s been some really impressive speedups to the game engine .
Just enable “ Vertex Arrays ” in your preferences and “ Generate Display Lists ” from the game menu for the fastest performance .
Our test scene gets almost twice the frame rate .
The devs helping us are really doing amazing things ..
Things are really progressing quickly .
Have a look at our latest demo from the BGE , showing some new gameplay and playing with new features like glsl .
Most of the main actions for Frankie have been added , plus a small environment to play around in while we work on the world for the game .
Things are getting really exciting around here .
We ’ll post more progress this weekend , and , if anyone is interested , we may be looking for help soon .
More info on that later .
Of course one really big way to help this project is to pre-order the DVD !.

Barack Obama , the likely Democratic nominee , has two options in his hunt for a partner on the Democratic ticket .
He can double down on strengths or he can compensate for weaknesses .
If he mimics the last Democratic president and chooses the former ( Bill Clinton selected another young Southerner , Al Gore , in 1992 ) , the decision - making process is relatively easy :
Find someone youthful and energetic with a devotion to reform , a foreign policy approach that rejects conventional wisdom , and a short or nonexistent Washington resume .
If Obama chooses the latter , however , things are decidedly more complex .
Does he choose a VP who bolsters the ticket on foreign policy or on executive experience ?
Is there anyone with foreign policy expertise who is n’t a creature of Washington ?
Does he find someone with appeal to working - class voters in Appalachia or white women nationwide ?
What about Jews in Florida and Latinos in the Southwest ?
And hanging over all of this is the geographic question — does Obama pick someone who hails from a swing state that he or she can deliver ?
There is not a lot of evidence that suggests vice presidential candidates make a serious difference ( good or bad ) for the ticket .
Two words : Dan Quayle .
One study showed that a veep pick can increase a ticket ’s performance by less than one half of one percent in the VP ’s home state .
Presidential candidates do not assume the assets ( or race , or gender ) of their running mates , and voters generally focus on the top of the ticket .
The most important questions for Obama may be the simplest .
Which potential VP can be president should the unthinkable happen , and whom can Obama spend four ( or eight ) harmonious years with in the White House ?
With these caveats in mind , let ’s look at the contenders .
Hillary Clinton is n’t on this list — not because she is an unlikely pick , but because the merits of adding her to the ticket have been debated ad nauseam .
Gov. Kathleen Sebelius ( D - Kan. ) , 60
Sebelius is frequently mentioned because she is a living embodiment of Obama ’s message .
She won the governorship of deep red Kansas in 2002 and 2006 .
In both campaigns , she convinced a Republican to switch to the Democratic Party in order to become her lieutenant governor .
In 2006 , Sebelius also recruited the then - Republican district attorney in Johnson County to run as a Democrat for attorney general against a Republican incumbent .
He did , and he won .
Sebelius is also on the list because it is assumed she will strengthen Obama ’s support among female voters .
But is that really true ?
Will women who are devoted to Hillary Clinton warm to Sebelius simply because she is a woman ?
That would be a fairly patronizing assumption for Obama and his strategists to make .
And hardcore Clinton supporters may by angered if Obama selects a female running mate who is n’t Hillary Clinton .
A final consideration on the topic of gender is whether putting an African American and a woman on the same ticket is too much of a political risk in a country that has elected neither to the top office .
Sebelius has other advantages .
Because she has worked with a Republican legislature , she has been forced to issue bold vetoes of abortion restrictions , a harsh voter identification measure , and the creation of new coal plants .
She is also anti-death penalty .
In sum , Sebelius is a strong and successful progressive in a state where one does n’t expect to find them .
Her lack of foreign policy credentials and Kansas ’ paltry six electoral votes are liabilities .
And no discussion of Sebelius is complete without a mention of her soporific response to Bush ’s 2008 State of the Union address .
Given the opportunity to showcase her talents , Sebelius came off as wooden and uninspiring .
For one speech at least , she was the anti-Obama .
Gov. Ted Strickland ( D - Ohio ) , 66
Governors and senators from Ohio are always going to be considered ( Strickland is n’t the only Buckeye State lawmaker on this list ) , but Strickland brings more than just pull with the swingiest of states .
The son of a steelworker , and a former Methodist minister who promised to follow “ biblical principles ” when he ran for governor in 2006 , Strickland can probably appeal to those fabled working - class whites , if anyone can .
Though Strickland has only been governor since 2007 ( he won 20 percent of Republicans and 69 percent of independents in his fight against then - Secretary of State Ken Blackwell ) , he did represent Ohio for six terms in the House before moving to the mansion .
During that time , Strickland was instrumental in creating SCHIP , the federal government ’s leading program providing health care for underprivileged children .
In fact , it was during the genesis of SCHIP that Strickland came to know then - first lady Hillary Clinton , whose presidential candidacy he endorsed .
That fact alone would n’t make Strickland a thorny pick , but he did parrot some of the Clinton campaign ’s harshest criticisms of Obama .
Age is a factor with Strickland .
Of concern to the Democratic Party , though perhaps not to Obama , is whether the VP pick will be able to carry its flag eight years down the line .
Initiating an era of long - term progressive governance requires someone who is young , energetic , and inoffensive to most or all of the factions within the party .
In that case , Strickland , who will be 74 in 2016 , most certainly is n’t their guy .
Sen. Jim Webb ( D - Va. ) , 62
Webb recently took on John McCain on the GI Bill and showed that he was n’t intimidated .
In characteristically gruff fashion , he said that McCain , who opposed the bill because he feared it would decrease retention rates , was “ full of it . ”
It was reminiscent of when Webb , in a reception at the White House soon after his election in 2006 , refused to take a photo with President Bush and told him off when Bush asked about Webb ’s son , who was then serving in Iraq .
Incidents like that one have helped to forge Webb ’s reputation as the Democratic Party ’s ballsiest member .
A former Marine , Webb has earned a Navy Cross , the Silver Star , two Bronze Stars , and two Purple Hearts .
He was secretary of the navy in the 1980s ( though he is now actively opposed to the Iraq War ) , and two of his recent books are called Born Fighting and A Time to Fight .
Sense a theme ?
But if Webb does n’t sound too much like a Democrat , that ’s because he was n’t one until recently .
He held that secretary of the navy post during the Reagan administration .
He was once quoted calling liberals “ cultural Marxists . ”
In 2000 he assailed affirmative action as “ state - sponsored racism , ” and in 2004 he wrote that John Kerry should have been condemned for his opposition to the Vietnam War .
But Webb says that the GOP lost him .
As a former Republican , he serves Obama ’s unity theme .
As VP , Webb could hit the trail saying to Reagan Democrats and moderate Republicans , “ I used to find answers in the Republican Party , too .
But it got too extreme , too corrupt , and too hawkish . ”
And Webb ’s conversion looks thorough :
He now has a 100 percent NARAL rating , supports same - sex civil unions , opposes the death penalty , and is an advocate for prison reform .
But for the foreign policy credentials , the ability to put Virginia in play , and the outsized personality ( Terence Samuel noted in the American Prospect , “ some Democrats see in [ Webb ] attributes they long for in their party — conviction , strength , and a willingness to fight ” ) , Webb has one thing that may keep him off the ticket : a horrible record on women ’s rights .
He wrote a 1979 article titled “ Women Ca n’t Fight , ” making the argument that women are biologically unsuited for combat .
He called the Naval Academy “ a horny woman ’s dream . ”
At a 1991 gathering of naval aviators known as Tailhook , widespread sexual assault / harassment of female attendees took place ;
Webb publicly denounced the military ’s subsequent attempt to clean up shop .
He called the investigation a “ witch hunt . ”
Capping the defeat of the first nearly successful female presidential candidate by putting a one - time spouter of chauvinism on the ticket might be a seriously dumb idea for the Democrats .
“ It would be seen as a big ‘ screw you ’ to Hillary ’s supporters and to feminists in general , ” writes blogger Kathy G .
Gov. Ed Rendell ( D - Pa. ) , 64
Obama needs Pennsylvania the way fish need water .
One reason Clinton won the Pennsylvania primary so decisively was Rendell ’s support .
He served two terms as Philadelphia ’s district attorney , followed by two terms as the city ’s mayor .
( The New York Times called his tenure “ the most stunning turnaround in recent urban history . ” )
Then Rendell took a year to chair the Democratic National Committee before running for governor .
He won twice statewide .
He brings a roadmap for success in the Keystone State and valuable executive experience .
That long resume in public service , however untainted by Washington as it may be , could be a deficiency if it is perceived as clashing with Obama ’s agent - of - change theme .
A bigger disadvantage , however , is Rendell ’s seemingly genetic inability to stay on message .
He has a long history of problematic truth telling , including his claim that Obama would struggle in Pennsylvania because “ You ’ve got conservative whites here … who are not ready to vote for an African American candidate . ”
Rendell would be an irrepressible personality in a position that sometimes calls for self - suppression .
No presidential candidate wants to be upstaged by his or her running mate .
Rendell also brings no foreign policy background , and his age is no asset .
The fact that he is Jewish , however , could help Obama in Florida and with Jews nationwide who question Obama ’s commitment to Israel .
But there ’s always the other hand :
Is America ready for a ticket that includes a fellow whom a significant number of Americans still believes is a secret Muslim , and a Jew ?
Gov. Bill Richardson ( D - N.M. ) , 60
His impressive resume — former Secretary of Energy , former UN Ambassador , 15 years in Congress , two - term governor — provided the justification for his presidential run , but Richardson could n’t translate it into support with voters .
He was often something of a sideshow and failed to convince voters that he was worthy of serious consideration .
Richardson ’s history of negotiating with tough characters around the globe would lend credence to Obama on his biggest split from foreign policy orthodoxy .
And Richardson could help Obama with Latino voters in swing states like Nevada and Colorado ( and deliver New Mexico ’s five electoral votes ) .
Minor concern : Does the Democratic Party want Richardson to be its best - positioned member for a 2016 run for the presidency ?
Sen. Chuck Hagel ( R - Neb . ) , 61
An unlikely choice , no doubt .
But selecting Hagel , an outspoken anti-war Republican , would be a powerful signal that Obama will walk the walk , and not just talk the talk , when it comes to reaching out to like - minded Republicans .
The two - term senator has foreign policy credentials and unlike most other moderate Republicans who have gone queasy on the war on Iraq , Hagel actually votes with the Democrats nowadays .
But although Hagel has become something of a progressive darling because of his tough talk on the Bush administration , he is a bedrock conservative on most domestic issues .
His Planned Parenthood rating was 0 percent in 2006 .
His League of Conservation Voters rating was 20 percent in 2007 .
These are likely deal breakers .
Gen. Wesley Clark ( US Army , retired ) , 63
Clark , a retired four - star general , commanded the NATO forces in the Kosovo War during his term as the supreme allied commander ( 1997 to 2000 ) .
Obviously that background brings national security cred to the ticket .
But by Clark ’s own admission , his political consciousness was born after his military duties ended in 2000 .
A history of suspiciously conservative statements and the fact that Clark did not seem to have clearly defined positions on major issues when he ran for president as a Democrat in 2004 led many to believe that his choice of political party was a matter of convenience instead of principle .
But Clark has always been pro-choice , and is now firmly against the Iraq War .
And since 2004 , he has become a fully integrated part of the progressive movement , even giving the keynote address at Yearly Kos , the annual convention for liberal bloggers and their fans , in 2007 .
Clark endorsed Clinton last September and is identified as one of her most prominent ( and combative ) surrogates .
As a result , many in the media argue that his selection would help unify the party .
But will heartbroken Clinton supporters really be mollified if one of Clinton ’s good friends is on the ticket ?
Picking Clark would only be a bridge - building gesture if Clinton herself feels as though Clark ’s presence on the ticket ensures that her agenda will have a place in the next administration .
Sen. Sam Nunn ( D - Ga. ) , 69
Nunn is almost as old as McCain , the man Democrats are hoping voters will consider too geriatric for the presidency .
If something were to happen to Obama , the face of the presidency and the face of the Democratic Party would change drastically .
He is essentially a Cheney pick .
That said , Nunn has his strengths .
A favorite of the folks who consider themselves national security experts , Nunn served for 24 years as a senator ( 1972 to 1997 ) .
He was chairman of the Armed Services Committee , and cosponsored the bill that formed the Nunn - Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program , which helps foreign countries secure and destroy their nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons .
And after leaving the Senate , Nunn did n’t stop working on the issue of nukes , a focus he shares with Obama , whom he endorsed .
He is currently the cochairman of the Nuclear Threat Initiative , a nonprofit that seeks to reduce the global threat from weapons of mass destruction .
He is routinely considered a top choice for secretary of defense or secretary of state in Democratic administrations , and offers something to everyone on foreign policy :
He was often considered a hawk , but opposed both Gulf wars .
Throughout his Senate career , Nunn was a moderate to conservative Democrat on domestic policy .
He fiercely opposed President Clinton ’s attempt to integrate openly homosexual Americans into the military and was a committed deficit hawk .
He left politics , citing a lack of “ zest and enthusiasm , ” meaning he would probably shy from the attack - dog role traditionally played by the VP candidate .
And his long career in Washington makes the “ change ” slogan a hard sell .
Sen. Evan Bayh ( D - Ind. ) , 52
Though young and telegenic , Bayh resembles a generic politician .
He has a long career in politics — he was elected governor of Indiana in 1988 ( at the age of 33 ) and again in 1992 , and was elected to the Senate in 1998 and again in 2004 .
Like many lifetime politicians , Bayh is a legacy .
He is the son of Birch Bayh , who was a senator from 1963 to 1981 and ran for president in 1976 , losing to Jimmy Carter in the Democratic primary .
Bayh is a moderate .
As governor , he cut taxes and earned the favor of the Wall Street Journal , which called him a “ genuinely fiscally conservative Democrat . ”
After moving to Washington , Bayh served as chair of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council , a group that has been criticized for its corporate funding and willingness to embrace Republicanism Lite .
He is a member of the Senate Centrist Coalition .
While Bayh is competent , his name is typically met with a yawn in VP discussions .
He is n’t known for any bold positions or legislative achievements .
He is close to the Clintons — top - tier DLCers — and has been an active surrogate during the campaign .
He is frequently cited , like Wes Clark , as one of the Clintonites Obama could choose as a sop to the defeated camp .
More purely political concerns : Indiana is deep red , and though Obama fared well against Clinton there , his only hope of winning the state in November may be by selecting Bayh , who has won by historic margins in the state .
( Even with Bayh , it will be very tough to take a state that Bush won by 21 percent in 2004 . )
If the Democrats , with Bayh on the ticket , were to win the White House , Indiana ’s Republican governor would likely replace Bayh with a member of the GOP , costing the Dems a seat in the Senate and potentially undermining their chance of achieving a 60 - seat filibuster - proof majority .
Sen. Joe Biden ( D - Del. ) , 65
As the current don of the Democrats ’ foreign policy community , Biden shores up Obama on a key front .
Currently serving his sixth term in the Senate , Biden is the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee .
The senator from tiny Delaware would be a perfect liaison to Capitol Hill .
That comes with the obvious flip side , however .
When you ’ve been in Washington more than 30 years , it ’s hard to argue you can suddenly play an agent of change .
You are as complicit in Washington ’s problems as anyone .
Biden has a famously big mouth .
He talks too much and too often says things that he immediately regrets .
Early in the campaign season , for example , Biden said that Obama represented a break from black presidential candidates of the past because he is “ clean and articulate . ”
But as Steve Kornacki wrote in the New York Observer , “ By embracing [ Biden ] , Obama would be sending a signal to well - meaning white voters of a certain generation that he understands if they — like Biden — have n’t fully figured out how to talk about race . ”
And that big mouth can be an effective weapon .
Biden could be an attack - dog with infinite credibility .
When Bush likened Obama to Nazi appeasers several weeks ago , Biden roared , “ This is bullshit .
This is malarkey .
This is outrageous . ”
There are problems to overcome .
Biden supported the war in Iraq and is relatively hawkish by Democratic standards .
When he campaigned in Iowa as a presidential candidate , Biden frequently said that he would oppose any move to make war funding dependent on withdrawal timetables because of a “ sacred obligation ” to the troops .
Gov. Janet Napolitano ( D - Ariz . ) , 50
Here ’s someone for whom age is definitely not a factor .
Of all the people on this list , Napolitano is the closest to Obama in years .
Napolitano first entered the national stage when she represented Anita Hill in her sexual harassment case against Clarence Thomas .
In 1993 , Napolitano was named the US attorney for Arizona .
In 1998 , she was elected attorney general .
By 2002 , she had won the governorship .
In 2005 , Time named her one of the five best governors in the US .
As a two - term governor , like Sebelius , Napolitano has a longer record of executive achievement than Strickland , Virginia governor Tim Kaine , and Montana governor Brian Schweitzer .
Napolitano has tons of experience with the immigration issue .
When disgruntled Arizona voters passed Proposition 200 , which prohibited undocumented immigrants from receiving benefits from the state , Napolitano stood up against it .
She has done so with other bills targeting undocumented immigrants .
But Napolitano understands something must be done :
In 2005 she declared a state of emergency in Arizona because of the border situation .
Like Obama , Napolitano supports comprehensive immigration reform .
The negatives are there , however .
She is perhaps the least well known nationally of all the candidates on this list , and she brings no foreign policy expertise to the ticket .
Though Arizona generally could be a swing state , it will be essentially impossible for the Dems to win McCain ’s home state .
Napolitano is unmarried , which might prompt distracting gossip about her sexuality .
If Napolitano is not Obama ’s VP pick , she will be term - limited out of office in 2010 .
She could run for John McCain ’s seat , whether he ’s sitting in it or not .
Sen . John Edwards ( D - N.C. ) , 54
If Edwards desires the vice presidential nod — and that ’s no sure thing considering his experience in 2004 — it would have served him well to endorse Obama early and campaign with him in those late primary states where he might have helped Obama the most : Pennsylvania , Indiana , West Virginia , and Kentucky .
By endorsing late and declining to play an active role for Obama , Edwards missed an opportunity not only to test - run an Obama - Edwards act , but also to prove that he could help Obama attract the votes of working - class whites .
Some might argue that Edwards ’ pitch to those folks — he was the strongest economic populist in the Democratic presidential field — was manufactured , and not really part of Edwards ’ personal history ( like Strickland or Webb ) nor part of his long - term public record ( like Sherrod Brown , below ) .
His critics assailed him as a hypocrite , citing his expensive haircuts , his big house , and his work for a hedge fund .
He also brings little to the table on national security , and in 2004 he did n’t deliver his home state .
All of that said , he reinforces Obama ’s strengths .
He is young , lively , a good speaker , and has been around Washington just long enough to know where it ’s broken .
He spent a very significant portion of his time in the race slamming the power of lobbyists and the sway of special interests .
His “ Two Americas ” message was fundamentally a call to create one America , which fits Obama ’s rhetoric like a glove .
We noted on more than one occasion that there was serious overlap between the Edwards and Obama messages .
In fact , Edwards hinted that they made natural partners .
Sen. Sherrod Brown ( D - Ohio ) , 55
Brown represents , like Edwards , an opportunity for Obama to double down .
He is an energetic campaigner and an early and consistent opponent of the war in Iraq .
He is fresh to the Senate ( though he did spend 14 years in the House ) .
He is one of the upper body ’s leading advocates for the populist economic policies that have become standard rhetoric for both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton this campaign season .
( Back when Brown was in the House in 2005 , he was a leader in the fight against CAFTA . )
Brown has built a serious reputation : Political observers consider him a top - flight economic mind .
Though Brown adds nothing to the ticket in terms of national security bona fides , he speaks the language of those working - class whites on the nation ’s No. 1 issue .
And he ’s an unabashed progressive .
Did I mention he ’s from Ohio ?
If Brown leaves the Senate , Gov. Ted Strickland can replace him with another Democrat , thus preserving the Dems ’ count in the Senate .
Ultimately a 60 - seat majority in the Senate may mean more to an Obama administration than any vice presidential choice .
Ferrofluid in a Magnetic Field Wallpaper Description :
A ferrofluid is a liquid which becomes strongly polarised in the presence of a magnetic field .
It is a colloidal mixture comprising extremely small magnetic particles suspended in a liquid .
The particles are coated with a surface active agent ( surfactant ) to prevent them from clumping together .
Ferrofluids are composed of nanoscale ferromagnetic , or ferrimagnetic , particles suspended in a carrier fluid , usually an organic solvent or water .
The ferromagnetic nano - particles are coated with a surfactant to prevent their agglomeration ( due to van der Waals and magnetic forces ) .
Although the name may suggest otherwise , ferrofluids do not display ferromagnetism , since they do not retain magnetization in the absence of an externally applied field .
In fact , ferrofluids display ( bulk - scale ) paramagnetism , and are often referred as being " superparamagnetic " due to their large magnetic susceptibility .
Permanently magnetized fluids are difficult to create at present .

Face - to - face anger : Trump , Biden lash , interrupt each other
The debate will offer a massive platform for Trump and Biden to outline their starkly different visions for a country facing multiple crises , including racial justice protests and a pandemic that has killed more than 200,000 Americans and cost millions of jobs .
Ben Smith makes an excellent point as to why the Democrats should emit a large yawn at childish threats from Hillary ’s donors to boycott the fall congressional races if Herself is n’t handed the nomination :
The threat of money , at this point , makes little sense .
The most powerful financial force in American politics right now — by very , very far — is the Barack Obama money spigot .
Hillary , the one who is now bankrupt , is threatening to take her nonexistent donors and go home ?
Ooh , scary .
By Ian Youngs
Music reporter , BBC News website
Kid Rock has sold almost 20 million records in the US US music star Kid Rock is refusing to put his albums on iTunes because he says artists do not get paid enough for downloads from the Apple store .
Kid Rock is one of the last few acts not fully signed up to the service .
He said it was based on " an old system , where iTunes takes the money , the record company takes the money , and they do n't give it to the artists " .
His latest album Rock ' n ' Roll Jesus went to number one in the US last year , despite being absent from iTunes .
The Beatles , Garth Brooks and AC / DC are the only other major stars who have still not made their music available on iTunes .
" Back in the day , we all know the stories of the Otis Reddings and Chuck Berrys and Fats Dominos who never got paid , " Kid Rock told the BBC News website .
I do n't mind people stealing my music , that 's fine - but I think they should steal everything
Kid Rock
" So the internet was an opportunity for everyone to be treated fairly , for the consumer to get a fair price , for the artist to be paid fairly , for the record companies to make some money . "
But they stuck to the " old system " , he continued .
" I will be on iTunes eventually because I can't avoid it , but I like to always stick to my guns and prove a point and do something original and because I believe in it . "
His new single All Summer Long has , though , just been made available on iTunes in Europe and will be downloadable in the UK soon .
The rocker , who was famously married to actress Pamela Anderson , said he was losing 10 - 20 % of album sales by not being on iTunes .
But he added : " I 've just sold a million records , I 'm not really feeling that blow . "
The performer - whose real name is Robert Ritchie - said his record company Atlantic had asked him to " stand up for illegal downloading " a few years ago because it told him " people are stealing from us and stealing from you " .
Kid Rock has just played his first UK shows for five years " And I go : ' Wait a second , you 've been stealing from the artists for years .
Now you want me to stand up for you ? '
" I was telling kids - download it illegally , I do n't care .
I want you to hear my music so I can play live . "
Asked whether he was worried about illegal downloading , he replied : " I do n't agree with it .
I think we should level the playing field .
I do n't mind people stealing my music , that 's fine .
But I think they should steal everything .
" You know how much money the oil companies have ?
If you need some gas , just go fill your tank off and drive off , they 're not going to miss it . "
But he said he did not implement that advice himself .
" No , I do n't steal things .
I 'm rich . "
Apple and Atlantic declined to comment .
The only Kid Rock album on iTunes is his 1990 debut Grits Sandwiches For Breakfast , to which he does not own the rights .
' Full albums only ' Garth Brooks , who is second to The Beatles in all - time US record sales - ahead of Elvis Presley - has also refused to join the iTunes revolution .
He wants fans to download only full albums because he says each album is a complete work and the songs are designed to be heard together .
" We do albums , we have always done albums , " he recently told the BBC News website .
Referring to songs from his 1990 album No Fences , he continued : " Friends in Low Places is not Friends in Low Places without Wolves or Wild Horses .
" And if people try to make it a money issue , I can get the full album to the consumer for much less than they can get it at 99 cents a song .
" There are a number of issues that need to be addressed in the digital downloading world before we introduce our music to it . "
iTunes has overtaken supermarket group Wal - Mart to become the largest music retailer in the US , an independent study has said .

Condoleezza Rice has said the US wants to reach out to Iranian people
The US has refused to deny reports that it will establish a US diplomatic presence in Iran in the next month .
The UK's Guardian newspaper reports the US plans to open an interests section in Tehran , its first diplomatic presence in the country for 30 years .
The state department said its policy towards Iran was unchanged , but that it wanted to reach out to Iranians .
It comes as the US announced that a top diplomat would attend talks in Geneva with the Iranians on Saturday .
The talks will be the first time in 30 years that such a high - ranking US diplomat - the third - most senior in the US - has met Iranian officials .
Change of tone US officials said recently that the idea of a diplomatic presence in Iran was being discussed , but that it was not being actively worked on .
The unsourced Guardian report said that the interests section - a step towards setting up an embassy - would be similar to the one in Cuba .
Signs of hope in Iran - US ties
When asked for a comment , the state department sent out a note with past comments made by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
She said that while US policy towards Iran was known and unchanged , the Iranian people deserved better .
Ms Rice added that the US was determined to find ways to reach out to the Iranian people and wanted more Iranians to visit the US .
While Washington still insists Iran must suspend uranium enrichment - a process the West fears could be used to make nuclear weapons - there seems to be a significant change in US tone , says the BBC's Kim Ghattas in Washington .
Tehran has an interests section in Washington , where it processes visa applications and which gives it a presence on the ground in the US .
But the US has not had a diplomatic presence in Iran since the hostage crisis in 1979 , and Iranians have to go to Dubai to get US visas .

What are these ?
It ’s time for another pop quiz on America ’s favorite region of the world  the Middle East .
Let ’s get started with the subject of nuclear weapons .
Which country in the Middle East actually possesses nuclear weapons ?
Israel .
Which country in the Middle East refuses to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ?
Israel .
Which country in the Middle East refuses to allow international inspections of its nuclear facilities ?
Israel .
Which countries in the Middle East have called for the region to be a nuclear - free zone ?
The Arab countries and Iran .
Which country in the Middle East occupies land belonging to other people ?
Israel , which occupies a piece of Lebanon , a larger piece of Syria , East Jerusalem , the West Bank and Gaza .
Which country in the Middle East has for 60 years refused to allow refugees to return to their homes and refused to consider compensation to them for their lost property ?
Israel .
Which country has roads on which citizens who are Arab may not drive and housing developments where Arabs may not live ?
Israel .
Which country in the region has violated more United Nations resolutions than any other ?
Israel .
The United States has on more than one occasion gone to war ostensibly to enforce U.N. Security Council resolutions , but when it comes to resolutions directed against Israel , the U.S. is like the amoral monkey that sees , hears and says nothing .
That raises the question of who ’s the dog and who ’s the tail ?
Which country in the region has in the past been led by men who at one time were terrorists with a price on their heads ?
Israel .
Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir once led the Stern Gang and ordered , among other things , the assassination of Count Folke Bernadotte , a Swedish diplomat working for the United Nations .
Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin led the Irgun , a terrorist gang that among other things blew up one wing of the King David Hotel , killing nearly 100 people .
Which country in the Middle East openly employs assassination against its political enemies ?
Israel .
There have been assassinations carried out by some of the Arab governments , but they usually do n’t own up to them .
Israel has created a euphemism that the suck - up American press has readily adopted : " targeted killings . "
A British journalist told me once , " The Palestinians have a talent for picking bad leaders , and the Israelis have a talent for murdering their good ones . "
What are the top five countries from which we import oil ?
Here they are in order of volume : Canada , Saudi Arabia , Mexico , Nigeria and Venezuela .
The next time you hear some blowhard politician ranting about how the Arabs control our oil imports , remind him or her of the facts .
By far , a majority of oil imports come from non-Arab countries .
Which country in the region receives an annual gift of $ 3 billion or more from Congress ?
Israel .
Which foreign - aid recipient is the only one allowed to receive its aid in a lump sum and which routinely invests part of it in U.S. Treasuries so that taxpayers pay them interest on the taxpayers ’ gift ?
Israel .
Which country in the Middle East has the most powerful lobby in the U.S. ?
Israel .
Which country in the Middle East are most American politicians , journalists and academics afraid to criticize ?
Israel .
On behalf of which country has the U.S. vetoed the largest number of U.N. Security Council resolutions ?
Israel .
What country do the people in the region consider the world ’s biggest hypocrite ?
The United States .
Which countries in the Middle East have attacked U.S. ships in international waters ?
Iraq and Israel .
A lone Iraqi plane fired one missile at a U.S. ship by mistake .
The Iraqi government quickly compensated the U.S. In 1967 , Israeli airplanes and torpedo boats attacked the USS Liberty , killing 34 Americans .
The U.S. government declared it an accident even before the ship limped into port , and to this day Congress has never held a public hearing and allowed the survivors to tell their story .
Their story , by the way , is that the attack was deliberate .
Israel compensated the families of those who were killed , but resisted for years paying compensation for the ship .
The people who created this country built a moral structure around money .
The Puritan legacy inhibited luxury and self - indulgence .
Benjamin Franklin spread a practical gospel that emphasized hard work , temperance and frugality .
Millions of parents , preachers , newspaper editors and teachers expounded the message .
The result was quite remarkable .
The United States has been an affluent nation since its founding .
But the country was , by and large , not corrupted by wealth .
For centuries , it remained industrious , ambitious and frugal .
Over the past 30 years , much of that has been shredded .
The social norms and institutions that encouraged frugality and spending what you earn have been undermined .
The institutions that encourage debt and living for the moment have been strengthened .
The country ’s moral guardians are forever looking for decadence out of Hollywood and reality TV .
But the most rampant decadence today is financial decadence , the trampling of decent norms about how to use and harness money .
Sixty - two scholars have signed on to a report by the Institute for American Values and other think tanks called , “ For a New Thrift : Confronting the Debt Culture , ” examining the results of all this .
This may be damning with faint praise , but it ’s one of the most important think - tank reports you ’ll read this year .
” is movie based on the true story from director , writer , starringwhich hits the theaters onBased on the true story of college professor and part - time inventor Robert Kearns ’ ( Greg Kinnear ) long battle with the U.S. automobile industry , Flash of Genius tells the tale of one man whose fight to receive recognition for his ingenuity would come at a heavy price .
But this determined engineer refused to be silenced , and he took on the corporate titans in a battle that nobody thought he could win .

The Kearns were a typical 1960s Detroit family , trying to live their version of the American Dream .
Local university professor Bob married teacher Phyllis ( Lauren Graham ) and , by their mid-thirties , had six kids who brought them a hectic but satisfying Midwestern existence .
When Bob invents a device that would eventually be used by every car in the world , the Kearns think they have struck gold .
But their aspirations are dashed after the auto giants who embraced Bob ’s creation unceremoniously shunned the man who invented it .
Ignored , threatened and then buried in years of litigation , Bob is haunted by what was done to his family and their future .
He becomes a man obsessed with justice and the conviction that his life ’s work - or for that matter , anyone ’s work–be acknowledged by those who stood to benefit .
And while paying the toll for refusing to compromise his dignity , this everyday David will try the unthinkable : to bring Goliath to his knees .
A new catalyst makes it feasible to split water with solar power .
MIT chemists say the catalyst , used in conjunction with cheap photovoltaic solar panels , could lead to inexpensive , simple systems that use water to store the energy from sunlight .
In the process , the scientists may have cleared the major roadblock on the long road to fossil fuel independence : Reducing the on- again , off - again nature of many renewable power sources .
The catalyst enables the electrolysis system to function efficiently at room temperature and at ordinary pressure .
Like a reverse fuel cell , it splits water into oxygen and hydrogen .
By recombining the molecules with a standard fuel cell , the O2 and H2 could then be used to generate energy on demand .
" You 've made your house into a fuel station , " Daniel Nocera , a chemistry professor at MIT said .
" I 've gotten rid of all the goddamn grids . "
Solar energy currently makes less than one percent of the world 's electricity .
The main drawback of the technology , preventing wider adoption , is that solar systems only make power while the sun is shining .
At night or on cloudy days , those in need of power must look elsewhere .
So storage of electrical energy has been a long - sought after technological advance .
Batteries work but they 're too big and expensive .
Fuels , fossil or renewable , are different :
They act as their own storage , allowing for easy transport and usage .
That 's one reason that coal and oil have such a dominant hold on the world 's energy market .
The MIT discovery could help transform electricity generated through solar energy into a fuel , making it more competitive with fossil fuels .
That could prove to be a major milestone in clean technology .
" I think it 's a very interesting discovery , " said Tom Mallouk , a chemistry professor at Penn State .
" It 's one of those papers that really has the potential to change the field . "
The key advancement in Nocera 's Science paper is the development of an oxygen - producing catalyst made of cobalt and phosphate .
Splitting water requires two half - reactions , one to create oxygen gas and the next to create hydrogen .
For decades , Mallouk said , scientists have been trying to reduce the cost of the oxygen part of the reaction , with little success .
" The hydrogen side of the cell is only two electrons per molecule .
The oxygen side is four electrons per molecule , " Mallouk said .
" There is a rule in electrochemistry that the more electrons you have the more complicated the process is . "
It 's important to note that Nocera 's breakthrough is in making it cheaper and simpler to split water by electrolysis .
Expensive machines have long been able to do the same thing , but only by using iridium alloys or exotic nanoparticles .
The new catalyst is remarkable because its made of common materials and can operate at room temperature and normal pressure .
Without the need to heat and pressurize the water , the energy needs and cost of running the process overall are much lower .
And that could make a standard solar array on a home a viable source of electricity for creating all the hydrogen a household would need .
The joke in clean tech circles about hydrogen is that " hydrogen is the fuel of the future and always will be . "
But that 's in large part because producing hydrogen has been so expensive and energy - intensive to produce .
Most of the power in the world comes from fossil fuel , too , so making hydrogen generated tons of greenhouse gases .
" It 's never an issue in energy of whether you can do it or not , " Nocera said .
" It 's whether you can do it cheaply . "
And whether or not the setup will prove cost - effective remains to be seen .
It still uses a platinum catalyst to produce hydrogen , for example .
Erik Straser , a leading clean technology investor with the venture capital firm ,
Mohr - Davidow , termed the technology " promising , " but said the new paper did n't shed light on its economic viability .
" I think that having operation at room temp and standard pressure is a key innovation , " he wrote in an e-mail to Wired.com .
" What is not there are any of the metrics that would let you determine whether this made economic sense ( a huge issue in these energy technologies ) . "
Other scientists are , however , hard at work trying to find cheaper hydrogen producing catalysts , including a group of scientists led by Bjorn
Winther - Jensen who published work on a carbon - based catalyst in the same issue of Science this week .
Nocera himself admits that he has n't " driven down the whole road " on what the setup could cost .
And , solar panels remain very expensive on a per- kilowatt basis , even as innovation in the field continues to drive costs down for consumers .
Still , despite the questions about the commercial viability of the technology , Nocera said that the Bob Metcalfe - run venture capital firm ,
Polaris , had
" swooped in " on the technology and was filing for patent protections .
Though Nocera does n't expect retail systems to be available for the better part of a decade , the questions about the viability of his idea should begin to be answered soon , as prototype designs attempt to deliver on his big promises .
" Within two years , you 'll start seeing module designs , " Nocera said . " A
lot of my MIT colleagues are raring to go and work on this and they are all engineers and they 're pretty damn good . "

They Earn $ 200,000 and Pay No Taxes Find out how these rich folks avoided paying any income taxes .
June 15 , 2008  --
Death is inevitable , but federal income taxes are n't for an increased number of high - income earners .
New IRS statistics show 7,389 federal tax returns with $ 200,000 or more in adjusted gross income reported no federal income taxes in 2005 .
That 's a 161 % jump from the 2,833 comparable returns filed in 2004 .
Additionally , 4,224 of the over - $ 200,000 earners reported no worldwide income tax liability on their 2005 returns , the IRS data show .
That represents a 75 % increase from the 2,420 comparable returns filed in 2004 .
The data are the most recent available from the IRS .
It shows a rising number of high - income earners have avoided the alternative minimum tax , which was intended to ensure that tax shelters , deductions and loopholes would n't exempt wealthy Americans from paying at least some federal income tax .
" It 's an interesting case study on how people find ways to avoid paying taxes , " said Howard Gleckman , a senior research associate and tax blog editor at The Tax Policy Center , a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution .
The increases stem in part from two tax law changes , according to the IRS Spring 2008 Statistics of Income Bulletin .
Responding to Hurricane Katrina , Washington exempted charitable contributions between Aug. 27 , 2005 , and Jan. 1 , 2006 , from the overall limit on itemized tax deductions and the 50 % of adjusted gross income limit for such giving .
The one - time change was n't limited to hurricane - related contributions .
" There was no excuse for not restricting it to the affected area , " said Joann Weiner , a former Treasury Department employee who analyzed the changes in her current job as a contributing editor at Tax Analysts , a non-profit publisher of tax information and data .
Under the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004 , Washington also allowed taxpayers to eliminate up to 100 % of their alternative minimum tax liability by using credits for any foreign taxes paid .
Before tax year 2005 , those credits could only eliminate 90 % of federal income taxes .
High - income earners — guided by accountants and tax advisers — reacted swiftly to the change , which remains in effect .
In 2004 , IRS data show they reported $ 16.6 million in foreign tax credits .
The following year , the total credits claimed soared to $ 447.3 million .
" You can make the case for this on the merits :
You 've paid taxes on the income once , why should you have to pay it again ? "
Gleckman said .
He and other tax specialists said they were unsure whether the no-taxes - paid trend is likely to accelerate .
But they offered greater assurance that federal officials anticipated the likely outcome of the tax law changes .
" My sense of it is that the people who introduce these provisions know exactly who is going to benefit , " Gleckman said .

The Real Story of ' Curveball ' How German Intelligence Helped Justify the US Invasion of Iraq
Five years ago , the US government presented what it said was proof that Iraq harbored biological weapons .
The information came from a source developed by German intelligence -- and it turned out to be disastrously wrong .
But to this day , Germany denies any responsibility .

A prominent genetics institute recently sequenced its trillionth base pair of DNA , highlighting just how fast genome sequencing technology has improved this century .
Every two minutes , the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute sequences as many base pairs as all researchers worldwide did from 1982 to 1987 , the first five years of international genome - sequencing efforts .
That speed is thanks to the technology underlying genomics research , which has been improving exponentially every couple of years , similar to the way computer tech improves under Moore 's Law .
" Up to 2006 , the various cycles of new technology and introduction were cutting costs in half for a similar product every 22 months , " said
Adam Felsenfeld , a program director at the National Human Genome Research Institute , which invests about as much money in DNA sequencing as the Sanger Institute .
Progress in DNA sequencing has been as breathtaking as any technological change in the IT realm .
The Human Genome Project was estimated to cost $ 3 billion – to sequence a single genome – when it began in 1990 , but cost reductions during the decade - long effort drove its actual cost closer to $ 300 million .
By the end of the project , researchers estimated that if they were starting again , they could have sequenced the genome for less than $ 50 million .
By 2006 , Harvard 's George Church estimated that his lab could sequence a genome for $ 2.2 million .
In 2007 , the sequencing of James Watson 's genome was said to cost less than $ 1
million .
Looking into the future , the NIH wants genomes to cost a mere
$ 100,000 by 2009 , and $ 1,000 five years later .
With dropping costs and increasing speed , a flood of genetic data is flowing out of international institutes across the world .
Previous progress was measured in gigabases ( billions of DNA base pairs ) , but now major research centers are stepping up to the terabase level ( trillions of bp , as they are abbreviated ) .
( Human genomes contain about 3 gigabases . )
" We 're going to go from raw production of 150 gigabases per year to something between two - and - a - half to five terabases in 2008 and double that in 2009 , " said Felsenfeld .
" If things behave like they have in the past , we might be on a Moore 's Law - like curve again . "
Given the rate of change , it 's worth asking :
How did this happen ?
And , more importantly , will costs continue dropping as fast as they have ?
Phase One : Manual Labor
Early DNA sequencing efforts were a labor - intensive and slow effort .
Humans had to do almost everything to turn the building blocks of DNA – thymine , adenine , guanine and cytosine – into data .
Strands of DNA were replicated over and over , and then sliced with specialized enzymes into different lengths using the chain - termination method developed by Frederick Sanger , and variations on it that followed .
Long DNA strands were cut into smaller ones , separated by length in a gel with lanes , and then imaged .
Molecule by molecule , the DNA code appeared .
But human involvement meant that this kind of sequencing was inevitably slow .
Machines can do this sort of work faster than humans , so biologists began the long engineering task of automating what they did every day with pipettes and their bare hands .
Phase Two : Automation
First , researchers automated the reading of the T's , G's , C's and A's .
Then , a better separation system , called capillary electrophoresis , began to take hold in the major research centers .
With this system , DNA is sorted inside tubes the width of a human hair instead of within grooves carved into a gel .
That allowed the automation of the DNA loading system , leading to more throughput increases and higher speeds .
Those were the technologies available until about 2006 .
The major research centers optimized these machines and processes and brought the cost of sequencing a base pair down to about 30 cents for 1000 base pairs .
That drop in cost was significant , but it was n't enough .
With 3 billion base pairs in a human genome , and the necessity of redudancy in the process , sequencing an individual 's particular genome was still a multimillion - dollar dream .
Phase Three : Next - Generation Sequencers
So - called next - generation sequencers from ABI , Illumina , and 454 are now pushing the cost curve down yet again .
Jeff Schloss , program director at NHGRI in charge of technology , noted that the new technologies allow for a far greater number of samples in every run .
Previous technologies allowed a maximum of a few hundred samples while the new technologies allow up to a million samples per run .
These new sequencers do n't use the old chain - termination paradigm .
Instead , 454's technology , for example , binds DNA to small beads , which are dropped into tiny wells in a fiber optic chip .
In that state , the DNA is essentially waiting to add another molecule to its chain .
When that happens , the sequencer picks up which wells used a T or G molecule , indicating which base is next in the sequence .
This technique is called sequencing - by - synthesis .
While this process allows for high - throughput sequencing , it does come with the downside that it generates only tiny fragments of DNA data – just a few hundred base pairs long .
Given that even tiny genomes include millions of base pairs , assembling those little bits into a complete genome is a major task .
That assembly work falls to computers , specifically computers running bioinformatics software to assemble DNA sequences into genomes .
Right now , to complete a single genome , the same DNA needs to be run through a sequencer like 454's dozens of times before there 's enough information to puzzle out the right relationships between short sequences .
Still , the NHGRI researchers we spoke with were confident that the next several years would yield major increases in speed and reductions in cost with the current technology .
" We have grantees that are working on systems that can increase the throughput of machines like those produced by 454 or ABI and potentially bring genomes down to ten thousand dollars , " Schlossen said .
" But they are really interesting tweaks to them . "
Phase Four : The Next Generation
The next generation of technologies could come from a new set of companies like Pacific Biosciences and Helicos .
The latter company 's technology , Schloss said , promises to deliver very long sequences of base pairs , perhaps up to 100,000 bp .
That would allow scientists to spot new types of patterns as well as make assembling genomes much easier .
Schloss expects that technology to become viable within five years .
What 's clear is that the DNA sequencing technology pipeline is deep and ready to deliver innovation and reduced cost for years to come .
Within the next decade , nanopores , tiny holes about 1.2 nanometers across , combined with new microscopy techniques , could even allow scientists to " read " individual DNA bases as easily as we read the letters A , C , T , G .
" The ultimate goal would be to use electronic sequencing , " Schlossen said .
" You 'd take genomic DNA , thread it through the pore , and get an electronic readout . "

A New Admixture Model for Inference of Population Structure in Light of Both Genetic Admixing and Allele Mutations
A New Admixture Model for Inference of Population Structure in ...
SAN FRANCISCO , Sept. 28 — Since the iPhone hit the market in June , tech - savvy owners of the phone have been busy messing with its insides , figuring out how to add unauthorized software and even “ unlock ” it for use on networks other than AT&T’s .
But the Web was filled Friday with complaints from people who had installed the latest iPhone software update , only to see all the fun little programs they had been adding to their iPhones disappear — or , still worse , see their phones freeze up entirely .
Should they have known better ?
Since Monday , Apple officials have been warning iPhone owners that using unlocking software could cause the phone to become “ permanently inoperable when a future Apple - supplied iPhone software update is installed . ”
But in many cases those warnings went unheeded .
People who had unlocked their phones to use them with another carrier ran the greatest risk of , in techie terms , having them “ bricked ” — rendered about as useful as a brick .
Most of those who committed the lesser transgression of installing programs not authorized by Apple simply had those programs wiped out .
Back when we started writing on this site , I mentioned that it was the time to take vacations that would likely soon become too expensive .
In keeping with that , this summer we are taking , what will probably be our last holiday where we drive , in part , just to see the countryside .
And so , on Friday , this brought us to the Arts and Crafts Show in Frankfort , KY .
It was some 93 degrees , and thus attendance was a bit sparse , but I suspect that there are more reasons than that for the reducing popularity that these shows face , both from vendors and customers , and that their viability will slowly fade in the face of high oil prices .
( clicking map will take it to full size ... )
One of the stalls , for example , was run by a lady from Alabama , and she talked about going to a show in Springfield , MO as the range of her “ territory . ”
But when one considers the distance , and the need for some accommodation it is already becoming difficult for her to justify the expense for the longer trips , in light of size of the potential income she anticipates .
The wife of a colleague of mine , who had been working the same “ circuit ” has , in fact , recently stopped since it is no longer profitable .
Their hope is that they can still get business , but working instead through the internet .
Which led to another conversation with a nearby stall holder , who had also just set up a web site , selling jewelry .
He mentioned that this was becoming much more of a source of income , but also commented on something that I had not thought of .
For much of my professional life I have bought items that I need through salesmen and local offices .
But now I purchase more through the internet .
The vendor was commenting that this holds true for many businesses , but that in doing so this cuts out the role of the salesman , who concurrently loses the commission that would otherwise have come with getting the order .
I am not sure this is totally a good thing , since in the past the visit of a salesman brought up new technology I was n’t aware of , and I suspect that if I looked at the records I would find I bought more than I do now , to stay current and extend our capabilities .
Well , after a quick trip through the State Capitol it was time to get back on the road , and into the 2 - hour traffic mess that is the current intersection of highways 64 and 75 outside of Lexington .
So much for making good mileage , as we slowly wormed our way up the 5 - odd miles of stop and go traffic caused by a highway resurfacing project .
And speaking of things that will become more costly , and thus less common , Leanan noted in Drumbeat that the cost of asphalt is rising with the price of oil , and that Highway Departments are already having to trim severely the amount of repairs that they can afford each year .
Larimer County , Colo. , would like to resurface 16 - 20 miles of its 450 miles of paved road each year .
" This year , we 'll be lucky to do seven miles , " says road and bridge director Dale Miller .
Paul Degges , chief engineer for the Tennessee Department of Transportation , will resurface 1,600 miles of state highway this year , well short of his 2,500 - mile target .
" Since my budget is not growing and costs are up , we 're doing less paving , " he says .
Unfortunately the rate of road disintegration is not similarly stalled and so , without a series of those election - winning tax increases ( grin ) , this is going to become a spiraling problem of the next decade .
In regard to the traffic control through the construction , the Actress did wonder why the local highway department had n’t adopted something similar to the controlled speed system ( pdf ) that the British had put in on the M25 .
Controlled motorways prevent bunching and flow breakdown and , thus , increase safety and throughput .
A controlled motorway system has been operating of the M25 .
Its purpose is to smooth traffic flow by imposing a mandatory speed limit , which is varied automatically in response to flow conditions .
Following the successful trials on the M25 further extensions to the system will take place .
Since a significant part of the problem comes with stopping and starting large trucks , keeping the traffic moving at a slow rate would help overcome the problem ( as was discussed in comments the other day ) .
It has also received Automobile Association approval I had to explain that Highway Engineers tend to be some of the more conservative of the Engineering Bretheren .
And so we moved on , visiting two more State Capitols in the following two days and then coming to a short rest for a couple of days in Raleigh , NC .
And here the conversation turned to the change in education that is starting to occur .
It was interesting to note the number of entries , in an Art Exhibition at the State Museum , that had been submitted by home - schooled children .
The advent of the internet would seem to make this choice a more palatable one , in terms of the availability of materials , and in much the same way as oil price encourages working at home , perhaps , particularly in rural communities , where transportation is already expensive , home education way well increase in popularity .
The nature of education is in itself changing , as the internet makes the classroom a far distant place from the little red schoolhouse , but some other older habits may return .
My mother , for example , was raised in a small village in Scotland , and boarded over the week in a larger town , in order to get a better education in her more senior school years .
In that same period of my own life I also went to a boarding school ( traveling in a train not that dissimilar to the one seen in the Harry Potter movies – though not a dedicated train , rather that those were the carriages of the normal British Rail of the period ) .
One wonders if the increasing costs may strengthen the appeal of such schools .
I suspect it may not , although in this case the school has been around since 11xx and boarding students since at least the middle of the 13th Century .
Yet it is also having to adapt to the changing demands of both student expectation and the more widespread involvement of students outside the schoolroom , that is increasingly part of education , but which also relies on inexpensive transportation as a facilitator .
But one of the reasons for the long success of the school has partially been the same reason that induced my grandparents to send my Mother to board .
There was an exhibit in the North Carolina Historical Museum in Raleigh that noted how liberating the car had been for rural America , a point I have heard emphasized by other historians .
The presence of good roads ( requiring asphalt ) and the power and speed that cars brought in moving goods and people ( based on oil ) opened the horizons and markets for the farming communities in ways that is hard for those of us today to understand .
It is why some form of similar transport is still going to vital to the community at large .
And so it is that I think that I do n’t think that Kiashu understands the rural economy .
His piece , sensibly saying that , instead of Hypermiling we should stop driving , fails to understand the imperative in the rural community of the car .
In many places in the United States , and I suspect in other rural parts of countries such as Canada and Australia , the population density will make it harder and more costly to provide public transport for the low numbers of folk out there .
At the same time they will continue to need the services of the community in the villages and small towns and thus will increasingly be forced to drive .
It was , after all , the uneconomic aspects of serving the rural community that caused Dr. Beeching to close almost a third of British Railways largely through reducing that service in the 1960’s .
As the costs of rural service go up it is more likely that communities will continue to prune the public services that they provide to areas of lower public density , and then for those who live outside the urban conurbation there will be no choice but to increasingly rely on cars and trucks .

OMAHA �( CNNMoney.com ) --
In the Q&A session Saturday morning at Berkshire Hathaway 's annual meeting , CEO Warren Buffett and vice chairman Charlie Munger repeatedly warned investors to lower their expectations .
When a shareholder asked whether Buffett 's recent purchases of publicly traded stocks were likely to generate returns greater than 7 % to 10 % over time , Buffett promptly said no .
Note :
What follows is based on a best - effort attempt to take accurate notes of a fast - moving discussion and does not purport to be an exact transcript of Buffett and Munger 's remarks .
" We would be very happy if we earned 10 % , pre-tax " on the additions to Berkshire 's equity portfolio , said Buffett .
" Anyone that expects us to come close to replicating the past should sell their stock ; it is n't going to happen .
We 'll get decent results over time , but not indecent results . "
Added Munger : " You can take what Warren said to the bank .
We are very happy at making money at a rate in the future that 's much less than the past ... and I suggest that you adopt the same attitude . "
" We think Berkshire is an attractive investment [ at today 's price ] , " said Buffett .
" We do n't think it 's the most attractive in the world . "
Both men made it clear that their preference now is to acquire 100 % ownership of private businesses at a " fair " price and to increase BRK 's interest in companies that get substantial portions of their earnings in non-U.S. currencies .
" We are happy to invest in businesses that earn their money in euros in France or Italy or sterling in the UK , because I do n't have a feeling that those currencies are likely to depreciate against the dollar , " said Buffett .
" Overall I think that the U.S. continues to follow policies that will make the dollar weaken against other major currencies ....
I feel no need to hedge purchases of companies that earn profits in other currencies . "
Buffett added that major U.S. multinationals , like Coca - Cola ( KO , Fortune 500 ) , are a natural hedge against the dollar , since they earn most of their profits offshore -- which , he said , " will be a net plus over time . "
Asked what 's in store for the economy , Buffett said he does n't have a clue and does n't care .
" I have n't the faintest idea , " he said .
" We never talk about it , it never comes up in our board meetings or other discussions .
We 're not in that business [ of economic forecasting ] , we do n't know how to be in that business .
If we knew where the economy was going , we 'd do nothing but play the S&P futures market . "
His simple point :
As an investor , you do n't need to predict the economic cycle ( or even pay much attention to it ) .
Instead , you should focus on evaluating individual businesses if you pick your own stocks -- or , simply buy the entire market in the form of an index fund .
When a shareholder asked for the single best specific investment idea Buffett could recommend to an individual in his 30s , Buffett said : " I would just have it all in a very low - cost index fund from a reputable firm , maybe Vanguard .
Unless
I bought during a strong bull market , I would feel confident that I would outperform ... and I could just go back and get on with my work . "
In response to a similar question from an investor asking how Berkshire ( BRKA , Fortune 500 ) would invest differently if it had only a few million dollars to put to work , Buffett advised him to think small .
" That would open up thousands of opportunities , " said Buffett .
Earlier this year there were " very mispriced bonds " that " we could buy nowhere near enough of to make a difference to Berkshire , " but a smaller investor could have exploited .
" Most of the opportunities would probably be in small stocks or in specialized bond situations . "
On succession
Asked about succession , Buffett ( who is 77 ) and Munger ( who is 84 ) had this to say :
" On the CEO front , we have three [ internal candidates ] who could step in , " said Buffett .
" The board is unanimous in knowing which one it would be , although the answer might change with time ....
In terms of the [ chief ] investment officer , the board has four names , any one or all of whom would be good at my job .
They all are happy where they are now [ working outside of Berkshire ] , but any would be here tomorrow if I died tonight , they all are reasonably young , and compensation would not be a big factor ....
There will be no gap after my death in terms of having someone manage the money .
They 'll be much more energetic [ than I am ] and may even have a better record . "
Added Munger : " We still have a rising young man here named Warren Buffett .
And I think we want to encourage this rising young man to reach his full potential . "
At this point , Buffett interjected : " At the average age of 80 , we 're aging at the average rate of only 1 1/4 % per year .
That 's a lot better than younger people . "
From the Cubs , to China
Later , asked by a teen shareholder whether he is interested in buying the Chicago Cubs ( currently on sale by the Tribune Co. for roughly $ 700 million ) , Buffett said he did not need the " psychic income " and would not swing at the offer .
Asked whether Berkshire will seek to purchase entire private companies based in China or India , Buffett responded : " We would like to .
If we get lucky , we 'll buy one or two in the next three or four years .
I do n't know if it will be in China , India , Germany , the U.K. or Japan -- there 's a lot of luck in that in terms of families thinking of us specifically ....
But you will see the day that BRK owns businesses in both countries [ India and China ] . "
Despite its huge cash hoard , Berkshire wo n't be paying a dividend anytime soon .
" The test , " said Buffett , " is whether you can continue to create more than $ 1 for every $ 1 you 're retaining . "
He and Munger feel they still can put surplus cash to work and earn a higher return with it than shareholders could on their own , after tax , if BRK paid it out .
" If we can turn $ 1 in dividends into $ 1.10 or $ 1.20 on a present - value basis , they 're better off if we do n't pay out .
When the day comes , it should be paid out .
But because we still have this ability to redistribute money in a tax - efficient way within the company , we can reallocate it , " he said , where it will earn a higher return than shareholders may be able to on their own . "
A Quebec court has issued a permanent injunction against Quebec Torrent .
ADISQ and AFTPQ , the two Quebec associations that filed suit against the torrent tracker site , report that the Superior Court ordered the site to shut down the section of the site that permitted unauthorized sharing of music , movies , and other copyrighted works .
The site now features a shutdown notice that says that the court ordered :

As China 's stock market completes an eight - day slide , even a muted new margin - lending initiative to deliver a pre-Olympic boost will struggle to turn the tide in the week ahead .
Inflation is now the gorilla in the room for investors .
Conventional thinking has said that the subprime crisis was a made - in - America problem and that Asia was the safe haven or even the new institutional " core holding . "
As the City in London slashes jobs , new funds in Hong Kong have opened to target markets , consumers and corporates who are debt - light and seemingly far removed from any housing meltdown .
But have the U.S. Federal Reserve 's interest rate cuts blown open the decoupling scenario ?
It 's now becoming increasingly apparent that the Fed 's rate - cut medicine has been a particularly toxic tonic for China and many other Asian economies , as they are hammered by the worsening inflationary side - effects .
And it looks as if these less developed economies and less sophisticated corporations are also not as well positioned to manage profits in such an environment .
Last year , China was viewed as the driver behind rising commodities prices .
But blame for the renewed surge in soft commodities and oil is increasingly being laid at the door of Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke for taking the fed funds rate to 2 % and unleashing a wave of surplus liquidity looking for a new home .
The fallout is now being seen .
Countries such as India , China , the Philippines and Indonesia are hiking their own interest rates to rein in rising prices , and others may follow suit .
Vietnam 's ridiculous 25 % inflation has served as reminder that emerging market risk is still very much alive .
With this type of price spiral , the economy struggles to function normally and even the maligned U.S. dollar is starting to rally against the local currency , the dong .
In China , consumer prices increased only 7.7 % last month , down from 8.5 % in April , but understandably the market is not impressed .
With producer prices still rising 8.2 % in May , including some hefty increases like coal doubling in price since the beginning of the year , further jumps look to be in the pipeline .
Analysts point to an inevitable fuel price reckoning in China which may exacerbate inflation due to various unsustainable price controls and subsidies .
HSBC estimates that if oil prices average $ 120 a barrel this year , the effective subsidy paid by China to maintain lower domestic prices could reach $ 27 billion , or 4 % of the annual budget .
And without true prices being felt , the incentive to conserve to reduce demand is lost .
Another phenomenon being linked directly back to the Fed policy is how rate cuts led to a surge in hot money flows into China seeking the deposit yield advantage , as well as speculation on the yuan .
Recent reports say China 's huge foreign exchange reserves grew by a record $ 74.5 billion in April , partly fuelled by huge inflows of speculative capital which add to the liquidity in the financial system .
While China has capital controls , they do not look to be working .
And even if quotas on bank loans are in place , expectations are that money is ending up getting lent in the grey or informal banking system .
Notably , China 's M2 money supply measure grew 18.1 % last month , much faster than expected , and up from 16.9 % in April , according to the central bank .
These funds are clearly not flowing into A shares , as the market has now broken below the key 3,000 points level -- down 37 % this year .
It 's now become apparent that deteriorating fundamentals justify the correction .
J. P. Morgan says a mix of rising inflation and slowing export markets has put a squeeze on corporate profitability .
In the first quarter , the external slowdown , rising inflation and raw material costs saw pre-tax profit growth for domestically - listed companies drop to 17.4 % on year , from 49.4 % in 2007 .
Companies like insurers whose earnings depend on equity gains face an additional earnings drain .
It could be shaping up for a painful summer for equities until we see signs prices are stabilizing .
Any changes in monetary policy or price regulation are likely to be watched closely near term .
Maybe it would help if the world 's preeminent central bank joined the inflation fight or considered the global impact next time it moves to prop up an investment bank .
For now it seems all equity markets must face the inflation menace together .
Allergic diseases appear more often in children who grow up near busy roads according to a new study involving several thousand children .
Under the direction of the Helmholtz Zentrum München , a German research group studied in a longitudinal study , over six years , whether associations are identifiable between the onset of atopic diseases and exposure to air pollutants originating from traffic .
The scientists based their analysis , on the one hand , on the corresponding distance of the parental home to streets busy with traffic , and on the other hand , modeled values , for the respective residencial addresses of the children , of air pollution with fine dust , diesel soot and nitrogen dioxide .
The research team led by Dr. Joachim Heinrich of the Institute of Epidemiology of the Helmholtz Zentrum München compared , with this , the data of 3,061 six - year old children from Munich and its surroundings .
From birth , their development has been tracked within the scope of the so - called GINI and LISA studies .
The studies are led by Prof. Dr. H. - Erich Wichmann of the Helmholtz Zentrum München , and , among other things , are aimed at the study of behavioral and environmental risk factors for allergic diseases .
In the current analysis , the results of medical research and regular parental interviews were considered .
Moreover , the appearance of the specific IgE antibodies against common allergens in blood serum was tested in children at the age of 6 .
The scientists were able to estimate individual values of exposure of children to fine dust and nitrogen dioxide , with the help of calculation models .
It was shown that an escalation of asthmatic bronchitis and allergic sensitization to pollen and other common allergens occurred with increasing exposure to fine dust .
Increased exposure to nitric oxide was linked to increases in eczema .
Connections were noted , in particular , between the appearance of asthmatic bronchitis , hay fever , eczema and allergic sensitization , on the one hand , and residential environment , on the other : compared with their contemporaries living in more distant places , children who lived less than 50 m from a very busy main road were between 1 % and 50 % more likely to contract these diseases .
Statistical analysis of the data showed a lower risk with increasing distances to the main roads .
Joachim Heinrich and his colleagues consider the results of their research to be clear evidence of the disadvantageous effects of air pollution from traffic on the causes of allergies and atopic diseases .
In the past , epidemiological studies on this subject failed to supply a clear picture , although the effects of laboratory experiments and inhalation studies are well - known .
Bunches of air balloons bearing the image of Barrack Obama have been pinned to the lampposts along the June 17 boulevard .
The lawn in the neighboring Tiergarten park has been freshly mowed , and two giant video screens have been set up to give latecomers a chance to catch a glimpse of the political superstar .
" It was not an easy task to match our security concerns with Obama 's wish for an open event where people can enjoy freedom of movement , " said Berlin police spokesman Bernhard Schodrowski .
Therefore , maximum security precautions are only taken within a circle of 250 meters ( 820 feet ) around the Victory Column – the venue of Barack Obama 's speech .
This area is fenced off and people are not allowed to carry large bags and posters .
Change –
Yes he can
Police advised that spectators seeking to get close to the Democratic senator had to arrive at least three hours early .
Yet , while waiting they can indulge in pizza , bratwurst and beverages in one of the two dozen fast - food stalls lining the two - mile long boulevard .
There are also life performances of German pop band Reamonn and Reggea singer Patrice .
" Obama stands for a new era in politics , " he said .
" He is someone who can change the world . "
Stefan Schiller , a Berliner who watched the senator 's motorcade drive by on this Thursday morning , hopes that Barrack Obama is able to put German - American relations on a better footing .
His wife , Doris , agreed .
" It was really sad to see how President Bush has fueled anti-American sentiments with his policy , " she said .
" We have so much to thank Americans for in this city . "
Berlin – a city that matters for US policy
Barrack Obama 's speech in Berlin is the only public address during his current tour of European countries .
Observers say no other place on the continent has greater significance for American policy in Europe .
It was here where the United States and its World War Two allies defeated Adolf Hitler 's Nazi regime , and where allied airplanes led by the United States rescued millions of Berliners from starvation during the Cold War Soviet blockade in 1948 .
In the Footsteps of JFK
Will Obama capture Berliners like JFK ?
Germany 's leading mass circulation Bild newspaper last week already compared Obama 's Berlin trip to a visit made by late US president John F. Kennedy in 1963 .
At the time JFK plunged the city into a similar frenzy by proclaiming " Ich bin ein Berliner " or " I'm a Berliner . "
He made this statement to assure Berliner 's of America 's unflinching support after communist East Berlin had built the Berlin Wall shortly before .
John Kornblum , a former United States ambassador to Germany , warned the Democrat senator against using the German language for rhetoric stunts .
" I strongly advice him not to even try and do that , " Kornblum said on Thursday on German television .
" It 's too difficult to find the right message in our times .
After all , Berlin is no longer a beleaguered city . "
Germany 's Favorite
Some 67 percent of Germans want Barrack Obama to become the next US president , a recent opinion poll said .
They say he represents change both in transatlantic relations and in world politics .
A majority of Germans could even fancy him being chancellor of Germany .
Robert Powell , an American who lives in Berlin said Obama had qualities that made it easier for him to get along with foreigners .
" He spent parts of his childhood in Indonesia , and there he has learned to adapt to people with different backgrounds , " he said .
GAZA CITY , Gaza ( CNN ) --
A truce between Israel and Gaza 's Hamas leaders will take effect Thursday and last for six months , Hamas officials said Tuesday .
Palestinian Hamas security men stand to attention at a training academy in Gaza City last week .
Israeli officials , however , stopped short of confirming that a cease - fire agreement has been reached .
" It 's still early to announce an agreement of calm , " Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said in a statement .
" When it starts , if it starts , it 's hard to say how long it will last .
The test will be how it 's implemented . "
Hamas senior official Mahmoud Zahar and Hamas negotiator Khalil al - Hayya announced the Egyptian - brokered agreement at a news conference in Gaza .
They said it will begin at 6 a.m. Thursday ( 11 p.m. Wednesday ET ) .
On Sunday , Israel gradually will start to open its border crossing terminals , the Hamas officials said .
Asked about initial reports of a cease - fire , one Israeli official would not confirm whether an agreement had been finalized but said any truce would involve a sequential process .
Watch what truce may mean in Gaza »
The official said Israel would reopen some of its terminals along the Gaza border after calm had been established .
He said Israel is still calling for the release of Cpl. Gilad Shalit as part of a broader cease - fire .
Gaza militants kidnapped Shalit in June 2006 .
Egypt has been trying to broker a truce between Hamas and Israel for months .
Militants in Hamas - controlled Gaza have pummeled Israel with thousands of rocket and mortar attacks , prompting Israeli military operations in the Palestinian territory .
Referring to the Egyptian mediation efforts , Barak said , " It 's important to exhaust the possibility .
" The IDF [ Israel Defense Forces ] is prepared for any developments , but it is important to attempt to achieve a period of calm to bring back the peace and quiet for the [ Israeli ] people who live around Gaza in Sderot and Ashkelon and to try and renew negotiations for the release of Gilad Shalit . "
Militants in Gaza have launched more than 2,300 mortars and rockets since the start of 2008 , more than the 2,000 launched in all of last year , according to Israeli military figures .
While most of the attacks do not result in casualties , three Israelis have been killed in rocket and mortar strikes in recent weeks .
The Israeli military responds to the attacks by carrying out airstrikes and ground operations in Gaza that target militants , but many times lead to civilian casualties -- further inflaming the Palestinian leadership .
Israel also has restricted supplies of gasoline , diesel and electricity to Gaza , limited the amount of food and other goods entering the strip and made it virtually impossible for manufacturers and farmers in Gaza to export anything to the outside world .
Hamas seized control of Gaza last year after routing Palestinian security agencies under the control of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah movement .
The ouster forced Abbas to dissolve the Fatah - Hamas unity government , but Fatah still controls the West Bank .
Representatives from the rival factions met recently in Senegal for talks aimed at restoring the political and territorial split .
Earlier this month , Abbas called for " national unity " talks with Hamas with the goal of producing new elections for the Palestinians , who elected a Hamas - led Palestinian Authority government in a U.S. - backed vote in 2006 .
Meanwhile , Abbas ' Western - backed government is working toward a peace agreement with Israel .
The Bush administration has said it wants the two sides to reach an agreement by the end of the year .
CNN 's Shira Medding contributed to this report .

Introducing Europe 's Weird Ways Phallus Fights and other Strange Traditions
Hanging from the neck of a live goose .

Europeans do all of this and more .
SPIEGEL ONLINE 's new series brings you up to date on the ins and outs of Europe 's Weird Ways .
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - When Sarah Roisman was 11 years old , her doctors prescribed Klonopin , a muscle relaxant , for a psychiatric disorder that caused her to have seizures .
She liked how the drug made her feel .
Her seizures went away .

The issue of prescription drug abuse shot to prominence with January 's death of 28 - year - old Hollywood actor Heath Ledger after he took six different prescriptions .

But that ’s where her trouble with addiction began .
By age 14 , the teen from an upper middle - class Philadelphia suburb led a dangerous double life .
Editor of her school paper , strong student and popular athlete , Roisman was also hooked on painkillers and other drugs in an addiction that illustrates the rapid expansion in prescription drug abuse in America .
“ My friends and I would take a bunch of different pills and break them up and put them all together and call it confetti .
It could be any combination of anything .
We could learn from it , and continue to take it , ” said Roisman , who is now 17 .
The issue of prescription drug abuse shot to prominence with January ’s death of 28 - year - old Hollywood actor Heath Ledger after he took six different prescriptions .
The death of Ledger , who plays the Joker in the new Batman film “ The Dark Night , ” adds to a growing list of prescription drug overdoses that includes Playboy model Anna Nicole Smith in 2007 .
Other deaths are less celebrated .
In the 45 - 54 age group , overdose deaths fueled by prescription drugs now surpass motor vehicle deaths as the nation ’s No. 1 cause of accidental death , federal data show .
The federal data also show nearly 7 million Americans abused prescription drugs in 2007 -- more than cocaine , heroin , hallucinogens , Ecstasy and inhalants such as marijuana combined .
The figure is up 80 percent since 2000 .
Definitions of abuse vary but refer typically to nonmedical use of prescription drugs .
The number of Americans treated for abuse of painkillers surged 321 percent from 1995 to 2005 , federal statistics show -- a trend some health experts link to another stunning figure : the 180 million prescriptions dispensed legally by U.S. pharmacies each year for pain medication .
In Florida , whose reputation for cocaine and other hard drugs was burnished in movies such as “ Scarface ” and “ Miami Vice , ” the rate of deaths caused by prescription drugs was three times the rate of death caused by all illicit drugs combined , according to an analysis of 2007 autopsies by the Florida Medical Examiners Commission released in June .
‘ LOW SOCIAL DISAPPROVAL ’
“ What you have among over the counter and prescription drug use is a very low perception of risk , ” said Stephen Pasierb , president and chief executive of the Partnership for a Drug - Free America , a nonprofit advocacy group .
“ There ’s very low social disapproval .
In fact , there are parents who almost relieved that their kid is using Vicodin and not smoking marijuana , ” he said .
Len Paulozzi , an epidemiologist with the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control , testified recently in Congress that he believed physicians were improperly trained in the long - term dangers of therapy involving opioid painkillers , or drugs containing opium .
“ There are guidelines out there , but we do n’t think that they ’re being routinely followed , ” he said .
Sen. Joseph Biden , a Democrat from Delaware , proposed to make August 2008 “ National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month ” in a resolution now before the Senate Judiciary Committee , saying the Internet had become “ an information superhighway ” for abuse of medicine in the United States .
But containing the abuse is notoriously difficult .
Thirty - eight states have passed legislation for prescription drug monitoring programs to trace the source of drugs , and police in some states have had success in reducing pharmacy break - ins .
A University of Maine program provides pre-addressed , postage - paid pouches to the elderly so they can mail their surplus prescription drugs to state authorities for disposal in a bid to reduce the amount that get into the wrong hands .
None of the measures has stopped the growth nationwide , and experts point to several stubborn problems , including the phenomenon of “ doctor shopping , ” in which patients go to multiple doctors to get several prescriptions .
Hundreds of online pharmacies also offer drugs that include generic versions of opiates like Purdue Pharma ’s OxyContin , methadone and Abbott Laboratories Inc ’s Vicodin , which are legitimately prescribed as painkillers , along with stimulants like Ritalin made by Novartis , and benzodiazepines like Pfizer ’s Xanax .
It is as easy in the United States to buy opiates or other abusable prescription drugs online as it is to purchase a book , said David Festinger , a scientist who has studied online drug sales at the Treatment Research Institute at the University of Pennsylvania .
Regulating such trade is tough , he said .
“ These Internet enterprises set up a bank account in one country , buy their drugs from another country , and do their merchandising and sales from another country , ” he said .
“ Everything is spread all over the globe .
And in an instant , if anybody ’s on their tail , they can switch everything around . ”
RAIDING MEDICINE CABINETS
For many children , getting the drugs is simple .
In Philadelphia , Roisman and her friends raided family medicine cabinets for the big prizes -- OxyContin , a kind of synthetic morphine also known as “ hillbilly heroin , ” along with Ritalin and Vicodin -- until she eventually passed out one day in school .
A drug test showed she had seven drugs in her system .
“ People think that it ’s OK because it ’s a prescribed pill .
It comes from a credible source .
Even if a doctor has not told you it ’s OK , they ’ve told someone else it ’s OK , ” said Roisman , who became sober two years ago after treatment at a rehab center run by the nonprofit Caron organization .
She blames doctors for failing to “ watch what they are prescribing ” and parents for failing to understand “ just how hard people will work to get what they want when they are an addict , ” adding many teens use the drugs to help study .
On college campuses , popping Adderall , Ritalin and other prescribed amphetamine - like psychostimulant drugs is a popular way to help cram for tests and cope with academic pressure .
Some are legitimately prescribed for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder , helping sufferers increase alertness , attention and energy .
But many use it without prescriptions .
Almost 60 percent of students have been offered an opportunity to try prescription stimulants by their junior ( third ) year of college in the United States , said Amelia Arria , a senior researcher at the University of Maryland ’s Center for Drug Abuse Research , which surveyed 1,253 students on drug usage .
Health insurers are also feeling the effects .
Some face mounting pressure to expand coverage to include substance - abuse disorders .
Others are grappling with swindlers who obtain illicit prescription narcotics through fraudulent insurance claims for bogus prescriptions , treating phantom injuries .
Such fraud costs health insurers up to $ 72.5 billion a year , according to a 2008 report by the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud , an advocacy group based in Washington .
Growing parade of conservatives backing Obama Nick Juliano
Published : Monday July 7 , 2008

An increasing number of disaffected Republicans fed up with what they see as President Bush 's broken promises and unimpressed with John McCain say they may be switching teams in November to vote for Democratic candidate Barack Obama .
Among the reformed righties now hoping for an Obama victory are free - market economist David Friedman , former Reagan aide Douglas Kmiec , Contract With America co-author Larry Hunter and Susan Eisenhower , granddaughter of the former president .
Bush 's " view of the legitimate power of the executive branch , including the authority to deliberately violate federal law , I find frightening , " Friedman , son of Nobel Prize - winning economist Milton Friedman tells the San Francisco Chronicle .
" Perhaps , if we are lucky , Obama will turn out to be the anti-Bush . "
" The untold story of the Bush administration is the deliberate annihilation of the Reaganite , small - government wing of the Republican Party , " said Michael Greve , director of the Federalism Project at the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative think tank .
" A lot of people are very bitter about it . "
Many conservatives and their brethren , the free - market , socially liberal libertarians , are deeply skeptical of Obama 's rhetorical flirtations with free - market ideas and view his policies as orthodox liberalism .
Yet one measure of their rupture with the GOP is their open disregard for Republican nominee John McCain and their now almost - wistful view of a president the Republicans tried to impeach .
" When he leaves the room , everybody thinks he just agreed with them , " Greve said of Obama .
" We do n't know if you 're really buying a pig in a poke here .
It could be the second coming of the Clinton administration .
If people have any confidence in that , I think a whole lot of conservatives would vote for him . "
Since emerging as winner of the Democratic primaries , Obama 's rhetoric has emphasized some of his positions that may be more attractive to disaffected Republicans , such as his support for some faith - based social programs , while his positions on the war and limitations of executive power make him a better choice than McCain for some libertarians .
" I do know libertarians who think Obama is the Antichrist , that he 's farther left than John Kerry , much farther left than Bill Clinton , and you 'd clearly have to be insane to vote for this guy , " David Boaz , executive vice president of the libertarian Cato Institute , tells the Chronicle .
" But there are libertarians who say , ' Oh yeah ?
Do you think Obama will increase spending by $ 1 trillion , because that 's what Republicans did over the past two presidential terms .
So really , how much worse can he be ? '
And there are certainly libertarians who think Obama will be better on the war and on foreign policy , on executive power and on surveillance than McCain . "
At the same time , Obama 's recent shifting position on a wiretapping bill has upset ardent civil liberties advocates , leaving Libertarian candidate Bob Barr to seek their votes .
Overall , though , Obama seems to be building a coalition of supporters from across the political spectrum , including conservatives ( " Obamacons " ) and Republicans ( " Obamacans " ) .
Eisenhower said his candidacy was a continuation of the ideals her grandfather cherished .
" The biggest barrier to rolling up our sleeves and preparing for a better future is our own apathy , fear or immobility .
We have been living in a zero-sum political environment where all heads have been lowered to avert being lopped off by angry , noisy extremists , " she wrote in a February essay in the Washington Post .
" I am convinced that Barack Obama is the one presidential candidate today who can encourage ordinary Americans to stand straight again ; he is a man who can salve our national wounds and both inspire and pursue genuine bipartisan cooperation .
Just as important , Obama can assure the world and Americans that this great nation 's impulses are still free , open , fair and broad - minded . "
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- U.S. banks ' direct primary credit borrowing from the Federal Reserve rose to a record high in the latest week .
Banks primary credit borrowings averaged $ 17.45 billion per day in the latest week , up from the previous record set last week of $ 16.38 billion , the Fed said on Thursday .
On the day of July 30 , banks ' primary credit borrowings inched lower to $ 17.38 billion , down from $ 17.68 billion on July 23 .
Banks ' overall discount window borrowings averaged $ 17.64 billion per day in the week ended July 23 , up from an average of $ 16.51 billion per day the week before .
Dealers borrowed $ 3 billion average per day from the Primary Dealer Credit Facility in the latest week after not borrowing at all the week before .
Seagate announced three new consumer - level hard drives today , which it claims are the " industry 's first 1.5 - terabyte desktop and half - terabyte notebook hard drives . "
The company claims that it is able to greatly increase the areal density of its drive substrates by utilizing perpendicular magnetic recording ( PMR ) technology .
Wikipedia states that PMR is " capable of delivering more than triple the storage density of traditional longitudinal recording . "
Credit : Wikipedia
Seagate 's latest desktop - class hard drive , the Barracuda 7200.11 , will be available in a 1.5TB capacity starting in August .
The 3.5 - inch drive is made up of four 375GB platters and has a 7,200 - rpm rotational speed .
It has a 3 Gb / second SATA interface , or 1.5 Gb / second using Native Command Queuing ( NCQ ) .
Seagate also claims that the new 1.5TB drive supports a sustained data rate of up to 120MB / second .
This represents a slight improvement in performance over the existing drives in Seagate 's Barracuda 7200.11 series , which have stated sustained data rates between 105 and 115MB / second -- with the 1TB Barracuda 7200.11 on the slow end of that scale at 105MB / second .
While many of the existing drives in the 7200.11 series have both 16MB and 32 MB cache versions , the 1.5TB will likely only be available with a 32 MB cache - - similar to its 1TB sibling .
Pricing has yet be announced .
For the moment , Hitachi and Western Digital 's highest - capacity desktop hard drives top out at 1TB -- the Hitachi Ultrastor AK71000 and the Western Digital Caviar Black WD1001FALS -- both of which share similar specs with the Barracuda 7200.11 series ( other than Seagate 's 1.5TB capacity , of course ) .
Seagate also announced today two new 500GB notebook hard drives , the Momentus 5400.6 and Momentus 7200.4 .
As its name implies , the 5400.6 spins at 5,400 - rpm , and it includes an 8 MB cache .
The 7200.4 spins at 7,200 - rpm and has a 16MB cache .
Both drives use 3 Gb / second SATA interfaces .
Seagate also claims that both drives are reasonably vibration - resistant and are low on power consumption :
" Both Momentus drives are built tough enough to withstand up to 1,000 Gs of non-operating shock and 350 Gs of operating shock to protect drive data , making the drives ideal for systems that are subject to rough handling or high levels of vibration .
For added robustness in mobile environments , the Momentus 5400.6 and 7200.4 are offered with G - Force Protection , a free - fall sensor technology that helps prevent drive damage and data loss upon impact if a laptop PC is dropped .
The sensor works by detecting any changes in acceleration equal to the force of gravity and parks the heads off the disc to prevent contact with the platter in a free fall of as little as 8 inches and within 3/10 ths of a second .
Seagate 's new Momentus drives are lean on power consumption , allowing notebook users to work longer between battery charges , and are virtually inaudible thanks to Seagate ’s innovative SoftSonic fluid - dynamic bearing motors and QuietStep ramp load technology . "
Banks stepped up their borrowing over the past week from the Federal Reserve 's emergency lending program , while Wall Street firms did n't draw such loans .
A Fed report released Thursday said commercial banks averaged $ 16.4 billion in daily borrowing over the past week .
That was up from $ 13.9 billion in the previous week .
Investment houses were given similar loan privileges as commercial banks after a run on Bear Stearns pushed the nation 's fifth - largest investment bank to the brink of bankruptcy .
The situation raised fears that other Wall Street firms might be in jeopardy .
Bear Stearns was eventually taken over by JPMorgan Chase in a deal that involved the Fed 's financial backing .

Richard Neely and Allyson Dalton 's battle to stay alive for 19 hours in the tropical waters of Australia 's Great Barrier Reef ensured them a place in the record books .
Their tale of survival against the odds had all the elements of a spell - binding narrative : an idyllic holiday that turned into a nightmare , panicked hours spent desperate and stranded in the deep , shark - infested waters , and cries for help that went unheard .
It ended , of course , in dramatic rescue , relief and a story that captured headlines all over the world .
From start to finish , the media cried , it was a tale of stupendous courage , almost superhuman stamina and intense drama .
But , as the dust settles on the reports of their awe - inspiring struggle , those who originally praised the couple are starting to ask questions .
And , unlike four days ago , when it was the operators of the boat and the pair 's fellow divers who were under fire for alleged negligence , now Mr Neely and Ms Dalton are in the spotlight .
Scuba experts have wondered why the couple went diving in tropical 23C waters wearing 9 mm hooded wetsuits when everyone else on their boat wore a 2 mm stinger suit .
It has also been queried as to why they took an expensive shark - repellent device when all they were planning was a casual afternoon 's diving .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Those onboard have also claimed the couple ignored safety instructions about leaving the lagoon they were diving in and that the distance they surfaced from the boat was much greater than was first suggested .
While Neely and Dalton say it was 200m , it has been said that it could have been nearer 2 km .
And , perhaps most curiously , it is being asked why the couple did not inflate their orange surface marker buoy immediately upon surfacing as they had done on five previous dives during the same trip .
Instead they waited until nightfall .
These questions , among others , have caused holes to emerge in the divers ' apparently watertight story .
Yesterday , as they flew to America with a public relations guru to sell their story , which has already earned them anywhere between £ 5,000 and £ 500,000 in Britain , their version of events was coming under increasing critical scrutiny .
Mr Neely , who is 38 and originally from Norfolk , had boarded the Pacific Star on Wednesday evening with his American girlfriend , Allyson , and 18 other passengers and four crew members .
That evening the couple , both experienced divers , sat and chatted with other passengers .
Rebecca Sharkey , 24 , from Liverpool , was one of the others on board .
" Everyone was drinking and getting along and treating it like a normal holiday but you could tell straight away that Rick and Ally were more interested in the diving than the holiday aspect of the trip , " she said .
" They would n't stay up as late as the rest of us and were quite sure about exactly where and when they wanted to dive and what they wanted to see . "
On Thursday afternoon the group took their first dips and retired to bed early ahead of Friday 's schedule .
Michael Paton , 18 , from Anglesey in north Wales , had lunch with the couple aboard the boat before the Friday afternoon dive – the dive that would see them lost at sea for 19 hours .
" They were a really friendly couple and were telling us about their diving experience , " he said .
" My friends and I had a lot of respect for them because they are seriously well - qualified divers .
He is a master scuba diver and she is a dive master ; they were probably better qualified than the instructors on the boat .

" Over lunch we spoke about diving and they told us about the shark - repellent device they had brought .
It is a seriously expensive piece of kit ; I reckon it would cost about £ 1,000 .
I do remember thinking it was a bit strange to have such extensive equipment for a dive around a small lagoon , but then again if I had one I 'd probably have taken it out with me too . "
After that lunch the passengers split up into groups of six to go diving in Gary 's Lagoon .
Ms Sharkey was part of the group that entered the water with Mr Neely and Ms Dalton .
She said : " I did notice that their suits were different to everyone else 's .
We were wearing 2 mm stinger suits simply to protect us from the jellyfish , but they were wearing 7 mm wetsuits on top of the 2 mm stinger suits , giving them 9 mm of protection .
You normally only need something for that if you 're diving in very cold water or spending a lot of time in the water .
" But I did n't find it too strange because they had brought their own kit and I had rented mine .
If I had my own suit and it was as good as the suits they had , I 'd have worn my own too . "
Ms Sharkey says the group were given instructions not to leave the lagoon and told to resurface immediately if they did so .
But she says she believes the couple ignored these rules .
" After we had been given the briefing they were talking about going to find manta rays and eagle rays .
You can't see things like that inside the lagoon so it seemed quite clear they were going to leave the lagoon , but it was n't really a big deal .
They are both so experienced that I assumed that even if they did leave , they would know what they were doing and be back in time .
As soon as we got under water I looked around and they were gone .
I assumed they 'd gone out of the lagoon , which was a direct violation of what we had been instructed to do .
They were definitely reckless . "
Following the dive , Mr Neely and Ms Dalton claimed that they were only 200 m from the boat when they resurfaced and , despite their shouts and whistles , were not spotted by the crew .
But Ms Sharkey finds that hard to believe .
" At one point my dive buddy and I wandered out of the lagoon by accident and as soon as we realised we surfaced and waved for help .
We were about 150 m away from the boat and simply by waving we were spotted immediately and the smaller boat came out to get us .
" If Rick and Ally were 200 m away they'd have been just a short distance behind us and easily visible to both myself and the crew .
But I did n't see them and the crew obviously did n't so I do n't see how they could have been just 200 m away . "
The final question is why the couple did not use their orange safety buoy to signal their position in the water .
The balloon is visible for one nautical mile and would easily have been spotted if Mr Neely and Ms Dalton were in the vicinity of the boat .
In the original Sunday Mirror interview , Mr Neely said he was waving the buoy from the start , but Australian newspapers have reported that the couple told police they did not inflate this until it got dark .
Ms Sharkey added : " Every other dive they had done , even if they had surfaced just 20 m from the boat , they were inflating their balloon ; it was just good practice .
I can't understand why they would have waited so long this time . "
Her sentiments were echoed by the boat operators , Ozsail , who released a statement simply saying : " Allyson and Richard did not remain on the dive site .
Allyson and Richard did not follow the clear instructions of the dive instructor .
Allyson and Richard did not surface immediately upon leaving Gary 's Lagoon . "
Mr Neely and Ms Dalton were found on Saturday morning , 14 km from where they first entered the water .
The search for them involved seven helicopters , three aircraft and many boats , and is estimated to have cost up to £ 200,000 .
Since then the couple have , in the numerous interviews they have been paid for , denied any wrongdoing and even said that they were disappointed in the reaction from the boat 's crew and passengers .
Mr Neely has been quoted as saying : " We do n't consider that we drifted away from the dive site .
We were on the dive site for the entire time of our allocated dive time .
I would consider that our ( dive ) plan went as expected . "
However , in another interview he said : " He ( the boat 's skipper ) definitely did not say we should surface if we left the lagoon . "
On the subject of the crew and passengers ' efforts to find them , Ms Dalton said : " Each moment ticked by and we were drifting further and further away and we realised that they were not coming . "
Mr Neely added : " They may have been looking for us in the lagoon , but I do n't think they were looking for us in the right direction . "
It is these comments which have irked fellow passengers .
" When they did n't return as scheduled we started worrying and everyone was on top of the boat using binoculars to try to look for them , " said Ms Sharkey .
" We stayed on the boat all night and I know for a fact that I did n't get a wink of sleep that night .
I 'm pretty sure most others on board did n't either .
To have them say we did n't do enough was quite hurtful .
They are now selling their story on television and to the newspapers and it hurts that they are being nasty about us when we put in so much effort for absolutely no gain of our own .
We just tried to help . "

English 1A
Professer ___________
My Best Summer Memory
Hey man , I ’m not really sure if you ’re supposed to put an introduction in this thing , but here goes anyway .
My name is ____________ .
My assignment today is to write an essay about the best thing that happened to me this last summer .
I know everybody ’s been kinda looking at me in class , wondering why a dude in his thirties is taking English 1A instead of being out there working a job .
I ’m not too keen on talking about myself much .
Most folks are n’t , I guess , unless they ’re Paris Hilton .
But since the assignment is a personal essay I suppose I do n’t have much choice .
Anyways the best thing that happened to me this last summer was when I finally got outta prison based on that DNA evidence .
I ’ll tell you man , if you ca n’t appreciate getting outta prison then you have n’t been there to begin with .
For me it started about three years ago when this chick got murdered in East San Jose while opening up her plumbing supply shop .
Me and Merle came by a couple weeks later to pick up some PVC for a sprinkler repair , and for some reason the dude behind the counter thought we was a little suspicious , so he called the cops .
They put me in a line up , but of course the dude already knew what I looked like and what clothes I was wearing so it was n’t that tough to pick me out .
Other than that there was no real evidence , but I did n’t have an alibi and I had a couple drunk and disorderlies on my record back from when me and Merle used to fight each other for fun after closing time .
They had it in their minds I was guilty , and they kept after me for two days , yelling and throwing stuff at me and telling me made - up stories about how Merle told them I did it .
I always figured I was pretty tough but after awhile it just wore me down .
I had to look at some pictures of death row and I got showed on my arm where the needles would go and everybody called me Dead Man Walking .
They told me if I signed a confession I would n’t get the death penalty and I had to think about that one pretty hard .
The lawyer they assigned to me smelled like he ’d been pulling a cork during lunch and he fell asleep while they was questioning me .
I knew I did n’t do nothing but sometimes life just ai n’t all fair , and this seemed like one of those times .
So I signed .
After the sentencing Merle sold my truck and moved all my stuff into storage for me , and promised me he ’d look after Mussel Shoals , my black lab .
They sent me up to San Quentin , and when I got there , I was put in the section with the black dudes .
I found out later that ’s what they do with new prisoners , except the blacks end up in the white section .
I guess it ’s to soften up the new inmates , I dunno .
Whatever the reason it did n’t take long for them to find this paleface .
One day I turn around , and there they stood , the welcoming committee .
It did n’t take but one look to realize they were n’t there to bring me a fruit basket .
I figured this was gonna be a test of me , find out if they could push me around , so I got a good shot in on the first one and broke his nose .
Since it was four on one , I was looking at an ass - kickin for sure , so I did n’t follow up on the others too much , to try and keep ‘ em from getting too mad .
Well man , was I ever wrong about that .
They got me face down , one on each arm and leg , then they got my pants down .
About this time , right up till the last minute , I was thinking , this can't be happening to me .
The dude whose nose I broke went first .
I was heaving and twisting my body trying to get loose , but the others held me down good .
He started to poke around and then forced himself in .
I never in my life had anything hurt like that , man .
Everything got all cloudy and I heard him call me his white bitch .
Bits of snot and blood from his nose dripped down on the cement next to my head .
It ’s the only time in my life I ever tried to talk to God .
First I asked him why .
Then I asked him to help me .
And he never said a word .
You know , the only thing worse than being shined on by God is having it happen at a time like that , man .
But it ’s just like the preachers say : you ca n’t fool God .
He knows why you ’re finally talking to him – because you need help .
So God never answered me , and I was on my own .
And the only thing I wanted to do was to die .
When he was done , he got up and kicked me in the head .
That in a way was kind of a blessing , cause I do n't remember anything that happened after that for awhile , and I 'm pretty sure the rest of those dudes took their turns .
A few weeks later , they came around again .
I knew what was coming this time , and I did n’t hold anything back .
I popped three of em pretty good before they got me down and did me again .
They got the better of me , no question , but I left them worse for wear .
That was the first time I ever saw a black eye on a black dude .
By this time I was hoping they ’d think I just ai n’t worth the trouble .
There were plenty of others there that were easier pickins than me .
But this was n't about finding someone for sex , it was about breaking me down .
So I got another visit from my new buddies .
This time , they kinda formed a circle around me before moving in , and I could see in their eyes that some of them were n't really looking forward to this at all .
Well man , welcome to the fuckin club .
This time I ended up in the prison hospital and spent a couple weeks there .
One day , I was laying there thinking about how much I hurt and wondering what a life sentence was gonna be like with this happening all the time , when one of the inmates working in the hospital starts talking to me and tells me about the Aryan Brotherhood and how I do n't have to put up with the nee - grahs no more as long as I join up with em .
And that ’s how I ended up with the tattoo of the swastika and WHITE POWER on my arm , right up there by the bicep .
Well , time goes by and I ’m getting settled into the routine of prison life , and no one is messing with my behind no more now that I ’m in this white guy gang .
Then from outta the blue I find out that that someone from the Pine Hills Youth Correctional Facility in Montana got religious and wrote a letter confessing to killing that chick .
He was just a kid , only seventeen years old .
Can you believe that ?
Well , no one at San Quentin did .
No one takes you seriously when you tell em you ’re innocent , cause everybody in prison says they ’re innocent .
I did n’t have the letter or anything , just what I heard , so no one gave a shiet .
So I wrote to Merle , and he sent some dude from the Innocence Project to visit me .
Next thing I know the prison doctor is scraping some skin from the inside of my mouth , and one day , just like that , they 're walking me out the door and on my way .
Course it did n’t take more than five minutes to be up to my ass in ambulance chasers all wanting to help me sue the government for my troubles .
Most of em did n’t smell much different than the public defender , and I began to wonder if I was ever gonna get a lawyer who was n’t a fall - down drunk .
The dudes at the Innocence Project gave me the name of some chick up in San Francisco to call .
That was kinda far away for me , but she turned out to be a pretty good lawyer and did n’t smell of booze either .
She spent a lot of time yelling at the guys from the city , and let me tell you man , after listening to that I sure was glad she was working for me and not them .
In the end , I got some money , not a lot , cause I was n't in all that long and of course I did n’t tell a soul about the other stuff , but it was enough to get my trailer and a good truck , and they also promised to pay for retraining which is why I ’m taking this class .
Once I got all signed up for school and the dust settled down , I figured I better get rid of that tattoo .
So I called up Merle and told him to come on over and give me a hand with it .
We heated up a weeding tool in the barbeque , and I bit down on a little stick of wood while Merle burnt off the tattoo with the weeder .
You know , I never stopped biting that stick , but when the flesh started to burn , I tried to push everything outta me like emptying a squeeze bottle of Heinz ketchup .
All the shame , all the rage I was carrying around inside me since I got out .
I just forced it all outta me and I guess I yelled a good deal , cause Merle was looking at me kinda funny when it was done .
Merle 's my best friend , and I figured maybe it was OK if I told him about it all , so I did .
And when I was done , there was a long silence , then he kinda looked at me and asked in a quiet voice if I was gonna make him burn my bunghole too , and finish the job .
That Merle , he 's as dumb as a box of rocks , but he always finds a way to make me laugh .
I never really took to queers in the first place but it ai n’t cause of what happened to me when I was inside prison .
I do n't blame the blacks or the queers for it .
That stuff really was n't about color or sex ; it was about power plays by cons who had to ditch their humanity in order to survive .
Still , as everybody knows man , no matter how many times you squeeze the bottle , you can't get every last bit of ketchup out , and for me , I still had some bits of my experience I could n’t get outta my head .
Sometimes , I 'd be watching TV and just start to feel terribly sad and weak .
Mussel Shoals was back with me by then , and he seemed to know something was wrong when I felt like that .
He did n't know what , but he ’d always come on over anyway , and lick my hand and rest his head on my leg .
I tell you man , I really love that dog .
It was real tough getting back in the saddle with the ladies after what happened to me in prison .
I ’d always heard that if you so much as touched another guy ’s privates you were queer for life , and although I was hoping that were n’t true , it was hard to think about sex without remembering all the bad stuff .
Merle brought by some chick he was going out with who had a lady friend , and though she was nice and all I was kinda scared I would n’t be able to deliver the goods and have to start explaining everything , so I had to pass .
About a month after I bought my trailer , I met a nice chick at the park while out walking Mussel Shoals .
She 's about my age and pretty agreeable .
Betty ’s her name .
She has a dog , too , a female Dalmatian named Dotty .
Mussel Shoals was OK with that , ‘ cause he ain’t prejudiced , and they got along just great .
After we'd been going out for a few weeks it was my birthday , and she and Merle came over to my trailer and surprised me with a little cake .
After I blew out the candles they said we could do anything I want , their treat .
So we talked about it awhile and decided to spend the day out at Great America .
Well I do n’t know if you been to Great America lately but they have this new feature which is a water park , and if you asked me that part alone is worth the price of admission .
After we got in we headed on over there and changed our clothes in one of the little changing rooms they have nearby .
While I was waiting for Betty to change ( course chicks always take forever , took me and Merle about a minute and Betty about four hours ) I struck up this conversation with this Filipino dude who was waiting behind me .
He had a shirt on said he ’s a police officer , so of course I did n’t mention anything about being in prison .
Then one of the changing rooms opened up , not the one Betty was in ( of course since she takes a million years ) so I told the dude to go ahead of me since I had to wait for Betty anyway .
He moved on into the room and then his son , who was maybe 3 or 4 years old , started following him , but he told the son to wait outside .
So the kid kinda backstepped a ways without turning around and then reached up and took my hand , and I closed my hand around his and we stood there awhile like uncle and son .
It was a great feeling man .
I never got to do that with my dad , cause he passed out on some tracks and got all mashed up by a train when I was only six months old , and none of the dudes that Mom brought around after that ever stayed more than a couple days .
I did n’t really know what I was supposed to do , so I just stood there and tried not to squeeze his hand too hard .
Pretty soon though I heard this laughing behind me , and it ’s the kid ’s mom .
And I looked down at him , and he ’s looking over at her , and his forehead gets all crinkly , and he looks at his hand in mine , and you can see him sorta follow my arm all the way up to my shoulder and to my head .
When he figured out I was n’t his mom , his eyes got real big and he yanked his hand away and scampered over to where she was sitting .
Well by this time his mom is pretty much doubled over with laughter and she and I are talking , and of course Betty comes out right about then and sees me talking to this hot Filipino chick and gives me the stink eye .
But it did n’t take too long before I ’m the one who was upset cause Betty is wearing this string bikini top and let me tell you man , if I had charged a quarter a peek for a look at her tatas I would have made a fortune that day .
Betty looks a lot like Salma Hayak ( specially when she gets mad , which is all the time , Geez ! ) and she has a really nice rack .
But you see man this is where chicks are really sneaky .
Betty knew we was going to a water park and there 'd be lots of chicks to look at and she did n’t want me looking at em .
So she wore her most revealing outfit cause she knew I ’d have to keep an eye on her .
At a place like Great America there are tons of buff dudes walking around trying to grab your chick when you ’re distracted .
So you got to keep your eye out every minute and that cuts into your time cruising the hotties .
And speaking of that I think next time I ’m gonna tell Betty how much I enjoy checking out the babes while she ’s goofing around in the dressing room .
That oughta speed her up .
We had a great time and ate crummy food and I won a Spongebob doll for Betty at the pitching booth .
Merle almost got in a fight with some dudes who stole a big doll from one of the other carnival booths but the rent - a - cops broke that one up before it started .
Later he got sick after going on the Invertigo and we got to watch him puke in a trash can .
That part was n’t so good , but after it got dark the fireworks started going off and Betty snuggled up to me real close and I forgot all about Merle , and we kinda lost him .
It worked out OK though in the end .
Merle called me later and told me that when he got out to the parking lot he ran into the same dudes he almost got in a fight with , and they ended up going out drinking and they ’re his dawgs now .
I never heard Merle call anyone that before , but he do n’t generally hang out with black dudes either .
After the fireworks was done , Betty came back with me to my trailer , and we started watching American Idol .
Well , one thing led to another and the next thing you know we was in bed getting ready to do the horizontal mambo .
She was kinda nervous so I cracked a few jokes to relax her till she told me to shut up .
I was nervous too , man .
I was worried about maybe being queer , but besides even that , this was gonna be the first time for me since before I went to prison , and I was afraid I might be a little rusty .
It was a night I think I ’m always gonna remember .
First - time sex with a chick who 's your girlfriend is always a big deal , specially if you ’re a guy .
You get to see what she looks like naked , specially the boobs , and see what kind of funny noises she makes when she gets all excited .
In spite of all my worrying , everything turned out OK .
I guess sex is like being on a bicycle , you never forget how to ride .
Still , it took Betty a long time to come that night , but that ’s probly cause she was busy with her own first - time sex thoughts .
Chicks are funny about that .
It 's like the first time you take em out to dinner .
They do n't care about the dinner so much as not looking bad eating it , which usually means not eating much of it at all .
Same thing with sex .
The first time , they do n't care so much about coming as much as they do n't want to embarrass themselves .
Next time though you better deliver , that is if you want there to be a third time .
So we 're laying there afterwards , her head on my shoulder , and just talking real soft about nothing in particular , when all of a sudden there 's this big commotion and damn if Mussel Shoals was n't trying to have sexual relations with Dotty .
She did n’t seem quite as interested as he was , but he stayed right on it , the two of em crashing into the walls and the bed and just going to town .
I 'll tell you , no one is gonna mistake ol ’ Mussel Shoals for a 60 minute man , but seeing it was his first time and all , maybe he 'll improve with practice .
A bit later I was the only one awake , and I was laying there listening to the three of em making their sleep noises , and wishing I could get my arm loose somehow so I could get a glass of water without waking up Betty .
But I just laid there listening to the sounds , and smelling the odors of the people sex and dog sex , and thinking about my life .
I wanted to be an astronaut when I was a kid .
I wanted to be a big success and fall in love with the prom queen and live in a four bedroom house with two kids and a Chevy just like white people do in the movies .
It did n’t take long to figure out that was n't gonna happen , and things started to look real bad there for awhile like I just told you about , and much as I try to , I ’m probly never gonna forget how I got into prison and what happened to me there .
But all and all , life really ain’t been so bad to me , man .
Betty said she thinks I might make a good lawyer someday .
I told her I ’ll be lucky to pass this class much less make it all the way to law school .
But she thinks I can become a lawyer , not one like the city gives you that drinks his lunch , but someone who really helps people , maybe even get some other dudes outta prison that do n’t belong there either .
She said everybody has a destiny in life , and mine is to help people to redeem their lives .
How can you not love a chick who talks like that , specially about you ?
Come to think of it , the best thing that happened to me last summer was meeting Betty .
I got me a good woman in that chick .
I got someone to calm me down after I get cut off on the freeway by some dick , and to help me express my true feelings without cussin .
She ’s someone who ’ll open the aspirin bottle for me when I have a hangover , fake an orgasm when I really need her to , and maybe someday , God willing , remind me how many kids we have and what their names are .
Guys do n't give their chicks enough credit for this sorta stuff , and frankly you dudes out there reading this , if you are not making use of this kinda help then you are not getting full value outta your chick .
I ’m gonna do my part too .
I ’m gonna protect her , always .
I ’m gonna hold her and pet her head and tell her everything ’s OK when she ’s feeling sad .
I ’m gonna nod at her sympathetically while thinking , " Who fuckin cares ? " while she bitches on and on about some other chick at work who looked at her the wrong way .
I ’m gonna help her watch football with me , let her change my haircut and clothes all the time , and worry about all the big shiet so she has plenty of time for chick stuff like shopping and crying .
It was a great summer , man .
And I ’m looking forward to the rest of my life .
it 's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests
Tucked in a folder of an old notebook at the very bottom of the box was the essay that follows .
Written in longhand , it was the first assignment from the first class in my first semester .*******************************************************************************************************************I got a D for this essay ( " inappropriate content ) " , and a C - minus for the course .
I was pretty discouraged , but Betty would n't let me quit .
She said that this might not be my last chance to change my life , but it sure was going to be my best chance , and I should go all out .
At the department graduation ceremonies in May , the entire faculty rose and applauded me as I walked up to get my diploma .
And then before you know it , everyone else got up and joined in too , and Betty started bawling her eyes out .
I was really embarrassed , but fortunately Merle was there , and he shouted " It 's about fucking time ! " to me , which cracked up everyone and got them back into their seats .
In the fall , I 'll start law school at Santa Clara University , on an Emery scholarship .
Merle is a Precinct Captain for the Obama Campaign .
Mussel
Shoals went on to live a happy life with Dotty .
When his hearing started to go , we noticed that she was helping him to understand when we gave him commands .
One by one his parts started to wear out , and on December 24th of last year , my dearest friend licked my hand one last time and then slept away .
I buried him on a short hill , next to a trail where I used to hike with him and Dotty .
The view is beautiful , and when we visit , Dotty will lay next to him for as long as I am willing to stay .
About three years ago my grades started to get very good and it looked like school would stick .
I came home one night and told Betty that I thought things were getting better every year , year after year .
She started crying and would n't tell me why .
It took me a long time to figure it out , and when I did I felt pretty sheepish .
I asked her , she answered yes , and nine months to the day of our wedding night , little Tina was born .
She 's as cute as a bug , and someday when she is old enough to learn about her old man 's story , I will take this essay out of storage for her to read .
Elections in China , Pakistan and the US could prompt more arrests
More bloggers than ever face arrest for exposing human rights abuses or criticising governments , says a report .
Since 2003 , 64 people have been arrested for publishing their views on a blog , says the University of Washington annual report .
In 2007 three times as many people were arrested for blogging about political issues than in 2006 , it revealed .
More than half of all the arrests since 2003 have been made in China , Egypt and Iran , said the report .
Jail sentence Citizens have faced arrest and jail for blogging about many different topics , said the World Information Access ( WIA ) report .
Arrested bloggers exposed corruption in government , abuse of human rights or suppression of protests .
They criticised public policies and took political figures to task .
The report said the rising number of arrests was testament to the " growing " political importance of blogging .
It noted that arrests tended to increase during times of " political uncertainty " , such as around general elections or during large scale protests .
Jail time followed arrest for many bloggers , said the report , which found that the average prison sentence for blogging was 15 months .
The longest sentence found by the WIA was eight years .
It acknowledged that the true number of bloggers arrested could be far higher than the total it found as , in some cases , it proved hard to verify if an arrest had taken place and on what grounds .
For instance , it said the Committee to Protect Bloggers has published information about 344 people arrested in Burma - many of whom are thought to be be bloggers - but the WIA could not verify all the reports .
It also noted that many nations , perhaps as many as 30 , imposed technological restrictions on what people can do online .
In nations such as China this made it difficult for people to use a blog as a means of protest .
The report pointed out that it is not just governments in the Middle East and East Asia that have taken steps against those publishing their opinions online .
In the last four years , British , French , Canadian and American bloggers have also been arrested .
The report predicted that the number of blogger arrests in 2008 would exceed the 36 seen in 2007 thanks to greater popularity of blogging as a medium , greater enforcement of net restrictions , and elections in China , Pakistan , Iran and the US .

Thank you for your cooperation .
More than seven years too late , it appears as if a growing number of congresspersons are realizing that they are part of a co-equal branch of government .
After allowing their institution to be disrespected and at times ignored by the executive branch , top officials in Congress are finally expressing a willingness to use their full power under the Constitution to rein in an out - of - control administration .
The current target : Karl Rove .
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
Rove has been asked by the House Judiciary Committee to testify about his involvement in the Justice Department ’s prosecution and imprisonment of former Alabama Governor Don Siegleman .
As Rove has so far refused to testify voluntarily , members of Congress have started sending signals that they are prepared to go to the mat over this .
Yesterday , Rep. Robert Wexler sent out a strongly worded E-mail advocating the use of “ inherent contempt ” against Rove , which would allow the House Sergeant - of - Arms to forcibly bring Rove to the House to testify .
Also yesterday , House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers alluded to the use of inherent contempt .
" We 'll do what any self - respecting committee would do , ” Conyers said .
“ We 'd hold him in contempt .
Either that or go and have him arrested . "
( And if you have n't already heard , Conyers spoke to a colleague a little too loudly and was overheard by reporters to say , " We ’re closing in on Rove .
Someone ’s got to kick his ass . " )
It is time for all of us to let our representatives know that we support this forceful action .
That is why I just sent an E- mail to my representative through the American Freedom Campaign Web site .
I hope that you will join me .

The Dalai Lama claimed yesterday that Beijing was planning the mass settlement of 1 million ethnic Chinese people in Tibet after the Olympics with the aim of diluting Tibetan culture and identity .
Tibet 's exiled spiritual leader also claimed that some of Asia 's most important rivers which flow from the Tibetan plateau are being polluted and diminished by careless industrialisation and unplanned irrigation .
The Dalai Lama made the claims in an interview with the Guardian after a meeting yesterday with Gordon Brown at Lambeth Palace .
He said the talks had been detailed and the prime minister had been helpful " in spite of his difficulties " .
The Dalai Lama said : " He met me and he showed genuine concern and he wants to help . "
Downing Street said the discussion focused on talks due next month on Tibet 's future between Tibetan representatives and Beijing officials .
The prime minister is said to have stressed the importance of the Dalai Lama 's pledge to oppose violence , not seek Tibetan independence , nor support a boycott of the Beijing Olympics .
The Dalai Lama said he feared the Chinese authorities could take a tougher line on Tibet after the Olympics , and possibly flood it with Han Chinese , the world 's largest ethnic group .
The Dalai Lama said he had been informed by Tibetan residents that large areas of empty land had been marked out , as if for construction , in the past two years .
" Then last year we received information - after the Olympics 1 million Chinese are going to settle in the autonomous region of Tibet , " he said , adding the information came from a " military source " in Tibet .
" There is every danger Tibet becomes a truly Han Chinese land and Tibetans become an insignificant minority .
Then the very basis of the idea of autonomy becomes meaningless . "
There has been an increasing influx of Chinese settlers into Tibet in recent years as transport has improved , but the exact figures are a matter of dispute .
According to an official census in 2000 , there were 2.4 million Tibetans in the region and 159,000 Han Chinese .
The government in exile says there are many more Chinese if migrant workers and soldiers are counted .
The Dalai Lama has said there is a Han majority in Lhasa , the regional capital .
China has denied carrying out any deliberate settlement policy aimed at the dilution of Tibetan culture and points instead to the benefits brought to the region by economic development and investment .
The Dalai Lama claimed over - settlement and over - exploitation of Tibet was threatening the quality and flow of rivers flowing out of the Tibetan highlands , including the Yangtze , the Yellow River , the Indus , the Mekong and the Ganges .
" Due to carelessness these waters have been polluted and also reduced , and I think billions of people 's lives depend on these rivers , " the Dalai Lama said .
" [ There has been ] mining without proper care , deforestation ... irrigation without proper planning .
In some valleys , new diseases have developed which some specialists believe is the result of water pollution . "
Lhasa is now relatively quiet since protests were put down by Chinese troops in March , and the Dalai Lama has threatened to resign if the unrest turns to violence .
But he said the Tibetan commitment to non-violence might not outlast him .
" Now there are signs of frustration among Tibetans , not only young monks , " the 72 - year - old Buddhist leader said .
He said Tibetans were now telling themselves : " While the Dalai Lama remains , we have to follow his advice .
That means non-violence .
After him , we ourselves will take appropriate action . "
The next talks between representatives of the Dalai Lama and China are scheduled for Beijing on June 11 .
On Wednesday , envoys of the Tibetan leader visited the Chinese embassy in London to offer his condolences for the dead from this month 's earthquake in Sichuan .
Asked what he thought Gordon Brown should tell the Chinese president , Hu Jintao , when he attends the Olympic closing ceremony in August , the Dalai Lama said : " If within two months it gets more positive then the prime minister must give encouragement and appreciation .
If things get worse , the prime minister will have to speak out . "
Many enjoying a day by the sea were injured by the Gaza City blast A powerful explosion inside a car travelling past a beach in the Gaza Strip has killed four Hamas militants and a young girl , medics have said .
At least 20 other people , including many enjoying a day by the sea , were said to be injured by the explosion on Gaza City 's coast road .
Leaders of the Islamist movement have blamed Israeli collaborators in Gaza .
It was the third bomb attack in a day - one of the bloodiest since Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire last month .
Earlier on Friday , a bombing outside a cafe in Gaza City killed one person - reportedly the perpetrator - and injured at least three others , Hamas officials said .
It was unclear why the area was bombed , but there have been attacks on internet cafes , music shops and Christian institutions in Gaza in recent months .
Officials also reported a bombing near the home of Marwan Abu Ras , a Hamas politician and academic .
No -one was injured .
' Fugitive party '
The explosion on Friday night at a major junction besides Gaza City 's beach killed a commander of Hamas ' military wing , the Izzedine al - Qassam Brigades , and three other members , hospital officials said .
We have information that some elements are planning to carry out bombings against the interests and leaders of Hamas in order to sow anarchy
Khalil al - Hayya
Hamas leader
The five - year - old girl killed in the blast had been on her way to the beach with her family , they added .
Afterwards , Hamas did not explicitly accuse its bitter rival , Fatah , of carrying out the attack , but it did imply it , the BBC's Aleem Maqbool says .
Khalil al - Hayya , a Hamas leader whose son was wounded in the blast , blamed Palestinian groups " who collaborate with the enemy [ Israel ] " .
" We have information that some elements are planning to carry out bombings against the interests and leaders of Hamas in order to sow anarchy , " he told the Reuters news agency .

Advertisement The Izzedine al - Qassam Brigades , however , were more explicit and blamed " members of the fugitive party " - a derogatory term for Fatah .
Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007 from the Fatah movement of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
Since then , Hamas 's forces have arrested many Fatah supporters .
Most have been afraid to challenge the Islamist movement and so while there has been dissent , factional killings have decreased considerably , our correspondent says .
In response to this latest internal violence , Hamas immediately set up checkpoints throughout Gaza City .

I am a relative newcomer to python , and have been blown away by the flexibility of some operations in Python .
The string - formatting operator , % , is really wonderful and flexible .
This is my attempt at implementing something similar in JavaScript .
Obviously , you ca n’t create a new operator in JavaScript , and in addition you ca n’t use % as a JavaScript identifier .
So I went for the next - best thing :
String.prototype.format = function string_format(d ) { // there are two modes of operation ... unnamed indices are read in order ; // named indices using % ( name ) s .
The two styles can not be mixed .
//
Unnamed indices can be passed as either a single argument to this function , // multiple arguments to this function , or as a single array argument let curindex = 0 ; if ( arguments. length >
1 ) d = arguments ; function r(s , key , type ) { let v ; if ( key == " " ) { if ( curindex == - 1 ) throw Error ( " Cannot mix named and positional indices in string formatting . " ) ; if ( curindex == 0 && ( ! ( d instanceof Object ) || ! ( 0 in d ) ) ) v = d ; else if ( !( curindex in d ) ) throw Error ( " Insufficient number of items in format , requesting item % i".format( curindex ) ) ; else v = d[curindex ] ; ++ curindex ; } else { key = key . slice ( 1 , - 1 ) ; if ( curindex > 0 ) throw Error ( " Cannot mix named and positional indices in string formatting . " ) ; curindex = - 1 ; if ( !( key in d ) ) throw Error ( " Key ' %s ' not present during string substitution . " .
format ( key ) ) ; v = d[key ] ; } switch ( type ) { case " s " : return v.toString ( ) ; case " r " : return v.toSource ( ) ; case " i " : return parseInt ( v ) ; case " f " : return Number ( v ) ; case " % " : return " % " ; default : throw Error ( " Unexpected format character ' %s ' . " . format ( type ) ) ; } } return this .replace (/%( \( [ ^ ) ] +\ ) ) ?(. ) /g , r ) ; } ; String.prototype.ø = String.prototype.format ;
If you are at all familiar with the python string - formatting operator , this should be very similar :
" %s %s " .ø ( " angry " , " monkeys " ) ; == " angry monkeys " ; " %( key ) s : %( value ) s " .
ø( {key : ' bananas ' , value : ' tasty'} ) == " bananas : tasty " ; " % i - %i " .ø ( [ 1 , 3 ] ) == " 1 - 3 " ; " %r " .ø ( ['α ' , 'ω ' ] == ' [ " α " , " ω " ] ' ;
I know that there are many sprintf - like libraries out there for JavaScript : I just happen to like mine best .
Caution : this code requires JavaScript 1.7 … if you replace some “ let ”s with “ var ”s it may work in older browsers , but I have n’t tested it .
Being able to pass a function as a replacement in String .
replace is a very powerful feature !
Jacqui Smith , the British Home Secretary has sent a letter reported on by the British Journal of Photographers stating that the practice of harassing photographers who take pictures in public places is legitimate , though there is no law against it .
' First of all , may I take this opportunity to state that the Government greatly values the importance of the freedom of the press , and as such there is no legal restriction on photography in public places , ' Smith writes .
' Also , as you will be aware , there is no presumption of privacy for individuals in a public place . '
However , the Home Secretary adds that local restrictions might be enforced .
' Decisions may be made locally to restrict or monitor photography in reasonable circumstances .
That is an operational decision for the officers involved based on the individual circumstances of each situation .
' It is for the local Chief Constable , in the case of your letter the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Force , to decide how his or her Officers and employees should best balance the rights to freedom of the press , freedom of expression and the need for public protection . '
As FISA nears toward vote , Feingold warns against immunity David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday July 8 , 2008

While the final result of what critics call a flawed surveillance bill is all - but - ordained , Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) is sticking to his fight to convince colleagues not to retroactively eliminate any consequences for participating in President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program , which was conducted outside of existing law .
" This immunity provision does n't just allow telephone companies off the hook .
It will also make it that much harder to get at the core issue that I 've been raising since December 2005 , which is that the president broke the law and should be held accountable , " Feingold said on the Senate floor Tuesday .
" When these lawsuits are dismissed , we will be that much further away from an independent judicial review of this illegal program . "
He noted that judges who are considering the warrantless spying program have rebuked the Bush administration several times , and that most Senators continue to be unaware of exactly what the program included .
Only members of the Judiciary and Intelligence committees , both of which Feingold is a member , have seen classified documents fully explaining the warrantless wiretapping , which Bush dubbed his Terrorist Surveillance Program .
" We 're considering granting immunity when roughly 70 members of the Senate still have not been briefed on the president 's wiretapping program , " he said .
" The vast majority of this body still does not even know what we 're being asked to grant immunity for . "
Feingold was speaking in favor of an amendment he is co-sponsoring with Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) to strip a grant of retroactive immunity from an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
The two senators succeeded in delaying a vote on FISA that had been scheduled for last month until after the Independence Day recess .
Originally scheduled for Tuesday , vote on the amendments and final bill have been delayed another day so senators can attend the funeral for former North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms , who died last week .
When the Senate debated another FISA bill earlier this year , a similar Feingold - Dodd amendment received just 31 votes ; it is not expected to be adopted this time around either .
Sens. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) and Jeff Bingaman ( D - NM ) have introduced their own amendments to modify the immunity provision .
Specter would let the court decide not to grant immunity if it decides the NSA 's warrantless spying was unconstitutional ; Bingaman would delay a congressional decision on immunity until Congress receives reports from the Justice Department , NSA and other Inspectors General on the warrantless wiretapping .
Because of procedural rules worked out by Senate leadership those amendments would each need 60 votes to pass , meaning their success also is unlikely .
President Bush also has promised to veto any FISA update that does not include an unfettered grant of immunity to telecommunications companies like Verizon and AT&T , which are defendants in some 40 lawsuits alleging they violated customers ' privacy .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , which is representing plaintiffs in some of those suits , accused Bush of ignoring the need to improve surveillance mechanisms .
" The Bush Administration is willing to veto the legislation and forgo these tools unless the telecom immunity is given effect immediately , " wrote Kurt Opsahl on EFF 's blog .
" None of this is as important as immediate immunity for the telecommunications carriers .
Even if the President gets an unprecedented expansion of government surveillance power , and the bill merely delays telecom immunity until Congress has more information , this , Bush contends , is not better than continued surveillance under the current version of FISA . "

Full Text of Feingold 's Remarks : Mr. FEINGOLD : Mr. President , I strongly support Senator Dodds amendment to strike the immunity provision from this bill , and I want to thank the Senator from Connecticut for his leadership on this issue .
Both earlier this year when the Senate first considered FISA legislation and again this time around , he has demonstrated tremendous resolve on this issue , and I have been proud to work with him .
Now , Mr. President , some have tried to suggest that the bill before us will leave it up to the courts to decide whether or not to give retroactive immunity to the companies that allegedly participated in the Presidents illegal wiretapping program .
Make no mistake  this bill will result in immunity being granted , because it sets up a rigged process with only one possible outcome .
Under the terms of this bill , a federal district court would evaluate whether there is substantial evidence that a company received a written request or directive from the Attorney General or the head of an element of the intelligence community indicating that the activity was authorized by the President and determined to be lawful . 
But , Mr. President , we already know from the report of the Senate Intelligence Committee that was issued last fall that the companies received exactly such a request or directive .
That is already public information .
So under the terms of this proposal , the courts decision would be predetermined .
As a practical matter , that means that regardless of how much information the court is permitted to review , what standard of review is employed , how open the proceedings are , and what role the plaintiffs are permitted to play , the court will essentially be required to grant immunity under this bill .
Now , proponents will argue that the plaintiffs in the lawsuits against the companies can participate in briefing to the court .
This is true , but they are not allowed access to any classified information .
Talk about fighting with both hands tied behind your back .
Mr. President , the administration has restricted information about this illegal wiretapping program so much that roughly 70 members of this chamber dont even have access to the basic facts about what happened .
So lets not pretend that the plaintiffs will be able to participate in any meaningful way in these proceedings -- in which Congress has made sure that their claims will be dismissed .
This result is extremely disappointing .
It is entirely unnecessary and unjustified , and it will profoundly undermine the rule of law in this country .
I cannot comprehend why Congress would take this action in the waning months of an administration that has consistently shown contempt for the rule of law  perhaps most notably in the illegal warrantless wiretapping program it set up in secret .
Mr. President , we hear people argue that telecom companies should not be penalized for allegedly taking part in this illegal program .
What you dont hear is that current law already provides immunity from lawsuits for companies that cooperate with the governments request for assistance , as long as they receive either a court order or a certification from the Attorney General that no court order is needed and the request meets all statutory requirements .
But if requests are not properly documented , FISA instructs the telephone companies to refuse the governments request , and subjects them to liability if they instead decide to cooperate .
When Congress passed FISA three decades ago , in the wake of the extensive , well - documented wiretapping abuses of the 1960s and 1970s , it decided that , in the future , telephone companies should not simply assume that any government request for assistance to conduct electronic surveillance was appropriate .
It was clear that some checks needed to be in place to prevent future abuses of this incredibly intrusive power  the power to listen in on peoples personal conversations .
At the same time , however , Congress did not want to saddle telephone companies with the responsibility of determining whether the governments request for assistance was legitimate or not .
So Congress devised a system that would take the guesswork out of it completely .
Under that system , which is still in place today , the companies  legal obligations and liability depend entirely on whether the government has presented the company with a court order or a certification stating that certain basic requirements have been met .
If the proper documentation is submitted , the company must cooperate with the request and is immune from liability .
If the proper documentation has not been submitted , the company must refuse the governments request , or be subject to possible liability in the courts .
This framework , which has been in place for 30 years , protects companies that comply with legitimate government requests while also protecting the privacy of Americans  communications from illegitimate snooping .
Granting companies that allegedly cooperated with an illegal program the new form of retroactive immunity that is in this bill undermines the law that has been on the books for decades  a law that was designed to prevent exactly the type of abuses that allegedly occurred here .
Even worse , granting retroactive immunity under these circumstances will undermine any new laws that we pass regarding government surveillance .
If we want companies to follow the law in the future , it sends a terrible message , and sets a terrible precedent , to give them a get out of jail free card for allegedly ignoring the law in the past .
Mr. President , just last week a key court decision on FISA undercut one of the most popular arguments in support of immunity -- that we need to let the companies off the hook because the state secrets privilege prevents them from defending themselves in court .
A federal court has now held that the state secrets privilege does not apply to claims brought under FISA .
Rather , more specific evidentiary rules in FISA govern .
Shouldnt we at least let these cases proceed to see how this plays out , rather than trying to solve a problem that may not even exist ?
And that s not all .
Mr. President , this immunity provision doesnt just allow telephone companies off the hook .
It also will make it that much harder to get to the core issue that Ive been raising since December 2005 , which is that the President broke the law and should be held accountable .
When these lawsuits are dismissed , we will be that much further away from an independent judicial review of this illegal program .
On top of all this , we are considering granting immunity when roughly 70 members of the Senate still have not been briefed on the Presidents wiretapping program .
The vast majority of this body still does not even know what we are being asked to grant immunity for .
Frankly , I have a hard time understanding how any Senator can vote against this amendment without this information .
I urge my colleagues to support the amendment to strike the immunity provision from the bill .
People still ask underlings to get them coffee ( really ? ) .
From the Philadelphia Inquirer :
" Nine minutes after receptionist Tamara Klopfenstein complained - for the second time - about getting her bosses coffee , she was fired .
" I do n't expect to serve and wait on you by making and serving you coffee every day , " Klopfenstein e-mailed to her boss at National Sales & Supply L.L.C. , of Bensalem .
Manager Jason
Shrager told her the issue was n't " open for debate . "
Instead , the issue caused a brouhaha in federal court .
Earlier this month , U.S. District Judge Berle M. Schiller could n't resist punning his way through a decision on the deeper issue - whether Klopfenstein 's managers had created a hostile and discriminatory work environment by requiring the receptionist to fetch them coffee .
He wrote that she had no grounds for her complaints of sexual discrimination .
" The act of getting coffee is not , by itself , a gender - specific act , " Schiller wrote .
The fact that a vice president wrote " looks nice , dresses well , " on notes when she was hired also does n't add up to discrimination , the judge wrote . "
Ever been asked to get some coffee for someone ?
I have .
It happened to me during a quick team meeting at a boss 's office earlier in my career .
I do n't think the fact that he asked me to get coffee was an intentional slight .
I was the last one to the meeting and he was buried in a spreadsheet and when I asked him if he wanted me to close the door , he asked me if I could grab him some coffee .
With a name like " Kris " , I should tell you now that I 'm a man , baby ( cue the Austin Powers ) .
I was a little taken aback , but like Ask A Manager explains , a task is a task and it 's important not to appear like you have zero flexibility .
Still , the fact that I was asked was a little embarassing .
It took me about 2 minutes to get the plan together to ensure I was never asked again .
Instead of coming back with coffee , I came back to the office no fewer than 3 times to ask the creamer / sugar / real or paper cup questions .
Once I was back with the java , I asked him 2 - 3 times with a joyous spirit how the coffee was .
I saw the look in his eye and he figured out that I was poking him for asking me to get his swill .
He never asked again and we continued to have a great working relationship .
Plan B , if I got asked a second time , was to trip as I was presenting the second cup and scald him with the hot brew .
Glad it did n't come to that ...

If you 've been trawling the recesses of the internets for the past week or so , you may have come across a story about a pair of 13 year - old kids who lied about winning a WoW tournament , booked a swish hotel room then paid for two $ 1000 - a- night hookers to come upstairs and play Halo with them .
For their troubles , the pair have allegedly been " convicted of fraud " .
It 'd be a pretty funny story if it was true .
Thing is , it 's not .
Kiwi site Stuff actually bothered to check with the police in Newark , Texas , where the events supposedly took place , and were told :
As far as we know , this story is a hoax .
There have not been any arrests here , and we 're not aware of any convictions like that in this county .

Hint : as soon as the story involves midgets , and not just hookers , Xbox and WoW , there 's a good chance it 's too good to be true .
Did a 13 yo buy hookers with dad 's credit card ?

DETROIT — Sales of new cars and trucks plunged to their lowest level in more than a decade in June , as high gas prices and a weak economy kept American consumers away from dealer showrooms .
With the drop last month of more than 18 percent , automakers now expect to sell well below 15 million new vehicles this year , far fewer than the norm this decade of more than 16 million vehicles a year .
Detroit automakers were hit hard .
Ford Motor was down 28 percent in June , General Motors was off 18 percent , and Chrysler dropped 36 percent .
Despite its sharp decline , G.M ’s results were better than expected , which industry analysts attributed to a sales blitz with offers of zero- interest , long - term financing deals .
The cut -rate loans helped G.M. retain its historic position as the top- selling United States automaker over Toyota , whose sales fell 21 percent .
Generally , geeks notoriously avoid wearing jewelry , especially male geeks .
But there is one exception to this rule : watches .
This is probably because watches do not only add an element of fashion to their look , but are actually useful .
And if the watch looks especially high - tech , then all the better !
I ’m sure you ’ve all seen some geeky - looking watches on the Net in recent months .
Most technology blogs cover them from time to time , so if you ’re following a bunch of them , you ought to have seen a few .
Today , I ’m not only going to show you 3 amazing watches from a company named TokyoFlash , but I ’m also going to give away two of them ( an approximate value of $ 150 each ) .
Keep on reading for all the details .
Watch # 1 : 1000100101
Contrary to what most people think when looking at its name , this watch is not one which displays time in binary format .
As you can see , it has been designed to look like a high - tech device that would fit well on the wrist of a moon base commander .
Its surface has a brushed metal look and displays the time by pressing a button on the side of the watch .
It then lights up a bunch of bright LEDs .
The yellow LEDs on top are used to indicate the day of the week .
Under this , the green , red and yellow ones represent the hour of the day .
If you press the side button once more , you ’ll then get the current date and month .
The strap looks very nice , has a leather back and sports durable , carbon - fiber style coating .
Once again , our second watch looks very futuristic .
The S - Mode Oberon features a very cool looking , full - face , black mineral crystal lens and the wrist strap is stainless steel .
It displays time by lighting up a bunch of white LEDs located underneath the lens .
All you need to do to get the time is to press the top side button .
The LEDs are arranged in three different rings .
The outer ring is used to count the hour , the middle ring counts the single minutes and the inner ring displays the minutes in groups of ten .
The date can also be read in a similar way by a second touch of the upper button .
Watch # 3 : Tibida
Our third and final watch will probably please the binary maniacs among you .
The Tibida can display time using three methods : hour - centric , minute - centric and binary .
Like most TokyoFlash watches , it can also give you the date .
Tibida features a nice - looking stainless steel case and a polyurethane wristband .
It is available in four colors : red , blue , black or orange .
The model we received is red and will probably look nicer on a lady .
But that ’s just my personal opinion .
The LEDs on the Tibida are extra bright , and I almost got blind after looking at it for the first time .
Ok , maybe I ’m exaggerating a bit , but yes , they are noticeably brighter than on the two other models we received .
Giveaway
At the end of this week , we will be giving away 2 of these watches : The S - Mode Oberon and the Tibida .

General Motors is sticking to its guns , insisting that the Chevrolet Volt will be ready for production by 2010 .
If GM can produce this vehicle on time and in significant numbers - and it works well and reliably - the Volt will stand as a milestone in automotive technology .
But if it does n't turn out well , GM could stand accused of " killing the electric car " again .
The Volt is not a hybrid car .
It will run entirely on electricity .
Unlike other electric cars , though , it will not conk out if the battery runs low before stopping to charge .
A small on - board gasoline engine will run as a generator to charge the batteries and keep the car moving .
The Volt is expected to go about 40 miles before that needs to happen and most drivers should be able to go most days without using a drop of gas .
Do n't expect the Volt to look just like this concept version .
The final car will have a more rounded front end look and a sharper - edged tail .
Why does Harriet Harman hate marriage ?
Political ideologues live in a permanent state of denial , refusing to accept any evidence that contradicts them .
A classic example of this pattern lies in family policy .
For decades , feminist zealots have told us that family structure is irrelevant , fathers are unnecessary for child - rearing and marriage is outdated .
These views have had a disastrous influence , encouraging the state to preside over the breakdown in the traditional family .
The results are everywhere - in crime , in benefits dependency , poverty and the rising costs to public services .
Hardline : Harriet Harman clings to the dogma of the Left
Yet , amid all this wreckage , hardliners still cling to their dogma .
And none is more hardline than the High Priestess of British Feminism , Harriet Harman .
In an extraordinary interview published yesterday , she declared marriage was ' irrelevant ' to public policy and described high rates of separation as a ' positive development ' , as it reflected ' greater choice ' for couples - never mind the children .
If nothing else , Harman can be credited with consistency .
Neither the facts nor the passage of time have changed her mind .
She was preaching this dangerous gospel of feminist fascism when she was first elected to Parliament in 1982 .
When I came to work for her as a parliamentary aide in the early Nineties , Harman was questioning whether fathers were necessary at all .
In her 26 years as MP , she appears to have learnt nothing from representing the poor South London constituency of Camberwell and Peckham .
It not only has one of the highest rates of lone parenthood in the country , but is also one of the most deprived and crimeridden areas in Britain .
Yet in Harriet Harman 's mind , these two points are not connected .
As a naive young Ulsterman , hailing from a middle - class , two - parent home in Belfast , I was shocked at the complete absence of responsible fathers in the big housing estates that dominated the constituency .
Yet this wilful creation of fractured society in her own midst did not bother Harriet .
' Families come in all shapes and sizes ' , has long been one of the favourite mantras of the Left .
Research studies have shown , however , that children do better when raised in married families .
Tony Blair 's favourite think - tank , the Institute for Public Policy
Research , concluded that a stable background means you are less likely to be out of work , live off the State , become single parents or even smoke .
Children of married parents do better in exams , according to other studies , and are less likely to have mental difficulties .
The Commons Home Affairs Committee has shown that levels of family breakdown among the black community are propelling teenagers into a life of crime .
This was all too evident in Peckham 's phenomenal caseload , arising from an army of constituents who were reliant on the state for all their needs , which meant I found working for Harriet an extremely demanding job .
When I first took up the post , many friends in the Labour party told me I was an idiot to do so .
She had a tyrannical reputation , notorious for her unreasonable demands and hectoring manner .
But , despite her image and the heavy workload , Harman was personally decent with me and generous with her praise .
Even so , there was often an air of chaos about her management - she often struggled to remain on top of her paperwork .
And for someone in the frontline of politics , Harman could be strangely ill - informed about current affairs and I would have to brief her strenuously for appearances on BBC Question Time , trying to ensure , for instance , that she remembered the names of key players in the Middle East peace process .
She could also be odd about money .
At one stage she decided to employ a media negotiator to enhance her earnings from routine broadcast appearances - unheard of in Whitehall .
It was a tactic that backfired when an outraged ITV company leaked to the Press her substantial demand for a fee .
The negotiator was no more .
Regardless , for several years after I had left my job with her and embarked on a career as a writer , I retained some affection for Harriet .
In 1998 , when she was being attacked for her poor handling of the welfare portfolio , I even wrote an article in this paper in her defence .
But over the past decade , I have become increasingly disillusioned .
I can now see what aggravates so many people about her : the politically correct condescension ; smug self - certainty despite a record of incompetence ; the whiff of born - to - rule arrogance ; the attachment to the shibboleths of multi-culturalism and feminism .
Harman is the embodiment of so much that is wrong with New Labour .
Born into affluent privilege herself , Harman is that classic socialist type that regards the robust British working class with suspicion .
But Harriet 's greatest vice - and there are many - is her hypocrisy .
She is now the Deputy Leader of a party that , in its latest by - election campaign in Crewe , has descended into the gutter of class warfare , deriding its opponents as ' toffs ' .
Yet few figures in modern politics have enjoyed greater privilege than Harman .
Her father was a Harley Street surgeon , her uncle the Earl of Longford .
She was educated at the exclusive St Paul 's Girls ' School , before going on to York University and legal training .
And like so many of the New Labour elite , she has never had a real job in the commercial world .
Before she entered Parliament , she worked as the legal officer for the radical pressure group , the National Council for Civil Liberties .
Further hypocrisy comes in the way she is raising her family - Harman 's attachment to the socialist ideal of comprehensive education clearly does not extend to her own life .
She sent one of her sons to a grant - maintained school , another to a selective grammar , reinforcing the belief that too many Labour politicians refuse to practise what they preach .
Living in the leafy enclave of Dulwich , Harman 's detachment from her constituents ' lives was further reflected when she wore a stab - proof vest for a tour of Peckham , even though she was escorted by three police officers .
The fact Harman has retained high office for so long is a tribute to her iron - clad self - confidence .
In 11 years of Labour rule she has no significant achievements to her name .
She was sacked from the Cabinet by Blair in 1998 for making a hash of the policy of welfare reform .
Since then she has used a succession of jobs , first Solicitor - General and now Minister for Equalities and Leader of the Commons as a platform to propound her dated brand of feminism .
Her mix of incompetence and cash problems was again demonstrated when she was embroiled in the Donorgate row recently , having accepted money for her Deputy Leadership bid without checking the source and then failing to make a proper declaration to the Electoral Commission , the party funding watchdog .
Harman is fond of talking about equality , but her policies move in precisely theopposite direction .
So she has called for the introduction of U.S. - style positive discrimination for job candidates , where female and ethnic minority candidates are favoured over white males .
This is in direct contradiction of equal opportunities .
Nothing could be more unjust , patronising or discriminatory than awarding jobs on the basis of skin colour or gender .
The same is true of her scheme to promote all - black shortlists in elections to increase the number of non-white MPs .
But then Harman has never had time for the British public , preferring to patronise rather than listen .
She wants to shape society instead of serving its genuine needs .
Her entire career , based on the elitist belief that she knows best , represents a betrayal of the traditional working class - the very people Labour was founded to represent .
Yea , but what does the world ’s richest person and most successful investor know about the economy ?
He supports Democrats so obviously he ’s a communist and is against our glorious leader .
Clearly we need more tax cuts and less regulation as McCain says .
Last Wednesday , the Commerce Department said the economy grew at a 0.6 percent annual rate in the first quarter .
But Buffett said the nation ’s population also grew , making the real growth rate lower .
He also said that , even if the data do not show the economy retracting , people feel as though it is .
“ The U.S. is in recession as I define it , ” Buffett said .
“ I would define that as a situation where people are doing less well than they were three months , six months or eight months earlier and most businesses find themselves in that position too .
“ If were are in a non-recession , I do n’t think people want to see it going in the same direction as it is and saying it ’s wonderful . ”

And this is Dan Senor ’s WaPo Oped .

The evocative question ' Is there anybody there ? ' conjures up images of mediums summoning spirits in a darkened room .
But now psychics must add a few riders before they invoke the voices of the dead , thanks to new consumer laws due to come into force .
Breathless audiences are now likely to be asked : ' Is there anybody here ... who is vulnerable , of nervous disposition , or likely to sue ? '
Indeed , a whole list of disclaimers must be added to the spiritualists ' spiel if they are to avoid an avalanche of writs following the repeal next month of the Fraudulent Mediums Act , to be replaced by the new Consumer Protection Regulations .
Promises to raise the dead , secure good fortune or heal through the laying on of hands are all at risk of legal action from disgruntled customers .
Spiritualists say they will be forced to issue disclaimers , such as ' this is a scientific experiment , the results of which cannot be guaranteed ' .
They claim the new regulations will leave them open to malicious civil action by sceptics .
The problem is that very little in the multi-million - pound psychic industry in Britain is for free , and anyone charging or accepting ' gifts ' in exchange for a service is bound by the new regulations .
There are charges for seances , Tarot , psychic readings and clairvoyance .
Spiritualist church service - goers - and there are more than 300 spiritualist churches in Britain - are charged or asked for donations .
Psychic mailings - letters promising spiritualist services in exchange for a cheque - are estimated to have cost Britons £ 40 m in 2006 - 07 , according to Office of Fair Trading research .
Psychic services via telephone , online and satellite TV keep the tills ringing further .
For the past half - century , ' genuine ' mediums have been protected by the 1951 Fraudulent Mediums
Act , under which prosecutors had to prove fraud and dishonest intent to secure a criminal conviction , which was difficult .
There have been fewer than 10 convictions in the past 20 years .
With that protection gone , there will now be nothing between the medium and the trading standards officer - and no need to prove fraud .
Instead it will be up to the trader , in this case the medium , to prove they did not mislead , coerce or take advantage of any ' vulnerable ' consumers .
Carole McEntee - Taylor , a spiritualist healer in Essex , said having to stand up and describe the invoking of spirits as an ' experiment ' was forcing spiritualists to ' lie and deny our beliefs ' .
She added : ' No other religion has to do that .
And how can you tell if someone is vulnerable ?
You would have to ask them if they felt vulnerable , or had mental health issues , or were of a nervous disposition . '
With her husband , David , a spiritualist minister , she has set up the Spiritualist Workers ' Association , to help regulate the industry and offer guidance on the law .
They will be presenting a petition to 10 Downing Street on 18 April .
Their website warns :
' The changes in the legislation are a minefield ... given Britain 's litigation culture .
We have to fight it .
If not , we will go back to the Dark Ages , where we will be persecuted and prosecuted . '
The Fraudulent Mediums
Act replaced the 1735 Witchcraft Act .
The government is set to repeal it and many other laws alongside the introduction of the Consumer Protection Regulations .
If they are approved by Parliament , as is likely - there are debates in the Lords on 23 April and in the Commons on 6 May - the regulations will come into force on 26 May .
They will ban 31 types of unfair sales practice outright , including bogus closing - down sales , prize - draw scams and aggressive doorstep selling , and will for the first time establish a catch - all duty not to trade unfairly , closing loopholes that rogue traders have been able to exploit .
But spiritualists say the measures fail to take account of their religion .
' It is taking a religion , a way of life , and making it a commercial transaction , ' said David McEntee - Taylor .
' If we hold a service in a village hall , we have to charge or ask for a donation to cover the cost of hiring the hall .
There are bad mediums out there , and we would like to regulate them .
But this is unfair on genuine spiritualists .
Some people are very nervous of entrapment .'
Emma-Louise Rhodes , a researcher for BadPsychics , which seeks to expose malpractice , said : ' Hopefully , the new regulations will bring to justice those who have cruelly sought to exploit the bereaved for personal financial gain . '
A legal specialist said : ' Now there is no difference between a psychic and a double - glazing salesman in law . '
