Obama ’s unwillingness to cut capital gains tax rates is having disastrous results :
The number of Americans filing for first - time unemployment benefits surged last week to a level not seen since October 1982 , according to a government report released Thursday .
The number of initial jobless claims jumped to a much - higher - than - expected 626,000 in the week ended Jan , 31 , according to the Labor Department .
That ’s up from a revised 591,000 in the previous week and the highest level since the last week of October 1982 , when jobless claims reached 637,000 .
Clearly , the cause is the Democratic unwillingness to make the Bush tax cuts permanent .
What these people need is a serious cut to government programs and government waste so that the economy is stimulated .

In all seriousness , for those of you who think I am kidding :
The most sweeping of them , by Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) , failed on a mostly party - line vote of 61 - 36 .
It would have replaced the White House - backed legislation with a series of tax cuts on personal and business income and capital gains at the same time it made cuts passed during the Bush administration permanent .
Tax cuts are , to Republicans , secular creationism .

ISTANBUL --
As scientists around the world celebrate the 150th anniversary of Charles Darwin 's seminal work on evolution , Adnan Oktar , a college dropout turned theorist of Islamic creationism , is working on the fifth volume of a 14 - part masterwork that he says will bury Darwinism once and for all .
" Darwin and his theory are dead , " says Mr. Oktar , founder and honorary president of the Science Research Foundation , an Istanbul outfit dedicated to debunking the Victorian - era English naturalist .

( If you missed it before , here 's the link to the presentation slide deck over on slideshare . )
The announcement that Mary Barra will become the first female chief executive of General Motors is more than a human resources changeup .
It 's a nod to the changing times .
Her appointment culminates a period when women in the auto industry have been taking over senior roles in traditionally male - dominated areas like purchasing , manufacturing and quality control .
Eight years ago , three of GM's 54 - person senior leadership group were women .
Today , in a downsized company after its bankruptcy , six of GM 's top two dozen executives are women , including two of the company 's six senior vice presidents .
The other five top executives at the automaker are Victoria McInnis , chief tax officer ; Anne Larin , corporate secretary ; Melissa Howell , senior vice president for global human resources ; Grace Lieblein , vice president for global purchasing ; and Alicia Boler - Davis , senior vice president for gobal customer experience and quality .
" It 's become more welcoming , " Ms. Barra said last month in an interview .
" There are women in every aspect of the business . "
This generation of women started their careers in the late 1970s and 1980s — as Ms. Barra did at GM in 1980 — when they were often the only woman in a meeting .
They recall navigating a balance between fitting in while keeping their own view .
" There just were n't that many women in engineering or the leadership ranks , " said Ms. Lieblein in an interview in September .
" Pretty quickly , I learned how to maneuver . "
" Before , I 'd be the only woman in the room , " Ms. Lieblein said .
" Today , sometimes there will be three people in a meeting , and we 'll all be women . "
GM 's female leaders say that they did n't experience overt hostility while they rose through the ranks , but that the pressure to prove their qualifications was more intense than for their male counterparts .
" You spend so much of your career trying to demonstrate that you belong , that you deserve a seat at the table , " said Doneen McDowell , plant manager at GM's Detroit - Hamtramck assembly plant .
Ms Barra 's promotion will set an example for other women aspiring to leadership roles within the automotive industry , said Terry Barclay , chief executive and president of Inforum , Michigan 's largest women 's networking group .
" The ability of employees to look up at the top of the company and see people like themselves creates a sense of what 's possible and is a powerful motivator , " Ms. Barclay said .
" Unless there 's a deliberate effort , we hire mini me's .
It gets expressed as , ' Are they a good fit with our culture ? ' "
G.M. said that 21.8 per cent of its director - level and senior executive roles were now filled by women , compared with 19 percent in 2004 .
But that belies the magnitude of the change , industry insiders said .
" The kind of change I see is not a 2 per cent change , " Ms. Barclay said .
There 's a strong business case for including more women in decision - making positions , executives and analysts say , especially when women are making more than half of new car purchases .
" If this is viewed as a male , Midwestern company making cars and trucks that people wo n't buy , that 's a problem , " Mark Reuss , who will become G.M. 's new head of global product development and purchasing , told reporters in August .
The culture shift within GM's Renaissance Center headquarters is evident , Mr. Reuss said .
Instead of the old GM — a closed , inwardly focused culture that discouraged risk - taking — " the behavior is completely different , " he said .
" People are actually relaxed enough to be creative and try things they would n't normally try . "
Ms. Lieblein said she was the chief engineer on a team that developed GM 's larger crossover utility vehicles , the Buick Enclave , Chevy Traverse and GMC Acadia , in 2007 .
She and the three other women on the team decided to leave a gap at the bottom of the left foot rest to make room in case the driver wore a high - heel shoe .
" It was a really simple thing , and it did n't cost a lot of money , " she said .
The New York Times
Allstar
IN A classic horror film , “ Night of the Living Dead ” , a terrified group of people barricade themselves in a rural farmhouse to escape hordes of flesh - eating zombies .
Today Americans are gripped by a similar fear , but this time the walking corpses in their nightmares are banks , tearing insatiably at the public purse .
As the Obama administration struggles to get its poorly received bank - rescue plan up and running , it is being pressed to respond to suspicions that some large banks are on the edge of insolvency , if not already there .
In a matter of weeks nationalisation has gone from taboo to talking point .
Economists debate its pros and cons across the blogosphere .
Politicians on both left and right accept that America 's sickest banks may need to be taken over and restructured and their good parts returned to private ownership .
Even Alan Greenspan has become an advocate .
Although the government continues to resist such calls , its hand may be forced by the results of the “ stress tests ” that it began to perform on February 25th on the 19 largest banks .
Officials ' own stress levels are running in inverse relation to the banks ' share prices .
Those of Citigroup and Bank of America plumbed new lows on February 20th ( see chart 1 ) .
That prompted the Treasury and a group of regulators to declare that they stood “ firmly ” behind the banking system , but that their “ strong presumption ” was that banks would remain in private hands .
Ben Bernanke , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , went further , saying in congressional testimony this week that nationalisation “ is when the government seizes the bank and zeroes out the shareholders … we do n't plan anything like that . ”
Even so , the neediest banks are heading that way .
As The Economist went to press , the government was in talks with Citigroup over what would in essence be partial nationalisation : the conversion into common equity of a chunk of its preferred stock , obtained in return for pumping capital into Citi last year .
This would give it a stake of up to 40 % — eight times the holding of Prince Alwaleed bin Talal , the most influential existing shareholder — and voting power to match .
Citi approached regulators about the conversion , fearful of being swamped by further losses as the recession and housing crisis deepen .
The deal would mark the bank 's surrender in its battle to persuade investors that its reasonably healthy “ tier - one ” ratio is a convincing measure of capital adequacy .
These days markets prefer measures using tangible common equity , which is undiluted by hybrid capital such as preferred stock ( see article ) .
The government may end up repeating this across the industry .
The first step in its Capital Assistance Program will be the stress tests , which will take a few weeks .
The aim will be to map potential losses in a two - year recession with unemployment rising as high as 10.3 % and house prices continuing to tumble .
If the testing shows that banks need more capital , they can first try to raise it over six months from private sources .
If they fail , they will get government help .
The state will take preferred stock ( paying a 9 % dividend ) that converts into common equity if needed .
This strikes some as fiddly at a time when the markets crave boldness .
Drip - feeding equity as needed avoids the appearance of nationalisation .
But by adding to the complexity of banks ' capital structures and not revealing what would constitute adequate capital it risks sowing confusion about their ability to ride out losses .
Next for shaving
Nor has the government brought clarity to its treatment of bondholders , which was anything but consistent under the previous administration : Bear Stearns 's creditors got their money , Washington Mutual 's were all but wiped out .
Credit - default swaps on Citi have widened lately ( see chart 2 ) , as have those on other big banks .
This reflects fears that the state , in return for injecting more capital , might force a “ haircut ” on creditors , who sit above shareholders in the capital structure .
Compelling troubled banks to default on their debt may seem just .
Christopher Whalen , an independent banking analyst , argues that some banks ' bondholders may have to take a hit if depositors are to be made whole .
The danger , however , is that this causes the sort of liquidity runs that wreaked havoc after the demise of Lehman Brothers last September .
If bond investors are forced to share the pain , they may at least want some potential gain .
Some restructuring specialists have suggested that bondholders be handed shares in the most troubled banks through debt - for - equity swaps , a common device in non-financial corporate workouts .
That , however , would leave the banks partly owned by foreign governments and central banks .
American politicians may find this unpalatable .
Doubt also surrounds a centrepiece of the bail - out plan announced by Tim Geithner , the treasury secretary , on February 10th : a public - private partnership to buy distressed mortgages and other bad assets .
Mr Geithner envisages vulture investors snapping up as much as $ 1 trillion - worth of the stuff , helped by cheap government loans and perhaps a floor under prices .
But details are still being worked on , leaving potential participants sceptical of its merits .
Under Hank Paulson , his predecessor , two asset - buying plans foundered after proving unworkable .
Bank executives , meanwhile , are livid that they have not been consulted on the plan 's mechanics .
They also question the logic of performing stress tests that do not take account of the gains in store , at least for some banks , if a market for distressed assets takes off .
It could send the prices of the most illiquid securities up by 80 % in short order , reckons one chief executive .
Even if banks can offload at reasonable prices the dross they piled up in the boom , they have lots of other assets that will sour this year , from credit - card debt to corporate loans .
High - quality , or “ prime ” , mortgages look ever wobblier , too , as joblessness climbs towards 8 % .
American banks have recognised more than $ 1 trillion in credit losses , but most analysts think this is only around half the final tally .
The most pessimistic expect losses on American loans to reach $ 3 trillion - 4 trillion .
Regulators insist that the big banks are , by and large , well capitalised despite their flurry of write - offs .
Just as important , the industry as a whole is still producing fairly strong cash flows : higher in the rocky third quarter of 2008 than in the calm first quarter of 2007 , points out Dick Bove of Rochdale Research .
But this masks huge variation .
Some regional banks are thriving , especially those that avoided dodgy mortgages and loans to property developers .
Hudson City Bancorp , a New Jersey thrift that wrote only high - quality mortgages through the boom and insisted on down - payments of 20 % , recently announced record profits .
According to a survey by Greenwich Associates , such conservative lenders are picking up market share from rivals that rely on government support .
But Hudson is in the minority .
The number of banks on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 's problem list was expected to rise sharply , from 171 , when the FDIC published its quarterly update on February 26th , after The Economist went to press .
Fortunes vary among the giants , too .
No one doubts that the sums still needed to put Citi on a sure footing exceed its current market value of about $ 14 billion .
The capital conversion would be its third bail - out in four months .
Bank of America is also in poor shape , thanks to its disastrous purchase of Merrill Lynch and its heavy exposure to enfeebled consumers .
JPMorgan Chase , the healthiest of the big banks , is nevertheless taking no chances .
It cut its dividend this week to save $ 5 billion in equity .
It said this was a precaution , in case conditions worsen dramatically .
What should be done with “ systemically important ” banks that perform poorly in the stress test ?
Throwing yet more capital at them risks perpetuating what Paul Krugman , a Nobel prize - winning economist , calls “ lemon socialism ” , in which banks reap the gains but taxpayers eat the losses .
It was handouts without proper workouts that led to Japan 's “ lost decade ” .
Hence the growing calls for the clean break offered by temporary nationalisation — or “ conservatorship ” , as some prefer .
This involves several steps : ascertain which banks are insolvent , take them over , sever the most toxic assets and sell them over time or hold them to maturity .
The good parts would be sold to the public or a strategic buyer as quickly as is feasible .
These healthy banks would be fit to lend , benefiting the overall economy .
The taxpayer may even avoid losses .
This may present another opportunity : to accelerate the break - up of banks that have become too big to fail .
This was a problem before the crisis .
Shotgun takeovers of weaklings , such as Bear Stearns , Merrill and Wachovia , have made it worse .
Citi is considered particularly unmanageable .
Death and taxes
This degree of interference would strike some as un-American .
But the government 's tentacles are already wrapped around the banking industry , through debt guarantees , loss - sharing agreements , central - bank facilities and capital infusions , not to mention pay caps .
It may take up voting rights on its common stock .
As Mr Bernanke pointed out this week , banks cannot do whatever they like with capital they receive from the state .
Citi already has to clear strategic decisions with regulators .
Moreover , far from being an alien concept , nationalisation is , as Mr Krugman has put it , “ as American as apple pie ” .
Banks have often been seized by the state , in the form of the FDIC .
Some of them , such as Washington Mutual , have been big .
The FDIC runs those with assets that it cannot sell quickly , as it did with IndyMac , a Californian lender , before finding a group of private - equity buyers in January .
Even the most vocal proponents of this approach accept the need to tread with care .
Those banks deemed insolvent would have to be dealt with in one go , to avoid the seizure of one bank starting a run on the liabilities of others that are seen as weak , points out Nouriel Roubini of New York University 's Stern School .
That is not the only risk .
Political owners find it hard not to meddle : they have wasted no time turning America 's mortgage agencies and Northern Rock , a British bank , into tools of the state , or arm - twisting banks that took taxpayer money into modifying mortgages .
And state control tends to rattle nerves abroad .
Mexico 's authorities , for instance , are sure to frown on Citi 's local subsidiary , Banamex , falling into the hands of another government .
Moreover , the nationalisation of American International Group , an insurer , is no advertisement .
In state hands AIG has gone from bad to worse .
Already in hock to the taxpayer for $ 150 billion , it is estimated to have lost another $ 60 billion in the last quarter of 2008 and is reported to be in talks about a further bail - out and possible break - up .
Adding to its woe , the auction of an Asian subsidiary faltered this week .
Then there is the exit strategy .
Governments can become attached to banks they get their hands on .
Those that resist the temptation cannot always find buyers .
It took the FDIC seven years to sell Continental Illinois , which failed in 1984 .
Sweden deftly managed its overhaul and flotation of bust banks in the 1990s , but its financial system was much smaller and simpler than America 's today .
Finally , government takeovers are risky amid a systemic crisis because of the scale and distribution of creditors ' potential losses .
Jeffrey Gordon of Columbia Law School cites Citi as an example .
With total liabilities of $ 1.9 trillion and deposits of just $ 800 billion , not all of them insured , it has over $ 1.1 trillion of claims at risk in the event of a seizure .
Their value would depend on how much the receiver would get for the bank 's assets .
Were it to push for a quick sale , the price would doubtless be low , clobbering creditors that included pension and money - market funds .
Though full - blown nationalisation “ appeals to the desire for a clean sweep and the punitive distribution of losses ” , it is , Mr Gordon argues , a gamble .
Is there a way to deal with bombed - out banks that falls short of greatly increased government ownership ?
Some , nostalgic for the past , point to the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s .
Then , Western regulators went soft on their banks , allowing even the insolvent to limp along until they had regained enough strength to withstand the Brady - bond restructuring .
But that is an imperfect parallel .
The economy was in better shape , so it was easier for banks to return to health .
And there was no mark - to - market accounting .
Suspending that today would ease the burden on banks , but would also make it easier to avoid admitting to losses .
With such forbearance unlikely this time , greater state control seems inevitable , despite its drawbacks .
To keep recapitalising hopelessly insolvent banks without more draconian measures merely necessitates further bail - outs , argues Joseph Mason , an expert on banking crises at Louisiana State University .
He suggests the Depression as a model : the Reconstruction Finance Corporation ended up with effective control over large parts of the banking system .
It used its power to fire executives and shake up operations , with dramatic results .
In each successive crisis , he says , authorities have to relearn the lessons applied by private - equity firms : “ Keep control of the firm and the capital . ”
That is hard to swallow in a country that likes its capitalism red in tooth and claw .
But better a temporary ward of the state than a permanent zombie .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The 111th Congress has just barely begun as Senate Republicans brace for more grueling elections in 2010 that threaten to further weaken the party 's influence in Congress .
Sen . George Voinovich , a Republican from Ohio , will retire from the Senate when his term is up in 2010 .
The latest setback for the party came Monday , when Ohio Sen. George Voinovich -- the 72 year - old two - term GOP senator -- announced he will not seek reelection in 2010 .
That leaves Republicans with a highly vulnerable seat in a perennial swing state that has drifted Democratic in the last two elections .
Voinovich 's decision sent Ohio Republicans and Democrats scrambling ahead of what will likely be a competitive primary on both sides , and virtually guarantees the GOP will have to spend significantly more money defending a seat that otherwise would likely have been a safe bet .
Democrats control 58 seats in the Senate -- 59 if Al Franken 's lead in Minnesota 's recount withstands Norm Coleman 's legal challenge -- moving the party close to the 60 seats needed for a filibuster - proof majority .
" Republicans are starting the cycle on the defensive once again , it 's a familiar but uncomfortable position , " said Nathan Gonzalez of the Rothenberg Political Report .
Voinovich is the most recent in a string of four Republican senators -- some from crucial battlegrounds states -- to announce his retirement , rattling Republicans in an election cycle that already promises to be difficult .
Just last week , longtime Sen.
Kit Bond , R - Missouri , unexpectedly announced he would not seek reelection after more than two decades in the chamber , abruptly setting the stage for a competitive race in a state that 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain carried by less than 1 percentage point .
Sen .
Mel Martinez , R - Florida , the once - popular Cuban - American who has seen his approval ratings slump of late , also recently announced he would not seek reelection .
Jeb Bush , the popular brother of President Bush , announced last week he would not enter that race despite the urging of national Republicans .
Two - term Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback , a former Republican presidential candidate , is also retiring in 2010 to run for governor .
While Kansas is traditionally considered a red state , Democrats are buoyed by President - elect Barack Obama 's strong performance there and the prospect that the state 's popular Democratic governor , Kathleen Sebelius , may enter the race .
" A party would almost always have incumbents run for reelection rather than open seats , especially in swing states , " said Quinn McCord , the executive editor of the Hotline .
" These are exactly the type of seats Democrats have won the past two cycles when they have opened up . "
In all , Republicans must defend 15 incumbents in addition to the four open seats next year , a number that could increase if Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison , R - Texas , decides to mount a 2010 gubernatorial bid .
Watch as members of the 111th Congress are sworn in »
Meanwhile , Democrats have to defend 15 incumbents and two seats for which special elections are expected to be held .
Delaware will hold a special election for Vice President - elect Joe Biden 's seat and New York will hold one if Sen.
Hillary Clinton is confirmed as the next secretary of state .
More sobering for Republicans is the fact that few Democrats currently appear vulnerable , except perhaps for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , whose current approval numbers are slumping in his home state of Nevada .
But John Feehery , a Republican strategist and CNN contributor , said the GOP should n't panic just yet , especially considering Democrats control all three branches of government and the economy shows little signs of recovering in the near future .
" A lot depends on what happens in the next year with the economy and how [ President - elect ] Obama does --
That 's the great unknown . "
Feehery said .
" We 've had two really bad cycles in a row , and the Democrats are running everything now . "
Mid -term elections have historically not been kind to the party of the sitting president .
One exception was 2002 during Bush 's first term , when Republicans picked up seats in both houses .
Other Republicans are optimistic the wave of recent retirements offers the GOP a chance to move beyond its old guard and recruit fresh faces to inject the party with new energy .
" The reality is Bond and Voinovich both would have won reelection , but they would have been tough .
I 'd rather have someone who is 110 percent committed , gung - ho , has the energy , and wants to do that , rather than someone who is going through the motions , " a Senate Republican leadership aide said .
Senate Republicans are also eyeing one of Colorado 's Senate seats , recently vacated by Obama 's Interior Secretary - designate Ken Salazar .
To fill the remaining two years of the term , Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter , a Democrat , appointed Denver School Superintendent Michael Bennet -- a man who has never run for statewide office before .
" Republicans were handed a gift in Colorado , " the GOP leadership aide said .
" He 's not someone who has run a statewide race before or known around the state .
He 's not tested . "
Senate Democrats also face a few roadblocks :
Their top picks in Iowa and Arizona to take on Republican incumbents there have both been named to Obama 's Cabinet -- Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano and former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack .
Still , much of the GOP 's outlook will ultimately depend on how well Texas Sen.
John Cornyn -- the man tasked to head the Republicans Senate Campaign Committee -- can recruit strong and credible candidates amidst a playing field that clearly favors the opposition .
" The map itself is working against Republicans , it 's not clear yet where the vulnerable Democrats are , " McCord said .

With the Terrorism Act ( 2008 ) coming into effect on February 17th , police accountability has reached possibly its lowest level in the 25 years I 've been alive .
Thanks to this law , it is no longer safe to even photograph a police officer in the act of abusing their power , or neglecting to do their job .
At the same time the roll out of supposedly non-lethal Tasers to UK police forces continues unabated despite growing evidence demonstrating that these devices are neither safe or humane , nor can police be trusted with them .
See this article in the Telegraph from November 2008 where Jacqui Smith earmarked £ 8 million to the rollout of new Tasers : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3...

In an 1856 letter to his wife Mary Custis Lee , Robert E. Lee called slavery " a moral and political evil . "
Yet he concluded that black slaves were immeasurably better off here than in Africa , morally , socially and physically .
The fact is large numbers of free Negroes owned black slaves ; in fact , in numbers disproportionate to their representation in society at large .
In 1860 only a small minority of whites owned slaves .
According to the U.S. census report for that last year before the Civil War , there were nearly 27 million whites in the country .
Some eight million of them lived in the slaveholding states .
T he census also determined that there were fewer than 385,000 individuals who owned slaves ( 1 ) .
Even if all slaveholders had been white , that would amount to only 1.4 percent of whites in the country ( or 4.8 percent of southern whites owning one or more slaves ) .
In the rare instances when the ownership of slaves by free Negroes is acknowledged in the history books , justification centers on the claim that black slave masters were simply individuals who purchased the freedom of a spouse or child from a white slaveholder and had been unable to legally manumit them .
Although this did indeed happen at times , it is a misrepresentation of the majority of instances , one which is debunked by records of the period on blacks who owned slaves .
These include individuals such as Justus Angel and Mistress L. Horry , of Colleton District , South Carolina , who each owned 84 slaves in 1830 .
In fact , in 1830 a fourth of the free Negro slave masters in South Carolina owned 10 or more slaves ; eight owning 30 or more ( 2 ) .
According to federal census reports , on June 1 , 1860 there were nearly 4.5 million Negroes in the United States , with fewer than four million of them living in the southern slaveholding states .
Of the blacks residing in the South , 261,988 were not slaves .
Of this number , 10,689 lived in New Orleans .
The country 's leading African American historian , Duke University professor John Hope Franklin , records that in New Orleans over 3,000 free Negroes owned slaves , or 28 percent of the free Negroes in that city .
To return to the census figures quoted above , this 28 percent is certainly impressive when compared to less than 1.4 percent of all American whites and less than 4.8 percent of southern whites .
The statistics show that , when free , blacks disproportionately became slave masters .
The majority of slaveholders , white and black , owned only one to five slaves .
More often than not , and contrary to a century and a half of bullwhips - on - tortured - backs propaganda , black and white masters worked and ate alongside their charges ; be it in house , field or workshop .
The few individuals who owned 50 or more slaves were confined to the top one percent , and have been defined as slave magnates .
In 1860 there were at least six Negroes in Louisiana who owned 65 or more slaves
The largest number , 152 slaves , were owned by the widow C. Richards and her son P.C. Richards , who owned a large sugar cane plantation .
Another Negro slave magnate in Louisiana , with over 100 slaves , was Antoine Dubuclet , a sugar planter whose estate was valued at ( in 1860 dollars ) $ 264,000 ( 3 ) .
That year , the mean wealth of southern white men was $ 3,978 ( 4 ) .
In Charleston , South Carolina in 1860 125 free Negroes owned slaves ; six of them owning 10 or more .
Of the $ 1.5 million in taxable property owned by free Negroes in Charleston , more than $ 300,000 represented slave holdings ( 5 ) .
In North Carolina 69 free Negroes were slave owners ( 6 ) .
In 1860 William Ellison was South Carolina 's largest Negro slaveowner .
In Black Masters .
A Free Family of Color in the Old South , authors Michael P. Johnson and James L. Roak write a sympathetic account of Ellison 's life .
From Ellison 's birth as a slave to his death at 71 , the authors attempt to provide justification , based on their own speculation , as to why a former slave would become a magnate slave master .
At birth he was given the name April .
A common practice among slaves of the period was to name a child after the day or month of his or her birth .
Between 1800 and 1802 April was purchased by a white slave - owner named William Ellison .
Apprenticed at 12 , he was taught the trades of carpentry , blacksmithing and machining , as well as how to read , write , cipher and do basic bookkeeping .
On June 8 , 1816 , William Ellison appeared before a magistrate ( with five local freeholders as supporting witnesses ) to gain permission to free April , now 26 years of age .
In 1800 the South Carolina legislature had set out in detail the procedures for manumission .
To end the practice of freeing unruly slaves of " bad or depraved " character and those who " from age or infirmity " were incapacitated , the state required that an owner testify under oath to the good character of the slave he sought to free .
Also required was evidence of the slave 's " ability to gain a livelihood in an honest way . "
Although lawmakers of the time could not envision the incredibly vast public welfare structures of a later age , these stipulations became law in order to prevent slaveholders from freeing individuals who would become a burden on the general public .
Interestingly , considering today 's accounts of life under slavery , authors Johnson and Roak report instances where free Negroes petitioned to be allowed to become slaves ; this because they were unable to support themselves .
Black Confederates and Afro - Yankees in Civil War Virginia ( University Press of Virginia - 1995 ) was written by Ervin L. Jordan Jr. , an African - American and assistant professor and associate curator of the Special Collections Department , University of Virginia library .
He wrote : " One of the more curious aspects of the free black existence in Virginia was their ownership of slaves .
Black slave masters owned members of their family and freed them in their wills .
Free blacks were encouraged to sell themselves into slavery and had the right to choose their owner through a lengthy court procedure . "
In 1816 , shortly after his manumission , April moved to Stateburg .
Initially he hired slave workers from local owners .
When in 1817 he built a gin for Judge Thomas Watries , he credited the judge nine dollars " for hire of carpenter George for 12 days . "
By 1820 he had purchased two adult males to work in his shop ( 7 ) .
In fewer than four years after being freed , April demonstrated that he had no problem perpetuating an institution he had been released from .
He also achieved greater monetary success than most white people of the period .
On June 20 , 1820 , April appeared in the Sumter District courthouse in Sumterville .
Described in court papers submitted by his attorney as a " freed yellow man of about 29 years of age , " he requested a name change because it " would yet greatly advance his interest as a tradesman . "
A new name would also " save him and his children from degradation and contempt which the minds of some do and will attach to the name April . "
Because " of the kindness " of his former master and as a " Mark of gratitude and respect for him " April asked that his name be changed to William Ellison .
His request was granted .
In time the black Ellison family joined the predominantly white Episcopalian church .
On August 6 , 1824 he was allowed to put a family bench on the first floor , among those of the wealthy white families .
Other blacks , free and slave , and poor whites sat in the balcony .
Another wealthy Negro family would later join the first floor worshippers .
Between 1822 and the mid-1840s , Ellison gradually built a small empire , acquiring slaves in increasing numbers .
He became one of South Carolina 's major cotton gin manufacturers , selling his machines as far away as Mississippi .
From February 1817 until the War Between the States commenced , his business advertisements appeared regularly in newspapers across the state .
These included the Camden Gazette , the Sumter Southern Whig and the Black River Watchman .
Ellison was so successful , due to his utilization of cheap slave labor , that many white competitors went out of business .
Such situations discredit impressions that whites dealt only with other whites .
Where money was involved , it was apparent that neither Ellison 's race or former status were considerations .
In his book , Ervin L. Jordan Jr. writes that , as the great conflagration of 1861 - 1865 approached : " Free Afro-Virginians were a nascent black middle class under siege , but several acquired property before and during the war .
Approximately 169 free blacks owned 145,976 acres in the counties of Amelia , Amherst , Isle of Wight , Nansemond , Prince William and Surry , averaging 870 acres each .
Twenty - rune Petersburg blacks each owned property worth $ 1,000 and continued to purchase more despite the war . "
Jordan offers an example : " Gilbert Hunt , a Richmond ex-slave blacksmith , owned two slaves , a house valued at $ 1,376 , and $ 500 in other properties at his death in 1863 . "
Jordan wrote that " some free black residents of Hampton and Norfolk owned property of considerable value ; 17 black Hamptonians possessed property worth a total of $ 15,000 .
Thirty - six black men paid taxes as heads of families in Elizabeth City County and were employed as blacksmiths , bricklayers , fishermen , oystermen and day laborers .
In three Norfolk County parishes 160 blacks owned a total of $ 41,158 in real estate and personal property .
The general practice of the period was that plantation owners would buy seed and equip ~ ment on credit and settle their outstanding accounts when the annual cotton crop was sold .
Ellison , like all free Negroes , could resort to the courts for enforcement of the terms of contract agreements .
Several times Ellison successfully sued white men for money owed him .
In 1838 Ellison purchased on time 54.5 acres adjoining his original acreage from one Stephen D. Miller .
He moved into a large home on the property .
What made the acquisition notable was that Miller had served in the South Carolina legislature , both in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate , and while a resident of Stateburg had been governor of the state .
Ellison 's next door neighbor was Dr. W.W. Anderson , master of " Borough House , a magnificent 18th Century mansion .
Anderson 's son would win fame in the War Between the States as General " Fighting Dick " Anderson .
By 1847 Ellison owned over 350 acres , and more than 900 by 1860 .
He raised mostly cotton , with a small acreage set aside for cultivating foodstuffs to feed his family and slaves .
In 1840 he owned 30 slaves , and by 1860 he owned 63 .
His sons , who lived in homes on the property , owned an additional nine slaves .
They were trained as gin makers by their father ( 8 ) .
They had spent time in Canada , where many wealthy American Negroes of the period sent their children for advanced formal education .
Ellison 's sons and daughters married mulattos from Charleston , bringing them to the Ellison plantation to live .
In 1860 Ellison greatly underestimated his worth to tax assessors at $ 65,000 .
Even using this falsely stated figure , this man who had been a slave 44 years earlier had achieved great financial success .
His wealth outdistanced 90 percent of his white neighbors in Sumter District .
In the entire state , only five percent owned as much real estate as Ellison .
His wealth was 15 times greater than that of the state 's average for whites .
And Ellison owned more slaves than 99 percent of the South 's slaveholders .
Although a successful businessman and cotton farmer , Ellison 's major source of income derived from being a " slave breeder . "
Slave breeding was looked upon with disgust throughout the South , and the laws of most southern states forbade the sale of slaves under the age of 12 .
In several states it was illegal to sell inherited slaves ( 9 ) .
Nevertheless , in 1840 Ellison secretly began slave breeding .
While there was subsequent investment return in raising and keeping young males , females were not productive workers in his factory or his cotton fields .
As a result , except for a few females he raised to become " breeders , " Ellison sold the female and many of the male children born to his female slaves at an average price of $ 400 .
Ellison had a reputation as a harsh master .
His slaves were said to be the district 's worst fed and clothed .
On his property was located a small , windowless building where he would chain his problem slaves .
As with the slaves of his white counterparts , occasionally Ellison 's slaves ran away .
The historians of Sumter District reported that from time to time Ellison advertised for the return of his runaways .
On at least one occasion Ellison hired the services of a slave catcher .
According to an account by Robert N. Andrews , a white man who had purchased a small hotel in Stateburg in the 1820s , Ellison hired him to run down " a valuable slave .
Andrews caught the slave in Belleville , Virginia .
He stated : " I was paid on returning home $ 77.50 and $ 74 for expenses .
William Ellison died December 5 , 1861 .
His will stated that his estate should pass into the joint hands of his free daughter and his two surviving sons .
He bequeathed $ 500 to the slave daughter he had sold .
Following in their father 's footsteps , the Ellison family actively supported the Confederacy throughout the war .
They converted nearly their entire plantation to the production of corn , fodder , bacon , corn shucks and cotton for the Confederate armies .
They paid $ 5,000 in taxes during the war .
They also invested more than $ 9,000 in Confederate bonds , treasury notes and certificates in addition to the Confederate currency they held .
At the end , all this valuable paper became worthless .
The younger Ellisons contributed more than farm produce , labor and money to the Confederate cause .
On March 27 , 1863 John Wilson Buckner , William Ellison 's oldest grandson , enlisted in the 1st South Carolina Artillery .
Buckner served in the company of Captains P.P. Galliard and A.H. Boykin , local white men who knew that Buckner was a Negro .
Although it was illegal at the time for a Negro to formally join the Confederate forces , the Ellison family 's prestige nullified the law in the minds of Buckner 's comrades .
Buckner was wounded in action on July 12 , 1863 .
At his funeral in Stateburg in August , 1895 he was praised by his former Confederate officers as being a " faithful soldier . "
Following the war the Ellison family fortune quickly dwindled .
But many former Negro slave magnates quickly took advantage of circumstances and benefited by virtue of their race .
For example Antoine Dubuclet , the previously mentioned New Orleans plantation owner who held more than 100 slaves , became Louisiana state treasurer during Reconstruction , a post he held from 1868 to 1877 ( 10 ) .
A truer picture of the Old South , one never presented by the nation 's mind molders , emerges from this account .
The American South had been undergoing structural evolutionary changes far , far greater than generations of Americans have been led to believe .
In time , within a relatively short time , the obsolete and economically nonviable institution of slavery would have disappeared .
The nation would have been spared awesome traumas from which it would never fully recover .

The BBC has refused to broadcast a national humanitarian appeal for Gaza , leaving aid agencies with a potential shortfall of millions of pounds in donations .
The Disasters Emergency Committee ( DEC ) , an umbrella organisation for 13 aid charities , launched its appealtoday saying the devastation in Gaza was " so huge that British aid agencies were compelled to act " .
But the BBC made a rare breach of an agreement dating back to 1963 when it announced it would not give free airtime to the appeal .
Other broadcasters then followed suit .
Previously , broadcasters have agreed on the video and script to be used with the DEC , with each station choosing a presenter to front the appeal , shown after primetime news bulletins .
The BBC said it was not the first time broadcasters had refused to show a DEC appeal .
The corporation said it had been concerned about the difficulties of getting aid through to victims in a volatile situation .
The BBC , which has faced criticism in the past over alleged bias in its coverage of the Middle East , said it did not want to risk public confidence in its impartiality .
The DEC 's chief executive , Brendan Gormley , said the decision could have a big impact on its appeal .
" We are used to our appeal getting into every household and offering a safe and necessary way for people to respond .
This time we will have to work a lot harder because we wo n't have the free airtime or the powerful impact of appearing on every TV and radio station . "
DEC appeals have recently raised £ 10 m for the Congo and £ 18 m for Burma .
Gormley rejected the BBC 's claim that it was difficult for aid to reach those in need , saying 100 lorries a day were entering Gaza .
He challenged the corporation 's concerns about impartiality .
" We are totally apolitical and are driven by the principles of the Geneva conventions in terms of impartiality and neutrality .
This appeal is a response to those humanitarian principles .
The BBC seems to be confusing impartiality with equal airtime . "
A BBC spokesperson said : " Along with other broadcasters , the BBC has decided not to broadcast the DEC 's public appeal to raise funds for Gaza .
The BBC decision was made because of question marks about the delivery of aid in a volatile situation and also to avoid any risk of compromising public confidence in the BBC 's impartiality in the context of an ongoing news story .
However , the BBC will of course continue to report the humanitarian story in Gaza . "
ITV said : " The DEC asked all broadcasters if they could support the appeal .
We ( the broadcasters ) assessed the DEC 's requirements carefully against the agreed criteria and we were unable to reach the consensus necessary for an appeal . "
Sky said : " We were considering this request internally when the DEC contacted us to let us know that the BBC had decided not to broadcast the appeal at this time .
As , by convention , if all broadcasters do not carry the appeal then none do , the decision was effectively made for us . "
BOCA RATON , Fla./NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. retailers are increasingly pitting their own products against national brands to win sales and that battle will only get fiercer in a prolonged recession .
Shoppers are pictured in front of a Target discount store at the Glendale Galleria shopping mall on Black Friday in Glendale , California November 28 , 2008 .

From Wal - Mart Stores Inc to Target Corp to drugstore chains , retailers are trying to boost profits by introducing or revamping their own branded products , such as food , tissues and detergent .
While none have talked about abandoning national brands , retailers are taking over more of the shelf space in their stores and promoting their own lower - priced private brands .
They are also cutting back on how much they keep in stock as shoppers buy less .
That means branded product makers must show consumers their brands are worth paying for .
Some , like Procter & Gamble Co , are using more coupons and highlighting value in their advertising .
But so are retailers .
At the Walgreens Co store in Times Square , shoppers needing laundry detergent can choose a 100 - ounce bottle of P&G ’s Tide for $ 18.49 , pay $ 15.99 for the same sized bottle of Gain , also from P&G , or reach to the right and pick up Walgreen ’s own brand for $ 10.99 .
If shoppers do not want to calculate the savings , Walgreen is eager to do it for them .
A tag below its “ W ” brand of detergent tells shoppers they will save $ 5 if they buy its product instead of Gain .
Manufacturers are meeting analysts and investors at the annual Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference this week and the rise of retail brands is on their minds .
“ I think there will be questions and concerns about increased private label usage and the effect on branded products , ” Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said .
Investors will not have to wait long to find out what ’s in store when it comes to the brand battle .
P&G , Kimberly - Clark Corp and Clorox
Co are among the companies speaking at CAGNY on Thursday , the same day that CVS Caremark Corp issues quarterly results and gives an update on its business .
CROWDING OUT BRANDS
So far , consumers seem willing to try store brands for tissues , paper towels and other such products , while they tend to stick to brands they trust for items they ingest or put on their bodies .
In a poll conducted for Reuters by SheSpeaks , a marketing firm , almost 600 women were asked if they had to , would they replace a household product , such as paper towels , with a cheaper generic version , or would they replace a brand name personal care product , such as face cream .
More than 87 percent said they were more likely to replace the household product , while only 13 percent said they would choose to replace the personal care product .
Colgate - Palmolive
Co said in late January it had not seen meaningful growth of cheaper private - label items in its categories , which include toothpaste , dishwashing liquid and high - end pet food .
But Arm & Hammer maker Church & Dwight Co Inc warned in early February that retailers who added more private brands to their shelves were pressuring the market .
Some more personal items are also not immune .
Sales of Energizer Holdings Inc ’s Playtex Gentle Glide tampons declined in the most recent quarter , due in part to private label growth .
STIFFER COMPETITION
And the competition is only going to get stiffer .
“ The focus on private label in the U.S. among grocers , warehouse clubs and drugstores is greater than in any time in our history , and the quality gap between branded and private - label offerings has shrunk to near zero in many categories , ” wrote Morningstar in a research note previewing major themes of the CAGNY conference .
Walgreen saw a double - digit percentage jump in private label sales during the last three months of 2008 , as consumers really started to look for value .
Now , about 21 percent of non- pharmacy sales at Walgreen come from private brands , excluding greeting cards , film and cigarettes .
At rival CVS , private label accounted for 15.5 percent of front - end sales in the third quarter , up 111 basis points from a year earlier .
And CVS plans to increase that to 18 percent to 20 percent .
“ A consumer who is really brand - loyal in this economy , has tried the private label and we think the quality of our private label is pretty good and they will come back and use it .
So , we continue to see that growing , ” Chairman and CEO Tom Ryan said in late October .
Meanwhile , Wal - Mart is relaunching its Great Value private brand , which includes 5,500 unique food and household items .
It is improving the quality and value of the line and the rebranded products will arrive on its shelves in March .
Not to miss out , Target is increasing the presence of private brands in it stores and dedicating more space in its weekly circulars to them .
And Rite Aid Corp is even launching its own line of suntan lotions , lip balm and other products called Rx Suncare , all priced under $ 10 .

I probably need to find a better solution ( like using lhs and attaching pdfs or something ) .
In the recent discussion about run length encoding , one thing people focused on was the use of the &&& operator and how noone understands arrows so &&& is scary and arcane .
I feel perfectly placed to comment on this , because I do n’t understand arrows either . :-)
I cheerfully abuse the arrow operators for their function instance without really worrying about that , and it seems to work fine .
So , this is just a rundown of what the arrow operations do for the function instance , in order to make them seem less scary .
I might follow up with looking at Kleisli arrows later ( which are arrows that arise from monads in a natural way ) .
The arrow class is defined as follows :
class Arrow a where arr :: ( b -> c ) -> a b c pure :: ( b -> c ) -> a b c ( >>> ) :: a b c -> a c d -> a b d first :: a b c -> a ( b , d ) ( c , d ) second :: a b c -> a ( d , b ) ( d , c ) (***) :: a b c -> a b' c' -> a ( b , b ' ) ( c , c ' ) ( &&& ) :: a b c -> a b c' -> a b ( c , c ' )
The first two are totally uninteresting for functions ( they ’re just the identity ) .
So if we cut those out and specialise the signatures to functions we get the following :
(>>>) :: ( b -> c ) -> ( c -> d ) -> ( b -> d ) first :: ( b -> c ) -> ( b , d ) -> ( c , d ) second :: ( b -> c ) -> ( d , b ) -> ( d , c ) (***) :: ( b -> c ) -> ( b ' -> c' ) -> ( b , b ' ) -> ( c , c ' ) ( &&& ) :: ( b -> c ) -> ( b -> c' ) -> b -> ( c , c ' )
i.e. these are basically all operators for manipulating combinations of pairs and functions .
Most of these you can probably infer the purpose of from their types and names , but I ’ll go through them anyway .
We ’ve already encountered &&& , and it ’s the one I use the most , so I ’ll go through these in reverse order .
The &&& operator is in fact very simple , but it ’s the arrow operator I use the most .
Consider the following :
> ( +1 ) &&& ( +2 ) $ 3 ( 4 , 5 )
i.e. f &&& g when applied to x just evaluates both and returns them as a pairs of both results .
We could define this as :
( &&& ) :: ( a -> b ) -> ( a -> c ) -> ( a -> ( b , c ) ) ( f &&& g ) x = ( f x , g x )
For example , in the run length encoding article we had the function head &&& length :
> head &&& length $ [ 1 , 3 ] ( 1,2 )
In a similar usage to the RLE article , I ’ve often found the following sort of trick useful :
map ( head &&& length ) .
group .
sort
This counts frequencies of elements in a list .
> map ( head &&& length ) .
group .
sort $ [ " foo " , " bar " , " foo " , " baz " ] [ ( " bar " , 1 ) , ( " baz " , 1 ) , ( " foo " , 2 ) ]
Now ***.
> ( +1 ) *** ( +2 ) $ ( 3 , 4 ) ( 4 , 6 )
i.e. f *** g applied to ( x , y ) returns ( f x , g y ) .
Or , in a more readable form :
(***) :: ( b -> c ) -> ( b ' -> c' ) -> ( b , b ' ) -> ( c , c ' ) ( f *** g ) ( x , y ) = ( f x , g y )
I do n’t really have an obvious use case for this one .
I ’m sure they exist though .
I ’m going to pick up the speed now , as I ’m getting bored and so you probably are too . :-)
(>>>) :: ( b -> c ) -> ( c -> d ) -> ( b -> d ) ( f >>> g ) x = g ( f x )
Or in other words , >>> is just reverse function composition .
So we could have written this as
(>>>) :: ( b -> c ) -> ( c -> d ) -> ( b -> d ) ( f >>> g ) x = g . f
Or
(>>>) :: ( b -> c ) -> ( c -> d ) -> ( b -> d ) ( >>>) = flip (. )
Now for first and second :
first :: ( b -> c ) -> ( b , d ) -> ( c , d ) first f ( x , y ) = ( f x , y ) second :: ( b -> c ) -> ( d , b ) -> ( d , c ) second f ( x , y ) = ( x , f y )
i .e . These just take a function and apply it to the first or second entry of a tuple , leaving the other unchanged .
Those are all the core arrow operations .
There are a few derived operations , but the only one which is at all interesting for functions is << class Arrow a => ArrowChoice a where left :: a b c -> a ( Either b d ) ( Either c d ) right :: a b c -> a ( Either d b ) ( Either d c ) (+++ ) :: a b c -> a b’ c’ -> a ( Either b b ’) ( Either c c ’ ) ( | || ) :: a b d -> a c d -> a ( Either b c ) d
Specialised to functions :
left :: ( b -> c ) -> ( Either b d ) ->
( Either c d ) right :: ( b -> c ) -> ( Either d b ) -> ( Either d c ) (+++ ) :: ( b -> c ) -> ( b ' -> c ' ) -> ( Either b b ' ) -> ( Either c c ' ) ( | | | ) :: ( b -> d ) -> ( c -> d ) -> ( Either b c ) -> d
Lets jump straight to writing out some definitions :
left :: ( b -> c ) -> ( Either b d ) ->
( Either c d ) left f ( Left x ) = Left $ f x left _ ( Right y ) = Right y right :: ( b -> c ) -> ( Either d b ) ->
( Either d c ) right f ( Right x ) = Right $ f x right _ ( Left y ) = Left y ( +++ ) :: ( b -> c ) -> ( b ' -> c ' ) -> ( Either b b ' ) -> ( Either c c ' ) ( f +++ g ) ( Left x ) = Left $ f x ( f +++ g ) ( Right x ) = Right $ g x ( | | | ) :: ( b -> d ) -> ( c -> d ) -> ( Either b c ) -> d ( f | || g ) ( Left x ) = f x ( f | || g ) ( Right x ) = g x
i.e. left f applies f to the left option of an Either and leaves the right option alone .
> left ( +1 ) $ Left 2 Left 3 > left ( +1 ) $ Right 2 Right 2
right does the reverse .
f +++ g applies f to the left option and g to the right :
> ( +1 ) +++ ( +2 ) $ Left 2 Left 3 > ( +1 ) +++ ( +2 ) $ Right 2 Right 4
So we could have implemented left and right ( and indeed , this is how they ’re actually implemented in the real instance declaration ) as follows :
left :: ( b -> c ) -> ( Either b d ) ->
( Either c d ) left f = f +++ id right :: ( b -> c ) -> ( Either d b ) ->
( Either d c ) right f = id +++ f
Or even as ( +++id ) and ( id +++ ) .
Finally , ( f | || g ) x is basically just a combinator for case matching , applying f if we have a Left value , g if we have a Right .
It ’s just the standard ‘ either ’ function but it can be nice to have it available as an operator .
> ( +1 ) ||| ( +2 ) $ Left 2 3 > ( +1 ) ||| ( +2 ) $ Right 2 4
So , there you have it .
Arrow operations .
Not too scary , and now you have a bunch of new combinators to play with .
I doubt it will revolutionise your Haskell code , but every now and then they allow for a really neat solution you would n’t otherwise have thought of .
Have fun .

Bush 's farewell
George W. Bush 's farewell speech brings his presidency back to its defining event , the terror attacks less than nine months after he took office .
The relatively short speech , with the conventional congratulations to his successor gratitude for his elections and mentions of ordinary citizens , focuses on 9/11 and its consequences .
In the prepared remarks out early , and without embargo , he 's expected to say :
This evening , my thoughts return to the first night I addressed you from this house – September 11 , 2001 .
That morning , terrorists took nearly 3,000 lives in the worst attack on America since Pearl Harbor .
I remember standing in the rubble of the World Trade Center three days later , surrounded by rescuers who had been working around the clock .
I remember talking to brave souls who charged through smoke - filled corridors at the Pentagon and to husbands and wives whose loved ones became heroes aboard Flight 93 .
I remember Arlene Howard , who gave me her fallen son ’s police shield as a reminder of all that was lost .
And I still carry his badge ....
The battles waged by our troops are part of a broader struggle between two dramatically different systems .
Under one , a small band of fanatics demands total obedience to an oppressive ideology , condemns women to subservience , and marks unbelievers for murder .
The other system is based on the conviction that freedom is the universal gift of Almighty God and that liberty and justice light the path to peace .
Bush expresses a hint of regret at things he might have done differently , but mostly argues that his presidency is more successful than currently perceived .
" There is legitimate debate about many of these decisions .
But there can be little debate about the results .
America has gone more than seven years without another terrorist attack on our soil , " he 's to say of his national security policy .
His successor is mentioned in the opening , in the same narrative terms in which Obama frames himself :
Five days from now , the world will witness the vitality of American democracy .
In a tradition dating back to our founding , the presidency will pass to a successor chosen by you , the American people .
Standing on the steps of the Capitol will be a man whose story reflects the enduring promise of our land .
This is a moment of hope and pride for our whole Nation .
And I join all Americans in offering best wishes to President - elect Obama , his wife Michelle , and their two beautiful girls .
Full prepared remarks after the jump .
For Immediate Release January 15 , 2009
FAREWELL ADDRESS TO THE NATION
As Prepared for Delivery
Fellow citizens :
For eight years , it has been my honor to serve as your President .
The first decade of this new century has been a period of consequence – a time set apart .
Tonight , with a thankful heart , I have asked for a final opportunity to share some thoughts on the journey we have traveled together and the future of our Nation .
Five days from now , the world will witness the vitality of American democracy .
In a tradition dating back to our founding , the presidency will pass to a successor chosen by you , the American people .
Standing on the steps of the Capitol will be a man whose story reflects the enduring promise of our land .
This is a moment of hope and pride for our whole Nation .
And I join all Americans in offering best wishes to President - elect Obama , his wife Michelle , and their two beautiful girls .
Tonight I am filled with gratitude – to Vice President Cheney and members of the Administration ; to Laura , who brought joy to this house and love to my life ; to our wonderful daughters , Barbara and Jenna ; to my parents , whose examples have provided strength for a lifetime .
And above all , I thank the American people for the trust you have given me .
I thank you for the prayers that have lifted my spirits .
And I thank you for the countless acts of courage , generosity , and grace that I have witnessed these past eight years .
This evening , my thoughts return to the first night I addressed you from this house – September 11 , 2001 .
That morning , terrorists took nearly 3,000 lives in the worst attack on America since Pearl Harbor .
I remember standing in the rubble of the World Trade Center three days later , surrounded by rescuers who had been working around the clock .
I remember talking to brave souls who charged through smoke - filled corridors at the Pentagon and to husbands and wives whose loved ones became heroes aboard Flight 93 .
I remember Arlene Howard , who gave me her fallen son ’s police shield as a reminder of all that was lost .
And I still carry his badge .
As the years passed , most Americans were able to return to life much as it had been before Nine - Eleven .
But I never did .
Every morning , I received a briefing on the threats to our Nation .
And I vowed to do everything in my power to keep us safe .
Over the past seven years , a new Department of Homeland Security has been created .
The military , the intelligence community , and the FBI have been transformed .
Our Nation is equipped with new tools to monitor the terrorists ’ movements , freeze their finances , and break up their plots .
And with strong allies at our side , we have taken the fight to the terrorists and those who support them .
Afghanistan has gone from a nation where the Taliban harbored al Qaeda and stoned women in the streets to a young democracy that is fighting terror and encouraging girls to go to school .
Iraq has gone from a brutal dictatorship and a sworn enemy of America to an Arab democracy at the heart of the Middle East and a friend of the United States .
There is legitimate debate about many of these decisions .
But there can be little debate about the results .
America has gone more than seven years without another terrorist attack on our soil .
This is a tribute to those who toil day and night to keep us safe – law enforcement officers , intelligence analysts , homeland security and diplomatic personnel , and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces .
Our Nation is blessed to have citizens who volunteer to defend us in this time of danger .
I have cherished meeting these selfless patriots and their families .
America owes you a debt of gratitude .
And to all our men and women in uniform listening tonight :
There has been no higher honor than serving as your Commander in Chief .
The battles waged by our troops are part of a broader struggle between two dramatically different systems .
Under one , a small band of fanatics demands total obedience to an oppressive ideology , condemns women to subservience , and marks unbelievers for murder .
The other system is based on the conviction that freedom is the universal gift of Almighty God and that liberty and justice light the path to peace .
This is the belief that gave birth to our Nation .
And in the long run , advancing this belief is the only practical way to protect our citizens .
When people live in freedom , they do not willingly choose leaders who pursue campaigns of terror .
When people have hope in the future , they will not cede their lives to violence and extremism .
So around the world , America is promoting human liberty , human rights , and human dignity .
We are standing with dissidents and young democracies , providing AIDS medicine to bring dying patients back to life , and sparing mothers and babies from malaria .
And this great republic born alone in liberty is leading the world toward a new age when freedom belongs to all nations .
For eight years , we have also strived to expand opportunity and hope here at home .
Across our country , students are rising to meet higher standards in public schools .
A new Medicare prescription drug benefit is bringing peace of mind to seniors and the disabled .
Every taxpayer pays lower income taxes .
The addicted and suffering are finding new hope through faith - based programs .
Vulnerable human life is better protected .
Funding for our veterans has nearly doubled .
America ’s air , water , and lands are measurably cleaner .
And the Federal bench includes wise new members like Justice Sam Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts .
When challenges to our prosperity emerged , we rose to meet them .
Facing the prospect of a financial collapse , we took decisive measures to safeguard our economy .
These are very tough times for hardworking families , but the toll would be far worse if we had not acted .
All Americans are in this together .
And together , with determination and hard work , we will restore our economy to the path of growth .
We will show the world once again the resilience of America ’s free enterprise system .
Like all who have held this office before me , I have experienced setbacks .
There are things I would do differently if given the chance .
Yet I have always acted with the best interests of our country in mind .
I have followed my conscience and done what I thought was right .
You may not agree with some tough decisions I have made .
But I hope you can agree that I was willing to make the tough decisions .
The decades ahead will bring more hard choices for our country , and there are some guiding principles that should shape our course .
While our Nation is safer than it was seven years ago , the gravest threat to our people remains another terrorist attack .
Our enemies are patient and determined to strike again .
America did nothing to seek or deserve this conflict .
But we have been given solemn responsibilities , and we must meet them .
We must resist complacency .
We must keep our resolve .
And we must never let down our guard .
At the same time , we must continue to engage the world with confidence and clear purpose .
In the face of threats from abroad , it can be tempting to seek comfort by turning inward .
But we must reject isolationism and its companion , protectionism .
Retreating behind our borders would only invite danger .
In the 21st century , security and prosperity at home depend on the expansion of liberty abroad .
If America does not lead the cause of freedom , that cause will not be led .
As we address these challenges – and others we cannot foresee tonight – America must maintain our moral clarity .
I have often spoken to you about good and evil .
This has made some uncomfortable .
But good and evil are present in this world , and between the two there can be no compromise .
Murdering the innocent to advance an ideology is wrong every time , everywhere .
Freeing people from oppression and despair is eternally right .
This Nation must continue to speak out for justice and truth .
We must always be willing to act in their defense and to advance the cause of peace .
President Thomas Jefferson once wrote , “ I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past . ”
As I leave the house he occupied two centuries ago , I share that optimism .
America is a young country , full of vitality , constantly growing and renewing itself .
And even in the toughest times , we lift our eyes to the broad horizon ahead .
I have confidence in the promise of America because I know the character of our people .
This is a Nation that inspires immigrants to risk everything for the dream of freedom .
This is a Nation where citizens show calm in times of danger and compassion in the face of suffering .
We see examples of America ’s character all around us .
And Laura and I have invited some of them to join us in the White House this evening .
We see America ’s character in Dr. Tony Recasner , a principal who opened a new charter school from the ruins of Hurricane Katrina .
We see it in Julio Medina , a former inmate who leads a faith - based program to help prisoners returning to society .
We see it in Staff Sergeant Aubrey McDade , who charged into an ambush in Iraq and rescued three of his fellow Marines .
We see America ’s character in Bill Krissoff , a surgeon from California .
His son Nathan , a Marine , gave his life in Iraq .
When I met Dr. Krissoff and his family , he delivered some surprising news :
He told me he wanted to join the Navy Medical Corps in honor of his son .
This good man was 60 years old – 18 years above the age limit .
But his petition for a waiver was granted , and for the past year he has trained in battlefield medicine .
Lieutenant Commander Krissoff could not be here tonight , because he will soon deploy to Iraq , where he will help save America ’s wounded warriors and uphold the legacy of his fallen son .
In citizens like these , we see the best of our country – resilient and hopeful , caring and strong .
These virtues give me an unshakable faith in America .
We have faced danger and trial , and there is more ahead .
But with the courage of our people and confidence in our ideals , this great Nation will never tire … never falter … and never fail .
It has been the privilege of a lifetime to serve as your President .
There have been good days and tough days .
But every day I have been inspired by the greatness of our country and uplifted by the goodness of our people .
I have been blessed to represent this Nation we love .
And I will always be honored to carry a title that means more to me than any other : citizen of the United States of America .
And so , my fellow Americans , for the final time : Good night .
May God bless this house and our next President .
And may God bless you and our wonderful country .
WAREGADUD , Kenya ( Reuters ) - Clouds of dust rising above the harsh scrub herald the arrival of more livestock at a borehole in northeastern Kenya , the end for some of a 45 - km ( 28 - mile ) trek for water that must be repeated every few days .

Drought is starting to bite in east Africa ’s biggest economy and the government has declared a state of emergency , saying 10 million people may face hunger and starvation after a poor harvest , crop failure , a lack of rain and rising food prices .
For an economy still recovering from post-election violence last year and facing fallout from the global slowdown on export markets , Kenya ’s looming food crisis risks putting more pressure on its fragile coalition government .
Kenyans have been horrified by multi-million dollar government graft scandals in the maize and fuel sectors in the middle of the food shortage , and at a time when the administration is appealing for international food aid .
The Kenya Food Security Meeting ( KFSM ) , a coordinating body of government ministries and non-governmental organizations , said last month food security was critical for 3.7 million people , including half a million schoolchildren .
“ High food and non -food prices , livestock disease , crop failure and conflict have compounded already precarious food insecurity , ” the KFSM said in its January update .
It said rains at the end of 2008 were generally poor after three successive poor seasons .
In the area around Waregadud in Mandera , rainfall was just 10 to 20 percent of normal levels in the October - December period .
The Mandera region bordering Ethiopia and Somalia -- like much of Kenya -- is prone to drought .
The lack of rain has left dams dry , pasture is dwindling and herders say tension is rising as animals and humans compete for resources .

SKIPPING MEALS
Abduallahi Abdi , head of the village council that manages the borehole at Waregadud , worries that children are becoming malnourished because of a persistently poor diet .
“ We are skipping meals .
We eat just one meal at night , ” he said .
“ In the next few weeks , things are likely to become serious as we are already in a dire situation . ”
“ If we do n’t get assistance before then we will start getting human deaths , ” Abdi said .
“ It is shameful to ask for help -- we do it with a lot of reservations -- but when things are out of hand we have no choice . ”
The problem Kenya and neighboring drought - prone countries in the Horn of Africa face is that traditional donors struggling with economic crisis are not meeting aid demands .
Aid workers say , while drought is a regular feature here , this time the crisis has been compounded by high food and fuel prices worldwide , and in Kenya by post- election violence that meant farmers in the fertile Rift Valley failed to plant crops .
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies ( IFRC ) launched an appeal for $ 95 million in December to help those at risk of starvation in the Horn of Africa , but it says pledges so far have met just 6 percent of the appeal .
“ When the governments of the world are busy bailing out car companies ... it ’s a shame that for a fraction of that they ca n’t intervene to save millions , ” said Andrei Engstrand - Neacsu , IFRC communications officer for east Africa .
In the hamlet of Qalanqlesa in Mandera , a sprawl of traditional huts in a stark landscape of dust and grey , leafless trees , village chairman Aden Hassan says herders trekked 55 km ( 34 miles ) in search of pasture but were turned back by other pastoralists .
They have a small borehole nearby but the quest for water has doubled the size of the village since December and they have started to ration the precious commodity .
“ Competition for scarce resources is becoming acute ... there is a lot of friction , ” Hassan said .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Marijuana use may increase the risk of developing testicular cancer , in particular a more aggressive form of the disease , according to a U.S. study published on Monday .

The study of 369 Seattle - area men ages 18 to 44 with testicular cancer and 979 men in the same age bracket without the disease found that current marijuana users were 70 percent more likely to develop it compared to nonusers .
The risk appeared to be highest among men who had reported smoking marijuana for at least 10 years , used it more than once a week or started using it before age 18 , the researchers wrote in the journal Cancer .
Stephen Schwartz of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle , one of the researchers , said the study was the first to explore marijuana ’s possible association with testicular cancer .
“ This is the first study to look at this question , and by itself is not definitive .
And there ’s a lot more research that would have to be done in order to be more confident that marijuana use really is important in a man ’s risk of developing testicular cancer , ” Schwartz said in a telephone interview .
The study found the increased risk appeared to be in the form called nonseminoma testicular cancer .
It accounts for 40 percent of cases and can be more aggressive and more difficult to treat , Schwartz said .
Experts are unsure about the causes of testicular cancer , which often strikes men in their 20s and 30s .
The disease is seen more commonly in men who have had an undescended testicle or have a family history of testicular cancer .
The disease usually responds well to treatment and has a five - year survival rate of about 96 percent , according to the American Cancer Society .
About 8,000 men in the United States are diagnosed with testicular cancer per year , and there are about 140,000 U.S. men alive who have survived the disease , the group said .
The researchers said they were not sure what it was about marijuana that may raise the risk .
Chronic marijuana use also can have effects on the male reproductive system including decreased sperm quality , they said .
SCP -654
Item # : SCP - 654
Object Class : Euclid
Special Containment Procedures : A habitat has been constructed for SCP - 654 in Sub - Level 12 of Sector - 28 .
The chamber is to be kept at a temperature of approximately - 5 °C , and saltwater is to be circulated throughout the aquatic enclosure .
Chamber walls outside of the aquatic enclosure have been plated with insulating ceramic composite .
A staff of handlers , composed of Security Clearance Level 1 personnel and headed by staff marine biologist Dr. Earles , works in shifts of three in eight hour rotations to maintain feeding and medical examination schedules .
Cleaning of the habitat is assigned to standard Sub - Level custodial staff , to whom personal Plexiglas shielding is allotted in case of incident .
Description : SCP - 654 , colloquially referred to as “ Thunderhorn ” by its handlers , is a male narwhal ( Monodon monoceros ) , visually disparate from others of its species only in that its characteristic spiral tusk has grown in a clockwise helix from the jaw , rather than the counterclockwise helix found in all other examined narwhals to date .
The other , notably more significant unique quality of SCP - 654 is its ability to emit sudden bursts of electrostatic discharge from the apex of its tusk .
The discharge is reminiscent of lightning , and is accompanied by a loud crack of sound .
While not particularly accurate , the tusk can be used to direct the discharge , and SCP - 654 had previously been observed in the wild making use of this ability : the mechanism , heretofore referred to as the “ Stephens effect , ” after its discoverer , SCP marine researcher ( now project head of SCP - 654 studies ) Dr. ████ █ Stephens , had been adapted for use in hunting harp seals , SCP - 654 being so bold as to uncharacteristically attack adults of the species , and having developed a taste for the cooked flesh .
Discovered by the northern shore of Hudson Bay in late 1982 , SCP - 654 had apparently been separated from its pod by clashing ice floes .
Current speculation is that , unable to escape through Hudson Strait , it had become frustrated , and tried to clear a path through the closed passage .
Conservation officers operating in Polar Bear Provincial Park had documented an “ Unseasonal lightning strike , ” and had been sent to quash a possible forest fire .
Having found only a large amount of strangely melted ice , and the charred remains of three polar bears , an incident report was filed , triggering an investigation by Sector - 28 Northern operatives upon submission .
A full sweep of the bay was ordered , until SCP - 654 was discovered .
After a short corralling , it was sedated , placed into a porpoise stretcher , and airlifted to a park landing strip .
From there , it was transported by privately - rented jet , sedated for the duration of the flight , to Sector - 28 , where it was held in the Sub - Level 13 flooded cavern until its habitat could be constructed .
Addendum 654-A : Pod migration
While tracking the pod SCP - 654 had belonged to , to determine whether similar mutations had presented themselves , researchers Robertson , Jones , and Voth discovered that Hudson Bay is not in the pod ’s usual migratory path .
Aside from the one recorded instance , it had carefully avoided the strait , most likely to avoid the conflicting ice floes .
Addendum 654-B : Extent of damage
After a considerable length of time in containment , it has been determined that SCP - 654 has no natural protection against its own ability , having caused itself harm several times thus far .
Severe burns on and around the dorsal area are untreatable , as SCP - 654 now responds violently to anyone except for the feeding crew , including Dr. Earles , and even then only long enough for feeding .
Considerable damage to the containment area has also been noted : shortening or extraction of the tusk has been proposed .
Note : SCP - 654 most likely avoided personal harm in the wild by hunting from a distance .
If a larger containment facility can be provided , these problems should cease .
- Dr. Stephens
Note : Dr. Stephens ’ objections have been noted , and overruled .
Creation of a larger facility would require more resources than currently available .
If difficulties persist , extraction will be considered .
- Director Menzies
Addendum 654- B - 1 : Follow - up report
Treatment of SCP - 654 made possible by use of sedation , porpoise stretcher , and a small mobile crane .
Veterinary crew have discovered significant damage to the underside of its fluke ; cause unknown , but suspected to be self - inflicted .
Prolonged sedation and bathing , with enteral feeding , is suggested to allow recovery .
- Dr. Earles
Note : Upon further investigation , fluke damage has been identified as bite damage , most likely from another toothed cetacean .
Not currently known how this went unnoticed during initial transport .
Investigation pending .

Canadians packed St. Basil ’s Church in Toronto on Monday evening to hear Archbishop Charles Chaput speak about how Catholics should live out their faith in the public square .
He warned that in the U.S. , Catholics need to act on their faith and be on guard against " a spirit of adulation bordering on servility " that exists towards the Obama administration .
The public lecture by Archbishop Chaput took place on the campus of the University of Toronto at St. Basil ’s Church and was attended by an overflow crowd of more than 700 people .
After giving a sketch of the basic principles in his New York Times Bestseller " Render Unto Caesar , " the archbishop offered his insights on the need for an honest assessment of the situation of the Church in the public square .
" I like clarity , and there ’s a reason why , " began the archbishop .
" I think modern life , including life in the Church , suffers from a phony unwillingness to offend that poses as prudence and good manners , but too often turns out to be cowardice .
Human beings owe each other respect and appropriate courtesy .
But we also owe each other the truth -- which means candor . "
The Denver prelate then provided his critique of President Obama .
" President Obama is a man of intelligence and some remarkable gifts .
He has a great ability to inspire , as we saw from his very popular visit to Canada just this past week .
But whatever his strengths , there ’s no way to reinvent his record on abortion and related issues with rosy marketing about unity , hope and change .
Of course , that can change .
Some things really do change when a person reaches the White House .
Power ennobles some men .
It diminishes others .
Bad policy ideas can be improved .
Good policy ideas can find a way to flourish .
But as Catholics , we at least need to be honest with ourselves and each other about the political facts we start with . "
Yet this will be " very hard for Catholics in the United States , " Chaput warned .
According to the archbishop , the political situation for Catholics is difficult to discern because a " spirit of adulation bordering on servility already exists among some of the same Democratic - friendly Catholic writers , scholars , editors and activists who once accused pro-lifers of being too cozy with Republicans .
It turns out that Caesar is an equal opportunity employer . "
Looking ahead to the coming months and years , Chaput offered four " simple things " to remember .
" First , " he said , " all political leaders draw their authority from God .
We owe no leader any submission or cooperation in the pursuit of grave evil . "
" In fact , we have the duty to change bad laws and resist grave evil in our public life , both by our words and our non-violent actions .
The truest respect we can show to civil authority is the witness of our Catholic faith and our moral convictions , without excuses or apologies . "
In a reference to the messianic treatment the Barack Obama received from some Americans during the presidential primaries , Archbishop Chaput delivered his second point : " in democracies , we elect public servants , not messiahs . "
Noting that Obama actually trailed in the weeks just before the election , the Denver archbishop said that this places some of today ’s talk about a " new American mandate " in perspective .
" Americans , including many Catholics , elected a gifted man to fix an economic crisis .
That ’s the mandate .
They gave nobody a mandate to retool American culture on the issues of marriage and the family , sexuality , bioethics , religion in public life and abortion .
That retooling could easily happen , and it clearly will happen -- but only if Catholics and other religious believers allow it . "
The third point to focus on when the beliefs of Catholics are challenged is that " it does n’t matter what we claim to believe if we ’re unwilling to act on our beliefs , " Chaput counseled .
" The fourth and final thing to remember , and there ’s no easy way to say it , " remarked Archbishop Chaput , is that the " Church in the United States has done a poor job of forming the faith and conscience of Catholics for more than 40 years . "
" And now we ’re harvesting the results -- in the public square , in our families and in the confusion of our personal lives .
I could name many good people and programs that seem to disprove what I just said .
But I could name many more that do prove it , and some of them work in Washington . "
American Catholics need to realize that many in the current generation have n’t just been " assimilated " into the American culture , but have in fact been " absorbed and bleached and digested by it , " Archbishop Chaput asserted .
If this realization does n’t happen , the coming generations will continue on the same path and " a real Catholic presence in American life will continue to weaken and disappear , " said Chaput .
Citing the example of " unhappy , self - described Catholics who complain that abortion is too much of a litmus test , " he stated , " We ca n’t claim to be ‘ Catholic ’ and ‘ pro-choice ’ at the same time without owning the responsibility for where the choice leads – to a dead unborn child . "
The archbishop also addressed the " abortion reduction " argument being made by some in politics .
" We ca n’t talk piously about programs to reduce the abortion body count without also working vigorously to change the laws that make the killing possible .
If we ’re Catholic , then we believe in the sanctity of developing human life .
And if we do n’t really believe in the humanity of the unborn child from the moment life begins , then we should stop lying to ourselves and others , and even to God , by claiming we ’re something we ’re not . "
" Catholic social teaching goes well beyond abortion , " Chaput noted .
" In America we have many urgent issues that beg for our attention , from immigration reform to health care to poverty to homelessness . "
Winding his talk down , the Archbishop of Denver remarked on the misunderstanding of the word " hope . "
" For Christians , " he explained , " hope is a virtue , not an emotional crutch or a political slogan .
Virtus , the Latin root of virtue , means strength or courage .
Real hope is unsentimental .
It has nothing to do with the cheesy optimism of election campaigns .
Hope assumes and demands a spine in believers .
And that ’s why – at least for a Christian -- hope sustains us when the real answer to the problems or hard choices in life is ‘ no , we can ’t , ’ instead of ‘ yes , we can . ’ "

So amazing , so illegal .
What are we going to do with you , future ?
That 's my pal , Jonathan Coulton , remarking on the disruptively talented Kutiman , who has made an astounding series of YouTube video remixes that 's lighting up the web and ( one imagines ) generating a lot of wood amongst our nation 's libidinous entertainment litigators .
Here 's Kutiman 's " The Mother of All Funk Chords " ( link includes credits for each video ) :
Unsolicited tip for media company c-levels : if your reaction to this crate of magic is " Hm . I wonder how we'd go about suing someone who ' did this ' with our IP ? " instead of , " Holy crap , clearly , this is the freaking future of entertainment , " it 's probably time to put some ramen on your Visa and start making stuff up for your Linked In page .
Because , this is what your new Elvis looks like , gang .
And , eventually somebody will figure out ( and publicly admit ) that Kutiman , and any number of his peers on the " To - Sue " list , should be passed from Legal down to A&R .
Everybody knows the business has moved from legal to binary files .
The question now is how much more lead time old media companies and other IP - obsessives can afford to burn by pretending it 's otherwise .
In the mean time , though , you have to wonder how much artists like Kutiman ( or , for that matter , Jonathan ) , really need the mixed basket of theoretical benefits that big companies with big distribution can provide .
For a long - lived career , does a boot - strapping indie artist with giant niche appeal gain enough from a big - company relationship to offset the loss in agility , equity , and flexibility ?
I guess we 'll find out soon enough .
Because , even in the face of bullying , obfuscating , and throat - clearing from corporations with a homemade timetable for evolution , more and more folks like Kutiman will just keep making and releasing stuff .
Cool stuff , " illegal " stuff , niche stuff , and stuff that does n't require the benediction of a middle - aged executive in order to reach its precise audience with almost zero friction or overhead .
And , that prospect should buoy and energize anybody with a scintilla of artistic entrepreneurship or the drive to just try making and offering their own stuff in their own way .
Man .
What an exciting time this is .
Seriously .
We may not each have Kutiman - level talent and vision , but there 's absolutely never been a better time to at least give it a throw .
Remember : the only person who can sit on your ass is you .
A British man has wrangled what ’s considered the largest freshwater fish ever caught anywhere .
Ian Welch managed to bring in a 770 - pound stingray from the Maeklong River in Thailand .
Largest Stingray : Nearly 800 Pounds
The stingray — which was five times
Welch ’s weight — measured 7 feet long by 7 feet wide .
Its stinger alone was 10 feet long .
Welch needed the help of a dozen men just to lift the thing out of the water .
“ It dragged me across the boat , ” Welch , 45 , tells The Mirror .
“ I knew it was going to a big one .
As soon as we saw it there was just silence .
Everyone was in awe of this thing . ”
Welch says it took a full 90 minutes to bring the nearly 800 - pound stingray in .
He and his team soon learned the giant stingray was actually a pregnant female .
They released the massive creature back into the water .
The previous record for a freshwater fish caught with a rod , The Mirror reports , was a 646 pound catfish caught in 2005 .
Giant Stingray Video
Welch and his fellow team members have brought in plenty of record - breaking stingrays in the past .
The following videos show their struggle with another mammoth - sized stingray recently in the same Thailand river .

Advertisement A dam has burst south - west of the Indonesian capital Jakarta , killing at least 58 people .
Witnesses said a " horrifying " flash flood of water up to 4 m ( 13ft ) deep engulfed hundreds of homes in Cirendeu in the Tangerang district .
Officials say they expect the death toll to rise , and 150 body bags have been sent to the scene .
An official said the Situ Gintung lake behind the dam became overloaded after hours of heavy rain .
" The dam was an old dam , 16 m ( 52ft ) deep , " said Ratu Atut Chosiyah , governor of Banten province , where the lake is located .
" Last night , because of heavy rain , the dam could not hold back the water so it broke , " she added .
Thick mud is hampering rescue teams , but the waters have now begun to recede .
' Still sleeping '
The incident happened at about 0200 local time ( 1900 GMT ) in what is a popular tourist area .
A surge of water laden with debris slammed into the suburb of small , poorly built houses , sweeping away cars and toppling telephone lines .
In pictures : Dam burst Dam burst felt ' like tsunami hit '
" People were still sleeping and could n't do anything , " local official Danang Susanto told the AFP news agency .
" Many people are still trapped and the rescue is ongoing . "
Television footage showed rescue workers wading through deep water and bodies being pulled from the mud .
Indonesia 's President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono sent his condolences to the families of the victims and officials said he was planning to travel to the scene of the disaster later in the day .
Vice - President Yusuf Kalla and Welfare Minister Aburizal Bakrie have already visited .
" We will provide emergency help to the victims .
For those whose homes were destroyed , the government will help with the repairs , " Mr Kalla told Metro TV .
Sirens
The decades - old dam had been holding back a lake of about two million cubic metres of water .
One resident said the dam broke after the morning call to prayer .
SITU GINTUNG DAM Earthen dam , made of compacted earth Built in the early 1900s under Dutch colonial rule Surrounds man-made lake on south - west edge of Jakarta Thought to have released two million cubic metres ( 70 million cubic ft ) of water " I took all my family out of the house and I saw my neighbour with his pregnant wife drifting away .
They asked for help but the water was so fast , " Hamdani said .
Another resident , Seto Mulyadi , said he heard a siren from the dam before water crashed into his house , breaking through all the windows and doors and leaving water 2.5 m ( 8 ft ) deep .
" A flash flood came suddenly and was horrifying , " he was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency .
" My house in a dreadful mess .
Thank God my family is safe . "
One man told local media it had been " like being in a tsunami " .
People were screaming ' the water 's coming in , the water 's coming in , ' and our dog was barking , " a local resident told Detikcom news website .
" I could hear our door being pounded on and I wondered who could it be , but it was the water . "
" Rustam Pakaya , head of the Health Ministry Crisis Centre , said people in the area were being evacuated to higher ground .
" About half of them are still on rooftops waiting for help , " he said .
South Jakarta Police chief Makmur Simbolon told AP that it was not yet known what had caused the failure of the 10 m ( 32 ft ) dam , which was apparently earthen .
The BBC's Katherine Demopoulos in Jakarta says the city is prone to floods and has an ageing , poorly maintained drainage system which struggles to cope with heavy rainfall .
In 2007 , floods in the capital left more than 50 people dead .

Water samples from one of the sinkhole areas are nearly pure groundwater , fueling growth of purple cyanobacterial mats .
Scientists have found some odd life forms in Lake Huron .
Peculiar geological formations are supporting floating plumes and purple mats of microbes dwelling in enclaves of the Great Lake , researchers report .
The odd biology is more akin to what is found in some of Earth 's most extreme environments .
The mats are located about 66 feet ( 20 meters ) below the surface of Lake Huron — the third largest of North America 's Great Lakes — where researchers have found sinkholes made by water dissolving parts of an ancient underlying seabed .
Around these sinkholes are brilliant purple mats of cyanobacteria — cousins of microbes found at the bottoms of permanently ice - covered lakes in Antarctica — and pallid , floating ponytails of other microbial life .
The water there is dense , oxygen - free and salty , and therefore hostile to most familiar , larger forms of life in the lakes .
The scientists report that some deep sinkholes act as catch basins for dead and decaying plant and animal matter and collect a soft black sludge of sediment topped by a bacterial film .
These environments are also similar to those around deep - sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps , where many odd forms of life have also been found .
In the oxygen - depleted water , cyanobacteria carry out photosynthesis using sulfur compounds rather than water and give off hydrogen sulfide , the smelly rotten - egg gas .
Where the sinkholes are deeper still and light fails , microorganisms use chemical means rather than photosynthesis to metabolize the sulfurous nutrients .
Groundwater beneath Lake Huron is dissolving minerals from the defunct seabed and carrying them into the lake to form these exotic , extreme environments , said Bopaiah A. Biddanda of Grand Valley State University , in Muskegon , Mich .
Biddanda is one of the leaders of the study of these odd environments .
" You have this pristine fresh water lake that has what amounts to materials from 400 million years ago ... being pushed out into the lake , " said team co-leader Steven A. Ruberg of the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .
Biddanda , Ruberg and their colleagues are trying to understand how long ago the minerals were deposited that are now entering the lake and how fast the salty brew containing them is arriving .
The work , described in Eos , a weekly newsletter put out by the American Geophysical Union , " might also lead to the discovery of novel organisms and previously unknown biochemical processes , furthering our exploration of life on Earth , " Biddanda said .
AIG wrath on the Hill : Geithner , Bernanke testify RAW STORY

Print This Email This During a Tuesday hearing of the House Financial Services Committee , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner asked lawmakers to give him new regulatory powers to deal with the country 's massive financial crisis .
The Treasury Secretary asked for powers similar to those of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which can seize control of banks , take over their bad assets and sell the good ones to competitors .
Geithner , who in the eyes of much of the public , has struggled to an extent to find his footing in dealing with the massive financial crisis , asked Congress to give him even more power to take control of a troubled financial institution and run it , after consultation with the Federal Reserve .
The treasury chief is an official of the administration , unlike the FDIC , which is an independent regulatory agency .
House Minority Leader John Boehner has already come out against Geithners request for more regulatory authority .
 This is an unprecedented grab for power ,  Boehner said .
 Before this occurs there ought to be a real debate about whether we should give that to the Treasury Secretary . 
Geithner said he did n't learn of the controversial AIG bonuses until March 10 .
At that time Geithner said he asked AIG CEO Edward Liddy to re-negotiate the payments but was informed that they were legally binding .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said he originally wanted to sue AIG for the millions in executive bonuses but was talked out of it by his legal staff .
According to a report from Bloomberg , New York Fed President William Dudley speaking at the hearing said ,  We did not think it was legally permissible " to overrule AIGs decision to pay bonuses .
Bernanke seemed to support Geithner 's call for more regulatory power , noting that if the government had had more power to take control of financial institutions in September , the way the FDIC has the authority to take control of failing banks , the government " could have taken haircuts against some of the counterparties without out taking a default . "
" Because we have no legal mechanism in place , we did not have the ability to selectively impose losses on their counterparties , " Geithner said of the rescue of AIG in September .
Committee Chairman Barney Frank interrupted testimony at several points to chastise protesters attending the hearing for their disruptions .
" I do not know how you think you advance any cause to which you might be attached with this kind of silliness , " Frank said to the protesters .
Geithner said the American people were " understandably skeptical " in the need for more bailout funds , particularly to AIG .
Going forward , more " clarity " would be required of the recipients of Troubled Asset Relief monies on how exactly they planned to use their funds and who they would be making loans to .
" I completely agree that the American people deserve to see much higher accountability , " Geithner said .
Rep. Maxine Waters ( D - CA ) extensively grilled Geithner on his knowledge of Goldman Sachs involvement in the design and implementation of the Fall 2008 government bailouts .
 This small group of decision makers at the center of it is Goldman Sachs and that is what is causing a lot of the distrust [ of the public ] ,  Waters said .
Geithner defended the actions taken by former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , who is also a former Goldman Sachs CEO , and other Treasury officials with ties to the bank saying , it was deeply unfair to suggest that they were making decisions that were in the interest of Goldman Sachs but were not in the greater interests of the American people .
He also defended the decision , under questioning from Rep. Carol Maloney ( D - NY ) , to pour billions into AIG to keep it from failing saying ,  I dont believe there is any plausible argument that AIG was not systemic then or that its failure today would not be systemic . 
Calling Congresss reaction to the AIG bonuses  kabuki theater ,  Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - CA ) pressed Geithner to agree to release a list of the executive compensation packages of all of the TARP recipient companies .
He specifically asked for information on executives earning more than $ 1 million and those receiving large contractual bonuses .
 Im not going to hide the ball , I will reflect on the suggestion that you made ,  Geithner said to Sherman .
Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) questioned Bernanke on the need for deposit insurance , and the governments role as a lender - of - last - resort , saying isnt that what creates moral hazard ?
Is nt that the problem and not the solution ?
Bernanke said those government policies were here to stay for better or for worse  and that those protections required government oversight .
Paul objected to the proposal for new regulatory power , saying that once the current recession passes , any new regulatory powers would likely be there to stay for 10 to 15 years .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
A suicide bomber killed at least 40 people and injured 70 -- many of them women -- during a Shia pilgrimage in northwestern Baghdad Sunday , Iraqi officials told CNN .
Pilgrims , pictured above , have gathered to celebrate the Shia holy period of Ashura .
The dead included at least 16 Iranians who had come to mark the Shia holy period of Ashura , which commemorates a central event in the history of the movement .
At least 32 Iranians were among the wounded .
The other casualties were Iraqi , an Interior Ministry official said .
The bomber was a woman wearing an abaya , a robe - like dress , said Maj.
Gen. Qassim Atta , military spokesman for Fardh al - Qanoon , an interagency domestic security body .
She seems to have been targeting women , Atta and an interior ministry source said .
The Interior Ministry official declined to be identified .
The attack appears to be the single deadliest suicide bombing in Iraq since a bomber killed 47 people in Kirkuk in December 11 .
It took place in Baghdad 's Kadhimiya neighborhood , not far from the Imam Moussa al - Kadhim holy shrine .
Hundreds of thousands of Shiite pilgrims are expected in Baghdad and the southern Iraqi city of Karbala for Ashura , which falls on January 7 this year .
Ashura commemorates the martyrdom of Hussein , the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad .
He was killed in battle in Karbala in 680 , one of the events that helped create the schism between Sunnis and Shiites , the two main Muslim religious movements .
CNN 's Mohammed Tawfeeq in Baghdad contributed to this report .

Channel 4 ’s series Embarrassing Teenage Bodies is meant to reassure young people .
But an episode which saw doctors perform labiaplasty on a 19 - year - old achieved exactly the opposite effect , argues Bellavita
I was initially a fan of Channel 4 ’s Embarrassing Illnesses / Bodies series , which aims to reduce the embarrassment surrounding certain illnesses and problems , and encourage sufferers to seek medical advice .
However the episode Embarrassing Teenage Bodies : Below the Belt has left me angry and upset , and done untold damage to countless young viewers .
The problem ?
Nineteen - year - old Lindsay consults Dr Pixie McKenna about the size of her labia minora .
She says that they protrude beyond her labia majora and that this cases her a great deal of embarrassment : she wo n’t undress in front of her boyfriend and she will only have sex in the dark .
Dr McKenna asks her if they cause her discomfort and she replies that when she has sex she has to part her labia .
At this point I am really hopeful that Dr McKenna is about to do the right thing and reassure this young woman how normal she is .
To talk to her about the enormous variety of shapes and sizes of women ’s vulvas , and how very common it is for women to have labia minora that protrude beyond their labia majora .
To talk to her about how the labia minora have an important function in protecting a healthy vaginal environment .
To talk to her about how they are a responsive part of her sexual organs , becoming engorged with blood during sexual arousal and providing her with a degree of pleasure .
As doctors , the presenters of the programme must know how common it is to have a vulva that looks like this
Dr McKenna , quite sensibly , wanted to examine Lindsay .
What I saw was a young woman whose labia minora protruded from her labia majora by a small amount .
Dr McKenna exclaimed that she could see this was “ a big problem ” .
It was explained that the condition is known as ‘ hypertrophic labia ’ , and that common causes are hormones produced in puberty and childbirth , that sufferers can have problems with personal hygiene and discomfort when having sex , playing sport , even walking .
Not that Lindsay mentioned having any of these problems , beyond needing to part her labia for sex , what she talked about was embarrassment about the look of her labia .
Nevertheless , Dr McKenna tells her there are procedures that can help ; surgical procedures .
The next thing we know , Lindsay is on an operating table having labiaplasty .
The surgeon commented that there was a “ fair amount of excess ” , and that the condition can cause psychological and physiological problems including infection ( again note that Lindsay had not complained of having a problem with infections ) .
Operation completed , the surgeon noted that there was “ a big difference in appearance ” .
I was absolutely gob - smacked .
Here was a golden opportunity to reach out to young women with large labia minora and reassure them about their normality , but no , it was presented as “ a big problem ” , a medical abnormality needing surgical correction .
My question is , if this is a medical condition requiring a surgical solution , why do searches for labiaplasty and labia reduction on NHS Direct , return no results ?
Why does the programme ’s own website state that “ this is seen as cosmetic and will not usually be available on the NHS ” ?
Just a general search for labiaplasty on the internet returns many results – almost exclusively from cosmetic surgeons .
When the young woman returned for her follow up consultation , Dr McKenna said that she “ had been experiencing an awful lot of discomfort ” .
Well no , she had n’t , had she ?
She had been experiencing an awful lot of embarrassment , which is not the same thing at all .
The woman declared that “ she felt a lot happier ” , “ a lot cleaner ” and Dr McKenna mentioned again how “ very obvious ” and “ really noticeable ” her labia had been and “ how flush ” they were now .
Let ’s face it , that is what this is really all about – appearance – about conforming to an expected ‘ norm ’ .
And where does this ideal of what your vulva should look like come from ?
Pornography is the only credible source , in my opinion .
Most heterosexual women simply do not have exposure to one another ’s genitals in any other way .
A gallery showing photographs of women ’s vulvas and the enormity of anatomical difference I found there finally freed me from my undeserved feelings of shame
I too have protruding labia minora , actually significantly more so that the woman on the programme .
When I became sexually active I had a glorious few years where I was completely unaware that I did not conform to the pornographic norm and I have to say that no lover has ever intimated that my vulva was in any way different , abnormal or unattractive .
However , exposure to pornography soon made me feel like that and , for many years , I felt deeply embarrassed by my anatomy ( although like Lindsay , I have never experienced any physical problem beyond sometimes needing to part my labia for sex , which I do n’t consider “ a problem ” ) .
Then I discovered the wonderful Vulval Health Awareness Campaign website .
It contains a link to a gallery showing photographs of women ’s vulvas and the enormity of anatomical difference I found there finally freed me from my undeserved feelings of shame .
This is why I feel so very angry and upset by the way the programme handled Lindsay ’s case .
Perhaps all she really needed was some reassurance that she was n’t ‘ abnormal ’ , but this was n’t even offered .
I am sure there are some cases where there are genuine problems with physical discomfort and , as a last resort , surgery is justified , but this was not the situation that was presented with Lindsay .
As doctors , the presenters of the programme must know how common it is to have a vulva that looks like this .
I feel they have been incredibly irresponsible in the way they handled her case , and a quick look at the comments on their website shows that my fears are justified .
Just look at the comments to date :
I am 15 and i have the same problem .
I never reaslised i was different untill my friend told me about it after watching a programme a while back , then i began to get paranoid .
I was too afraid to get a boyfriend because i was embarressed !
Surgery is to drastic and painful , i think i will just leave myself alone .
Anyway , if a person laughs at you for it or thinks you are strange , then they are not worth knowing , you are who you are :)
I ’m 15 and i thought I was fine , but since I ve watched the programme I ve become worried , as mine seem larger than the girl who had hers made surgically smaller !
it doesnt make any difference to my life , but i worry now that when I ’m older and start having sex I might have problems ?!
hi , im 18 and have been aware of the size of my left labia minora .
last year i did some research into the problem and have considered labiaplasty .
i am very insecure about it especially after told my mum and she thought it i was ‘ mad ’ .
i am bisexual and im not really concerned about when i start sleeping with men , but am with the thought of sleeping with women and carrying certain sexual acts .
in addition i have noticd that after intense masturbation it can become inflamed , very pink or purple , feel bruised and sometimes sore when i urinate .
i saw the program and i think i have this i thought it was a little werd befor the program and now i dntno what to dooo …. help someone i was propa embarressed about my down below .
i always slept with boys , in the dark , with the lights off incase they saw !!
then i have been with my boyfriend for two years now !
and he loves it !
he says he doesnt care and thinks its lovely so honestly dont be embarressed by it :)
Im 21 and i’ve got this problem too .
I dont really like it .
In my relationships its never been a problem to a guy but its something im so conscious about .
I often try to cover myself up .
I can tell its been something that my current boyfriend and i avoid talking about .
Most of my friends found it discusting when watching the show .
I think more people need to realise its natural to make us girls feel more normal .
I would take up the opportunity of surgery but its whether i can afford it if its not on the NHS .
It would definately build my confidence more .
im 15 and i thought that it was actually quite normal but i was watching this programme and a girl had a promblem with this , and it has really made me parranode .
I have exactly the same problem but did n’t realise how different I was .
Noone I know has ever mentioned it to me .
My previous boyfriend had no problems and my now fiance has never said a word .
It does occasionally get in the way of sex but I have never found it to be a problem .
I just think this is the way I was made and I can’t change that .
If the person your with likes you for you then it should never be a problem and your friends are just mean if they ever tease you for it .
I ’m surprised how many people are suffering with this but I have it and I would never say I suffer .
I ’m just me and it ’s part of me and I would n’t change it unless it affected my health .
I am 19 , and i have this problem , however i didnt think anything of it … i can sometimes get a little embarrased over it in the bedroom but nothing serious as i thought it was normal .
i would love to change how it looks , but i dont have the money and my mum would think its pointless to have surgery .
she probably thinks it normal too… this has sort of opened my eyes to the problem .
the show is really helpful , thank you .
well i am so glad im nt the only one to have this problem !
i find it very uncomfortable to deal with and very embarrassing in front of my boyfriend .. who do i see about this and how much would the operation be ?
Most of these girls had no idea they had ‘ a problem ’ until this programme was aired .
As a feminist , I feel absolute despair that the pornographic norm of what a vulva should look like has become so widespread that now even general practitioners are advocating that young women should spend thousands of pounds mutilating themselves , in order to look ‘ normal ’ .
I will be sending a complaint to the makers of the programme , but the damage is done now , is n’t it ?

Distributed version control systems ( DVCS ) are being adopted at a rapid pace by the open source software community .
A large number of prominent open source projects are abandoning legacy management systems such as Subversion and CVS in favor of more powerful decentralized alternatives .
The most popular of these are Git , Bazaar and Mercurial .
The primary factor that differentiates distributed version control systems from their centralized predecessors is that they are designed so that each individual working copy is actually a fully functional repository .
This approach offers numerous advantages for open source development .
With a DVCS , it is easier for developers to work independently without having to gain permission to access a centralized repository .
It also boosts robustness by diminishing dependence on a single potential point of failure .
Git was originally created by Linus Torvalds to replace BitKeeper as the version control system for the Linux kernel .
It has been adopted by many other high - profile projects , including Samba , Xorg , and Ruby on Rails .
We also recently looked at a major Git migration that was undertaken by the Perl Foundation .
Git is generally regarded as the current favorite of the open source community and could become a de facto standard .
Here at Ars , our fearless web ninjas use it for several internal projects .
Bazaar , which was created by Canonical 's Martin Pool , is one of the technological cornerstones of the Ubuntu software ecosystem .
It supports tight integration with Launchpad , which is a project - hosting site and web - based distribution development platform that Canonical has constructed for Ubuntu .
It has excellent documentation and is generally regarded as easier to learn than Git .
It 's primary weakness is performance , an area where it trails behind Git.
Bazaar is used by a lot of projects , including MySQL , APT , and Gnash .
Bazaar happens to be my current favorite and I use it for several of my own projects .
Mercurial is a highly scalable DVCS that was designed by Matt Mackall .
It was originally intended to serve as a BitKeeper replacement for the Linux kernel , but it was displaced by Git. Although Mercurial was n't adopted for Linux , it has been taken up by several extremely large projects , including Firefox , Netbeans , OpenJDK , and OpenSolaris .
Mercurial offers very good performance and scalability .
It also has better Windows support than Git and is easier to learn .
GNOME ponders a migration strategy
The numerous advantages of these distributed version control systems have made them powerful enablers of efficient community - driven development .
The growing number of options available has , however , made it difficult for developers to choose one .
Disputes over which system to use have become barriers to adoption for some projects .
This problem has taken center stage during the GNOME community 's recent struggle to find a DVCS migration solution that is easy to implement and acceptable to a majority of stakeholders .
The topic has been discussed by the GNOME community on several previous occasions without resolution .
This time , however , consensus appears to be growing .
The GNOME developers conducted a survey in December to gauge the level of interest among project contributors .
Over 1000 GNOME developers with Subversion accounts were invited to participate , and responses were received from 579 .
The raw data from the survey was published on Saturday and developer Elijah Newren followed up with a detailed report that includes numerous graphs and in - depth analysis of the statistics .
The study shows a very strong preference for Git and indicates that a majority of the respondents are in favor of a migration to a DVCS or do n't have a strong opinion .
The graphs also show that roughly 60 percent of respondents are already familiar with Git and just under 30 percent are already familiar with Bazaar .
This is significant , because it reveals that many GNOME developers are also working on other projects for which distributed version control systems are being used .
Although there is clearly strong support for migration in the GNOME community , the task itself is not easy and there are some technical challenges that will have to be addressed .
One approach that has been proposed is to add a Git server plugin to bzr - playground , an existing Bazaar mirror of the GNOME Subversion repositories .
This approach would allow GNOME developers to seamlessly use either Git or Bzr depending on preference .
John Carr , who proposed the solution , is already working on a proof - of - concept implementation .
Adopting Carr 's hybrid solution would theoretically require a lot less manpower than doing a full Git migration , but some GNOME developers have expressed concerns about the maintenance problems that could arise in the future from using a non-standard hybrid solution .
As a counter - proposal , a few GNOME contributors have expressed willingness to volunteer their time to manage a full migration to native Git .
The matter is still being debated on the GNOME desktop developer mailing list .
Each large - scale project that migrates to a distributed version control system contributes significantly to the growing body of information we have about the challenges and rewards of undertaking further migrations .
This helps other projects make an informed decision and allows them to face the prospect of a major transition with less uncertainty .
As the growing trend towards DVCS adoption makes the technology ubiquitous , individual developers will have a lot more flexibility , but they will also clearly be required to gain proficiency with multiple systems .

A plan , mind you that has no deficit forecast , a plan that relies solely on tax cuts and NO NUMBERS AT ALL .
The party of NO kept the comedy rolling along .....
Nora O'Donnell grills Rep. Mike Pence ( R - IN ) on this budget
This was laughable .
Really , it was .
Japan warned Monday it was in the deepest economic crisis since World War II , after Asia 's biggest economy suffered its worst contraction in almost 35 years .
The economy shrank for a third straight quarter in the three months to December as the global slowdown crushed demand for Japanese exports , a key pillar of the world 's number two economy .
The government said the slump was even worse than the recession of the 1990s when the country 's economic bubble burst , ushering in a decade of economic stagnation and deflation .
Japan 's economy contracted 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 -- 12.7 percent on an annualised basis , official data showed .
It was the weakest performance since 1974 when the country was reeling from the first oil crisis , and the government said this slump would be even more severe .
This is a nation addicted to speed .
And to ride Japan ’s super Shinkansen , or bullet train , is to zip into the future at speeds reaching 186 miles per hour .
From Nagoya to Tokyo , the scenery whizzes past in a dizzying blur as the sleek engine with its bullet - like nose floats the cars along elevated tracks -- without the clickety - clack of the lumbering U.S. trains that make you feel as though you ’re chugging along like cattle to market .
These days , Californians dream of a future with high - speed elevated rails that would link Southern California and Las Vegas in less than two hours , or L.A. and San Francisco in just over 2 1/2 .
Advertisement
Japan , meanwhile , will soon have a class of train that could make the trips in less than half those times .
This is a nation where it ’s not nearly enough that the trains run on time -- they ’ve got to break land records .
And even that ’s not enough .
By 2025 , a network of bullet trains connecting major cities is to feature magnetically levitated , or maglev , linear motor trains running at speeds of more than 310 mph .
Developed for use during the 1964 Tokyo Olympics , the Shinkansen trains were the brainchild of Hideo Shima , a government engineer who died a decade ago at the age of 96 .
Over the years , the trains have signaled Japanese prosperity , a gauge of just how far this technology - crazed culture has come and where it ’s headed .

Designed to traverse Japan ’s mountainous terrain , the trains use tunnels and viaducts to go through and over obstacles rather than around them .
They travel on elevated tracks without road crossings and apart from conventional rail .
An automated control system eliminates the need for signals .
Officials boast that on average the trains are less than half a minute late each year , which includes delays caused by earthquakes , typhoons and snow .
During the line ’s 45 - year history and transport of 7 billion passengers , there have been no deaths from derailment or collisions .
An E - 5 series of train scheduled to take to the rails in 2011 promises speeds of nearly 200 mph , improved suspensions and a car - tilting system to make the ride more comfortable on curves .
Power - reclining shell seats in first class will provide what engineers call a “ peaceful and soothing time during your travels . ”
Amtrak , eat your heart out .
Advertisement
But Japan is n’t stopping there .
The trains planned for 2025 will reduce the travel time between Tokyo and Nagoya to 40 minutes from about 90 minutes .
At that speed , commuters could go from L.A. to the Bay Area in just over an hour .
Rail officials say as many as 200,000 passengers could use the line daily .
Still , the Shinkansen is n’t perfect .
The trains often cause a rail version of a sonic boom as they emerge from tunnels .
That ’s because they enter so fast that they create a bubble of air pressure that is pushed along until they emerge .
Advertisement
The trains remain in stations for only two minutes -- not a moment more or less -- before easing out and quickly gaining speed .
By the time they reach top velocity , the world has begun to change .
There ’s no tooth - jarring shudder as when jets lumber down the runway .
This ride is smooth .
The turns are gentle , peaceful , even serene , though every once in a while a passenger is awakened by the boom of a train passing by or exiting a tunnel .
For the most part , you do n’t realize you ’re traveling faster than almost any other man-made land vehicle until you look out the window and see the scenery passing by so fuzzily that you think you ’ve lost your glasses .
For most of the ride you settle into your seat , buy a beer or coffee from the passing snack cart and realize once again that you ’re not in America anymore .

COLUMBIA , South Carolina ( CNN ) --
The United States faces a Zimbabwe - style economic collapse if it keeps " spending a bunch of money we do n't have , " South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford said Wednesday .
South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford says he does not want to spend money that his state does n't have .
Sanford , a Republican , has been an outspoken critic of the Obama administration 's $ 800 billion stimulus plan .
He said he 'll turn down about a quarter of his state 's $ 2.8 billion share unless Washington lets him use that money to pay down debt .
" What you 're doing is buying into the notion that if we just print some more money that we do n't have and send it to different states , we 'll create jobs , " he said .
" If that 's the case , why is n't Zimbabwe a rich place ? "
Zimbabwe has been in the throes of an economic meltdown ever since the southern African nation embarked on a chaotic land reform program .
Its official inflation rate topped 11 million percent in 2008 , with its treasury printing banknotes in the trillion - dollar range to keep up with the plummeting value of its currency .
But with South Carolina 's unemployment rate now the second - highest in the country , state lawmakers will attempt to override Sanford and take the $ 700 million if he turns it down , Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer said .
" They will use the total economic stimulus to stimulate the economy , jump - start it , so we can get out of the ditch we are in as a state and as a nation , " Bauer , a fellow Republican , said in a written statement Wednesday .
Labor Department figures released Wednesday showed South Carolina 's January unemployment rate hit 10.4 percent , second only to Michigan 's 11.6 percent .
Sanford is one of several Republican governors who have criticized the nearly $ 800 billion stimulus package , which passed with minimal GOP support in the Senate and none in the House of Representatives .
Other governors , such as California Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger or Michigan Democrat Jennifer Granholm , have said they would take any money Republican - led states reject .
But Sanford told reporters that taking the money now would leave the state in the lurch in two years , " when those funds dry up . "
" Fundamentally , if you boil down what the stimulus means for South Carolina , it means we would go through the process of spending a bunch of money we do n't have , " he said .
The stimulus measure allows state legislatures to override governors and take the money -- a provision championed by South Carolina congressman James Clyburn , the No. 3 Democrat in the House .
Clyburn said Sanford is unlikely to get any waiver from the administration , and he called the governor 's announcement " 100 percent political posturing . "
" This recovery package is designed to stabilize communities , to save and create jobs , and help our economy get back in a growth mode , " he told reporters .
" And you do n't do that by paying down debt that 's been incurred over a long period of time . "
And Bauer said that if South Carolina turns down the money , " South Carolina taxpayers will be taking on the debt for economic stimulus money sent elsewhere . "
Sanford has been called a potential GOP presidential contender in 2012 , but he told CNN that the next election is " not where I 'm focused . "
" I do n't rule anything in , I do n't rule anything out , " he said , adding , " If anything came along like that , it would be an incredibly long shot . "

Tutu speaks of his disbelief and wonder when President Obama was elected Archbishop Desmond Tutu has warned Barack Obama of the risk of squandering the goodwill he says the US president 's election has generated .
In an article for BBC News , he says it would be " wonderful " if Mr Obama apologised for the invasion of Iraq .
He also says he prays that Mr Obama will be tough on African dictators .
The Nobel Peace Prize winner adds that the UK's standing in the world has suffered because of its co-operation with the US in the " war on terror " .
' Dance and shout '
In the exclusive article for BBC News , based on a lecture he will give in London on Thursday to mark the 75th anniversary of the British Council , the former Archbishop of Cape Town speaks of his joy at watching the US election results coming in .
" I wanted to jump and dance and shout , as I did after voting for the first time in my native South Africa on 27 April 1994 . "
He calls Mr Obama 's election an " epoch - making event that filled the whole world with hope that change is possible " .
However , he also sounds a note of caution .
The Bush administration 's bully - boy attitude sadly polarised our world
Archbishop Desmond Tutu

He reminds his readers of the outpouring of sympathy that followed 9/11 and how quickly it vanished in the light of the allegations of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay .
" Obama , too , could easily squander the goodwill that his election generated if he disappoints , " he says .
He adds : " It would be wonderful if the US president could apologise for the US - led invasion of Iraq on behalf of the American people . "
He urges the president and the Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , to act quickly to reach out to other countries , to build bridges with them and to listen to what they say .
Pointing to the inspirational role of the US during the struggle against apartheid , the veteran campaigner for reconciliation asks President Obama to " come down hard " on African dictators .
UK role
The archbishop says November 's election has turned America 's image on its head after what he says were seven lean years for those who looked to America for inspiration .
" The Bush Administration managed to rile people everywhere .
Its bully - boy attitude sadly polarised our world , " he says .
But Desmond Tutu is also critical of the role of the British government in the so - called war on terror .
He says the country 's standing has been damaged as a result of its close co-operation with the US and that it lacks what he calls the " redeeming Obama factor " to restore the UK 's perception abroad .
The archbishop also has some positive words for Britain , and the British Council in particular .
He praises its work in helping the government of Nelson Mandela reform the post - apartheid diplomatic service and train black teachers .
Martin Davidson , chief executive of the British Council , said : " It is particularly appropriate that Archbishop Desmond Tutu has opened our 75th anniversary lecture series .
" This is also a testament to the long - lasting ties that can be built through cultural relations .
We worked in South Africa during the apartheid years , building the foundations for future cooperation and collaboration . "
The British Council 's Talking without Borders lecture seriesmarks the organisation 's 75th anniversary .

The stunning light graffiti which is created with nothing but torches and a camera
By Daily Mail Reporter
An artist has swapped paintbrushes for torches to create a range of stunning works which are created entirely with the use of light .
Welsh artist Michael Bosanko creates the amazing light graffiti effect using only five coloured torches and by leaving his digital Canon camera on a long exposure .
The 39 - year - old has spent the past five years perfecting his art which is created in a similar way to how people write their names with sparklers on Bonfire Night
This image of a giant spider crawling along a road is thankfully just a colourful trick of light created by artist Michael Bosanko
These colourful creations certainly make a big impact against the dusk background
Based in Cardiff , he draws most of his light art either in the empty urban night spaces of cities like Newport and his home town , or in the more desolate landscapes of the Brecon Beacons hills .
' I use my torches like an artist would use a paint brush , ' says Michael ' I employ an exposure that lasts from ten seconds to one hour and then try to let my art manage to create what I had imagined .
' What I feel I am trying to convey is a sense of an aesthetically pleasing shape that clearly does not belong in that particular place or area . '
This green dragon was created without the aid of photoshop
Bosanko 's creations include works such as this colourful city
Light graffiti is making quite an impression in the art world
Bosanko covers the lens of an average household torches in coloured acetate paper which allows him to bring different shades of the spectrum to his work .
And he said that he gets the best results on a shoot depending on the amount of ambient light that available .
' If I am working in an urban environment like a city then there is lots of ambient light that means I have to work quickly , ' he said .
' Some people have asked if I have ever used photo - shop on my work and I have to tell them that it is simply created with a torch , a camera and the canvas of the night . '
The artist has used his talent to make a range of pictures including this one of a rabbit sitting on the side of a road
This hitch - hiker is light years away from home
His impressive images have such an otherworldly sense about them that it is even difficult to tell they have been shot in the UK .
Bosanko said he got the inspiration for creating light graffiti while on holiday in Greece about five years ago .
' I was taking a picture of a very bright moon one evening in Greece when I noticed a swirling effect because the exposure had been left too long , ' he said .
' I then realised the beginning of my work in light art and have continued ever since . '
Bosanko uses just five torches and keeps his camera on a long exposure to capture these amazing colours and shapes
An armchair alien takes a rest against a barren setting
Also an abstract artist , Bosanko has pushed his art to the point where he is now creating images that display what he calls a real sense of the unusual .
' It is more a case of making the picture looks as alien and impressive as possible , ' he said .
Currently causing waves in the photographic art - world he plans to take his light graffiti to exhibitions round the country and possibly internationally .
' I like to think that people are inspired by my work and see what they want , as with all art , ' Bosanko said .
' I am privileged to be able to do this kind of work . '
This corn circle creation appears to be out of this world
Bosanko's said he uses torches like an artist uses a paint brush to create his works
From the ' that 's a lot of machines ' files :
Red Hat 's Fedora Linux 10 has been out since the end of November 2008 , and is now hovering around the 1 million installations mark .
Fedora uses a system to measure active installations that check the update repositories in order to determine how many installations are in use .
When combined with other actively used Fedora distributions as of Feb 16 , 2009 , Fedora 's counting method reports 12,188,598 Fedora Linux installations across Fedora 7,8,9 and 10 releases .
On Fedora 10 in particular , in contrast with adoption for Fedora 9 for a similar period , Fed 10 is at 115 percent adoption ( that is a greater adoption rate for the first 12 weeks of release for Fed 10 than Fed 9 ) .
Perhaps more interesting though is the fact that the bulk of Fedora 's counted installation remain on Fedora 8 which was released in November of 2007 .
It just goes to show you that though Fedora Linux is a fast moving distribution with up to two releases a year , a lot of users do n't move with every release .
Real winner will never be known , as GOP ' winner ' given 89 ' vote ' edge in disastrous Fairfax County Board of Supervisors race ...
Brad Friedman Byon 3/11/2009 , 5:28 pm PT
Yet another touch - screen voting machine broke down , in yet another " hotly contested " election , in yet another Democratic - leaning district yesterday .
Due to the failure , the actual results are completely unknown , unreliable , and unverifiable , and yet , one candidate ( the Republican , as coincidence would have it ) has been named the " winner " by 89 - votes out of 12,000 cast in the Fairfax County , VA , Board of Supervisors special election .
We are as completely sick of writing these stories by now , as we 're sure you are of reading about them , so we 'll bury the details below the fold , for those who want the skinny on what happened ... You 're welcome ...
* * *
The culprit machine , here , is the WINVote DRE touch - screen made by Advanced Voting Solutions , a company that recently went out of business after hundreds of failures were found in its systems , and the company refused to correct them .
Nonetheless , the geniuses who run Fairfax County 's election decided to use only touch - screen systems in the election yesterday , despite having used both paper ballots and touch - screens in last November 's election .
The WINVote " is the most widely used touch - screen voting machine in Virginia , " according to the Washington Post story in which explanations are given for why the Republican " narrowly defeated " the Democrat by 89 votes .
Officials are " not yet sure what caused the device to malfunction . "
WaPo 's earlier story --- when the Republican John Cook was said to have been leading the entirely - unverifiable election by 69 votes , before the wholly - unverified and unverifiable " votes " from the failed machine were printed out , one - by - one , and then tallied by officials from the machines memory --- notes that the race came down to the votes cast in the single precinct where the machine failed .
Last November , that same precinct , they report , " supported President Obama with about 57 percent of the vote . "
The Democratic candidate Ilryong Moon also outspent Cook , and was endorsed by the chairman of the board in the district which is said to be Democratic - leaning .
If he takes the seat --- as it appears he will , since there is no way to verify any of the ballots as having been counted accurately ---
Cook would be just the third Republican member on the 10 member Board of Supervisors .
News Channel 8's coverage offered a few more details on the actual machine failure ( they call it a " snafu " , naturally ) , in addition to a couple more maddening points :
...
About 20 minutes after the polls closed , Scruggs check the machine and realized the number did n't add up .
Election officials came to the site and sealed the machine .
" We could n't get results from the machines .
The numbers were n't adding up to what they should be , so we had to make sure the poll book was correct and then get the results from the correct machine and then move forward , " said general registrar Rokey Suleman .
The polling place only used electronic voting machines for the special election .
Before the polls opened , each machine was checked and election chief Philip Scruggs said everything seemed to be operating fine .... About 20 minutes after the polls closed , Scruggs check the machine and realized the number did n't add up .
Election officials came to the site and sealed the machine .
" We could n't get results from the machines .
The numbers were n't adding up to what they should be , so we had to make sure the poll book was correct and then get the results from the correct machine and then move forward , " said general registrar Rokey Suleman .
After running reports on both machines , the officials found the faulty machine recorded an accurate number of votes , but there was a problem with the final tabulation .
Workers printed out every vote recorded on the machine and hand tallied each one .
Of course , there is no way to know that any of those " printed out " votes actually reflect the voters ' intent , anymore than it can be known that any vote tabulated in the race is actually what the voters had intended .
And then there 's this graf , which reminds us that apparently , the bad guys and their disinformation continues to win the PR battle out there in the world .
Of course , those same bad guys had about $ 3.9 billion tax - payer dollars to spread their message , so it 's unlikely a blog that begs for $ 10 and $ 20 donations could defeat them entirely .
Here 's the maddening graf :
Voters are mixed .
" I think the electronic equipment these days is pretty good , " said Fairfax County resident Julie Stewart .
" But paper would be fine if they 've got a lot of money and they want to spend the time doing it , " said Fairfax County resident Richard Carlson .
Dear Julie :
It 's not good .
It sucks .
It 's unreliable .
And it 's a cold sharp knife into the very heart , and hope , of democracy .
Dear Richard : Paper elections are cheaper , more accurate , and take no more " time " to tally than touch - screen elections .
And at the end of the day , it 's possible to know who actually won them .
Apparently , our work here is never done ...

US energy chief floats idea of a carbon emissions tax Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday February 12 , 2009
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  US Energy Secretary Steven Chu has floated the idea of a carbon emissions tax to fight global warming , in an interview with The New York Times Thursday .
During the US presidential campaign , the notion was kept largely on the back burner as candidates were reluctant to promote the idea of costlier energy at a time when gasoline prices were soaring .
But since President Barack Obama 's administration took office in January , Congress has been working on setting up a system for swapping greenhouse gas emissions quotas similar to the one used in the European Union .
And Chu said " alternatives could emerge , including a tax on carbon emissions , " the Times reported .
Chu , a Nobel laureate in physics , long concerned about global warming , acknowledged it would be a tough sell to get a law passed in the United States that could lead to higher energy prices .
But he said he " supports putting a price on carbon emissions to begin to address climate change " the daily said .
Chu also stressed that the world was in real need of technological innovation to help address global warming , in areas such as solar energy , electric batteries and biofuels .

UNITED NATIONS ( Reuters ) - The U.N. Security Council should look into possible violations of international law during Israel ’s three - week war in the Gaza Strip , a senior U.N. official said on Tuesday .
Karen AbuZayd , head of the U.N. relief agency in the Palestinian territories UNRWA , told the 15 council members that they shared part of the burden of helping the 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza return to normalcy .
This , she said , includes supporting “ moves to investigate apparent contraventions of international law , including direct attacks on U.N. personnel and facilities , as in UNRWA ’s own headquarters and five of its schools . ”
Britain ’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Karen Pierce told reporters before the meeting that London believed some of the allegations against both Israel and Hamas militants warranted further investigation , though not necessarily by the United Nations .
“ I do think there are some credible allegations of the use of things like white phosphorus , which bear investigation , ” she said , adding the initial probe should be undertaken by Israel .
White phosphorus munitions can cause extreme burns .
The Israeli military has opened an investigation into white phosphorus use during the conflict .
“ At the same time one has to remember that a non -state actor , namely Hamas , is also involved in some of these alleged breaches of international humanitarian law and one would want to find a way of ensuring that was properly looked into , ” Pierce said .
She said the council would discuss the issue but would likely stop short of issuing a formal mandate for a Security Council investigation of any alleged war crimes .
The council was not expected to reach any decisions about the conflict during Tuesday ’s consultations .
New York - based Human Rights
Watch called for an impartial international investigation of allegations that both Israel and Hamas were guilty of “ serious violations of the laws of war . ”
‘ SYSTEMATIC DESTRUCTION ’
Richard Falk , a special U.N. investigator sent to the Middle East by the Geneva - based U.N. Human Rights Council , has said there was evidence that Israel committed war crimes in the Gaza Strip and there should be an independent inquiry .
Falk , who is Jewish , has compared the situation in Gaza to that of the Warsaw Ghetto during the World War Two , where the Nazis systematically starved and murdered Jews .
Israel denies committing any war crimes during its assault on Gaza .
Israel killed some 1,300 Palestinians , many of them civilians , and wounded 5,000 in the war .
Palestinians killed 10 Israeli soldiers and three civilians , hit by cross - border rocket fire .
AbuZayd told the council she had seen in Gaza “ what appears to have been systematic destruction to schools , universities , residential buildings , factories , shops and farms . ”
U.N. humanitarian chief John Holmes said Hamas ’ “ reckless and cynical use of civilian installations ” and “ indiscriminate firing of rockets against civilian populations ” in Israel were clear violations of international law .
He said there were “ major questions to be asked ” about the Israeli military ’s failure to effectively protect civilians and humanitarian workers in Gaza .
Holmes also said that around 1.3 million Gazans -- roughly 90 percent of the strip ’s population -- needed food aid .
He added that the United Nations would launch a flash aid appeal next week to raise funds for emergency relief in Gaza .
One of most high - profile trials over copyright infringement in years began today in Sweden .
Four men behind The Pirate Bay website – which enables people to find others willing to share audio , video , games and other files with them – appeared in court in Stockholm to answer the charge that they had assisted in copyright infringement .
The film , music and games industries are saying that the defendants not only encouraged copyright infringement but also profited from it , while the defendants argue that they hosted no shared files and therefore are not responsible for infringement .
The Pirate Bay is a " torrent " tracker , which uses the peer - to - peer file sharing technology called BitTorrent .
Trackers do n't host the music , video or software files themselves , but allow users to search for and download " torrent " files .
Those in turn allow users to find other people who have the file they want , and to share the files amongst themselves .
Each BitTorrent user with a copy of the file contributes a piece to others who are downloading it .
BitTorrent filesharing has been enormously popular : some internet service providers reckon that around 80 % of the data traffic passing over their networks uses the service .
This morning , prosecutor Håkan Roswall outlined his case , accusing the four men of profiting from promoting copyright infringement via one of the largest filesharing services on the internet .
An estimated 22 million people have used The Pirate Bay site .
Roswall said in court that the defendants were aware that Swedish law was changed in 2005 , incorporating an EU directive that makes it illegal to download copyright protected files from the internet .
The defendants include three of the website 's co-founders , Fredik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg and Peter Sunde Kolmisoppi .
Prosecutors also charged one of the site 's donors , Swedish dotcom millionaire Carl Lundström .
Lundström has donated money to the organisation , and the prosecution says that in 2004 he helped the other defendents configure larger numbers of computers to host the site .
If convicted , the men face two years in prison and a fine of 1.2 m kronor ( £ 98,000 ) .
Lundström 's lawyer said : " To supply a service that can be used illegally or legally is not illegal . "
The first day of the trial was such an event that Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter 's media blog reported that tickets to get into the courtroom were selling on the black market for 500 Swedish kronor ( £ 41 ) .
However , the intense interest and festival atmosphere outside of the court was not matched by high courtroom drama .
Most of the day was taken up by the prosecutor showing various screenshots of The Pirate Bay site demonstrating how to download from the site .
As Snild Dolkow who is translating Swedish coverage of the trial into English put it :
On the first day of trial , the prosecutor gave to me ..
one screenshot of a torrent download ,
another screenshot of a torrent download ,
another screenshot of a torrent download ,
another screenshot of a torrent download ,
another screenshot of a torrent download ,
another screenshot of a torrent download ,
another screenshot of a torrent download ,
.... and so on .
While BitTorrent is used to share copyrighted files , the technology is also commonly used to distribute software such as the open - source operating system Linux because it lessens the bandwidth costs for distributors of the software : everyone with a copy of the file contributes a piece to the overall download .
Plaintiffs in the case include Warner Bros , MGM , Colombia Pictures Industries , 20th Century Fox , Sony BMG , Universal and EMI .
Led by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry , the plaintiffs are calling for damages of 120 million kronor ( £ 9.8 m ) .
The chairman of the IFPI , John Kennedy , said : " The evidence in this case will show that The Pirate Bay is a commercial business which made substantial amounts of money for its operators , despite their claim to be only interested in spreading culture for free . "
The prosecution will rely on expert witnesses , emails between the defendents and invoices sent to advertisers .
Pirate Bay held a press conference on Sunday , bringing in supporters on buses painted with pirate ship .
The supporters carried banners with " ctrl+c , ctrl+v " , the keyboard shortcuts for copying and pasting text , images or files .
At the press conference , defendant Gottfrid Svartholm Warg said the music and movie industry " are welcome to send me a bill " .
If he does get one , he said he will frame it and hang it on his wall .

GDC 09 Open - standards industry consortium the Khronos Group is forming a working group meant to bring accelerated 3D graphics to the interwebs .
Known as Accelerated 3D on Web , the working group was announced on Tuesday at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco .
The goal is to create an open , royalty - free standard that will 3D - ify what is now a flat , essentially rectangular web .
An established , open set of 3D APIs ( application programming interfaces , which are essentially agreed - upon sets of commands that software developers use to communicate with hardware ) that 's agreed upon by all browser developers could not only provide the web with a new visual dimension , but could also support applications not yet imagined .
The working group was formed in response to a request from Mozilla and has already attracted another heavyweight member : Google .
In a statement , Google engineering director Matt Papakipos said : " With more and more content moving to the web and JavaScript getting faster every day , the time is right to create an open , general - purpose API for accelerated 3D graphics on the web . "
During the announcement at GDC , Mozilla 's Vladimir Vukićević - who holds the sublime title of Infrastructuralist - cited three reasons that " now is the right time to look at adding 3D to the web . "
The first , Vukićević said , is the continuing increase in JavaScript performance .
The second is the ongoing increase in the hardware and software available to support web 3D .
The third , he said , is that " The browser market right now is a pretty vibrant space . "
Vukićević is upbeat about the competition among browser developers .
" We coexist in a kind of an interesting environment , " he said .
" We certainly compete - there 's a lot of competition going on , especially in performance and user experience - but at the same time we often cooperate and collaborate in making sure that new capabilities are exposed across browsers in a uniform fashion . "
The goal for the new working group , Vukićević said , is " to make sure that current web applications can be enhanced with improved user experience and an improved visual experience , but at the same time to also enable new innovations and new classes of web applications . "
The working group will explore incorporating the capabilities of the Khronos Group 's open - sourse OpenGL desktop - graphics and OpenGL ES 2.0 embedded - graphics standards with the widely used web - scripting language ECMAScript , a standardized outgrowth of JavaScript .
The working group will also accept and explore other proposals from its members .
Neil Trevett , president of the Khronos Group said that the announcement was a " call to participation , " adding that " Anyone is welcome with open arms to make sure we get a quorum of the industry to bring 3D to the web . "
And Trevett had a favor to ask : " If you know anyone who 's interested in the web , let them know that this is ongoing . "
So , Reg readers , call your chums at Apple , Opera , and Microsoft - the developers of Firefox and Chrome already being on board - and point them to the Khronos Group 's member - info page .
Apple , by the way , is already a major Khronos Group member , being the initiator of the group 's OpenCL standard , but no mention was made at the announcement of its possible participation in the Accelerated 3D on Web working group .
The Accelerated 3D on Web working group will start up next month . ®

The Mummy X - posed :
The face of an Ancient Egyptian priestess revealed after 3,000 years
She has lain undisturbed for nearly 3,000 years , sealed in a decorated coffin ready for her voyage to the underworld .
Now the face of Meresamun , a priestess who sang in the temples of Ancient Egypt hundreds of years before the birth of Christ , has been revealed to the world for the first time .
Using a hospital scanner , scientists were able to peer inside her closed casket , and see through the layers of linen that protected her mummified features .
The first level scan reveals the surface of the coffin , left , while a deeper scan shows clear details of the body sealed inside
The astonishing three - dimensional pictures reveal her skeleton and her face , apparently with stones placed on the eyes .
Egyptologist Dr Emily Teeter , from the University of Chicago ’s Oriental Institute museum , where a new exhibition featuring the images opens this week , said : ‘ It is so exciting to be able to see this .
The decorative coffin enters the scanner
‘ The mummy is still in the coffin .
It is like having X - ray eyes to see the relationship between the coffin , the wrappings and amount of linen used . ’
A close - up of the mummy 's face
Meresamun is thought to have worked and lived in the temple of Thebes around 800BC .
Her name , shown in an inscription on the casket , means ‘ She Lives for Amun ’ – an Egyptian god .
According to the inscription she was a priestess - musician who served as a ‘ Singer in the Interior of the Temple of Amun ’ .
The scans suggest she was about 5ft 5in and in her late 20s or early 30s when she died .
The cause of Meresamun ’s death is unknown and all the more mysterious since she
appears to have been in good health .
The state of her bones shows she had a nutritious diet and an active lifestyle .
Although she bore no signs of dental decay , her teeth were worn down by the grit in Egyptian bread , which was made from stone - ground flour .
The sealed casket was bought in Egypt in 1920 by James Henry Breasted , founder of the Oriental Institute .
Dallas cop ' makes death even worse ' for NFL player David Edwards

This A Dallas police officer is under investigation after he detained a NFL player who had been on his way to see a dying relative .
Houston Texans running back Ryan Moats was rushing to the hospital to see his dying wife 's mother .
Dallas Officer Robert Powell refused to let Moats go into the hospital after running a red light .
The relative died while Moats was held in the Hospital parking lot .
" The Moatses , who are black , said they can't help but think that race might have played a part in how Powell , who is white , treated them , " the Associated Press reports .
" My mother - in - law is dying !
Right now !
You 're wasting my time ! "
Moats reportedly screamed at the uninterested peace officer .
" I do n't understand why you can't understand that . "
The officer is said to have responded , " Shut your mouth .
You can either settle down and cooperate or I can just take you to jail for running a red light . "
At a blog on The New York Times website , Lynn Zinser observes , " As if having your mother - in - law dying of breast cancer was not painful enough , Houston running back Ryan Moats had it made worse by a Dallas police officer who stopped him for running a red light near the hospital , would not listen to his pleas about the circumstances , drew his gun , threatened to arrest him and kept Moats in the parking lot while his mother - in - law died .

Producers Confirm Jurassic Park IV Wo n't Be Happening
by Alex Billington
Sorry to break it to you , but Jurassic Park IV wo n't be happening .
Producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy told ComingSoon yesterday that there have not been any new developments and that " when [ Michael ]
Crichton passed away , I sorta felt maybe that 's it .
Maybe that 's a sign that we do n't mess with it . "
Crichton sadly died of cancer about a month back .
For those that do n't know , Crichton was the creator of the Jurassic Park " concept " and wrote the novel in 1990 that eventually became Steven Spielberg 's film .
Rumors of a Jurassic Park IV have been floating around for a few years , but it 's now officially dead .
To me , this comes as quite a relief .
After Jurassic Park III , I really did n't want to see another one , as I felt the franchise had finally nuked the fridge .
For a while , Joe Johnston ( of JP3 ) was attached to direct the fourth movie , but as we all know , he has since been handed the reigns to Marvel 's The First Avenger : Captain America .
If everyone supposedly hates unoriginality , then why was everyone looking forward to Jurassic Park IV so much ?
It may be because people do n't really hate unoriginality that much and instead find safety in familiar franchises - but that 's a discussion for another day
A few years ago , a woman and her husband were coming home from a ski trip in British Columbia when they spotted a disabled car on the side of the road .
It was raining and the driver looked distressed , so they stopped and helped him fix his flat tire .
The man was extremely grateful but did n’t have any cash to reward them , so he took down their personal information .
A week later , the couple got a call from their bank saying their mortgage had been paid and $ 10,000 had been deposited into their account by an appreciative Bill Gates .
“ Ah , the grateful millionaire , ” Barbara Mikkelson says with a satisfied grin .
“ It started with Henry Ford .
Then it was Nat King Cole .
Then Donald Trump .
We even have a version Oscar Wilde wrote back in the 1890s . ”
With her bemused tone and a habit of peering over her spectacles , Mikkelson has the air of a night - shift detective who has seen it all - and in a way , she has .
Barbara , 49 , and her husband , David , 48 , run Snopes.com , the Internet ’s preeminent resource for verifying and debunking rumors , ridiculous claims , and those e-mail chain letters your sister - in - law ca n’t stop forwarding .
Whether it ’s an urban legend like the Gates story , an overblown warning about the latest computer virus , or that bizarre photo circulating of “ Hercules , the world ’s biggest dog , ” chances are Snopes.com has checked it out and rated it as “ true , ” “ false , ” or “ undetermined . ”
What began in 1995 as a hobby for a pair of amateur folklorists has grown into one of the Internet ’s most trusted authorities — and a full - time profession for the Mikkelsons .
Each month , 6.2 million people visit Snopes , according to Quantcast , which tracks Internet traffic .
The New York Times recently put Snopes on its short list of essentials that every computer user must know about .
President Barack Obama ’s campaign launched a copycat version last fall to battle rumors of its own ( for the record , Michelle Obama did n’t gorge on room - service caviar and lobster at the Waldorf - Astoria Hotel ) .
And even the word Snopes , a name David borrowed from a family in a William Faulkner novel , has gone viral — as in , “ Why did n’t you Snopes that junk before forwarding it to your entire e-mail list ? ”
Richard Roeper , the movie critic who sidelines as an author of myth - busting books like Debunked ! , says , “ Snopes is like having your own army of fact - checkers sniffing out a million wacko leads . ”
An army of two , that is .
Snopes ’s world headquarters is actually just Barbara and David sitting around their modest double - wide on a shady hillside outside Los Angeles .
Their two home offices are stacked to the ceiling with their trusty research tools : dictionaries , almanacs , VHS tapes , Disneyana , encyclopedias , atlases , and hundreds of books like UFO ’s : A Scientific Debate and Organ Theft Legends .
Oh , and there are cats : Buster , Sterling , Irene , Ashes , and Memphis .
“ David and I work at opposite ends of the house , ” Barbara says , flinging a cat ’s crinkle toy .
“ I once attempted to send him a note by sticking a Post - it on the side of one of the cats . ”
Cat couriers ?
Sounds like a case for Snopes .
Strange rumors about animals are among the website ’s most popular cases .
That widely circulated photograph of Hercules , a 282 - pound mastiff with “ paws the size of softballs , ” is one example .
“ About a year ago , people started sending us photos from the Internet of a freakishly large dog walking alongside two people and a horse , and it made me go , ‘ Wait a minute , ' ” David says .
A self - proclaimed computer nerd with a mop of brown hair , David was undoubtedly the kid whose notes everyone copied .
“ We investigated , and the picture turned out to be a digital manipulation - what we call fauxtography . ”
Another Snopesism is glurge , a “ true story ” so sugary sweet , it could make a baby unicorn cringe .
One such tale making the rounds online is about Stevie , a young man with Down syndrome who receives donations from compassionate truckers at the restaurant where he works .
( Snopes , which cites its sources in detailed footnotes at the bottom of each entry , uncovered the magazine where it was first published - as fiction . )
Then there ’s the sad , cautionary poem reputedly penned in jail by a teenage meth addict shortly before her death by overdose .
It is forwarded in an e-mail thousands of times every day .
Again Snopes tracked down the original author : an Oklahoma mom with a seventh - grade daughter , neither of whom ever used methamphetamines .
“ Most of what we deal with exists outside traditional media , ” David says , staring at an inbox with 21,144 unopened e-mails .
Among the subject headings : “ Video of one - winged airplane landing .
For real ? ” and “ Fisher - Price talking doll says ‘ Islam Is the Light ! ' ”
David glances at his muted TV set , where Law & Order is playing with closed - captioning .
“ These stories and half - truths are handy forms of expressing fears or concerns or ways of looking at life , ” he says .
“ But it ’s not easy to find out if these things are true or not , so people turn to us . ”
A passion for nosing around is what brought the Mikkelsons together , and it ’s still their prime motivation .
The couple met in 1994 on an Internet newsgroup devoted to urban legends like the one about Walt Disney ’s body being cryogenically frozen after his death .
Faster than you could say , “ Mikey died of Pop Rocks , ” Barbara was flying from her hometown outside Ottawa to Los Angeles to meet David , then a computer programmer for an HMO .
“ Our first date was me taking Barbara to the library at UCLA to go through old magazines , ” David says , laughing .
The couple now earn a “ very healthy ” income , David says , from advertising on the site .
Though the Mikkelsons are established figures on the Web , they still prefer old - fashioned research — scouring vintage catalogs , thumbing through four newspapers a day — over finding quick answers online .
“ I might use Google or Wikipedia as a starting point , ” David says .
“ But that ’s not research . ”
For fun , the Mikkelsons go to places like the Coca - Cola museum in Atlanta and the Library of Congress .
Barbara , who is the more outgoing of the two , signs her name to her entries and tends to favor subjects like business , politics , and anything to do with horror or crime .
David , the resident expert on Coca - Cola , the Beatles , Disney , and sports , occasionally tries to make up a rumor , like the one he attempted to spread that Mr. Ed was actually a zebra .
“ You ’d be surprised how hard it is to get traction with one of these , ” he says .
“ The things that take off have to hit a nerve we ’re all thinking about . ”
The Mikkelsons ’ work is now more than just a labor of love .
Some say Snopes is changing the nature of folklore .
Jan Brunvand , professor emeritus of English at the University of Utah , is one of the world ’s leading experts on urban legends .
He says Snopes and websites like it have helped eradicate myths that in many cases have endured for generations , whether it ’s alligators crawling in the sewers or the old chestnut about gang members killing drivers over flashing their headlights .
“ Because they have been publicized so much , ” Brunvand writes , “ people no longer believe most of the classic urban legends . ”
Which does n’t mean Snopes ’s work is done .
With cats by her side and underfoot , Barbara peers over her glasses as fresh queries land in her inbox .
Was the St. Pauli girl on beer labels really a lady of the evening ?
Did the bottled water company actually name itself Evian because it ’s naive spelled backward ?
Did Neil Armstrong tell a dirty joke on the moon ?
Is it true that the elevator close - door button is completely useless ?
“ You ca n’t make this stuff up , ” Barbara says , and then quickly catches herself .
“ Well , I guess you could .
But if you do , I ’m sure we ’ll get to the bottom of it . ”
Anatomy of an Urban Legend
How it starts , where it spreads , and how Snopes takes it down
1 . The buzz begins
In early May 2008 , Snopes begins getting e-mail alerts warning of criminals using funny - smelling business cards soaked in a drug called burundanga as a way to incapacitate victims .
The forwarded message cites an incident that happened “ last Wednesday ” to “ Jaime Rodriguez ’s neighbor … at a gas station in Katy . ”
“ We noticed we were getting more and more inquiries on this from people searching our site , ” David says , “ and since burundanga was something we had never written about , we decided to tackle it . ”
2 . The big dig
The Mikkelsons start investigating .
With few hard details — Katy , Texas ?
Katy , Missouri ?- Snopes goes to its favorite sources : medical journals , police blotters , newspaper archives , and contacts in law enforcement cultivated over the years .
Sometimes , says Barbara , “ you have to pick up the phone . ”
Until the rumor can be confirmed or debunked , it will be listed as “ undetermined ” on Snopes .
Says David , “ We like people to know we ’re working on something even if we do n’t have an answer . ”
3 . The story spreads
After a few days , the burundanga rumor picks up momentum and becomes one of the most - searched - for items on Snopes , which receives close to a thousand inquiries a day about it .
“ The stories that rise most , ” says David , “ are those that pose a threat to readers . ”
Across the Web , people forward the e-mail as a public awareness effort that the Mikkelsons dub slacktivism - sending a warning without putting in any effort to see if it might be true .
4 . The verdict
With inquiries surging , Barbara spends several days on the case and determines that burundanga is a South American plant extract containing alkaloids that , at high doses , can indeed cause delirium and unconsciousness .
But there are red flags .
Burundanga has no scent , and it must be swallowed or inhaled to produce the described effects .
Moreover , there is n’t a single police report or news mention of an incident like this .
If burundanga crime rings were really a problem , “ the news would be awash in stories about such incidents , ” Barbara says .
Snopes lists the rumor as “ false . ”
5 . The comeback
After quieting down over the summer , the story resurfaces in October after police officers in Canada and England forward the e-mail to fellow officers to ask if it is real .
Those e-mails then circulate with the officers ’ signature blocks attached , giving the tale new credibility .
Adding to the confusion , a November version of such an e-mail concludes , “ This has been fact - checked out on Snopes.com , and this is true . ”
As David says , “ People will do just about anything to believe a story they want to believe . ”
6 . The myth dispelled
By early 2009 , the burundanga rumor is sliding down the list of the Hot 25 rumors on Snopes .
Inquiries dwindle to a couple hundred a day .
“ It ’s bubbling under , ” David says .
“ But these things can pop back at any time .
Most rumors never die completely . ”
Heard This One ?
Snopes sets the record straight on which high - circulation tales are myths and which are actually ( sort of ) true .
Money from Uncle Bill
Rumor : Internet users can receive cash rewards from Bill Gates by forwarding an e-mail message to test a Microsoft tracking system .
Origin : A hoax circulating since 1997 , the Gates story is still thriving in various forms .
One claims , “ For every person you forward this e-mail to , Microsoft will pay you $ 245 . ”
Snopes report : “ Totally false .
It ’s a made - up claim , probably started as a joke .
But since it promises easy cash , people believe it . ”
Deadly Flyers
Rumor : Would - be carjackers are placing flyers on the back windows of cars as a way to lure drivers out of vehicles .
Origin :
On the Snopes radar since 2004 , the alert is part of a tradition that fuels paranoia about danger around every corner .
See also : ankle slashers at the mall .
Snopes report : False .
“ Nothing rules out there having been one car theft carried out in the manner described , but we have yet to hear about it . ”
Wal - Mart Behemoth
Rumor :
An e-mail provides eye - popping statistics for the retail chain , claiming Wal - Mart shoppers spend $ 36 million every hour , every day .
Origin : Unclear , but it began circulating online in late 2008 .
Among the many claims : Wal - Mart is the largest company in the history of the world .
Snopes report : Mostly true .
Snopes discovered a few other shockers : that Wal - Mart customers , for example , spend an average of $ 42,754,109 every hour .
Missing Ashley Flores
Rumor : A 13 - year - old Philadelphia girl named Ashley Flores has been missing for two weeks .
Origin :
The text of the e-mail — making the rounds since 2006 — includes a photograph , a Yahoo e-mail address , and a sad plea from the missing girl ’s father , a “ deli manager , ” who writes , “ If anyone anywhere knows anything , please contact me . ”
Snopes.com logs roughly 1,000 requests a day from users wondering whether the claim is true .
Snopes report : Complete hoax .
The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children has no report of a missing child named Ashley Flores .
Snopes also cites phrases ( “ If anyone anywhere knows anything , ” for instance ) taken word for word from previous missing - child hoaxes such as reports on Kelsey Brooke Jones and Christopher John Mineo .
Be The Wumpus is a game with no graphics , with no text , only audio .
You are a wumpus , a blind , cave dwelling creature who subsists on meals of unlucky cave wanderers .
Back in the 70's , you may have been among those brave souls who hunted the wumpus .
But the wumpus , driven nearly to extinction , is now a protected species .
But , do not fear , there is still much fun to be had involving both hunting , and wumpusses .
Now you can be the wumpus , and hunt the wumpus hunters !
You really need headphones to play this game , and though a game pad is not mandatory , it is highly recommeneded , ( preferably an xbox 360 controller , and you 'll need linux kernel 2.6.26 or better with that one . )
This game is really more of a novelty than an actual game , and there 's not a whole lot to it , so do n't expect too much from it .
It 's really just a silly little project I worked on for awhile for my own amusement .
This game is licensed under the good old GPL v. 2.0 , except for the audio files , which are licensed under the Creative Commons Sampling Plus 1.0 license .
( see sounds / Attribution.txt ) .
WARNING -- this game does contain small amounts of sounds of people speaking words which some people might consider profane .
If you are apt to be offended by the numbers in a .wav file when run through a D / A converter , and then the analog signal amplified then run through a loudspeaker of some kind , well , you may have a problem with my numbers then , I suppose .
Thing is , it 's your problem , not mine .
You 've been warned .
And what sorts of things would you expect people trapped in a dark cave with a hungry wumpus to say ?
If you do n't like it , well , that 's just too damned bad .
Running the game Type
./bethewumpus
Controls
This game is best played with an xbox 360 controller .
This is the only controller for which rumble effects are known by me to work .
( You will need linux kernel 2.6.26 or better as well , and you 'll probably have to chown / dev / input / event5 or / dev/ input / event6 , or wherever your OS makes the device file for the rumble feature so that bethewumpus will have permission to use it . )
Failing that , use a gamepad with two joysticks , such as the Logitech Dual Action 2 Rumble is not a bad choice .
( The rumble function does n't work with this controller on linux though . )
Headphones are highly recommended , and to really get anything out of the game , headphones not just recommeded , but mandatory .
If you do not have a joystick , you can play with the keyboard , arrow keys + space bar to chomp , but it sucks .
Gamepads are n't extremely expensive , consider buying one .
( Well , ok , that xbox 360 controller is n't exactly cheap . )
The left stick controls rotation .
The right stick controls forward and backward motion .
The first button makes the wumpus attack .
You must be within close range of your prospective meal for this to be effective , otherwise you simply frighten the meal .
Some people have complained that e.g. the right stick pressed to the left moves the wumpus backwards -- I have not seen that behavior , it may have to do with whatever game pad was being used .
There is no real standardization when it comes to mapping axis and button numbers to a game pad 's physical controls , so if you have a gamepad other than the two I 've tried , things may be wonky .
If you experience trouble , or cannot tell if the controls are working correctly or not , there is a debug mode ( as shown in the video ) which you can enable by changing bethewumpus .c in the following way :
151 int framerate_hz ; 152 int sound_device = - 1 ; 153 int debugmode = 0 ; <--
Change this to a 1 for debug mode .
154 double water_x = SCREEN_WIDTH/2 ; 155 double water_y = 0 ; 156 int level = 0 ; 157 int intro_music_slot = - 1 ; 158 int Be_The_Wumpus_slot = - 1 ;
Of course the game is not meant to be played in this way , and it is n't any fun this way as it becomes trivially easy .
However , doing this once or twice just to get the idea of how the controls work , and to find out if they are working , especially if you have some oddball game pad might be worthwhile .
Bugs
There are probably some bugs .
I have noticed that sometimes , in v. 0.02 , you can not attack .
The game tries to only allow one " wumpus roar " sound play at a time , so you can't attack while the wumpus roar sound is still playing from the previous attack .
Somehow the variable which tracks this gets out of sync , or overwritten , and you are prevented from attacking at all .
From what I 've seen , this happens at the beginning of the game , just running the game again may allow you to pass this .
I have n't tracked this bug down yet , but it is the first thing on my list of things to fix when I get some time and motivation to work on this .
Update , Mar 31 : Sean Bolton sent me a patch which fixes this problem ( thanks Sean ) .
The fix is now in CVS .
Update , Apr 5 : The above bug is fixed in v. 0.03 .

この番組紹介を読んである程度予想はついていたのですが、怖いもの見たさというやつでつい観てしまいました。個人的にどのように取り上げられるのかに興味のあった
GUI 関連のトピックスについては、はたして、1980年代に先進と言われた
Lisa や Mac の GUI も、けっきょくは 1970 年半ばの Smalltalk GUI の焼き直しに過ぎないとい う “ 教典 ” に反する事実については言うに及ばず、譲歩としては定番の（しかし「パソコン」ではなく「ワークステーション」であったとか、間違った取り上げ方をされる）ALTO のアの字すら出てこないという、予想以上の（メタな意味では予想通りの）ひどさでした。^^ ;
なかでも今回のテーマでもあるスティーブ・ジョブズの“ 神格化 ” はすさまじく、番組によれば GUI という概念はもちろん ( ? )
のこと、アイコンやマルチフォント、あげくは「パーソナル・コンピュータ」という言葉すらスティーブ・ジョブズが造ったことになっていて、もう終始ズッコケまくり。Apple
I から Mac 発売のころまでのパートは、そのまま紹介する人物だけアラン・ケイに置き換えたほうがいっそしっくりくる内容でした。
もっとも 、Apple ・Mac ファンにしてみれば、敬愛するジョブズ猊下が我ら下々にくだされた奇蹟の数々に（多くの人は）初めて接することで、改めてその偉大さに感動し大いに涙すべきところだったみたいです…。^^ ;
実際、出演者も紹介ビデオがあけたあと、涙をぬぐっていました。
これが宗教番組だったな ら “ ある ” と思います。でも、普通の番組としてはどうでしょう。Apple の GUI 関係の仕事について（大枠は Smalltalk GUI を軸とする先達からの猿マネに過ぎないが、後発ならではの工夫という意味では、彼らなりのオリジナリティも少なからずあった…）にも言えることですが、ジョブズもジョブズで良い仕事をしているわけなので、そのモノやコト自体を
Apple やジョブズが創出したかのようなあからさまな嘘やミスリードを誘ったりせずとも、むしろ彼らの二次創作的な真の仕事のほうをきちんと整理して伝え、すばらしいと評価してあげればいいのに…といつものように残念に思います。
一方で 、Mac や
Win の GUI の礎になった Smalltalk の（つま り 「 暫定ダイナブック環境 」 の）GUI についても、この番組で言っていることが嘘、大げさ、紛らわしいと判断して批判を加えられるくらいには
Smalltalk の存在を知っていること が “ 常識 ” になっていって欲しいなぁとも思った次第です。たとえば、選択したテキストをコンテキストメニュー（右クリック）を使ってコピー＆ペーストするのが便利だなぁとふと気づいたときに、「Mac（コピペ）スゲー！」とか
「 Win（右クリックメニュー）スゲー！」とか歪めるのではなくて、迷わずストレートに「こんな機能を備えていた
Smalltalk は GUI の先進性でもすごかったんだなぁ…」と思える程度には、とか。

As Daniel nicely outlined below , the US astronomical community is currently going through its decadal exercise in naval navel gazing .
The decadal review process assesses the state of the field , figures out where best to invest limited resources to maximize the scientific return , and creates a report that lays out the scientific and technical priorities for the coming decade .
This document becomes close to holy writ for funding agencies , who use it as a roadmap for deciding which facilities deserve funding .
The decadal reports for astronomy have served us well in political circles , since they offer clear prioritization based on community - wide input , rather that a long list of projects clamoring for support .
( The rumor is that other scientific fields do n't do quite so well at prioritization during similar exercises , perhaps because they lack astronomers ' long reliance on shared facilities , which forces us to practice playing well with others on a regular basis ) .
Right now the review process is evaluating key areas where we think substantial scientific progress can be made in the next 10 years , either with existing facilities , or with new ones .
We 've also been tasked with identifying areas with unusual " discovery potential " .
This work is being done by various " Science Frontiers Panels " , after community input in the form of white papers ( see the list here ) and town hall meetings .
Our reports then go to the " Program Prioritization Panels " , who then start the hard work of ranking the various missions , facilities , and projects , in light of the priorities identified by the SFP and the " Infrastructure and State of the Profession Study Groups " .
( Horrific org chart can be found here . )
So , given that the SFP's are encouraged to gather input from the community , I am throwing open to the floor to your thoughts on the important scientific opportunities in astronomy and astrophysics during the next 10 years .
I 'll do my best to get the info to the relevant committees , particularly if you tag your suggestions with your preferred subcommittee :
Planetary Systems and Star Formation
Stars and Stellar Evolution
The Galactic Neighborhood
Galaxies Through Cosmic Time
Cosmology and Fundamental Physics
It would also be helpful to let us know whether you 're a professional astronomer , physicist , or interested bystander .
Please use pseudonyms if you 'd like to be anonymous , so that we can follow the thread of discussion more easily .
There 's also a nice Facebook discussion group hashing things out here .
Feel free to join in either venue .
As many of you know , when submitting a story to social news or bookmarking site , you risk having a lot of traffic to that page alone and having people leave your site immediately after reading the post in questions .
There are several things you can do to keep readers engaged and direct them to different articles : really great content , related posts , links in your sidebar and many more .
But the purpose of this article is not to teach you how to go about getting legitimate traffic ; it is to show you how not to act to get the same , yet temporary result .
There ’s a new practice : something mixing the multiple page posts with the well know “ read full post link ” used on blog homepages .
It translates into going to the post page , reading one or two paragraphs and seeing a “ read more ” link .
It ’s annoying !
And it will work once , twice , three times , but after having the nice reader click and see the entire article , you are back to square one : how do you keep them from moving to a different site ?
Besides , readers , like a lot of other people , are lazy sometimes .
They like to get what they were promised and what they expect when following a link .
All of us social media users expect a full article when we hit that link , so it ’d better be there !
Let ’s say the content is OK and we move past our urge to close the tab and we actually read .
What do you think will happen at your next submission ?
Will we click again or simply click away ?
Is your content worth “ spending ” an extra-click ?
And here comes the ugly part .
After the initial page intro , when actually clicking the artificial “ more ” link , the content is crappy .
This is the worst scenario .
It might increase the number of page views and add an extra second to the time spent on site , but it still would make readers run away at speed of light afterward .
Are multiple pages any different ?
I for one prefer having the content placed in a few pages to endlessly scrolling down to reach the end of a post .
But if you add a new page after every two paragraphs , it ’s not better than what I ’ve described above .
So when deciding how to present your content to social media readers , leave the petty metric goals for later , and think of how to better welcome your guests .
Do you remember Professor X - Avier , Jean Grey / The Pheonix , and even Magneto from X - Men world ?
Do you know what they all have in common ?
They can manipulate things with their minds .
We normal beings ca n’t do that .
Or can we ?
Well , meet Mattels forthcoming “ Mindflex ” , which lets you come one step closer to those special abilities .

I. Introduction
In justificatory argumentation two or more persons seek to justify or to excuse a belief or action , to determine whether it is a belief one ought to accept ( or to reject ) or an action one ought to undertake ( or to forgo ) , or whether the circumstances of the case present sufficient reasons ( e.g. , necessity , duress , compulsion , coercion , manipulation ) for excusing a person for believing or doing something that is contrary to right .
Philosophers , scientists , and lawyers regularly and publicly engage in such argumentations .
In fact , most people do the same at least occasionally , albeit in private , at home , at work , in clubs and barrooms .
Twenty years ago , Hans- Hermann Hoppe presented [ 3 ] the argument that no justificatory argumentation can invalidate the principles of libertarian capitalism [ 4 ] because those principles are presupposed in every dialogue in which their validity would be questioned .
Moreover , “ no other ethic could be so justified , as justifying something in the course of argumentation implies presupposing the validity of precisely this ethic of the natural theory of property . ” [ 5 ]
In this article I shall focus on the argument from argumentation [ 6 ] itself rather than on its implications for political economy .
My purpose is to clarify the relevance of argumentation or dialogue ethics for libertarian theorizing .
I shall also endeavor to rebut some frequent criticisms of Hoppe ’s theory , [ 7 ] some of which have recently been revived by Robert Murphy and Gene Callahan , [ 8 ] but only insofar as they betray a serious misunderstanding of the argument from argumentation .
II .
The Argument from Argumentation
The key to understanding the argument from argumentation is , first , that when they are told or asked ( not ) to believe , say , or do something people are likely and in fact entitled to question why they ought ( not ) to believe , say , or do it ; and second , that an exchange of arguments is a justificatory argumentation only if all the participants acknowledge certain facts and abide by certain norms — norms that no one can argue are invalid because adherence to those norms is a necessary condition of engaging in argumentation .
In short , argumentation does not and cannot take place in a normative void :
any truth claim [… ] is and must be raised and decided upon in the course of an argumentation .
And since it cannot be disputed that this is so , [ … ] this has been aptly called “ the a priori of communication and argumentation . ”
Now , arguing never consists of free - floating propositions [ 9 ] claiming to be true .
Rather , argumentation is always an activity , too . […
It ] follows that intersubjectively meaningful norms must exist — precisely those which make some action an argumentation — which have special cognitive status in that they are the practical preconditions of objectivity and truth .
Hence [ … ] norms must indeed be assumed to be justifiable as valid .
It is simply impossible to argue otherwise , because the ability to argue so would in fact presuppose the validity of those norms which underlie any argumentation whatsoever . [ 10 ]
For example , one cannot seriously make the argument that one ought not to argue , or that one ought not to take argumentation seriously , without destroying the point of making that argument . [ 11 ] A dialectical contradiction [ 12 ] emerges when someone states :
You ought to take seriously the argument that you ought not to take argumentation seriously .
One who seriously makes an argument in fact refers himself and at least the members of his audience to the norm that they ought to take their own and one another ’s arguments seriously and ought not to dismiss one another ’s questions or counterarguments without giving relevant , pertinent reasons for doing so .
Thus , when the claim is made that one ought not to take argumentation seriously and this claim is presented not as a joke but as a serious proposition for argumentation then the opposite norm , “ One ought to take argumentation seriously , ” is in any case simultaneously posited or presupposed as valid and binding , and is , moreover , argumentatively or dialectically irrefutable .
The point of engaging another in an argumentation is to make him understand the reasons or arguments for believing , saying , or doing something , in such a way that he comes round to the conclusion that believing , saying , or doing it is justified as being in accordance with reason .
There is no point in getting another to understand why he ought not ask for reasons , or why he ought not answer requests for reasons .
What , indeed , shall we make of the argument “ Here are compelling reasons for why there can be no compelling reasons ” ?
There may be occasions , of course , when one should not ask for or give reasons , for example in an emergency or when there are other prudential considerations for not trying to engage another in argumentation .
Nevertheless , the normative principle that one ought to act in accordance with reason remains intact :
One is entitled to question whether the emergency or other prudential considerations upon reflection justify or excuse the action .
It is also necessary to distinguish between “ arguing about principles ” and “ arguing about particular cases ( in which principles are entered as arguments ) ” — about , say , whether lying in a genuine argumentation is wrong and whether this particular man in these particular circumstances did wrong to a specific other by lying .
In the latter case , one might for example want to inquire if the other ( say , an agent of the Gestapo ) had a justifiable right to know where the first man ’s son ( suspected of being a resistance fighter ) was hiding . [ 13 ]
In our present academic culture , dominated by empiricism and tainted by its attendant positivism and scientism , prescriptions such as “ Be rational , ” “ Obey the dictates of reason , ” or “ Submit to the law of reason ” probably sound archaic .
Nevertheless , they are all argumentatively valid , and undeniably so : no compelling reasons can be given for not considering them valid .
Even people who do not want to be rational or hate being reminded of such prescriptions cannot find such reasons .
The best they can do is refuse to participate in argumentations and restrict themselves to one or another variety of “ sales talk , ” [ 14 ] making appeals to the others ’ fears and hopes , their greed and vanity , instead of their reason .
III .
Dialectical Contradictions and Dialectical Truths
Hoppe ’s argument raises the question , which norms underlie the praxis of argumentation and are therefore logically undeniable for any person who claims to take argumentation seriously .
However , it is beyond dispute that there are descriptive and normative statements , dialectical truths , that are in any case argumentatively undeniable , and other descriptive and normative statements , dialectical contradictions , that are in any case argumentatively untenable — even if they are neither analytic tautologies or contradictions , nor empirically or mathematically true or false statements .
Of course , not every argumentatively justified conclusion is a dialectical truth ; only argumentatively justifiable conclusions that depend only on arguments referring to the nature and conditions of existence of argumentation qualify as dialectical truths .
I do not dialectically contradict myself when I try to convince my wife that our goldfish is not a rational being , but I do when I set out to convince my wife by rational argument that she is not capable of understanding or producing rational arguments . [ 15 ]
While asking and answering questions , and getting answers to my questions , I cannot without contradiction maintain that I am , or my opponent in a discussion is , not an answerable , responsible person .
Thus , in any dialogue , the participants must accept it as a dialectical truth that each one of them is an “ animal rationis capax , ” [ 16 ] a being capable of reason — a person ( as I shall henceforth write ) .
Moreover , they must accept it as a dialectical truth that they are able to communicate and argue with each other and that each one of them is a separate person , capable of speaking his own mind and , unless specific sufficient reasons to the contrary are adduced , entitled to do so .
The point of having a dialogue would be lost if one of the speakers were no more than a mouthpiece for the other with whom he is supposed to be arguing .
There would not be a genuine dialogue if the participants were merely actors reading their lines from a script written by someone else .
The very idea of a dialogue presupposes an irreducible plurality of natural persons . [ 17 ]
Thus , in our argumentation , neither you nor I can deny that the other is a separate , independent other person .
Moreover , the participants cannot but recognize that they constitute a “ community ” of free ( separate , independent ) persons of the same rational kind .
Freedom among likes is the presupposition of argumentation , and cannot be denied in an argumentation . [ 18 ]
It is a dialectical truth that , in the context of argumentation , logic and facts ought to be taken seriously .
Any attempt to argumentatively deny , refute or defeat that norm would imply the appeal to take logic and facts seriously .
Anyone who considered the attempt successful would have to admit that the logic of the argument or the facts it invoked are irrelevant for its conclusion .
Similarly , it is dialectically true that one ought to be willing to respond to demands for reasons or justificatory arguments for , and to accept rational criticism of , everything one does or says .
It is a dialectical truth that silencing an opponent by forcibly gagging him , or intimidating him by threatening to inflict harm on him ( or indeed on anyone else ) , is not a permissible move in an argumentation .
“ I ’ll burn down your house , if you dare to disagree with me ” or “ I ’ll see to it that your children never get a decent job in this town ” is an illegitimate move in an argumentation , no less out of order than “ I ’ll cut out your tongue . ”
Such moves would destroy the conditions under which argumentation can serve its purpose .
More generally , it is dialectically true that one ought to respect the physical integrity of one ’s opponents in an argumentation , not only their bodies but also their property ( everything they own , i.e. , justifiably possess or control , or are justified to repossess or bring back under their control [ 19 ] ) .
This is , of course , just another way of stating the respectability of the condition of “ freedom among likes ” that I mentioned earlier .
It is also a dialectical truth that bribing an opponent , say , by promising him money or a lucrative or prestigious position in return for his not asking certain questions or only giving desired answers , is not a permissible move in an argumentation .
Such a move would vitiate the argumentation .
It casts doubt on the opponent ’s motive in asking questions or answering them , as it would be unclear whether he was engaging in argumentation or merely seeking to bag a reward .
Evidently , “ Persons , i.e. , beings capable of reason , ought to be rational ” is a dialectical truth and “ Our reason ought to be the slave of our passions ” is a dialectical contradiction .
The above are examples of dialectical truths , or of dialectical contradictions , some of them “ descriptive , ” others “ prescriptive ” or “ normative . ”
Together with others , some of which will be mentioned below , they constitute what I shall call the law of reason .
IV . Rationally Justified Norms
Clearly , engaging in argumentation entails a commitment to abide by a number of norms , because any violation of or departure from these norms impairs and possibly even destroys the purpose of argumentation itself .
These norms come into play whenever questions about the justifiability of actions of any kind ( not only moves in an argumentation ) are raised and submitted to argumentation .
Any action , from merely holding one or another belief to producing large - scale effects in the physical world , may be questioned with respect to its justifiability .
If an action cannot be argumentatively justified then it is unjustifiable ; if it can be argumentatively justified then it is justifiable .
It is a dialectical contradiction to hold that an argumentatively justified conclusion is justified only within the context of argumentation itself [ 20 ] — for example , that assaulting another person in the course of an argumentation is unjustified , but that assaulting him afterwards is justified even if he has not done anything that would justify the infliction of pain or harm .
Similarly , because bribing a person in the course of an argumentation is unjustified , it is also unjustified outside the context of argumentation . [ 21 ]
An argumentation that conclusively establishes that one is justified in claiming truth for a particular proposition , or validity for a normative principle , remains conclusive after the actual exchange of arguments has ceased .
Of course , someone who did not hear the arguments may well reserve judgment until he has had a chance to evaluate them himself — but that too is an implication of the ethics of argumentation .
However , a blunt refusal to accept the conclusion of an argumentation , unaccompanied by reasons that purport to justify the refusal , cannot commit anyone but the refuser himself and cannot be considered a justification in itself .
A lazy skeptic can effortlessly respond to every argument with “ I am not convinced ” ; but there is no point in engaging a lazy skeptic in an argumentation .
Moreover , dialectical truths oblige not just the actual participants in a dialogue in progress but all human persons .
Justificatory argumentation appeals to reason , not to subjective preferences or personal quirks .
It is easy to refuse another person the opportunity to present his arguments , questions and answers , and thereby avoid having an argumentation with him .
Nevertheless , such a refusal is not a conclusive rational proof that he is not capable of reason .
A’s refusal to speak to B does not prove that B is beyond the pale of argumentative intercourse .
Treating a person as if he were not a person is not justifiable on the mere ground that one has denied him the opportunity to prove himself capable of reason .
It is dialectically true that , in dealing with one ’s likes ( other human beings ) , one ought to presume that they are persons , at least until there is sufficient proof that they are not .
The contrary presumption , that other people are not capable of reason anyway , is a dialectical contradiction , because it amounts to an aprioristic refusal to take their arguments seriously — it amounts to a refusal to even recognize their arguments as what they are : arguments .
The presumption of rationality is implied in the practice of argumentation itself .
Obviously , the presumption of rationality is defeasible in particular cases .
There may be occasions when someone is temporarily “ out of his mind ” or definitively “ loses his mind . ”
Moreover , every human being goes through a stage early in life when his rational faculties and his knowledge of the world are still insufficient to allow him to participate in argumentations .
However , it is customary not to hold young children responsible for their actions , and customary to hold grown - ups responsible for their actions , unless the particular case reveals sufficient reason to think otherwise .
Few people are inclined to question whether this is a rationally justifiable custom — and with good reason , I should think .
If a man proves himself an animal rationis capax by engaging others in argumentation , then he is a person and ought to be regarded and treated as such by other persons .
My questions and answers do not magically transform a non-rational blob into a responsible , answerable being capable of reason , who will once again become a non-rational blob as soon as I turn my back to him — nor am I so transformed by another ’s questions and answers . [ 22 ]
There is no more evidence for the contrary proposition than there is for my saying that things exist only when I have an immediate sensation of them .
Moreover , to assume the contrary would make all argumentations about anything other than the current argumentation itself pointless — and that would make the current argumentation pointless .
If there are norms that are undeniably valid for persons capable of arguing and actually participating in an argumentation then they are valid for all persons capable of arguing , even at times when they are not participating in an argumentation .
Such norms are not like , say , the rules of chess that bind chess players only while they are playing the game .
There is no a priori of chess to match the a priori of argumentation .
The ethics of argumentation does not contend “ that whenever people are engaged in a debate , they have implicitly agreed to certain norms . ” [ 23 ]
To accept that contention is to uproot the argument from argumentation and reinterpret it as an argument about a game defined by rules that the participants have agreed upon .
If that were the case , then obviously only the participants in an actual argumentation would be bound by those rules , and only for the duration of the argumentation game .
However , the point of the a priori and the ethics of argumentation is that in order to participate in an argumentation people must accept the norms that are implied in the nature of argumentation .
Whether an exchange of questions and answers is or is not an argumentation does not depend on agreement , implicit or otherwise , on an arbitrary set of rules , but on compliance with the norms which must be adhered to if the exchange is to be an argumentation .
Unlike the rules of chess , which define by stipulation what the game of chess is , the “ rules ” of argumentation are to be discovered in the nature of argumentation .
Similarly , whether A proves B is not a matter of convention but of logic : “ Although B does not follow logically from A , it is nevertheless the case that A proves B because we have agreed that a proof is constituted by rules that are different from the rules of logic ” is no more than a roundabout way of saying “ A does not prove B . ”
To sum up :
It is a dialectical truth that one should respect one ’s opponents in an argumentation as free and independent persons whom one should not even try to manipulate or intimidate with anything other than the force of one ’s arguments .
Moreover , one cannot argue with dialectical consistency that argumentatively unjustifiable ways of dealing with other persons justifiably prevail outside the context of argumentation — those others might be one ’s opponents in a future argumentation .
Therefore there can be no justification for having recourse to such ways of dealing with such others .
In short : persons ought to respect their likes as free and independent persons .
Whether or not this is the principle of libertarianism or libertarian capitalism , it is in any case the rationally demonstrable foundation of the classical natural law ethic , the normative framework — the law of reason — within which natural persons ( human beings , in so far as they are capable of reason ) ought to solve their differences , disagreements and conflicts .
Within this framework , a jurisprudence of freedom can propose and critically consider ways in which people ought to , or may , interact in various sorts of situations without violating the normative requirements implied in their nature as beings capable of reason .
V. Significance for the History and Philosophy of Law
A man accused of having committed a crime does not prove his innocence by proving that he committed no crime during the whole time he was in court ( where his case was being argued ) .
The point of the argumentation in court is to determine whether some particular action of his before he was hauled into court was justifiable or unjustifiable , excusable or inexcusable .
If a man proves his innocence with respect to a crime of which he has been accused , a judge would dialectically contradict himself if he were to say , “ Congratulations , but I am going to hang you anyway .
After all , it does not follow from the fact that you gave proof of your innocence that anybody ought [ 24 ] to pay attention to it , especially after the trial is over . ”
An agent , officer , or magistrate in the service of a government might say such a thing without dialectical contradiction , but only if he makes no claim to do justice .
An official condemns a man to the gallows , having heard only the arguments and witnesses of the prosecution and having denied the accused the right to defend himself .
There is not a whiff of dialectical contradiction there as long as the official places himself in the realm of brute force or cunning manipulation , demonstrating by words or actions that he does not intend to justify his action .
However , he would dialectically contradict himself if he were to go on to say that he has rendered justice and spoken truly as required by the ethics of argumentation .
He would also dialectically contradict himself if were to attempt to justify his refusal to justify his obviously unjust actions .
Perhaps the greatest merit of Western civilization was that , for a remarkably long time , it accepted the normative primacy of reason in human affairs , as the foundational principle of justice .
This was the paradigm of natural law , which , in the words of Saint Thomas Aquinas , amounted to the recognition of “ man ’s rational participation in the eternal law . ” [ 25 ]
Few thought of arguing against the principle that conflicts , disputes , and disagreements ought not to be settled otherwise than by means of rationally justified actions in accordance with rationally validated principles .
Force , intimidation , manipulation and so on may be excused on those occasions when they are used as means in ultima remedio to help establish or re-establish justice , but never when they are used autonomously to bring about whatever one can get away with .
Thus , it was accepted that there is a “ court of reason ” and that men should ( indeed , ought to ) have and organize actual courts of justice to help ensure that reason should prevail . [ 26 ]
The idea of a court of justice as an island of reason , where arguments would be appreciated on their merits , and where attempts at intimidation , trickery and so on would be checked and weeded out , became central to the ideology of the West .
Inside the courts the ethic of dialogue or argumentation should reign supreme , regardless of how it fares in the rough - and - tumble of daily intercourse .
Moreover , the findings of such a court , with respect to the justifiability of particular actions , should prevail over the emotional or calculated responses of those who witness or hear about them — at least to the extent that the court ’s findings are justifiable .
Only reason can justify — and that reason is not manifested in a monologue of one side ’s arguments , but in a dialogue , where arguments and counterarguments can be evaluated in an open confrontation .
Thus , it was taken for granted that a court ought to hear all the parties involved in a dispute and give them an opportunity to justify or at least excuse their actions ( “ Audi et alteram partem ” ) ; that judges should arrive at the truth of the matter ( in their verdicts , that is , vera dicta or truth - sayings ) solely on the basis of “ the merits of the case ” as they emerge from the accounts of reliable witnesses and the arguments presented in court by the parties to the conflict ; and that these verdicts should have normative authority as long as they are not shown to be wrong ( that is , not vera dicta after all ) .
Whatever the degree of social , economic or political inequality in a society , respect for the process of finding justice and a commitment to uphold its findings were held to be the keys to freedom and justice .
The courtroom should provide the conditions that make fair argumentation possible ( “ equality before the law ” and , via the practice of permitting the parties to call on advisors and advocates , even a rough equality of intelligence and argumentative skills ) .
It was a great idea , but of course the powerful , the rulers and their clients , often enough intervened in court proceedings and made a mockery of the independence of the courts of law , replacing them with boards of officials whose main function was ( and is ) to see to it that their master ’s voice is heeded by all .
The judges were replaced with “ magistrates . ”
The jurists , whose main concern is the knowledge and application of the principles of justice , were replaced with legists , whose main occupation is to know and apply their masters ’ wishes as these are revealed in legal edicts and codes . [ 27 ]
Nevertheless , even in this day of rampant legal positivism , the ideals of justice still fashion the way in which those boards and magistrates present themselves to the public at large and to their masters .
Unlike bureaucrats and diplomats , the magistrates posing as judges do not claim authority on account of their loyal subservience to their masters , but on account of their “ independence ” from them .
Paying lip service to the ethics of dialogue and argumentation is vitally important for maintaining not only their position in society but also their status as possessors of a science of necessary things .
While positivism rules the curriculum in the law schools , telling their students that only “ the law ” matters and that “ the law ” is nothing but the set of legal rules , edicts and decisions promulgated by the authorities that other rules in the same set designate as “ legal , ” the schools never tire of instilling in their students the sense that the implications of positivism do not apply to the magistrates and the advocates they are being trained to become .
Like scientists , they should be aware that they are supposed to answer to a calling that transcends loyalty to any social or political regime .
Like scientists , they should feel entitled to claim immunity from arbitrary interference , admittedly not as a general human right but as a professional privilege .
And like scientists in the Age of Big Politicized Science , they should not have any qualms about serving and assisting the powers that be as long as the latter keep up the pretence of their “ independence . ”
Albeit in an increasingly emaciated and perverted form , the ethics of argumentation still has a hold on the imagination as the bulwark of civilized co-existence , no matter how obscure the distinction between a scientist and a government expert , or between a judge and a magistrate , has become in public discourse .
However , its force is sapped when the point of argumentation in a court no longer is to reveal which actions are justifiable and which are not but merely to determine which party complied with some set of arbitrary politically imposed rules .
Then argumentation gives way to a contest in which one “ legal mind ” tries to outwit his opponent in a game that turns primarily on one ’s skills in combining officially recognized legal classifications of facts , legal rules , other legal data such as precedents , and currently fashionable notions into “ a strong case . ”
Similarly , the ethics of argumentation and dialogue loses its grip on the intercourse of scientists if convincing the authorities of the social or political relevance of one ’s research becomes a priority .
The argument from argumentation is not a mere academic artifact without any practical significance .
It underlies the Western tradition of the philosophy of law and its impressive harvest of principles of substantive and procedural justice , which command respect even after more than a century of systematic “ debunking ” at the hands of scientistic positivists and others for whom man ’s reason counts for nothing and his voice ( “ vote ” ) for everything . [ 28 ]
VI . To Argue or Not to Argue
With few unfortunate exceptions , human beings are capable of reason .
Unfortunately , many people prefer not to upgrade to the condition of an “ animal rationale ” by accepting or at least striving to live within the law of reason ; many are opportunists , who appeal to the laws of reason , if at all , only when it suits them .
For them , “ What is in it for me ? ” is a far more pressing question than “ What is the right thing to do ? ”
Consequently , they prefer to get by on the basis of prudence rather than wisdom ( prudence controlled by reason ) , just as they would do in their interactions with animals and other natural phenomena .
Nevertheless , few people can resist the urge to distinguish between right and wrong , and to claim justification for their judgments in matters of right and wrong .
However , many want the reward of justification without arduous argumentation and are likely to settle for prejudices rather than well - argued judgments : “ Many people would sooner die than think .
In fact they do . ” [ 29 ]
That is not a refutation of the law of reason but an indication of man ’s imperfection in the light of his most distinctive faculty : reason .
Consider Jonathan
Swift ’s statement that I have chosen as a motto for this paper : “ [ N ] o person can disobey Reason , without giving up his claim to be a rational creature . ” [ 30 ]
It expresses a dialectical truth , “ Reason ought to be obeyed ” ( for one cannot consistently argue that reason ought not to be obeyed ) .
It also states an argumentatively justified consequence of disobeying reason : one thereby gives up the claim to be a rational being ( for one cannot consistently argue that one is a rational being and reject the obligation to abide by the dictates of reason ) .
Recall that Swift defined the human being as an “ animal rationis capax ” — not as a being that is always and everywhere , as it were automatically , in tune with reason , but as one for whom it is a matter of choice whether or not he or she will accept to be rational : to live or to strive to live , to accept to judge and be judged , in accordance with the dictates of reason . [ 31 ]
Obviously , it is physically possible for a human being to refuse to place himself under the authority of reason .
However , he cannot without dialectical contradiction argue that the dictates of reason do not apply to him but only to others .
The same holds for a man who wants to claim his rights according to the ethic of argumentation but refuses to recognize the obligations it imposes .
That too is an argumentatively untenable position .
Men who refuse to be bound by the ethics of dialogue or argumentation cannot hope to succeed in justifying that position argumentatively .
Such people choose to act , and to interact with others , outside the “ realm of reason . ”
Placing themselves outside the law of reason , the context where appeals to reason or justice can meaningfully be made , they choose to be outlaws .
They not only give up the claim to be rational persons , they also free all others from the rationally , argumentatively valid obligation to treat them as persons according to the dictates of reason .
The point is that whether or not one activates one ’s rational capabilities is a matter of choice .
We can choose to enter into civilized commerce with one another by accepting the a priori of argumentation and all that it entails , or we can refuse to do so and play the Hobbesian jungle game . [ 32 ]
Some will choose the second option , thereby waiving their rights under the law of reason and justifying others to treat them as “ wild things ” ( which one can try to manipulate but with which it is pointless to argue ) — and if they do “ injury contrary to right , ” justifying others to treat them as “ enemies . ” [ 33 ]
There is no contradiction in their choice as long as they do not pretend to be able to argue that placing themselves outside the law of reason is “ the right thing to do . ”
Indeed , some people succeed remarkably well in placing themselves outside ( or “ above ” ) the law of reason .
Nevertheless , they , their supporters , clients and apologists , cannot ever justify their stance in a rational argument .
They may not care about that as long as they get their way , but that is their choice ; it is not an argument with any rational force .
Their choice to make themselves outlaws in no way invalidates the laws of reason .
VII .
Outlaws and the Presumption of Innocence
Hoppe had no pressing reason to discuss the concept of an outlaw in the context of his comparison of socialism and capitalism .
Nevertheless , the concept is essential for a correct appreciation of argumentation ethics .
Not understanding this , critics such as Murphy and Callahan assume 1 ) that Hoppe ’s theory implies that criminals are self - owners , who cannot rightfully be punished for their crimes because punishment violates their self - ownership ; [ 34 ] and 2 ) that , if the theory should deny that criminals are self - owners , it cannot claim self - ownership for anyone : “ if Hoppe ’s argument does n’t prove that criminals own themselves , then it ca n’t prove that non-criminals do , either , since there is nothing in the argument itself concerning criminal behavior . ” [ 35 ]
Against Murphy and Callahan ’s reading of it , we must point out that the argument from argumentation clearly distinguishes between persons who stay within the law of reason and persons who avoid or evade that law .
Among the former self - ownership is argumentatively undeniable ; among the latter the question of ownership ( as distinct from effective control ) , let alone self - ownership ( as distinct from effective self - control ) , does not even arise . [ 36 ]
Of course , rational persons may be justified in using violence against a brute or a criminal , i.e. , one who is by nature or by his own volition outside the law of reason , incapable or unwilling to submit to the test of justificatory argumentation .
The ethics of argumentation restricts the range of one rational being ’s lawful actions with respect to other rational beings , who like him accept that actions should be justifiable ; it does not impose restrictions on what a rational being may do to a rock that threatens to crush his home , a bear that threatens to tear him apart , a criminal who tries to rob him .
A thing that is outside the realm of the law of reason , or a man who makes himself an outlaw , say , by fleeing from justice or refusing to make restitution to those he has unlawfully wronged , is not ( or is no longer ) in the same position as one who continues to submit to the law of reason or as the repentant robber who recognizes that his actions were unjustifiable and makes a genuine offer of full restitution to his victim .
Murphy and Callahan simply assume that bashing the head of an outlaw , a brute or an unrepentant robber , is just as much a violation of an argumentatively justifiable property right as is bashing the head of an innocent person or a repentant criminal .
They are wrong .
My argument here refers to the theory of crime and punishment implied in the ethics of argumentation , a theory that is familiar to libertarians . [ 37 ]
Its bare outline [ 38 ] is as follows : Suppose that one person , T ( a tortfeasor ) , intentionally or unintentionally , voluntarily or involuntarily , caused unlawful harm to another , V ( his victim ) .
Then there is an argumentatively justified obligation for T to undo , or compensate for , all the harm he caused V to suffer .
This obligation corresponds to V’s right not to suffer unlawful harm from another person .
If T readily demonstrates his willingness and ability to make full restitution to V , the two must rely on negotiation , mediation , arbitration or adjudication to determine how and when full restitution is to be made .
As soon as full restitution is made , the matter is settled , and V has no right to demand or extract more from T .
In particular , V has no right to “ punish ” repentant T . However , if T refuses to honor his obligation to make restitution , for example by trying to evade being brought to justice , then he turns himself into a criminal . [ 39 ]
Consequently , V has the right to enforce his claim against unrepentant T , [ 40 ] who is now no longer a mere tortfeasor but a criminal .
Thus , we have the presumption of innocence , i.e. , the principle that no person shall be considered a criminal or punished as a criminal unless he willfully places himself outside the law of reason .
Any “ animal rationis capax ” is to be presumed to accept the law of reason until it demonstrates that it does not . [ 41 ]
However , one who does place himself outside that law , not only gives up his claim to be a rational person but every other claim as well that invokes that law , including claims to ownership or self - ownership .
As will become clear in the next section , none of this implies or even suggests that claims of ownership and self - ownership cannot be justified within the law of reason .
VIII .
Self - ownership as Seen Through Positivist Spectacles
Argumentation ethics does not fit the modern academe ’s dominant paradigm of empirical science and its attendant positivistic and scientistic methodologies .
It is therefore no surprise that many of the academic critics of argumentation ethics have no use for it .
Normative propositions such as “ Being capable of reason , human persons ought to be rational ” simply do not pass the positivists ’ muster and should therefore never be used in “ scientific reasoning . ”
Positivists do not care to argumentatively justify their rejection of such propositions : “ dialectical truth ” and “ dialectical contradiction ” are not in their methodological or epistemological repertoire .
They do not , of course , deny that they themselves are capable of reason , and they do not deny that in their academic discourses they ought to show respect for truth and logic ; ought to be willing to produce reasons or justifications for , and to accept rational criticism of , every thing they do or say ; ought to respect each other as free and independent persons who should not even try to manipulate or intimidate one another with anything other than the force of their arguments ; and indeed ought to respect the full range of libertarian rights in so far as they are relevant for academic intercourse . [ 42 ]
They are , however , unlikely to consider these norms rationally justified or even justifiable ; they are far more likely to consider them as no more than “ conventions ” or “ rules of the game , ” like the rules of chess .
In the perspective of positivism , such rules are not grounded in a rational appreciation of the essence or final form of science ; rather , they happen to be the rules effectively followed by people who are conventionally regarded as scientists , and at least tolerated by public opinion and public authorities ( the powers that be ) .
Consequently , the norms implied in argumentation ethics can enter the discourses of positivists only as “ mere conventions ” or as perhaps disguised empirical statements .
Thus , we may expect two sorts of attack from positivists on any presentation of argumentation ethics such as Hoppe ’s : 1 ) argumentation is a conventional game and as such its rules have binding force only for those who play the game and only for the duration of the game ; 2 ) the ethics of argumentation implies empirical generalizations which can be shown to be false by suitable counterexamples .
Murphy and Callahan , indeed , try both sorts of attack , although they certainly would not like being labeled as positivists .
They sum up their critique as follows :
[ Even ] on its own terms , Hoppe ’s proof at most establishes fleeting and partial ownership of one ’s body . [… His ] proof does n’t even succeed in this , for it confuses temporary control with rightful ownership . [ 43 ]
The first sentence says that Hoppe has only shown fleeting ownership of one ’s body , namely , ownership for the duration of the argumentation , and even so only partial ownership , namely , ownership of those parts of one ’s body that one effectively needs to participate in an argumentation .
The second sentence states that Hoppe does not demonstrate ownership but only effective use of those parts of one ’s body .
As we have seen already , [ 44 ] the “ fleeting ownership ” criticism fails .
What a justificatory argument justifies ( whether or not that is an ownership claim ) is justified not only while the argumentation is in progress and not only for those who actually participate in it but for all time and for all actual and potential arguers — for all persons .
This is also true for the validity of the norm “ Beings capable of reason ought to respect each other as free , independent , separate persons , ” which implies that they ought to abstain from using force or other non-rational means against one another unless there is justification for resorting to such means .
As Hoppe put it :
“ Nobody has the right to uninvitedly aggress against the body of any other person and thus delimit or restrict anyone ’s control over his own body . ”
This rule is implied in the concept of justification as argumentative justification … .
Since according to the nonagression principle a person can do with his body whatever he wants as long as he does not thereby aggress against another person ’s body , that person could also make use of other scarce means , just as one makes use of one ’s own body , provided those other things have not already been appropriated by someone else but are still in a natural , unowned state . [ 45 ]
Clearly , it cannot be concluded from this that all human beings per se are self - owners .
Moreover , there is no reason to suppose that the argument intends to show that all human beings as such are self - owners .
Why then do so many critics seem to assume that the argument intends to prove precisely that , and therefore fails because it does not ?
At best , Hoppe has proven that it would be contradictory to argue that someone does not rightfully own his mouth , ears ... and any other bodily parts essential for engaging in debate .
But that clearly would not include , say , a person ’s legs . [ 46 ]
It is dialectically true that the participants in an argumentation must have physical control over some parts of the world and in particular of their own bodies .
This does not mean , however , that participants in an argumentation must have or even must be presupposed to have ownership of those parts of the world or their bodies .
Ownership , unlike possession or effective control , is not a merely physical relation .
‘ Ownership ’ means justifiable control , that is , argumentatively justifiable control ; therefore ownership can be determined only as the result of an argumentation about the justifiability of a person ’s having possession or control of one or another means of action .
Nevertheless Murphy and Callahan consider it “ a more fundamental objection ” that “ one is not necessarily the rightful owner of a piece of property even if control of it is necessary in a debate over its ownership . ” [ 47 ]
That proposition is simply true but the question is whether it is a relevant objection to Hoppe ’s argument .
Suppose I am charged with a crime in China .
To comply with some minimal requirements of justice the Chinese court concedes that I should be assisted by a competent translator .
I need one to be able to participate in the arguments made in court .
Yet , my need for such a translator does not prove that the one I eventually get is my property .
Did Hoppe say anything to suggest otherwise ?
I cannot find any place where he logically committed himself to such an absurdity and Murphy and Callahan do not direct me to one .
Instead , they attempt to make Hoppe sound as if he were a Georgist . [ 48 ]
The insinuation is pointless .
The fact that I need standing room in the Chinese court in order to be able to attempt to justify my actions does not make me the owner of a little piece of China .
The Chinese are not contradicting themselves in conceding me standing room in the court without granting me ownership rights in Chinese soil .
Murphy and Callahan suggest that if the Chinese are not contradicting themselves then also one who “ concedes ” another the use of his body or some parts of it for the duration of the discussion is not contradicting himself if he denies the other ownership of his body .
True enough : denying that some person is a self - owner is not per se a dialectical contradiction .
But that does not mean that his claim to be a self - owner — i.e. , his claim that only he has justified and indeed justifiable possession and control of his body — cannot be justified .
Murphy and Callahan also claim [ 49 ] that a theist may be wrong in asserting that God owns all of us , but insist that he is not thereby contradicting himself .
Therefore , or so they say , the thesis of self - ownership is not without a logically coherent alternative and so cannot be necessarily true .
They fail to see that a dialectical contradiction is not a contradictio in terminis but a contradiction between what is said and the saying of it .
In this particular case , they moreover fail to note the difference between arguing about God and arguing with God .
The question of God ’s ownership would have to be decided in an argumentation with God , [ 50 ] not with any self - proclaimed representative of God , who would have a hard time proving his credentials anyway — so much so that it is doubtful that he would ever get to discuss the question of God ’s ownership itself .
The same applies to discussions about Society or The People ’s having ultimate ownership of our bodies or other things .
The concept of ownership makes sense in the context of argumentation ( the moral sciences ) , not in the context of describing the interaction of merely physical forces ( the behavioral sciences ) .
Unless I am prepared to argumentatively justify my actions and to accept justifying arguments made by or on behalf of others — in short , unless I agree to live within the law of reason , I cannot without dialectical contradiction claim ownership of anything , including ownership of myself .
A wild animal , no matter how strong and cunning , makes no ownership claims ; a man who does not care about the dictates of reason cannot consistently claim that his control over or use of some parts of the universe is to be respected because it is argumentatively justified .
In many cases , of course , possession or effective control is unjustified , even unjustifiable .
The argument from argumentation does not deny that .
But neither does it deny that there are cases of justified or justifiable possession or effective control .
Recall once more Swift ’s definition of man as an “ animal rationis capax , ” bound by the argumentatively undeniable norm that it ought to be rational .
Swift concluded : “ No person can disobey Reason , without giving up his claim to be a rational creature . ”
We can now add : “ Giving up the claim to be a rational creature entails giving up the claim to be a self - owner , or indeed an owner of anything whatsoever . ”
One who places himself outside the law of reason , thumping his nose at justificatory argumentation , cannot consistently claim to own what he possesses or controls .
In contrast , a person who lives within the bounds of reason will have no difficulty proving justifiable possession of any part of his body or indeed of any other thing that he acquired without injustice to anyone .
After all , one cannot without dialectical contradiction presume that another person does not own his body .
A person is to be regarded as a self - owner unless and until specific reasons are adduced for holding that his control of his body is not justified .
It would be a dialectical contradiction to deny this : there is no point to engaging in an argumentation with someone who believes that no person has a right to use his body to express himself or to speak his mind .
To appreciate the undeniable justifiability of the presumption of self - ownership , it suffices to step out of the rarified atmosphere of academic discourse , where self - ownership is just a word or free - floating concept .
Let us sit down , you and I , and facing one another argue about who may be presumed to own ( justifiably control ) whom : I me and you you ( self - ownership ) ; I you and you me ; I both of us ; you both of us ; I and you both of us ; or none of us either of us . [ 51 ]
Chances are that you and I are already in the perfect condition for an argumentation of that kind , if there is no prior event that has caused one of us to be indebted or subordinated to the other , say , as debtor to creditor or criminal to victim .
It will soon become obvious that the presumption of self - ownership is the only argumentatively robust principle in the list , [ 52 ] the only one that is part and parcel of the factual and ethical presuppositions of argumentation .
Of course , from the perspective of positivism this explication is to no avail : for the positivists , justification adds nothing to anything and ownership reduces to effective possession , either actual possession or possession recognized and protected by the powers that be ; ethical notions must be eliminated from “ scientific reasoning , ” if not by simply ignoring them then by reinterpreting them as merely empirical concepts . [ 53 ]
Disregarding Hoppe ’s explicit protestations , [ 54 ] even Murphy and Callahan prefer to interpret Hoppe ’s dialectical statements about ownership ( justifiable control ) as empirical statements about the physical preconditions of the ability to speak ( effective control ) and to attack him by means of empirical counterexamples .
Hence , their reference to the fact that a person without legs can argue with others [ 55 ] and their conclusion that , since legs are not needed for the purpose of communication , Hoppe ’s argument cannot even account for the fact that a person owns his own legs .
Hence also , their reference to “ slaves . ”
These do not enjoy libertarian rights , yet are able to argue .
Therefore — or so Murphy and Callahan claim — libertarian rights are not necessary for the ability to argue , and Hoppe ’s argument cannot account for self - ownership at all .
However , because the general empirical statements against which they are directed are not part of Hoppe ’s theory , the counterexamples do not affect the theory in the least .
Hoppe ’s argument is not that “ This is mine ” follows from “ I need this to be able to participate in an argumentation ” because it would be contradictory to say , “ Indeed , you need it , but I deny that it is yours . ”
The argument is that when A and B enter into an argumentation both of them do so under the dialectically valid presumptions of rationality , innocence , and self - ownership — presumptions that will hold until there is proof that they should be withdrawn .
Neither A nor B can deny that he is arguing with another person , one who is both a person and another person — in the words of the time - honored formula , a separate “ free and equal person . ”
Neither of them can justifiably claim to own any other participant ’s justifiable possessions ( his body or any part thereof , or any other , non-somatic means of action ) , or , of course , the law of reason itself .
However , the fact that an outlaw ( one who has placed himself outside the law of reason ) needs his tongue to utter or his hand to write statements does not mean that he owns ( as distinct from possesses or has physical control over ) these body parts .
One can not at the same time repudiate the law of reason , which is what a criminal does , and invoke it to prove justifiable control , i.e. , ownership .
Murphy and Callahan then claim that , even if one sets aside their remarks about fleeting and partial self - ownership ,
it ’s still the case that Hoppe has only proven self - ownership for the individuals in the debate ...
For example , so long as Aristotle only argued with other Greeks about the inferiority of barbarians and their natural status as slaves then he would not be engaging in a performative contradiction . [ 56 ]
That is not true : Aristotle ’s general statement that barbarians have enough reason to obey orders and please their Greek masters but not enough to qualify as fully human [ 57 ] is not defensible in an argumentation .
If Aristotle had tried to justify his views to a moderately articulate barbarian , the contradiction would have been obvious .
He could only try to avoid the humiliation of being caught in a dialectical contradiction by refusing to justify his views to the so - called barbarians , by refusing to give them a hearing .
However , the attempt would have been in vain .
For that refusal itself is a contravention of the ethics of dialogue and argumentation .
It exemplifies not simply an intellectual mistake but a morally vicious stance .
Any person , Greek or non-Greek , could have made that clear .
There is no way in which Aristotle — the Philosopher !— could have argued that his refusal to let the “ barbarians ” speak for themselves was argumentatively justified .
Refusing to argue is not a form of producing an argument .
There can be no argumentative justification for Aristotle ’s refusal to put his statements to the only relevant test : engage a non-Greek in an argumentation .
After all , Aristotle was not merely stating the obvious , namely that the sentence ‘ Greeks are rational in a way non-Greeks are not ’ is not a contradictio in terminis .
Yet , Murphy and Callahan claim ( without argument ) that Aristotle ’s refusal to talk to barbarians is as justified or as unjustified as our refusal to try to justify our views on zoos to a polar bear or a horse !
[ T ]he Hoppeian might respond that horses are not as rational as humans , and therefore do not need to be consulted .
But Aristotle need only contend the same thing about barbarians : they are not as rational as Greeks . [ 58 ]
What sort of argument is that ?
Do I need only contend that I am the only rational person in the world to justify the claim that nobody else is capable of arguing ?
We should soon discover that polar bears and horses are not creatures with which it is wise or safe or indeed possible to reason .
Are Murphy and Callahan suggesting that that is exactly what Aristotle would have discovered if he had had a face - to - face discussion with a barbarian , any barbarian ; and that he was therefore justified in refusing to give any barbarian an opportunity to prove him wrong ?
Murphy and Callahan ’s contention , that refusing another person a hearing is just as rationally justifiable or unjustifiable as not giving animals a forum in which to expound their views on zoos and animal rights , is ridiculous .
It is precisely in the context of argumentation that we cannot overlook the difference between another person and another animal without making complete fools of ourselves .
In defense of Murphy and Callahan one might point out that academics , including most economists and social scientists , tend to deem scientific only theories about humans beings that treat them not as potential opponents in an argumentation but only as suitable matter for “ empirical research . ” [ 59 ]
I should think that that is a fundamental flaw in much of contemporary social and economic science . [ 60 ]
In an enquiry relating to the foundations of ethics it is utterly out of place .
Murphy and Callahan then refer to David Friedman who argued that Hoppe must be wrong when he claims that self - ownership is a prerequisite to debate because countless slaves have engaged in successful argumentation . [ 61 ]
However , Hoppe did not make the empirical and absurd claim that a person is incapable of arguing merely because the powers that be legally classify him as a slave , or that being the legally recognized “ owner ” of one ’s body is a necessary condition for being capable of engaging in argumentation .
His argument was that such legal classifications and the actions they sanction or legitimize cannot be justified in an argumentation with the slaves or indeed in any argumentation that takes the presuppositions of argumentation seriously . [ 62 ]
Consider , on the one hand , a master who enjoys debating the justifiability of slavery with his slaves after dinner and then sends them back to their cage , no matter what the outcome of the discussion may be .
Consider , on the other hand , a master who frees his slaves after being exposed to the argument that slavery is not justifiable .
Which of the two takes argumentation seriously ?
Which of the two acts as a rational being rather than a mere “ animal rationis capax ” ?
The first master obviously regards argumentation as no more than a parlor game ; he refuses to argumentatively justify his actions outside that game and to make them conform to justified principles .
He demonstrates by his actions that he does not take argumentation seriously if it does not suit his purposes .
Why should his opponents in the discussion , his “ slaves , ” take the argumentation in question seriously ?
Why should anyone ?
Hoppe answers :
No one should take that argumentation seriously because it is not a genuine argumentation .
Embracing Friedman ’s avowed positivism , which instructs them to find an empirical difference between the moves of a genuine argumentation and those of a mock argumentation , Murphy and Callahan jump to the conclusion that they have refuted Hoppe .
They are mistaken : to refute the Hoppeian argument from argumentation they would have to show that the first master and his “ slaves ” can with dialectical consistency engage in serious argumentation , accepting the dialectical principles such argumentation entails .
Murphy and Callahan do not even try to make that argument .
Recall that Aristotle defended slavery with the argument that it is not primarily a conventional institution but a natural ( and justifiable ) condition of “ inferior people . ”
His defense failed , as we have seen , because contrary to the requirements of the ethics of argumentation he had refused to submit his reasoning to the only test that could decisively refute it .
The scandal of slavery is not in the fact that slaves are not , let alone cannot be , self - owners but in the fact that most of the people held as slaves are self - owners , unjustifiably deprived of their freedom .
In other words , the scandal of slavery has very little to do with the persons held as slaves and very much with the people holding them unjustifiably as slaves .
IX .
The Fallacy of Scientism
The conventions of academic writing tend to prevail over the requirements of the ethics of argumentation , even where adherence to those conventions leads to scientistic fallacies . [ 63 ]
The basic convention is the subject - object distinction , in particular , the notion that the subjects ( the researchers ) and the objects of their research are qualitatively different sorts of entities .
That notion is appropriate where the subject is a human person and the object some non-human , non-personal form of life or matter .
However , it is inappropriate where both the subjects and the objects are human persons . [ 64 ]
There is a difference between theorizing about the human world as if it were a separate realm of things with which we can have no intellectual , argumentative intercourse whatsoever , and theorizing from within the human world about the human condition .
The scientistic fallacy results when academics pretend to study the human world “ from the outside ” as if they ( rational beings ) are no part of it , as if the objects of their study ( human animals or , perhaps , mere black boxes ) are as different from them as are snails or crystals .
On the one hand , the academics recognize that in their own disputes , where they face one another , they should abide scrupulously by the requirements of the ethics of dialogue , if they want to be accepted as members in good standing of their academic communities .
Thus , in the communications and argumentative exchanges within their academic community , ill defined as it may be , they fully accept that argumentation is between one person and another , between an I and a You , and also that the success or force of the argumentation does not depend on who is the I and who the You .
On the other hand , people outside the academic community should never be considered even a potential
You or I ; they are assigned the status of an impersonal It or Them and should not be regarded as rational persons of the same sort as the academics who theorize about them .
Consequently , it makes no sense to think that among themselves those human animals or black boxes are rationally bound by , and entitled to treatment according to , the ethics of argumentation in the way the academics are .
As a corollary , statements about “ ordinary people ” should not be applied to the academics themselves . [ 65 ]
The scientistic and positivistic insistence on a radical subject - object dichotomy between “ us ” and “ them ” precludes that the two sides of the dichotomy are united by any a priori of argumentation .
Indeed , scientism requires that the rationality of ordinary people be methodically disregarded : their arguments must be reinterpreted as instances of mere behavior to qualify as legitimate scientific data .
In a similar vein , the ethical notions that define the academic community must be emptied of their primary ethical content before they can be applied to the human objects of research .
As Anthony de Jasay memorably put it with respect to justice , unless justice is defined as something else than justice , [ 66 ] it has no place in the contemporary academy ’s “ scientific ” research concerning the human world .
“ Justice ” is no more than a subjective relative value or it is a nominal standard imposed by the scientific observer that answers , say , to this or that quantifiable maximum or this or that calculable condition of equilibrium in the pool of human matter .
Libertarianism likewise must boil down to the mere belief that ordinary human beings have more or less the same rights relative to each other as academics have in their academic community .
However , any justification of that belief about the ethics of beings outside the academic community of scientists must be different in kind from the justification of the ethics of the academic community itself .
Indeed , the subject - object dichotomy implies that rational , argumentative capacities cannot have the same kind of ethical implications for “ ordinary people ” that they have for intellectuals .
Consequently , an academic ’s commitment to libertarianism as a valid principle for all human persons has the same sort of contingent relation to the ethics of argumentation as any opinion or theory of animal rights has .
If the separation of mankind in two distinct species — ” we , the arguers who make up the academic community , and they , the black boxes we define as relevant behavioral units ” — is made into an axiom of the scientific study of the human world , the relevance of “ our ” ethical principles to ordinary mankind must be as contingent , arbitrary or delusional as it is to mosquitoes or black holes .
Hoppe explicitly refuses to accept that axiom . [ 67 ]
He most certainly does not appeal to the prevailing consensus in , or the mere conventions of , any particular human community , no matter how it labels itself .
He appeals to the capacity of all human persons to recognize one another as persons , at least when they get involved in asking questions and giving answers , and arguing about the reasons for their questions and answers .
In scientistic positivism the critics of argumentation ethics may well find all the arguments they need for their belief that an academic does not formally contradict himself when he says that human or other animals do ( or do not ) have one or another right .
True as this is , it does not amount to an argumentative justification of any form of scientistic positivism — unless , of course , it were true that academics belong to a different species than ordinary men and women .
The baneful influence of scientistic positivism emerges most clearly in the context of education .
What happens to education when the a priori and ethic of argumentation no longer binds teachers and pupils in a single community of rational persons ?
The enthusiasm with which many academics support , say , Hume ’s dictum that reason is and ought to be the slave of the passions , [ 68 ] as if it were a deep insight into the truth about human nature , raises the question what sort of education could be built upon the positivist principle as it is applied to human affairs .
At the individual level , it translates into “ Your reason is and ought to be the slave of your passions ; do not question your desires , only the efficacy and efficiency of the means to realize them ” [ 69 ] ; at the institutional level , it translates into , say , “ Schools and universities , the pursuit of scientific knowledge itself , are and ought to be the slaves of politics — or if not of politics then of public opinion . ”
In either case , we seem to be left with no principle of education at all , for what is the purpose of an education if not to teach us to learn to discern right from wrong ?
Hume never leads us beyond the question of how to get what we want in the most efficient way , no matter what we want .
To give only one example : Increased unemployment of certain classes of men may be an almost inevitable consequence of imposing an effective minimum wage .
Some people ( those who see their employment opportunities diminished or their labor costs increased by such a measure ) will say that that is a reason for not imposing a minimum wage ; others ( employers fearing competition from regions with lower wage rates , union members seeking to restrict entry into the labor market , politicians looking for a client base of people dependent on political redistribution and those hoping to become clients of such redistributive schemes ) will say that it is a reason for imposing a minimum wage . [ 70 ]
Humean “ reason , ” having established the relation between minimum - wage legislation and unemployment , sits back until the balance of power among the passions tilts towards a particular goal and then enlists itself in the service of the winner .
“ Education ” based on Humean reason teaches service to the ruling passion or opinion — in a word , conformism . [ 71 ]
Questions of right and wrong , justice and injustice , and the presumptions of rationality , innocence and self - ownership , lie outside its scope . [ 72 ]
At best , such questions are admitted only after they have been reduced to questions of compliance with existing , merely conventional rules .
Of course , there is no reason to suppose that what lies outside the scope of Humean “ reason ” is irrelevant and cannot be subjected to justificatory argumentation .
The effects of the adoption of Hume ’s principle in “ education ” are easily observable in the proliferation of experts and social and economic theories that , while claiming to be scientific , are examples of sophisticated sales talk promising the greatest happiness to those who adopt them .
X. But Does It Justify Libertarianism ?
While I was working on my ethics of dialogue , some people began to call me a libertarian because of the considerable overlap between the conclusions I reached ( in particular about the State being unjustifiable ) and positions defended in the writings of Murray Rothbard and others who by that time had made “ libertarianism ” a distinctive brand of American political philosophy .
At least to the extent of that overlap , the ethic of dialogue or argumentation does justify Rothbardian libertarianism .
Since I received the label “ libertarian ” because of my work on that ethic , I suppose I may say that my libertarianism is identical to that ethic .
Rooted in the philosophy of law rather than any particular theory of economics , it is the philosophy of people who accept that the ethic of justificatory argumentation is the proper framework for discovering rationally undeniable norms for human interaction as well as justifiable solutions to particular disagreements and conflicts .
Advocating such a framework is admittedly far less spectacular than promising a ready - made solution for every conceivable problem .
Nevertheless , it is all that libertarian philosophy can offer if it is to be true to the concept of freedom for all persons under the law of reason and the ( in particular cases defeasible ) presumptions of rationality , innocence , and self - ownership . [ 73 ]
With that in mind , it is fair to say that only libertarian rights can be argumentatively justified , because only libertarian rights define a context in which the conditions necessary for justificatory argumentation can be respected universally .
A final caveat :
The arguments from the a priori of argumentation and the ethics it entails do not , and are not intended to , supplant the study of the natural law of the human world ( that is to say , the natural conditions that mark the difference between order and disorder in the human world ) .
They complement it by proving how we can be rational and argumentatively justify certain actions or statements if we are conscious of the fact that we , all of us , are in that world .
The relative novelty of the word ‘ libertarianism ’ should not blind us to the fact that the complementarity of natural law and reason has been known and appreciated for a long time already .
Nor should the radical nature of libertarianism blind us to the fact that it is radical only because it presses the demand for interpersonal justification among free and equal persons into corners where the argument from authority , be it God , Society , Science , Utility , or whatever other Convenient Abstraction , used to reign unchallenged .
China has overseen a " brutal crackdown " in Tibet since protests shook the Himalayan region last year , part of decades of Chinese oppression that have driven Tibetan culture to the verge of extinction , the Dalai Lama said Tuesday .
The Tibetan spiritual leader made the comments in a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of the failed uprising that sent him into exile .
" Even today , Tibetans in Tibet live in constant fear and the Chinese authorities remain constantly suspicious of them , " the Dalai Lama said in this Indian hill town , where he and the self - proclaimed government - in - exile have been based since shortly after fleeing their homeland .
" The Tibetan people are regarded like criminals , deserving to be put to death , " he said .
Chinese martial law , and hard - line policies such as the Cultural Revolution , devastated the mountain region and left hundreds of thousands of Tibetans dead , he said , blasting the " brutal crackdown " in the region since protests last year turned violent .
He told a group of about 2,000 people , including Buddhist monks , Tibetan schoolchildren and a handful of foreign supporters , that the religion , culture , language and identity of successive generations of Tibetans faced " extinction . "
The group had gathered in a courtyard that separates the Dalai Lama 's home from the town 's main temple ; monks blew enormous conch shells and long brass horns to herald his arrival .
While his comments were unusually strong for a man known for his deeply pacifist beliefs , he also urged that any change come peacefully and reiterated his support for the " Middle Way , " which calls for significant Tibetan autonomy under Chinese rule .
" I have no doubt that the justice of Tibetan cause will prevail if we continue to tread a path of truth and nonviolence , " he said .
Later , at a press conference , he said he'd become deeply discouraged about repeated rounds of failed talks between his representatives and Beijing .
" We have to prepare for the worst .
At the same time , we should not give up our hope , " he said .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said he would not comment on the Dalai Lama 's statements , dismissing them as lies .
" The Dalai group confuses right and wrong and spreads rumors , " he said .
After the Dalai Lama 's speech , thousands of young Tibetans took to the streets of Dharmsala chanting " China Out ! " and " Tibet belongs to Tibetans ! "
About 1,000 more protesters marched peacefully through New Delhi in support of the Tibetans , many chanting " Shame on China ! "
Still more protested in Seoul and Canberra , the Australian capital , where they scuffled with police outside the Chinese Embassy .
Four of about 300 protesters were arrested there .
In Nepal , home to thousands of Tibetan exiles , police blocked about 100 Tibetans who demonstrated on the outskirts of the capital , Katmandu .
The area around the Chinese Embassy was blanketed with more policemen , and the government banned protests in the area .
The government also increased security along the Chinese border .
While Beijing claims
Tibet has been part of Chinese territory for centuries , Tibet was a deeply isolated theocracy until 1951 , when Chinese troops invaded Lhasa , the regional capital .
Tuesday 's anniversary marked March 10 , 1959 riots inside Tibet against Chinese rule which lead to a crackdown and , later that month , the Dalai Lama 's dramatic flight across the Himalayas and into exile .
Beijing has long claimed that it brought modernity to a region where monks and wealthy landowners had long ruled over huge tracts of land worked by slaves and serfs .
Ma , the Chinese official , said Tibet went through democratic reform in 1959 , and that Tibetans had been freed from slavery .
" People 's livelihoods have been greatly improved , " he said .
But Tuesday , the Dalai Lama dismissed such claims , saying most of the development in the last 50 years was designed to make Chinese rule easier , and came at " the huge cost of devastating the Tibetan environment and way of life . "
Last year , a peaceful commemoration of the 1959 uprising by monks in Lhasa erupted into anti-Chinese rioting four days later and spread to surrounding provinces — the most sustained and violent demonstrations by Tibetans in decades .
This year , China has largely sealed off Tibet to the outside world .
Recent visitors to Lhasa have described armed police posted on rooftops .
Local governments in Tibetan areas have ordered foreign tourists out , and foreign journalists have been detained and told to leave .
Internet and text - messaging services , which helped spread word of last year 's protests , have been unplugged in parts of the region .
Following the protests , China has stepped up its campaign to vilify the Dalai Lama , accusing him of leading a campaign to split the region from the rest of the country .
The Dalai Lama insists , though , that he does not want Tibetan independence , saying he is only seeking greater autonomy for the region to protect its unique Buddhist culture .
This is making the rounds .

A lingua franca for application extension
During his keynote presentation at OSCON last year , Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth described application extensibility as an important enabler of innovation and user empowerment .
Citing the Firefox web browser and its rich ecosystem of add - ons as an example , Shuttleworth suggested that the Linux community could deliver a lot of extra value by making scriptable automation and plugin capabilities available pervasively across the entire desktop stack .
The concept is very compelling and has a long history .
There are many examples from which to draw inspiration , because similar capabilities are present in virtually every platform .
Long ago , scripting languages called Guile and Tcl were the dominant extension languages of the Linux platform .
Although both still exist today , they are somewhat anachronistic and are no longer widely used .
In today 's world , demand for application extensibility is rising , and there is a strong need for interoperability between extension systems .
To accommodate those requirements , it 's a clear that the desktop must have a lightweight lingua franca for scripting and extension .
To gain traction on the desktop , the language has to be widely known , easy - to-use , and naturally conducive to rapid development .
JavaScript , which meets all of these requirements , is becoming a compelling contender for the role .
The ubiquity of web development expertise guarantees broad JavaScript familiarity , and the growing trend of convergence between the desktop and the web also contribute to JavaScript 's suitability as a desktop extension solution .
The developers of the open - source Qt toolkit , the underlying framework of the KDE desktop environment , figured this out a few years ago and introduced a native scripting engine based on JavaScript 's syntax ( it 's a standards - compliant implementation of ECMA - 262 ) directly in the toolkit .
It leverages Qt 's object system to provide dynamic access to native Qt widgets , with full support for Qt 's signal and slot system .
We recently took a close look at how these scripting capabilities are used in Amarok , KDE 's popular open source audio player .
A significant amount of Amarok 's functionality was implemented with scripting and , as I demonstrated in the article , it 's trivially easy for end users to add a wide range of additional features .
The GNOME platform could soon have similar support for scripting .
Two projects have emerged that aim to bring rich JavaScript bindings and embedded scripting functionality to GTK + application developers .
The Seed project is based on WebKit 's JavaScriptCore engine and the Gjs project leverages Mozilla 's SpiderMonkey engine .
GObject introspection
Both projects take advantage of a new and highly experimental introspection feature that is being integrated into GObject , the type system and object model framework that is used in GTK + and other libraries within the GNOME ecosystem .
The GObject introspection system supplies programmatically - accessible type metadata for GObject - based libraries .
Static analysis tools automatically generate the metadata by analyzing header files and extracting annotations from source code .
The metadata is then stored in XML - based GObject Introspection Repository ( GIR ) files .
One of the numerous advantages of having this type metadata available is that it dramatically reduces the complexity inherent in supplying language bindings for libraries .
One of the earliest experiments that demonstrated the viability of using GObject introspection for dynamically generating language bindings was the PyBank binding framework .
GObject introspection developer Johan Dahlin showed that it was possible to generate bindings at runtime as needed using the GObject metadata .
Seed and Gjs use a similar approach .

When a Child Becomes the Caregiver
Karen James 's visit drove me to continue probing the long - term effects of divorce on children .
The minute she left , I went to my study and drew out her family 's record to refresh my memory .
I have copious files on each family member in our study , including verbatim transcripts of past interviews , letters from teachers , notes describing dollhouse play , children 's drawings , comments from parents about their own lives and their beliefs about their children , comments from children showing an astonishing difference in perceptions , and my own margin notes about what each family represents .
The first item that caught my eye was a drawing Karen had done when we met .
( Children 's drawings often tell you what they are feeling and reveal far more than spoken words . )
Karen had depicted each member of her family in meticulous detail -- her mother , father , eight - year - old brother Kevin , and six - year - old sister Sharon .
Dressed in bright colors , they were standing very close together , each smiling broadly .
Even the cat was smiling .
" My Family " was printed across the top in large block letters .
I was intrigued by Karen 's capacity to maintain an image of serenity in her drawing because by now I was privy to the shrieking disorganization in her family life .
Karen 's wish for peace and family togetherness was poignantly clear .
As I was to learn , this was the central desire of her life .
The James divorce totally bewildered the children .
Though on a rocky course for several years , the marriage was functioning ( in the children 's eyes ) and family life seemed pretty stable .
The father made a good living as a dermatologist who worked long hours in a private practice with four other physicians .
The mother was furious at her husband , complaining that he was never available , spent zero time with the children , was cold and aloof as a husband and incompetent as a lover .
He paid almost no attention to what he called her " yammering . "
She was a strikingly beautiful woman who worked part - time in an upscale floral shop making elegant , expensive flower arrangements .
The job engaged her artistic streak and enabled her to be at home in the afternoons when the children got home from school .
She was a strict , demanding mother .
He was an emotionally distant father -- when he was around .
The parents yelled at one another , barking grievances that made no sense to the children , but there was never any talk of divorce .
As the three siblings told me , Sturm und Drang were part of normal family life .
The real storm began with the sudden traumatic death of Mrs. James 's mother , who was killed in a highway accident .
Mrs. James collapsed with grief .
She had depended on her mother for advice , affection , and help in maintaining the social façade of a happy marriage .
The death precipitated an agitated depression in Mrs. James , who became increasingly angry at the world and critical of everyone around her .
She turned to her husband for solace , love , compassion , and sexual intimacy .
He became the chief target of her rage because he did not provide the help she needed .
Quarrels that were part of the marriage began to magnify and cascade as the anger took on a life of its own .
Soon their life was nothing but a series of arguments , each louder than the next .
Dr. James was badly frightened by the intensity of his wife 's needs and withdrew further .
Reeling from both losses , she attacked him more and more wildly .
Stung by her loud accusations of his failings , he countered with accusations of infidelity , long - standing frigidity , and incompetent mothering .
As best I could make out , the final trigger was Dr. James 's departure for a two - day dermatology convention .
Consumed by her anger , she impulsively sought legal counsel and filed for divorce .
As I looked over the record and searched my memory , I was surer than ever that the James 's quarrels had more passion than content .
They were not fighting over infidelity -- which was apparently old hat -- so much as wanting to hurt each other .
Each heatedly denied the other 's accusations .
Yet , like so many divorcing couples , they fought savagely , as the children looked on helplessly or ran away and hid .
As happens in many families , there was no disagreement around child custody or visiting .
Mrs. James would have done anything to irritate her husband , including making him take the kids -- as long as that is what he did not want .
Anger Does n't End with Divorce
The marriage was dissolved amid rising chaos within the family .
The parents ' fury at each other did not subside over the years that followed , although it was never fought out in the courts .
This is a familiar situation for those of us who work with divorcing couples .
Contrary to what most people think ( including attorneys and judges ) , the vast majority of divorcing parents do not drag their conflicts into the courtroom .
The 10 to 15 percent of couples who do fight in court consume the lion 's share of our attention but they do not represent the norm .
Most parents negotiate a divorce settlement , decide on custody arrangements , and go their separate ways .
Unfortunately , many of them stay intensely angry with one another .
In our study , a third of the couples were fighting at the same high pitch ten years after their divorce was final .
Their enduring anger stemmed from continued feelings of hurt and humiliation fueled by new complaints ( child support is too burdensome or too little ) and jealousy over new , often younger partners .
The notion that divorce ends the intense love / hate relationship of the marriage is another myth of our times .
Like many divorced people , Karen 's mother frequently called her ex-husband and got into shouting matches .
As a result , the children were exposed to the hurt and anger that led to the breakup throughout their growing up years .
Millions of children today experience the same unrelenting drama of longing and anger that refuses to die .
It is , of course , hard to know how often divorce is precipitated by factors outside the marriage .
I have seen a good number of such instances .
Indeed , it is one of the common causes -- or more precisely , final triggers -- of divorce , yet few people seem to recognize its importance .
Whenever people are shaken by a serious loss in their lives -- be it the termination of a job , death of a parent , serious illness in a child , or any grievous event that can evoke powerful and primitive passions -- the bereaved person will turn to their spouse for comfort .
If the partner responds with understanding and tenderness , the marriage can be forever enriched .
But the tragedy can also split people apart when the bereaved person is deeply disappointed in the partner 's response and feels rejected in his or her hour of greatest need .
Grief turns to rage as the two people end up irrationally blaming the other -- one for not having empathy , the other for making insatiable demands .
The initial loss is soon compounded , anger and accusations take over , and the marriage cascades downward .
Mrs. James followed this script to the letter .
It 's especially tragic when divorce occurs as the sequel to a serious life crisis .
The suffering person loses whatever support there was in the marriage and confronts the transition from marriage to singlehood in a depleted state .
The children are badly frightened and apprehensive about what lies ahead .
It 's as if the entire family at its weakest point is expected to deal with an earthquake and its aftershocks .
What happened to this family is instructive .
Many people , including lawyers , judges , and mediators , do n't understand how often in divorce seemingly rational complaints cloak powerful , irrational feelings .
Or they assume that the complaints always reflect anger at the spouse and not some other deep sadness .
However familiar Mrs. James 's marital troubles sounded to her attorney , her anger did not arise from the marriage per se but from a secondary loss that fueled her rage .
Ideally , her grief over her mother 's sudden death and her inability to mourn should have been addressed before she moved ahead to make thoughtful decisions about her divorce and her children .
This is the kind of rage that can last for decades after divorce and it is the kind of anger that leaves lasting residue on a child 's personality .
As an adult , Karen is terrified of conflict because it 's so dangerous .
But we 're getting ahead of our story .
Becoming a Caregiver Child
Six months after the divorce , Dr. James married a much younger woman whom the children liked very much .
She was lively , funny , and did not try to intrude into their lives as a rule - making stepmother but rather befriended them and treated them warmly .
Unfortunately , Dr. James carried some baggage into his second marriage and it , too , was stormy , featuring many unexplained weekend departures by the second wife .
Three years later , she kissed the children good - bye and left to marry another man .
" I was a basket case , " Dr. James told me during one of our follow - up interviews .
The children were stunned , bereft of explanation for the second loss in their family life .
Nor did Mrs. James find much happiness in the years after her divorce .
She had several love affairs followed by a second marriage .
The new husband , who ran a landscape business , could not tolerate the children and soon grew bored with his pretty wife .
The marriage lasted less than five years , throwing the mother into continued turmoil .
For Karen , the legacy of divorce was that she moved into the role of substitute parent for her younger siblings and of confidante and adviser to her troubled mother and father .
It was an entirely new role for this child who , like many others before the divorce , had been leading a fairly protected life .
Yet Karen undertook the classic role of caregiver or " parentified " child with aplomb and grace .
In fact , she was a model parent .
" My brother is scared of a lot of things , " she once warned me .
" What is he scared of ? "
" Of the dark .
Of going upstairs .
Of being alone .
I try to take care of him .
I go into his room every night , so he wo n't cry . "
Many young girls voluntarily move to fill the vacuum created by parents who collapse emotionally , and sometimes physically , after divorce .
The caregiver child 's job , as she defines it , is to keep the parent going by acting in whatever capacity is needed -- mentor , adviser , nurse , confidante .
The range is wide depending on the parent 's need and the child 's perception .
One ten - year - old in this group got up regularly with her insomniac mother at midnight to watch television and drink beer .
She frequently stayed home from school to make sure that her mother would not become depressed and suicidal or take the car out when she was drinking .
A father told me how his twelve - year - old daughter had packed his clothing , helped him to find an apartment , and arranged to do his shopping .
She called him nightly to make sure that he had gotten home safely , and to beg him to stop smoking .
Although most caregivers are girls , we 've seen several dramatic instances of boys who undertook similar roles .
One fourteen - year - old boy , whose mother abandoned the family , stopped going to school and undertook all of his mother 's responsibilities , including shopping , cooking , cleaning , and caring for his father who was in a state of collapse .
Such children soon sacrifice their friends , school activities , and , most important , their sense of being children -- childhood itself .
In return , they gain a sense of pride and the feeling that they have saved a parent 's life .
When there are siblings at home , the caretaker child moves forthrightly into the parental role and takes charge of running the house , making dinners , seeing that homework is done , putting little ones to bed , cleaning bathrooms late at night .
Karen was well suited for this caretaking job and quickly learned to keep her own feelings under tight control .
To her great credit , Karen had enormous compassion for both of her parents and was especially comforting to her mother , who in turn acknowledged how much she depended on her ten - year - old .
With no hint of embarrassment , Mrs. James told me , " Karen takes care of me .
She understands me without words . "
Like most parents who come to rely heavily on their children , she had little or no awareness of the child 's heavy sacrifice of her own playtime and friendships .
She was n't aware of the fact that Karen was missing school and not paying attention to classroom work .
Instead , she spoke as if Karen were an adult or even a much older person .
" When she sees me sitting alone in the evening , she knows that I feel sad and she puts her arms around me .
She is also very wise .
She told me to get rid of my boyfriend .
' He will only hurt you , ' she said .
I 've learned to listen to her . "
And who , I wondered , does Karen turn to for soothing words ?
Who does she have to comfort her in the years following divorce ?
Or does she gradually learn to block her own feelings and needs because they are too painful ?
Karen told me how she liked to sit alone in her grandmother 's garden where it was quiet and she felt safe .
I regretted that she did n't have many friends but was pleased to hear she had at least this one oasis .
I remember Karen years later telling me , " My grandmother saved my life . "
There 's no way for a sensitive child to see her mother cry or her father fall into depression without worrying that she 's the cause of it -- and so she takes full responsibility for her mother 's tears and father 's moods .
I watched Karen with a feeling of great helplessness , realizing there was nothing I could do to alleviate her pain or slake her thirst for protection .
I remember once asking her , " What will you be when you grow up , Karen ? "
She blushed .
" I want to work with children who are blind or retarded or who can't speak . "
I thought of Karen 's mother who sat alone and cried , of her brother who was afraid of the dark , of all the sorrowful people in this family , including herself , whom this amazing child wanted to rescue and I almost cried .
When a child forfeits her childhood and adolescence to take on responsibilities for a parent , her capacity to enjoy her life as a young person , develop close friendships , and cultivate shared interests is sacrificed .
Beyond this loss , there is a major psychological hazard if the upside - down dependence goes on too long .
The child may become trapped into feeling that she alone must rescue the troubled parent .
When she attends to her own needs and wishes , she feels guilty and undeserving .
This happens if the parent 's unhappiness continues for years and the parent comes to rely on the child for comfort or when the child herself assumes the role and wo n't give it up .
Whatever its origins , the child feels obliged to care for the parent in whatever capacity is needed -- as caregiver , companion , mentor , or the person who keeps depression at bay .
Karen said , " My mom has no one .
Only me . "
As strange as this sounds , many of these youngsters believe that it 's their duty to keep their parent alive .
Without them , the parent would die .
This is an awesome responsibility , especially for a child who has no one to confide in .
It is far beyond the kind of help a devoted child gives to a parent in a temporary crisis , divorce or otherwise .
It is an overburdening that seriously inhibits the child 's freedom to separate normally and to lead a healthy adolescence .
Bound to the troubled parent by unbreakable strands of love , compassion , guilt , and self - sacrifice , the child is not free to leave home emotionally or to follow her heart in love or marriage .
In fact , the parents and siblings may not feel able to function without her .
They may cling to her and block her exit .
As I was to learn later , many of these child caregivers reinstalled the rescue relationship that they had with their parents into their adult relationships with the opposite sex .
This is a serious long - term consequence of divorce for those who become caught up in the caregiver role .
The Diminished Parent
By the time Karen was fifteen , her home situation had changed very little .
She made no waves in high school and got just passing grades .
Her teachers described her as being quiet , reserved , and ladylike .
They made no inquiries about her frequent absences , perhaps assuming too easily that someone at home was ill and she was needed .
Clearly she was not working to her potential .
How could she ?
Again I asked Karen about her plans for the future and she replied in what had become her customary grave , thoughtful manner .
" I 'd like to get married and maybe have kids .
But you never know , you might get a divorce .
I do n't ever want that . "
To understand how divorce affects children over the long haul , we need to explore the fact that the divorced family is not just a cut - off version of the two - parent family .
The postdivorce family is a new family form that makes very different demands on each parent , each child , and each of the many new adults who enter the family orbit .
For millions of American children the experience of growing up -- of simply being a child -- has changed .
For millions of adults , the experience of being a parent has been radically transformed .
The first thing we need to acknowledge is the close link between the marital bond and the parent - child relationship .
Every parent and child knows this is true .
When the marriage is working and the couple is content , the parent - child relationship is nourished and rewarded by the parents ' love and appreciation for each other and supported by their cooperation .
But when the tie is severed , the break sends messages throughout the system that quickly reach the children .
The first message is that parenting is diminished .
The adults are now each on their own and occupied with building separate lives .
How will I manage and where am I going and how can I put my life together ?
How does this diminished parenting show up ?
Ask any child of divorce .
In every domain of the child 's life , parents are less available and less organized , provide fewer dinners together or even clean clothing , and do not always carry out regular household routines or help with homework or offer soothing bedtime rituals .
But the big picture is more troublesome than the details .
When the marriage breaks , children take on a new meaning for their parents .
They may become a much heavier burden .
Or they are an unfortunate residue from a dream that failed .
Or they may give hope and meaning to a parent 's life .
After divorce a surprising number of otherwise well - functioning adults reach out to children for help with their grown - up problems .
In Karen 's case , this kind of behavior became the norm , leading her into the role of caretaker child .
But in many families , the reversal of parent and child roles is more or less temporary , albeit shocking .
One father told me that he revealed all his business and personal plans in Castro - like lectures to his seven - year - old son who " understands everything . "
In our playroom , this child 's play consisted of running a Mack truck over a little car .
Parents who are otherwise mature and responsible in their social and professional commitments will choose to be vulnerable in front of their children .
Suddenly they place tremendous stock in the child 's opinion -- even when the child knows absolutely nothing about the issue at hand .
Thus the adult will ask for advice about a lover , how and where to live , whether or not to remarry , and whom to choose .
Others share their disappointments in love with very young children .
I was startled when Sammy , who was four , comforted his grieving mother whose lover had just left by saying , " He should n't quit in the middle .
That 's not right . "
The parents ' motives are not hard to understand .
Even women who choose to leave their marriages and have successful careers will feel alone and beleaguered as they face new responsibilities and have to make decisions alone , without advice from a partner .
Men are also depressed and lonely at this time .
They need help setting up a home for themselves and to be reassured that their children want to see them .
Men and women alike feel isolated and alienated from former friends who may be reluctant to take sides -- and thus stay away from both .
Other friends are concerned about the cracks in their own marriages and will keep a safe distance .
Family members often disapprove of the divorce and do not hesitate to say so .
Feeling hurt and defeated , each parent naturally turns to the children as their most loyal confidants .
Both rely heavily on their offspring for sympathy and companionship .
These youngsters literally help keep the parents going .
They are remarkably intuitive about adult depression and protect their parents from pressures outside and inside the home .
Twenty - five years after divorce , many men and women still say to me , " I would not have made it except for this child . "
Given how emotionally dependent on their children many parents become , it 's not surprising to see bitter custody or visitation fights over who has priority in the child 's life .
Many parents come to believe that without that child , they have no one .
Their only remaining important life relationship and loyal support lies with that child .
Thus the legal battle often has its roots in adult despair and not , as many people think , in the parents ' simple desire to spend more time with the child .
Men and women tell me that when the child is with the other parent they become seriously depressed and wander restlessly from room to room unable to bear their loneliness .
Sometimes this behavior occurs only during the months following the breakup .
But it can also endure , providing the basis for endless litigation over custody and visiting .
Such battles may distract parents from their personal misery but they hardly resolve it .
As these relationships develop , parents and children often become more like peers than separate generations , which in turn can make the children more independent and responsible .
They are justifiably proud of their achievement .
Many of our efforts to understand the impact of divorce on children have assumed incorrectly that the child is a passive vessel who is shaped by the changes ushered in by a divorce .
But the child is an active agent .
( This is a theme I will develop in depth in a later chapter . )
No one asked Karen to step forward .
She did it on her own .
Her role in the postdivorce family was entirely different from her role in the predivorce family .
In some homes , everyone benefits from the child 's new role .
Adults gain needed help .
Children gain maturity and self - confidence .
They also show a moral sensibility and compassion for others far beyond their years , which they can draw upon later in their adult relationships and often in their career choices .
Karen 's decision to study public health and to develop programs for crippled children was by her own account rooted in the early responsibility she took as a child .
For the fortunate parent who is able to rely on the child to get through the extended divorce crisis , the child 's availability may tip the balance between chronic dysfunction and recovery .
Of course , caregiving by a child can occur in intact families when a parent is ill or troubled .
I recall one little girl , Martha , the oldest of three siblings , who took overrunning the household for a year when her mother was recovering from a serious car accident .
Martha and her father shared in parenting the younger children and in taking care of Martha 's mother .
The difference was that although the mother was in a wheelchair for many months , she maintained close touch with what was going on in the home .
Both parents maintained adult responsibility for all their children at home .
Martha matured as a result of her experience and was rewarded by both parents with appreciation and praise .
In many immigrant families one of the older children often is responsible for helping the adults to understand the new language and strange culture .
Here , too , the child performs vital functions that enable the family to keep going , but the adults maintain their responsibility at the head of the family .
In contrast , in a postdivorce family , the child often takes responsibility for the one or both parents who are temporarily or lastingly overwhelmed by the crisis .
This situation can be compounded by the adult 's subsequent disappointments in relationships .
A formerly competent mother or father is unable to carry on as before .
Recovery from a divorce is a lot harder than we have realized and it lasts a lot longer .
As a result , the burden falls on the child who steps forward to take charge -- out of compassion and often out of unrealistic guilt .
This is one way that divorce profoundly changes not only the child 's experience but , as Karen illustrates , the whole personality of the child as she grows up and becomes an adult .
Caregiving that involves sacrificing one 's own wishes for the needs of others is poor preparation for happy choices in adult relationships , as we 'll see in coming chapters .

Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has refused to apologise for the arrest of shadow immigration minister Damian Green .
Ms Smith told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme it would be wrong for her to intervene in a police investigation .
She said to do so would have been itself " Stalinist " , because of the principle of police being independent .
Mr Green was arrested , but not charged , by police investigating alleged leaks from the Home Office .
He was held for nine hours while his home was searched .
' Held to account ' Police said Mr Green was held on suspicion of " conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office " .
The MP denied any wrongdoing and said " opposition politicians have a duty to hold the government to account " .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Ms Smith have denied any " prior knowledge " of the arrest , saying the matter was one for the police .
The idea that you charge in to impact on operational independence when things get a bit hot , is not a principled position
Jacqui Smith
In quotes : Green arrest Analysis : Tories on attack Ms Smith told BBC One 's Andrew Marr programme : " There have been a lot of charges thrown around here - the idea that , you know , this is Stalinism , this is a police state .
" In my book , Stalinism and a police state happens when ministers direct and interfere with specific investigations that the police are carrying out . "
Ms Smith , who also declined to condemn the fact police searched Mr Green 's office in the House of Commons , said the leak investigation was launched at the request of the Cabinet Office and the head civil servant at the Home Office , and not by her .
She added that the leaks in the public domain were not necessarily all the things which formed the " systematic series of leaks ... breaches of security " which were being investigated .
' Implausible or incompetent '
Pressed about what she knew when , Ms Smith said she had known there was a leak inquiry going on and knew in advance that a Home Office official was being arrested as part of it on 11 November .
Conservative leader David Cameron , writing in the News of the World , challenged ministers to condemn the arrest and said the prime minister 's stance so far was " not good enough " .
He said : " The question is : does he think it is right for an MP who has apparently done nothing to breach our national security - and everything to inform the public of information they 're entitled to know - to have his home and office searched by a dozen counter - terrorist police officers , his phone , blackberry and computers confiscated , and to be arrested and held for nine hours ? "
There is no crime , this is an abuse of police powers , this is President Nixon 's America - harassing a political opponent of the government .
It should stop
Ken Clarke
Ex -Tory home secretary
Q&A : Damian Green arrested Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg told the same BBC programme the claim Ms Smith did not know the arrest was looming was either " implausible " or showed " incompetence " .
The incident has also angered MPs within the Labour Party .
David Winnick - a Labour member of the home affairs select committee - said he wanted an " immediate statement " from the minister when Parliament resumes on Wednesday .
He said the search of Damien Green 's Commons office was a serious breach of parliamentary privilege .
The Independent on Sunday has separately reported that offices of senior Tories , including Mr Green , were routinely swept for electronic bugging devices as they feared they were being spied on .
Ms Smith said that she had not signed any warrant to approve the bugging of Mr Green .

The Adapter Pattern in Python
Interface mismatches are one of the banes of code reuse .
You want to integrate component A and component B into your program , but component A expects a method called half_empty ( ) while component B only has a method called half_full ( ) .
The Gang of Four ( GoF ) Adapter pattern is used to convert the interface of an object to one the client expects , allowing collaboration between classes that normally could n't work together due to differing interfaces .
2D Land : A Demonstration of the Adapter Pattern
Let 's motivate that with a little example .
We 're going to start with a simple system , then add components to it with an interface that 's different from the one our system expects .
We 'll use the Adapter pattern to wrap the new components , so we can use them without changing the code in our existing system .
So let 's get started .
We 've been tasked with writing the back - end code for 2D Land , a cutting - edge world simulation program involving poorly drawn cartoon figures .
Our initial spec is pretty simple : our world consists of people , and when a person is clicked , their name and a speech bubble is printed .
We need to code a Person class , and a click_creature ( ) function that will return a person 's name and speech bubble to the GUI team .
So let 's get coding .
One way to code this would be as shown below .
We have a Person class , with a name property and a make_noise ( ) method .
These can be accessed to retrieve the Person 's name and speech bubble .
class Person ( object ) :
" " " A representation of a person in 2D Land " " "
def __init__ ( self , name ) :
self .
name = name
def make_noise ( self ) :
return " hello " Person , name= namemake_noise def click_creature ( creature ) :
" " "
React to a click by retrieving the creature's
name and what is says
" " " return creature.name , creature.make_noise ( )
The Person class takes a name argument , which it stores in its name attribute .
The click_creature ( ) function retrieves the person 's name and speech - bubble text .
We test it , and everything works as expected .
Looks like it 's time for a launch party !
More Features in 2D Land
After we get back from our team trip to Cancun , we find that our users are so happy with 2D Land that management has decided to build 2D Land version 2.0 !
The killer new feature of version 2.0 is that in addition to people , 2D Land will now also have dogs .
Luckily , the programmers over in the Pet Land team are going to let us use their Dog class .
The Dog class has a name property , and a bark ( ) method that returns the dog 's bark sound .
class Dog ( object ) :
" " " A representation of a dog in 2D Land " " "
def __init__ ( self , name ) :
self .
name = name
def bark ( self ) :
return " woof "
As it stands , the Dog class does n't have the interface that our clients expect .
It has a name property , but instead of a make_noise ( ) method , it 's got a bark ( ) method .
But we can use the Adapter pattern to wrap the Dog class and give it the expected interface .
Let 's start by solving this the classic GoF way .
There are actually two ways to implement Adapter in GoF : the Class Adapter and the Object Adapter .
The Class Adapter uses multiple inheritance , while the Object Adapter uses encapsulation .
For the sake of completeness I 'm going to show both of them , and then explain why the Object Adapter is almost always the best choice for Python .
According to the classic implementation of the Adapter pattern , we need a common class that Person and a dog adapter can inherit from ; let 's call it a Creature class .
The DogClassAdapter and DogObjectAdapter classes will each inherit from Creature ; DogClassAdapter will then inherit from Dog , and DogObjectAdapter will wrap Dog .
According to the pattern , Creature is supposed to be an abstract base class ( ABC ) ; that is , it 's not supposed to be instantiated directly .
Python 2.X does n't have ABCs as a language feature , but we can fake it here by having calls to make_noise ( ) raise a NotImplemented Error .
This means that we need classes to inherit from Creature and implement make_noise ( ) for us .
from dog import Dog dogDog class Creature ( object ) :
" " " The base class for creatures in 2D Land " " " def make_noise ( self ) :
" " "
This is a technique to fake an ABC
in Python 2.X
" " "
raise NotImplementedError class Person( Creature ) :
" " " A representation of a person in 2D Land " " "
def __init__ ( self , name ) :
self.name = name def make_noise ( self ) :
return " hello " class DogClassAdapter ( Creature , Dog ) :
" " " Adapts the Dog class through multiple inheritance " " "
def __init__ ( self , name ) :
Dog.__init__( self , name ) def make_noise ( self ) :
" " "
Provide the ' make_noise ' method that
the client expects
" " "
return self .bark ( )
DogClassAdapter inherits from Creature and Dog , getting the functionality of both .
It takes a name parameter in its __init__ ( ) method , which it passes on to Dog .
It then implements a make_noise ( ) method , returning the results of the bark ( ) method it inherited from Dog .
class DogObjectAdapter ( Creature ) :
" " " Adapts the Dog class through encapsulation " " "
def __init__ ( self , canine ) :
self .
canine = canine DogObjectAdapterCreature , canine= canine def make_noise ( self ) :
" " " This is the only method that 's adapted " " "
return self.canine.bark ( ) def __getattr__( self , attr ) :
" " " Everything else is delegated to the object " " "
return getattr( self.canine , attr )
DogObjectAdapter only inherits from Creature .
It takes a Dog instance as a parameter to its __init__ ( ) method , and stores that instance as self .
canine .
It implements a make_noise ( ) method , which returns the result of calling the bark ( ) method of its wrapped Dog object .
All other calls on the class are passed to its canine instance via the __getattr__ ( ) method .
In both cases , we only need to implement the interface we 're adapting .
DogClassAdapter inherits the rest of the Dog interface , while DogObjectAdapter uses __getattr__ ( ) to provide the same interface as the Dog class , with the exception of the methods it implements itself .
And here 's why we do n't need the Class Adapter .
Class Adapter is basically a shortcut to avoid coding stubs .
In languages like C++ , Object Adapter would force us to implement stubs for every method on the Dog class , just so we could pass them on to the wrapped Dog instance .
With Class Adapter , however , we 'd already have the behaviour implemented , so would n't need to write stubs .
This does n't make any difference in a simple class like Dog , but consider a huge class like StringIO .
StringIO from the standard library ; writing stubs for every method in that class just to adapt the interface slightly would be a real pain .
But in Python , we do n't have to write stubs for the behaviour we do n't wrap ; we can take advantage of dynamic dispatching instead , by implementing the __getattr__ ( ) method .
__getattr__( ) is a " magic " method , as denoted by the double underscores .
The Python interpreter calls it when it does an attribute lookup on the object , and can't find a matching attribute .
By intercepting this call and passing on the attribute lookup to the wrapped object , DogObjectAdapter only needs to implement the make_noise ( ) method ; everything else gets passed on to its wrapped object .
Flattening the Object Hierarchy
The code above works ; we can created adapted dogs , and feed them into our click_creature ( ) function .
But is inheriting from a Creature base class the best way ?
With statically typed languages , inheritance is used for two purposes : to coerce types , and to inherit behaviour .
By coercing types , I mean using a common base class so that we can feed a common type to the click_creature ( ) function .
These are the kinds of hoops you need to jump through to make the compiler happy in statically typed languages .
In Python , we do n't need to use inheritance to coerce the type system , because we use duck typing ; we only need to use inheritance for behaviour .
Duck typing : ask what an object can do , rather than ask what type an object is ( i.e. do n't ask if it 's a duck ; ask if it quacks like a duck ) .
So we do n't need to inherit from a Creature base class in order to use our various objects in the click_creature ( ) function .
And in fact , there 's a big problem with this inheritance approach : it would force us to change our existing codebase , by modifying the Person class to inherit from Creature .
So let 's flatten the hierarchy out :
Here 's our code without the Creature base class , and getting rid of the Class Adapter :
from dog import Dog dogDog class Person ( object ) :
" " " A representation of a person in 2D Land " " "
def __init__ ( self , name ) :
self.name = name def make_noise ( self ) :
return " hello " class DogAdapter ( object ) :
" " " Adapts the Dog class through encapsulation " " "
def __init__ ( self , canine ) :
self.canine = canine def make_noise ( self ) :
" " " This is the only method that 's adapted " " "
return self.canine.bark ( ) def __getattr__( self , attr ) :
" " " Everything else is delegated to the object " " "
return getattr( self.canine , attr ) def click_creature ( creature ) :
" " "
React to a click by showing the creature 's
name and what is says
" " " return ( creature.name , creature.make_noise( ) )
This is a lot simpler .
We 've captured the intent of the Adapter pattern , without bothering with the trappings of less dynamic languages .
Just because the GoF implement a pattern in a certain way does n't mean it 's the only or even best way to do it in Python .
Use the essence of the pattern , and leave out the accidents of implementation .
Testing out the System
Let 's test out our DogAdapter class with a function that simulates clicks on each type of creature in 2D Land .
from dog import Dog
from listing3 import Person , DogAdapter dogDoglisting3Person , DogAdapter def exercise_system ( ) :
person = Person ( " Bob " )
canine = DogAdapter ( Dog ( " Fido " ) ) for critter in ( person , canine ) : print critter.name , " says " , critter.make_noise( ) if __name__ == " __main__ " :
exercise_system ( )
animate_objects ( ) creates instances of classes Person and DogAdapter ; it then prints the name and speech bubbles of each object .
The output is shown below .
Output :
Bob says hello
Fido says woof
Perfect !
Looks like we 're ready to launch version 2.0 .
Extending the Adapter Concept
We 've got our Adapter working pretty well now , but we can still make it better .
Think about how we added a Dog class to 2D Land .
What if we later want to add a Cat class , and Bird class , and so on ?
Here 's a Cat class , that has a name attribute , and a meow ( ) method that returns the cat 's meow sound .
class Cat ( object ) :
" " " A representation of a cat in 2D Land " " "
def __init__ ( self , name ) :
self .
name = name
def meow ( self ) :
return " meow "
The problem with the current implementation is that every time we add a new class to our system , we 're potentially going to have to write a new adapter class for it .
We can take advantage of Python 's dynamic nature to write a single , generic adapter class for all the new classes we add .
Our generic adapter will take two arguments in its __init__ ( ) method : the object it 's going to wrap , and an implementation of make_noise ( ) .
class CreatureAdapter ( object ) :
" " " Adapts a creature for clients in 2D Land " " "
def __init__ ( self , creature , make_noise ) :
" " " Pass in the function to use as ' make_noise ' " " "
self .
creature = creature
self .
make_noise = make_noise CreatureAdapter , creature , make_noise= creature= make_noise def __getattr__ ( self , attr ) :
" " " Everything else is delegated to the object " " "
return getattr( self.creature , attr )
Note that the code no longer has to know anything about the Dog class or other creatures in 2D land .
All we need to do is supply an object to adapt and a method to use for make_noise ( ) , and we 're done .
So let 's test out the new system , and see how we 'd specify the make_noise ( ) method .
from dog import Dog
from cat import Cat
from twodeeland import Person , CreatureAdapter dogDogcatCattwodeelandPerson , CreatureAdapter def exercise_system ( ) :
person = Person ( " Bob " )
fido = Dog ( " Fido " )
canine = CreatureAdapter ( fido , fido . bark )
whiskers = Cat ( " Whiskers " )
feline = CreatureAdapter ( whiskers , whiskers . meow ) for critter in ( person , canine , feline ) :
print critter.name , " says " , critter.make_noise ( )
We have to specify which method to use as the make_noise ( ) method on instance creation , but in return we no longer have to create an Adapter for each new class in the system .
I 'd say that 's a big win .
Output :
Bob says hello
Fido says woof
Whiskers says meow
One final note about this system : you may have been wondering what happens if the class we 're adapting does n't have a name attribute ( for example , if the attribute is called " nickname " ) .
In that case , we could simply create new class that inherits from the creature class , implementing the name attribute via a property , and pass an instance of that to our CreatureAdapter class .
class NicknameCat ( object ) :
" " " A representation of a cat in 2D Land " " "
def __init__ ( self , nickname ) :
self .
nickname = nickname
def meow ( self ) :
return " meow " NicknameCat , nickname= nicknamemeow class NicknameCatAdapter ( NicknameCat ) :
def __init__ ( self , name ) :
NicknameCat.__init__( self , name )
def _get_name ( self ) :
return self.
nickname
def _set_name ( self , name ) :
self .
nickname = name
name = property ( _get_name , _set_name )
We could then do something like this :
kitty = NicknameCatAdapter ( " Whiskers " )
critter = CreatureAdapter ( kitty , kitty .
meow )
Note that this presupposes that the adapted class has some functionality that serves as the name attribute ; the Adapter class is all about changing the interface of an object , not adding to its functionality .
Using Adapter with Objects Other Than Classes
The Adapter pattern as classically implemented works with classes , but that 's just an accident of the languages that the pattern was initially made for .
Essentially any object in Python is ripe for adapting .
For example , you could adapt a function so that its signature was something that the client expected .
As an example , below we have a countdown ( ) function .
It takes as its arguments a number to count down from , and a callback function to call when it 's done ( callbacks are a common programming technique in things like multithreaded and asynchronous programs ) .
We want to use the completed ( ) function as its callback , but completed ( ) takes an argument ( the source ) , while countdown ( ) calls its callback without any arguments .
We can use the adapter pattern to change the signature of completed ( ) to what countdown ( ) expects .
def completed ( source ) :
print source , " completed " completedsourcesource , def countdown ( num , callback ) :
for i in range ( num , 0 , - 1 ) :
print " %s … " % i
callback ( ) def main ( ) :
def nullarg_callback ( ) :
completed ( " countdown " )
countdown ( 3 , nullarg_callback ) if __name__ == " __main__ " :
main ( )
Above , we adapted the completed ( ) function using the nullarg_callback ( ) function .
Output :
3 …
2 …
1 …
countdown completed
The Adapter pattern changes the interface of an object in order to match the interface that 's expected .
In the 2D Land example , we adapted the Dog class to provide make_noise ( ) method that our system expects .
The Adapter pattern is a good choice any time you 're integrating some code into an existing system , and the code has the needed functionality , but not the needed interface .
Here 's the code for this post , together with unit tests .
WASHINGTON , March 25 ( UPI ) -- The U.S. Air Force had no immediate word on the fate of the pilot of an F - 22A fighter jet that crashed Wednesday near Edwards Air Force base in California .
The cutting - edge warplane was on a training flight when it went down in the high desert about 35 miles from Edwards .

The Air Force said in a brief written statement that the condition of the pilot , who was the only person on board , was not immediately known and it was not clear if the pilot had been located .
The F - 22 Raptor is the United States ' new front - line air dominance fighter .
The aircraft runs around $ 187 million per copy .
Msgr. Thomas J. Shelley , a priest and a historian at Fordham University , said that many priests in New York watched the news conference , and that “ the people I talk to are all very pleased .
“ He comes across as very intelligent and gregarious and a happy person , someone that ’s comfortable with people , ” said Monsignor Shelley , who has known the archbishop for 25 years .
“ He gives religion a good name . ”
When it comes to dealing with politicians who vote in favor of abortion rights , Archbishop Dolan said he would rather persuade them through “ engagement ” and “ trusting dialogue , ” rather than confrontation .
He is not one of the small but vocal minority of American bishops who favor denying communion to Catholic politicians who support the right to abortion .
( In fact , later in the day , he said he had received congratulatory phone calls from President Obama and from Gov. David A. Paterson and other New York politicians . )
At the news conference , he sidestepped a question about his position on a bill before the New York Legislature that would temporarily lift the statute of limitations to allow more victims of sexual abuse to file lawsuits .
Similar bills passed in other states have led to a flood of litigation and public revelations about the extent of clergy sexual abuse .
The New York State Catholic Conference has lobbied against it .
Archbishop Dolan said the issue was a matter of “ such delicacy and precision that I ’m going to have to study that one hard . ”
In Milwaukee , where he has served for seven years , Archbishop Dolan has disappointed advocates for victims of sexual abuse , who accuse him of failing to find and remove all offenders from the ministry  though they acknowledge that he was one of few bishops to make public a list of abusive priests .
The archbishop has never studied or lived in New York , and does not speak much Spanish , the mother tongue of one - third of the roughly 2.5 million Catholics in the Archdiocese of New York .
At the news conference , he said he was “ still trying to learn , ” but knew enough to celebrate the Mass and “ give a rather childlike homily . ”
The loss of the CBC Radio Orchestra last year looks to have been the first in a series of drastic changes to our public broadcaster , changes that could see it shift away from its mandate to “ reflect Canada and its regions to national and regional audiences ” and “ actively contribute to the flow and exchange of cultural expression " toward a more commercial - style entity .
With federal government support unforthcoming , the CBC is now considering selling assets , such as Radio 3 , to cope with an advertising revenue shortfall of $ 65 million for the fiscal year ending March 31 , according to reports from the Canadian Press and Reuters .
The public broadcaster might also consider increasing American programming , its president Hubert Lacroix said today at a media scrum in Toronto .
“ It costs 10 times more to make one hour of high - quality Canadian programming like ” ˜The Border ’ than it does to buy ” ˜ Wheel of Fortune ’ , ” Hubert is quoted by CP as saying .
Lacroix said he had requested a meeting with Prime Minister Stephen Harper to ask for “ financial flexibility ” , and insisted he was not looking for a government hand - out .
Heritage Minister James Moore ’s spokesperson Deirdra McCracken told the Globe and Mail the CBC was expected to tighten its belt , indicating that no new money would be forthcoming beyond the broadcaster ’s $ 1 billion in annual public funds .
The recent federal budget made no mention of the public broadcaster , and it is not clear whether the annual $ 1 - billion appropriation will remain in 2009 - 2010 .
Other measures taken by the CBC could include the introduction of ads on Radio 1 and / or Radio 2 , a move which Moore hinted earlier this month he could support .
If the essence of the CBC becomes diluted with American content and advertising , it ’s possible a Conservative government could argue that it is no longer any different from a commercial broadcaster , and therefore question whether taxpayers should be funding such an entity at all .
Church services are being held today to remember the victims of last weekend 's Victorian bushfires .
The services come as the fire threat eases across the state .
The Governor - General , Quentin Bryce , will attend church services with Kinglake and Whittlesea residents , north of Melbourne .
Survivors at Wandong , north of Melbourne , will be visited by the Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd .
Mr Rudd 's will firstly attend a briefing by local fire chiefs , to get an update on a series of blazes still burning across Victoria .
He will then head to the Wandong Relief Centre , where he will hear from those left homeless and displaced by the fires .
The Prime Minister will also take part in a church service to remember those who did not survive .
The service will take place on the back of a truck parked on the Wandong football ground , where burnt trees and black hills are clearly visible in the distance .
Mr Rudd will later visit nearby Kinglake , which was all but obliterated by the fires .
Melbourne services
In Melbourne , hundreds of churchgoers will gather at Fitzroy Gardens after services this morning .
Congregations from 17 churches across Melbourne will walk from their services to the gardens to remember the bushfire victims .
The Governor , Dr David de Kretser , will attend , along with Lord Mayor Robert Doyle and the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne , the Right Reverend Denis Hart .
Organiser Father Tom Knowles says he expects a large turnout .
" The response to the individual services that have been held around the place has been very strong , so I would expect that most churches will be well attended , " he said .
Father Knowles says the service is an opportunity to mourn the dead and the survivors in a more public way .
" [ It is ] an opportunity for us to get together as a combined Christian community from all around the city to demonstrate our solidarity with and prayer for those that have suffered so much in the recent fires and are still suffering , " he said .
Female trio 3G are performing the Georgian song
Georgia 's entry has been ruled unacceptable by organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest in Moscow , because of some of its lyrics .
The disco - funk song , We Don't Wanna Put In , appears to poke fun at Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
However , it is against the competition 's rules to allow political content in entries .
A contest spokesman said : " No lyrics , speeches , gestures of a political or similar nature shall be permitted . "
The event , which is being held in the Russian capital in May , is taking place less than a year after Russia and Georgia went to war over the region of South Ossetia .
Relations between the two countries have been tense for several years .
Georgia initially announced it would not take part in the Moscow contest due to political objections , but the decision was reversed in December .
' Negative move '
The song , which was chosen by a public vote and jury , was due to be performed by female trio 3G along with male vocalist Stephane .
The song , which has a distinct 1970s feel , contains the chorus : " We do n't wanna put in , the negative move , it 's killin ' the groove . "
Even the title of the song appears to be play on the politician 's name .
The Geneva - based European Broadcasting Union , which runs the contest , said Georgia can rewrite the lyrics of its entry or select another song .
Natya Uznadze , the group 's producer , said they had yet to receive official confirmation of the decision .
Vladimir Smirnov from Russia 's state - run Channel One - which will broadcast the contest - said the network had nothing to do with the decision .
Russia won the right to host the annual event after winning last year 's competition .
Unfortunately Crunch
The Card Game is not available for sale any longer available for sale , however if you 're interested in learing about how the game was played click here .
If you 're looking for other games related sites online please click here .
Crunch is the second game from TerrorBull Games , following the critical and widespread success of War on Terror , the boardgame .
TerrorBull Games create games that help people grapple with the more unpleasant things in life .
About the Game and Rules
Crunch is a card game for 2 to 4 players that allows you to experience the upside of down .
Placed in the role of a global banking CEO , you have to juggle the conflicting demands of your ailing bank and your flourishing bank account .
Along the way , the game also replicates our modern banking system and foreshadows the inevitable collapse of capitalism , but that 's just a bonus .
It 's a Trust Thing
Each player starts the game with a number of Assets in their bank , a small workforce and a few Trust cards .
Trust is essential to your bank 's survival .
Not only will capitalism falter without it , but each Trust card hides on the reverse a potential Government Bailout .
Government Bailouts can be called in at any time you 're feeling the pinch ( that 's at any time ) in return for a variable cash injection .
Occasionally though you get nothing , so spend them wisely .
Debt Makes the World Go Round
Using your workforce , you lend out your bank 's Assets as debt .
You can dabble in high risk debt for potentially big rewards ( and big losses ) or stick to the safer ( but less profitable ) low risk debt .
Either way , clever playing of the markets will bring in big returns .
Bonuses and Embezzling
Bury the bad news !
But then that 's all immaterial because what 's really important is how much money you can secure for your own personal fortune .
You do this by awarding yourself bonuses at regular intervals and by brazenly embezzling your own bank 's Assets and hiding them when no one else is looking .
If you get caught embezzling , you lose a Trust card and you remember how important Trust is , right ?
Surviving the Crunch
Occasionally , the Crunch will hit and all CEOs have to make sure they can cover all the money they 've lent out with the total value of Assets in their banks .
If they can't , it 's government bailout time or bust .
But do n't worry too much if that happens because if you 've managed to bonus and embezzle enough , you can still win the game , even if you go bankrupt first .
Remember , you could run a model bank for the entire duration of the game , but if you fail to look after number one , you risk ending up yachtless .
Why the Game Was Made
In 2008 , as over - inflated markets , dodgy investments and diminishing resources all began to reach breaking point , the world 's financial systems started to wobble .
War : oil , bombs , cement , diplomats and ice cream
Although the problems inherent in , say , spending over a trillion dollars on a war , while your country 's exports diminish year - on - year , would be apparent to the average school child , somehow everyone seemed caught off guard by this .
And , being simple people , we started looking around to find out who to blame .
Blame
There were many villains .
The sub prime mortgage market in the US , inept financial ratings agencies , credit - addicted consumers ( how dare we borrow cheap and easy money ! ) , reckless city traders and rogue crooks like Bernard Madoff and Jerome Kerviel .
The Car or the Driver ?
Unfortunately , you can't bomb the economy into shape , so looking for culprits was largely a waste of time .
Even when bank bosses finally came under fire , it all felt like a bit of a diversion .
Like sitting in an upturned , burning car and taking that moment to try and work out where you went wrong , when the car itself has no brakes , no steering wheel , tyres made out of butter and wood instead of glass for windows .
And it 's not even a car , it 's an angry lion on roller skates and you 've been trying to drive it .
Bankrupt country !
It all seems a bit short - sighted .
After all , in a system that rewards greed and profit , should we really be surprised when both get out of control ?
And in a society whose only measure of value requires a price tag , should we wonder when some people find it difficult to separate money and morals ?
It 's All Good Until It Goes Wrong
A hundred reasons have been given for the current global recession but no one 's actually questioning the system itself .
Surely everyone who ever over - borrowed , eveyone who overlent , every Madoff , every Enron , every Fred the Shred , every bonus - loving CEO were doing pretty much exactly what the system required of them ?
And while things were good , we loved these people - they were the grease in the wheels that powered the Good - Times - Inc. - Mobile
Maximise Profits
Rebrand !
It 's also worth remembering that this system is explicitly enforced in UK and US law , which states that all businesses have a legal duty to maximise profits whenever possible for their shareholders .
What this means is that if you put your customers first , or you dare to think about the social , environmental or political consequences of what you do as a business , then you are breaking the law unless it's for the ultimate benefit of your shareholders .
This is a system that is designed to reach breaking point .
The pattern of " boom and bust " is integral to capitalism and forever will be until we run out of people to exploit or resources to power that exploitation .
Maximising your profits easily be done outside of this game if you 're into games of chance .
Playing online casino games is a great way to benefit from the value of these games but from the comfort of your own home or office .
If you 're looking to maximise your reward online try playing at many of the online casinos out there .
Keith Ellison , one of two Muslims in Congress , has cosponsored a bill with Rep. Betty Collum that will help bi-national same - sex couples keep their families together .
The bill , which Rep. Jerrold Nadler has been pushing since 2003 , is called the Uniting American Families Act , and would allow non-citizen partners of gays and lesbians to gain permanent resident status via the same channels that married couples use .
If passed , this bill would obviously bring the U.S. a step closer in LGBT rights .
My interest in the bill lies particularly in Rep. Ellison ’s involvement .
Ellison was Congress ’ first Muslim , and is still very active in his local Muslim communities .
His involvement in the bill is interesting because the mainstream consensus on homosexuality in Islam is that it is not permissible .
Thus , his support for the bill may be off - putting to some in American Muslim communities .
But it may give hope to LGBT Muslim communities in America that their sexual orientation is recognized as a part of an acceptable family unit , if not in Islamic law , then in U.S. law .
If Ellison does believe that homosexuality is not permissible , he has put his personal beliefs about the LGBT community aside in order to help them keep their families together .
Since Islam puts a heavy emphasis on family and community , I ’d say that Ellison ’s support of the bill is right on target with Islamic beliefs , despite the idea that he ’s not supporting “ traditional ” family structures .
Ellison ’s support also proves that , despite what FOX news may have us believe , a Muslim legislator does not automatically equal a Shari’ah crusader hell - bent on bringing stoning into American law .
The bill sends a message to those in LGBT communities ( including LGBT Muslim communities ) that their non-citizen partners are welcome in the U.S .
And when a Muslim representative sponsors a bill to allow gay and lesbian immigrants to stay in the U.S. with their families ( I can almost hear conservative heads exploding ) , it sends a message that America truly has what it takes to be the egalitarian democracy it aims to be .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - NV Energy has postponed plans to build the 1,500 - megawatt Ely Energy Center in Nevada due to environmental pressures and estimates that capturing coal - fired carbon emissions will not be feasible before 2020 , company president and ceo Michael Yackira said .
In a telephone interview , Yackira said that even if the Ely Energy Center is postponed to 2020 or so , it does not mean that the plant has been canceled .
“ We believe that it would be economically imprudent for our customers and our investors to go forward at this stage , ” Yackira said .
“ We believe coal is an important resource for this country .
We have more coal than any other resource ( for electricity generation ) . ”
However , until so - called clean coal technologies that can capture carbon work and are affordable for utilities , NV Energy wo n’t build coal plants , he said .
But Ely has not been canceled , Yackira said .
“ When we say postpone , we say the message is correct , ” he said .
In the past few years , the number of coal - fired power plants planned have dropped from about 200 to about 70 , and more are being canceled or postponed every week .
So - called clean coal plants are seen as key to keeping domestic coal king of U.S. power generation .
About half the power generated in the United States comes from burning coal , more than twice the power made at natural gas or nuclear plants .
Yackira declined to say whether he thought other utilities with plans for coal - fired power plants will follow NV Energy ’s lead and call off construction until clean coal is an affordable reality .
NV Energy three years ago said the Ely Energy Center ’s two 750 - MW units and associated transmission power lines would cost about $ 3.8 billion and be operational by 2012 .
That price tag has jumped to more than $ 5 billion , Yackira said , with opening of the plants in phases in 2015 and 2016 .
NV Energy still plans to build the transmission line that was to carry power from Ely in northeastern Nevada to populous southern Nevada that includes Las Vegas .
But now , instead of coal - fired power , it will carry renewable power created by wind turbines and geothermal fields , Yackira said .
The original plan for the north - south transmission line was about $ 600 million , but the line that will carry renewable power will cost a fraction of that .
The company has not yet made any details public , Yackira said , noting those plans must first be announced to Nevada utility regulators .
NV Energy is the holding company for Nevada Power Co and Sierra Pacific Power Co . It serves about 1.2 million power customers .

The obvious choice is Doug TenNapel , comic maven and creator of Earthworm Jim ( his graphic novels , Creature Tech and Gear , are both masterpieces ) , but since weâve already established that comics donât count , you should probably go for a mix between Zdzislaw Beksinski and Michel Gagne .
He still works on comics , but most of his do n't have any word balloons , which makes them art .
â Worldsâ is actually more accurate .
As a student at psychic summer camp , Raz is able to dive into the brain of pretty much any character in the game , and each is a unique , fully developed world with its own physics and art design evolved from the characteristics of the mind itself .
Accordingly , the uptight Germanic counselorâs brain is aÂ two tone neon box of ever - transforming precision ; the paranoic security guardâs head is crammed with shady , faceless men muttering about conspiracy on an impossibly twisted version of Main Street , U.S.A. ; and the giant fish - monsterâs mind is exactly what youâd expect that to be .
Razâs descent into the world of thought is nothing short of an attempt to suss out the true inner workings of the human mind .
As levels shift and flow , illusory as dream , we are faced with the manifold physical manifestations of the metaphysical : the body of self - loathing , the shape of fear , the dark recesses of denial and repressed emotion .
We emerge sobered , and ready to explore our own minds with an equal amount of depth and rigor .
Tim Schafer , creator of Grim Fandango and most every other awesome Lucasarts game , made this one too , which means itâs smart , funny and thereâs a move that lets you set squirrels on fire with your mind .
Thus , the fabled trifecta has been achieved , and Psychonauts receives the Michael Swaim official seal of â Best Platformer of All Time.â 
Let the rabid argument begin !
Tough , since each brain has a whole separate visual aesthetic .
Iâd go with Jacek Yerka as a catchall , but Iâm open to other suggestions .
Bioshock , Okami , Heart of the Alien , Beyond Good & Evil , the Metroid series , Mirror 's Edge and the works of Warren Spector .
Just had to stop at some point .
Okami and Heart of the Alien I do n't find particularly fun ( compared to others on the list ) , but both innovative visually and deserving of a mention .
Beyond Good & Evil and Mirror are fun as hell , and Bioshock is just all around phenomenal .
Warren Spector = Thief and Deus Ex , among others .
The commenters have mentioned a number of great games that could have easily made an expanded version of this list , but I 'd like to throw my weight behind Neverhood and Skullmonkeys as well , especially the latter .
Buy it on Ebay , get the soundtrack , it 's all good .
Also , a game being really really good does n't make it easily comparable to modern art ; sorry .
And did someone really give me shit for not mentioning Out of This World when I went to the trouble of mentioning the incredibly obscure Heart of the Alien ?
Seriously , man , I 'm trying here .
Cut me some slack .

Once confined to Europe , the plague of demon dentists is now firmly established on the U.S. mainland , according to an article in the Sacramento ( California ) Bee .
A dentist from Woodland , Calif . is on trial , charged with 21 counts of sexual battery for allegedly fondling the chests of 14 of his female patients .
As many as 26 women reported similar incidents .
According to his attorney , the dentist was using the massages in an attempt to treat a “ stress - related jaw disorder . ”
( I ’m guessing that if any of those women had husbands , brothers , or even especially strong mothers and sisters , these relatives would have been happy to demonstrate to the dentist that stress - related jaw disorders were transmissible . )
According to the attorney , the dentist was merely imitating his brother , a physical therapist , who uses chest massages to relieve temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) .
The attorney used anatomical drawings to demonstrate that the muscles of the face , neck , shoulders and chest are all interconnected .
The dentist , his brother , and his attorney apparently all learned their anatomy from the old spiritual “ Dem Bones ” ( De foot bone connected to de ankle bone , de ankle bone connected to de leg bone , de leg bone connected to de knee bone .
. .)
Curiously , no male patients have come forward with similar stories about this dentist .
Apparently TMD is a problem only in women , or maybe the chest bone is connected to the jaw bone only in females .

Officers :
Are you sick and tired of excessive force lawsuits ?
Well cheer up .
Taser has a plan to give your police department its own CYA reality TV show .
The less - lethal weapons company has launched a wearable computer , called Axon , that will let cops record every minute of their day and upload it to a secure website .
From there , they can share their favorite memories with friends , family , and jurors .
" Our Axon and Evidence.com technology will be a lifeline to protect truth , " says Steve Tuttle , the vice president of communications for Taser .
For years , cops around the world have been accused of being a little too eager to reach out and stun someone .
For example , a Denver Post report found that 90 percent of the subjects tased by the police department there were unarmed .
Most times , the weapon was used to " force people to obey orders , to shortcut physical confrontations and , in several cases , to avoid having to run after a suspect . "
In Sarasota , officers recently tased a naked senior .
In Wales , cops even zapped a bunch of sheep .
Not long ago , the less - lethal weapons company started offering a camera accessory that sits on the bottom of its people - zappers , but those devices could only record the drama that takes place once the weapon is drawn and the safety is off – so it could miss some of the most important moments .
The new camera is head - mounted , so it will record everything the user lays his eyes on .
Each headset plugs into a Linux - powered computer that looks curiously similar to a PlayStation Portable , which has an LCD screen so that officers can watch instant replays of their favorite tackles and shakedowns .
When the day is done , just plug the recorder into the Synapse docking station , and all of the evidence will be automatically uploaded to Taser 's pair of data warehouses via a 128 - bit encrypted connection .
Well , most of it , anyway .
According to the Axon brochure , the system features a " One - Touch ' Privacy Mode ' " which " temporarily suspends recording . "
In other words , cops can still work the streets – without being caught on tape .

A proposal to impose a levy on Internet service providers to fund the creation of Canadian new media content is an " unlawful " idea that would harm consumers and create barriers to net access in this country , says Rogers Communications Inc .
The Toronto - based telecommunications and cable giant made those arguments today at the Canadian Radio - television Telecommunications Commission , which is holding public hearings on the thorny issue of new media regulation .
As part of that probe , the federal broadcast regulator is mulling the idea of imposing a new charge on Internet service providers , or ISPs , to fund the creation of Canadian content for new media platforms like the Internet .
It is a contentious idea that critics say will create added costs for consumers during the current economic downturn .
For their part , ISPs like Rogers and Shaw Communications Inc. have already filed various legal opinions with the CRTC that cast doubt on the lawfulness of such a levy .
That prompted CRTC chair Konrad von Finckenstein to acknowledge today that brewing legal battle will likely be resolved in court .
During his presentation , Ken Engelhart , chief of regulatory affairs for Rogers , tried to further his company 's legal argument by contending that ISPs function as telecommunications service providers and not broadcasters .
That means ISPs should remain exempt from the Broadcasting Act , including its Canadian content requirements , he said .
" ISPs are pipes , not broadcasters , " Engelhart told the commission .
" ISPs are the underlying telecommunications facility that customers use to access the Internet and that content providers , including broadcasters , use to transmit their content .
ISPs do not buy , package or sell programming or any other Internet content . "
Furthermore , the CRTC has a long history of treating ISPs as telecom service providers by regulating them through provisions of the Telecommunications
Act since 1996 .
" The CRTC cannot impose a levy on ISP revenues under the Telecommunications Act , further to the cultural policy objectives of Section 3 of the Broadcasting Act , " Engelhart said .
" As a result , it would be unlawful to impose a levy on ISPs to support Canadian content .
While an ISP levy is not something that can or should be implemented , neither is it the only way to ensure that the objectives of the Broadcasting Act are achieved in this new age of broadcasting . "
It has been a decade since the CRTC deemed the Internet a regulatory - free zone through its 1999 new media exemption order .
ISPs , such as Rogers and Shaw Communications Inc. , say there is no need to revise that hands - off approach .
In addition to being potentially illegal , an ISP levy would result in higher costs for consumers and " harm the growth and development of Internet access in Canada , " executives said .
" Countries all over the globe are trying to ensure that their broadband networks are fast , powerful and ubiquitous , " Engelhart said .
" The Internet is the nervous system of the economy and broadband access is critical for a country 's future .....
" Imposing an ISP levy would frustrate these objectives and inhibit the growth of broadband in this country by raising the cost to consumers and by diverting a sizable amount of available resources away from infrastructure investments . "
CRTC chair Von Finckenstein , however , made it clear that he would not debate the legality of such an ISP levy during the current new media hearings .
" You make a big , big argument about legal .
Let 's reserve that for a court fight , " Von Finckenstein said .
" We disagree with you .
I know if we impose a levy , you will take that to the court .
The court will decide , so we are not going to waste any time on the legal issues here . "

Canadian content advocates have told the commission that a new fund to support new media content will help promote domestically - produced content online and have the effect of reserving " shelf space " for Canadian culture on the world wide web .
They point to statistics that show some 60 per cent of Canadians have high - speed Internet connections and are increasingly using the Internet to watch video and other media .
Executives from Shaw Communications were scheduled to present at the CRTC later in the day .

Critics are protesting a US border patrol plan to poison vegetation along a 1.1 - mile stretch of the Rio Grande riverbank in Texas to eliminate dense foliage used as hiding places by illegal immigrants and smugglers .
Some opponents of the action compare it to the Vietnam war - era Agent Orange chemical spraying programme .
The $ 2.1 m ( £ 1.4 m ) pilot project is due to begin this week .
If successful , it could be expanded along as much as 130 miles of river in the patrol 's Laredo sector , as well as other parts of the US - Mexico border .
Opponents are concerned that the spraying will occur near the cities of Laredo and Nuevo Laredo , Mexico .
" We do n't believe that is even moral , " said Jay Johnson - Castro Sr , executive director of the Rio Grande International Study Centre , located at Laredo Community College , adjacent to the planned test area .
" It is unprecedented that they 'd do it in a populated area . "
US border patrol and Environmental Protection Agency officials say the herbicide planned for the test is safe for animals .
The programme is intended to keep border patrol agents safe and make their jobs easier .
" We are trying to improve our mobility and visibility up and down the river , " said border patrol agent Roque Sarinana .
Members of the Laredo city council have raised concerns and called on Mexican president Felipe Calderon to intervene .
Mexican officials are worried that the herbicide imazapyr could threaten the Nuevo Laredo water supply .
Imazapyr was registered in the US in 1984 .
The EPA concluded after tests that " there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to the general population , and to infants and children from aggregate exposure to imazapyr residues " .
A US government outline of the project indicates the border patrol is going to test three methods to rid the riverbank of carrizo cane , which has thick stalks .
Trails through the cane can be all but invisible from higher up on the bank .
One method calls for the cane to be cut by hand and the stumps painted with the herbicide .
Another involves using mechanical equipment to dig the cane out by the roots , possibly without the need for the herbicide .
The third and most controversial removal method calls for using helicopters to spray imazapyr directly on the cane , until all plant life in the area is poisoned .
The cane is a non-native plant introduced by Spanish explorers centuries ago .
Johnson - Castro said he has no issue with removing the cane , just the method .
The border patrol said that after using the herbicide it intends to replant native vegetation .
Laredo mayor Raul Salinas said he believes federal officials when they say testing shows the chemical is not dangerous , but he also realises opponents have concerns .
" It is a complicated situation because we have to think about protecting our border , " said Salinas , a retired FBI agent .
" But let 's do it in a sensible , reasonable way to make sure humans wo n't be harmed , nor the vegetation , nor the animals , nor the environment . "
A British resident who says he was tortured before being sent to Guantánamo Bay said yesterday he may give evidence on behalf of an MI5 officer to ensure that senior figures within the government are held to account for any involvement in his treatment .
Binyam Mohamed spoke to the Guardian after the attorney general called in the Metropolitan police to investigate claims that MI5 had colluded in his interrogation .
Mohamed said he was determined that the officer , known only as Officer B , should not be scapegoated .
" It 's very important that we get to the truth , for everyone in the future , " he said .
The attorney general , Lady Scotland , announced the unprecedented move in light of damning evidence that Britain 's security and intelligence agencies colluded with the CIA in Mohamed 's inhuman treatment and secret rendition .
She said the police inquiry would look into " possible criminal wrongdoing " in what the high court described as Mohamed 's unlawful questioning .
After being arrested at Karachi airport in April 2002 , while travelling on a false passport , Ethiopian - born Mohamed was held incommunicado in Pakistan , Morocco , and Afghanistan , before being flown to Guantánamo Bay in 2004 .
He was released last month after the US dropped all charges against him , including claims that he was trying to make a " dirty bomb " .
The attorney general 's move yesterday was welcomed by MPs , lawyers and human rights groups .
However , they made clear that it did not go far enough , and that a judicial inquiry was needed to investigate the full extent of Britain 's alleged collusion in torture .
Scotland said that after reviewing a " substantial body of material , much of it highly sensitive " , and after consulting the director of public prosecutions , Keir Starmer QC , she concluded that the evidence should be passed to the police .
She said she hoped the investigation would be carried out as " expeditiously as possible , given the seriousness and sensitivity of the issues involved " .
The evidence includes open and secret high court hearings where Officer B was questioned about his interrogation of Mohamed when he was being held in Pakistan in 2002 .
The court heard that MI5 provided the CIA with material to interrogate Mohamed , even though it said it had no idea at the time where he was being held and in what condition he was in .
In a case Lord Justice Thomas described as " deeply disturbing " , involving " many and very troublesome issues " , the high court concluded : " The conduct of the security service facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the United States when [ Mohamed ] was being detained by the United States incommunicado and without access to a lawyer . "
They court added : " Under the law of Pakistan , that detention was unlawful . "
Much of the evidence is still being suppressed following gagging orders demanded by David Miliband , the foreign secretary , and the US authorities .
Leading politicians and campaigners yesterday said that the issue went far beyond the particular case of Officer B , and that a broader inquiry was needed .
The Conservative leader , David Cameron , called for a " targeted and clear review ... to get to the bottom of whether Britain was knowingly or unknowingly complicit in torture " .
The Liberal Democrat leader , Nick Clegg , said : " It is not enough for Gordon Brown to say the government does not endorse torture .
There remain serious questions concerning how far senior political figures were implicated in these alleged practices . "
Tayab Ali , a London solicitor who is representing two other men who say they were tortured by Pakistani intelligence agents before being questioned by MI5 officers , said that a judicial inquiry was required because , without one , " there is every danger that this will happen again " .
Clare Algar , executive director of the legal charity Reprieve , said : " The really important thing is that this does not become a witch - hunt of the [ MI5 ] agent in question .
Any investigation needs to look at the person at the top of the chain of command . "
Andrew Tyrie , chairman of the Commons all - party parliamentary group on extraordinary rendition , referred to the high court 's description of UK involvement in Mohamed 's interrogation as going " far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing " , and called for a wider investigation .
The prime minister , Gordon Brown , speaking from Brazil , said that the government would not tolerate or endorse torture .
The US alleged that Mohamed had undergone terrorist training at al - Qaida camps in Afghanistan .
Mohamed claimed he visited the country to kick a drugs habit and to study Islam .
I ’ve been using an interpreted scripting language called Matlab to do my research work for some time now .
I often type short commands straight into a command window to test the output before adding those commands to the main script .
This really accelerates my development time .
Now that I ’m learning c++ , I have become frustrated with having to recompile each time I want to test a small change to a calculation , or check my syntax .

Television is largely paid for by advertising .
Many consumers — I suspect a majority in developed countries — have equipment that lets them record a program when it is broadcast and listen to it later , fast forwarding , if they wish , over the ads .
The smaller the number of people who watch the ads , the less advertisers will be willing to pay broadcasters to run them .
Consider , however , a broadcast of a football game .
Part of what the viewer is paying for is the excitement of seeing which team wins and how .
That does not work very well if he knows the final score before he watches the game .
So football fans are likely to have a strong preference for watching the game in real time , as it is played .
If they are watching it in real time , they do n't get to fast forward over the ads .
It follows that advertisements will get more viewers in that context , hence that advertisers will be willing to pay more for a minute of time in a football game , or anything else that television watchers prefer to watch live rather than recorded .
From which it follows that the invention of the Tivo and similar devices can be expected to lead — very likely has already led — to a shift of resources away from made for TV movies and towards broadcasts of sporting events .
There are other implications as well .
My wife suggests that the same change should lead to an increased effort to make ads entertaining and an increase in embedded advertising .
It should also lead to an increased effort to make television drama more like football games , to create soap operas where the viewer is waiting on the edge of his seat to see whether she does or does n't date / marry / divorce / sleep with him and wants to see it happen before hearing about it from another viewer .
This is one example of the indirect ways in which technological change changes the world we live in .
A second and similar example , one that I have discussed before , is the effect of easy copying of digital intellectual property on what sorts of IP get produced .
A recorded movie is fully revealed in one viewing , so there is no adequate way of technologically protecting it ; however good the encryption , the customer has physical possession of the machine it is playing on and so can arrange to record it as it is played .
The same applies to any form of IP fully revealed in one use , such as a song or a novel .
It does not apply to a database such as Lexis , since what the user gets is not a copy of the database but only the answer to a particular query .
Nor does it apply to a massively multiplayer online game .
What the user wants is not a video of my adventure in World of Warcraft but an opportunity to have his own — and he will have to pay Blizzard to get it .
Hence we would expect improvements in the technology for making and distributing copies — higher capacity storage , the increased availability of high bandwidth connections to the Internet — to result in a shift of artistic effort out of movies and into online games .

when tax cuts of budget crises loom -- politicians use what has been aptly called " the kidney - machine " gambit .
What 's this ?
People will die because the first thing we must cut are kidney - machines at YOUR local hospital !
Small children will starve because food assistance to families will have to be slashed .
In short , the " kidney - machine gambit " declares that any cut will happen first to essential services .

A significant step toward eliminating the budget crisis in most states -- especially ones like California -- would be to decriminalize marijuana and immediately release all people imprisoned for related ' crimes ' .
( Even better , of course , would be to decriminalize all drugs . )
A significant step toward driving down the cost of college tuition would be to eliminate all legal requirement for sexual harassment / diversity training , all affirmative action related policies and offices ... everything that is politically rather than educationally driven .
The saving re : drugs would include a significant reduction of the prison / police system and alleviation within the courts .

Many thanks to Steve Quake for four stimulating articles on some of the dilemmas facing scientists today .
He now hands off to Sandra Aamodt and Sam Wang , two neuroscientists famous for their award - winning book , “ Welcome to Your Brain : Why You Lose Your Car Keys But Never Forget How to Drive and Other Puzzles of Everyday Life . ”
Sandra and Sam will be writing their articles together ; please welcome them .
Olivia
By Sam Wang and Sandra Aamodt
It ’s an honor to be invited to fill in for Olivia .
We ’ll be writing about slow and fast forces that shape the brain : natural selection , operating relatively slowly over many generations ; and environmental influences , whose effects are visible across a few generations or even within one individual ’s lifetime .
We ’re often asked whether the human brain is still evolving .
Taken at face value , it sounds like a silly question .
People are animals , so selection pressure would presumably continue to apply across generations .
But the questioners are really concerned about a larger issue : how our brains are changing over time — and whether we have any control over these developments .
This week we discuss intelligence and the “ Flynn effect , ” a phenomenon that is too rapid to be explained by natural selection .
It used to be believed that people had a level of general intelligence with which they were born that was unaffected by environment and stayed the same , more or less , throughout life .
But now it ’s known that environmental influences are large enough to have considerable effects on intelligence , perhaps even during your own lifetime .
A key contribution to this subject comes from James Flynn , a moral philosopher who has turned to social science and statistical analysis to explore his ideas about humane ideals .
Flynn ’s work usually pops up in the news in the context of race issues , especially public debates about the causes of racial differences in performance on intelligence tests .
We wo n’t spend time on the topic of race , but the psychologist Dick Nisbett has written an excellent article on the subject .
Flynn first noted that standardized intelligence quotient ( I.Q. ) scores were rising by three points per decade in many countries , and even faster in some countries like the Netherlands and Israel .
For instance , in verbal and performance I.Q. , an average Dutch 14 - year - old in 1982 scored 20 points higher than the average person of the same age in his parents ’ generation in 1952 .
These I.Q. increases over a single generation suggest that the environmental conditions for developing brains have become more favorable in some way .
What might be changing ?
One strong candidate is working memory , defined as the ability to hold information in mind while manipulating it to achieve a cognitive goal .
Examples include remembering a clause while figuring out how it relates the rest of a sentence , or keeping track of the solutions you ’ve already tried while solving a puzzle .
Flynn has pointed out that modern times have increasingly rewarded complex and abstract reasoning .
Differences in working memory capacity account for 50 to 70 percent of individual differences in fluid intelligence ( abstract reasoning ability ) in various meta- analyses , suggesting that it is one of the major building blocks of I.Q. ( Ackerman et al ; Kane et al ; Süss et al . )
This idea is intriguing because working memory can be improved by training .
Felix Sockwell
A common way to measure working memory is called the “ n - back ” task .
Presented with a sequential series of items , the person taking the test has to report when the current item is identical to the item that was presented a certain number ( n ) of items ago in the series .
For example , the test taker might see a sequence of letters like
L K L R K H H N T T N X
presented one at a time .
If the test is an easy 1 - back task , she should press a button when she sees the second H and the second T . For a 3 - back task , the right answers are K and N , since they are identical to items three places before them in the list .
Most people find the 3 - back condition to be challenging .
A recent paper reported that training on a particularly fiendish version of the n-back task improves I.Q. scores .
Instead of seeing a single series of items like the one above , test - takers saw two different sequences , one of single letters and one of spatial locations .
They had to report n- back repetitions of both letters and locations , a task that required them to simultaneously keep track of both sequences .
As the trainees got better , n was increased to make the task harder .
If their performance dropped , the task was made easier until they recovered .
Each day , test - takers trained for 25 minutes .
On the first day , the average participant could handle the 3 - back condition .
By the 19th day , average performance reached the 5 - back level , and participants showed a four - point gain in their I.Q. scores .
The I.Q. improvement was larger in people who’d had more days of practice , suggesting that the effect was a direct result of training .
People benefited across the board , regardless of their starting levels of working memory or I.Q. scores ( though the results hint that those with lower I.Q.s may have shown larger gains ) .
Simply practicing an I.Q. test can lead to some improvement on the test , but control subjects who took the same two I.Q. tests without training improved only slightly .
Also , increasing I.Q. scores by practice does n’t necessarily increase other measures of reasoning ability ( Ackerman , 1987 ) .
Since the gains accumulated over a period of weeks , training is likely to have drawn upon brain mechanisms for learning that can potentially outlast the training .
But this is not certain .
If continual practice is necessary to maintain I.Q. gains , then this finding looks like a laboratory curiosity .
But if the gains last for months ( or longer ) , working memory training may become as popular as — and more effective than — games like sudoku among people who worry about maintaining their cognitive abilities .
Now , some caveats .
The results , though tantalizing , are not perfect .
It would have been better to give the control group some other training not related to working memory , to show that the hard work of training did not simply motivate the experimental group to try harder on the second I.Q. test .
The researchers did not test whether working memory training improved problem - solving tasks of the type that might occur in real life .
Finally , they did not explore how much improvement would be seen with further training .
Research on working memory training , as well as Flynn ’s original observations , raise the possibility that the fast - paced modern world , despite its annoyances ( or even because of them ) may be improving our reasoning ability .
Maybe even multitasking — not the most efficient way to work — is good for your brain because of the mental challenge .
Something to think about when you ’re contemplating retirement on a deserted island .
*****
Clarification :
We wrote that in the complex version of the n-back task , test - takers “ saw ” two sequences of stimuli .
In fact , the letter sequence was heard .
Thanks to commenter Adam Thomas for pointing this out .

There was a day when airlines would truly reward you by collecting frequent flyer miles by taking several flights per year or earning them by spending money on your credit card .
You could collect points , and every few years take a trip on behalf of the airline at no cost to you , and enjoy a much more affordable vacation .
Unfortunately , those days have come to an end .
Frequent flyer miles are now as a valuable as Confederate money was immediately after the civil war .
In an effort to cut costs and increase revenues , the companies that operate frequent flyer rewards programs have made it much more difficult to redeem and use flights .
If fewer trips are taken with frequent flyer miles , which means their expenses are lower and they make more money at the end of the day .
Because of this profit incentive , airlines have systematically made it much more difficult to actually use the frequent flyer miles that you have .
Airlines have dramatically reduced the number of frequent flyer seats available on flights , so that you have to book months ahead of time to find available seats for you to use .
This allows them to have more seats for paying customers , and makes it almost impossible for you to redeem your miles .
Airlines have also made it so that you will need to pay ‘ double miles ’ to many of the frequented vacation spots in the United States .
There has also been a dramatic increase in the number of junk fees that you can expect to pay when making use of your frequent flyer miles .
You ’ll be hit with things such as fuel surcharges , convenience fees and other fees that do n’t do much more than paid the profits of the airlines that operate the programs .
You can expect to be hit with anywhere from $ 50.00 to $ 75.00 in fees per ticket whenever using your frequent flyer miles to book a flight .
About a decade ago , frequent flyer miles had about the equivalent value of about a penny each , but now that value is much more like .40 cents .
Frequent flyer miles are essentially “ fools gold . ”
When considering a rewards program for your credit card , you should probably choose another option than frequent flyer miles .
Cash back is usually a good option since it ’s guaranteed money in the bank , but there are some instances when it makes sense to get some of the other types of rewards .
SEC Charges R. Allen Stanford , Stanford International Bank for Multi-Billion Dollar Investment Scheme FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2009 - 26 Washington , D.C. , Feb. 17 , 2009 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Robert Allen Stanford and three of his companies for orchestrating a fraudulent , multi-billion dollar investment scheme centering on an $ 8 billion CD program .
Additional Materials Information for Stanford Customers
Litigation Release No. 20901
SEC Complaint
SEC First Amended Complaint
Memorandum of Law Stanford 's companies include Antiguan - based Stanford International Bank ( SIB ) , Houston - based broker - dealer and investment adviser Stanford Group Company ( SGC ) , and investment adviser Stanford Capital Management .
The SEC also charged SIB chief financial officer James Davis as well as Laura Pendergest - Holt , chief investment officer of Stanford Financial Group ( SFG ) , in the enforcement action .
Pursuant to the SEC 's request for emergency relief for the benefit of defrauded investors , U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor entered a temporary restraining order , froze the defendants ' assets , and appointed a receiver to marshal those assets .
" As we allege in our complaint , Stanford and the close circle of family and friends with whom he runs his businesses perpetrated a massive fraud based on false promises and fabricated historical return data to prey on investors , " said Linda Chatman Thomsen , Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement .
" We are moving quickly and decisively in this enforcement action to stop this fraudulent conduct and preserve assets for investors . "
Rose Romero , Regional Director of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office , added , " We are alleging a fraud of shocking magnitude that has spread its tentacles throughout the world . "
The SEC 's complaint , filed in federal court in Dallas , alleges that acting through a network of SGC financial advisers , SIB has sold approximately $ 8 billion of so - called " certificates of deposit " to investors by promising improbable and unsubstantiated high interest rates .
These rates were supposedly earned through SIB 's unique investment strategy , which purportedly allowed the bank to achieve double - digit returns on its investments for the past 15 years .
According to the SEC 's complaint , the defendants have misrepresented to CD purchasers that their deposits are safe , falsely claiming that the bank re-invests client funds primarily in " liquid " financial instruments ( the portfolio ) ; monitors the portfolio through a team of 20 - plus analysts ; and is subject to yearly audits by Antiguan regulators .
Recently , as the market absorbed the news of Bernard Madoff 's massive Ponzi scheme , SIB attempted to calm its own investors by falsely claiming the bank has no " direct or indirect " exposure to the Madoff scheme .
According to the SEC 's complaint , SIB is operated by a close circle of Stanford 's family and friends .
SIB 's investment committee , responsible for the management of the bank 's multi-billion dollar portfolio of assets , is comprised of Stanford ; Stanford 's father who resides in Mexia , Texas ; another Mexia resident with business experience in cattle ranching and car sales ; Pendergest - Holt , who prior to joining SFG had no financial services or securities industry experience ; and Davis , who was Stanford 's college roommate .
The SEC 's complaint also alleges an additional scheme relating to $ 1.2 billion in sales by SGC advisers of a proprietary mutual fund wrap program , called Stanford Allocation Strategy ( SAS ) , by using materially false historical performance data .
According to the complaint , the false data helped SGC grow the SAS program from less than $ 10 million in 2004 to more than $ 1 billion , generating fees for SGC ( and ultimately Stanford ) of approximately $ 25 million in 2007 and 2008 .
The fraudulent SAS performance was used to recruit registered investment advisers with significant books of business , who were then heavily incentivized to reallocate their clients ' assets to SIB 's CD program .
The SEC 's complaint charges violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 , the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act , and registration provisions of the Investment Company Act .
In addition to emergency and interim relief that has been obtained , the SEC seeks a final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay financial penalties and disgorgement of ill - gotten gains with prejudgment interest .
The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) in connection with this matter .
FINRA independently developed information through its examination and investigative processes that contributed significantly to the filing of this enforcement action .
The SEC 's investigation is continuing .

By the time you read this , my head will be thump - thumping – but this is not a standard - issue New Year 's Day hangover .
No .
My New Year 's resolution is to finally give up my addiction to two liquids that are trashing the lives of some of the poorest people on earth : bottled water , and Coke .
In 2009 , I 'm determined to lose my bottle .
There 's nothing more tempting than to imagine our luxuries appear fully - formed on the supermarket shelf .
It seems they come from nowhere , and when we toss them away , they disappear back to nowhere .
It 's disconcerting to break through this haze and trace them back to their origins .
How can something so ordinary and omnipresent – something we all glug down daily – be destructive ?
But I have finally forced myself to read two new book - length exposés of my favourite drinks .
Since I was a teenager , I have thought drinking water comes in bottles .
I do n't know when I stopped using the tap .
I never paused to think that it costs 10,000 times more to drink from bottles , or to read the shelves full of studies showing that tap water is just as healthy and impossible to tell apart in blind tastings .
But I am not alone .
Globally , we spend $ 60 bn ( £ 41 bn ) a year on bottled water .
Its sales now surpass beer and milk .

In her book Bottlemania , the investigative journalist Elizabeth Royte traces one of the great scams of our time : why are we paying a fortune for something we have running almost - free into our homes ?
In 1929 , Charles Kettering , the director of General Motors Research , outlined one of the rules of modern consumerism : " Keep the consumer dissatisfied . "
If the customer is happy with what they 've already got , where 's the profit ?
So the bottled water industry began to promote a series of myths .
They claimed tap water was filthy , when in the US and Europe it is the safest drinking water on earth .
They claimed you need to drink eight glasses of water a day , based on a garbled misreading of a creaky 1940s study .
They falsely promised better health and taste .
If the only people being suckered were those of us dumb enough to buy the bottled water , this would be a minor - league scandal – but look at one of the primary sources of mineral water for the developed world : Fiji .
Every day , a million litres of freshwater are pumped from an aquifer beneath a rainforest on Vitu Levu and shipped 10,000 miles to Europe and to the US .
" This water may come from one of the last pristine ecosystems on earth , " the adverts coo – without mentioning that it also helps to destroy it .
By the time you factor in making the bottles and shipping this heavy liquid half - way round the world , every bottle of mineral water is – in effect – filled a quarter of the way up with petrol .
The fizz might as well be greenhouse gases dissolving into the atmosphere .
And what of the people on the island of Fiji ?
While we merrily sip their water , a third of Fijians have no clean water at all .
There are regular outbreaks of typhoid and dengue fever on the island , culling children and the elderly first .
The bottled water companies claim it is justifiable to take these people 's water .
They say they are carbon - neutral because they buy " carbon offsets " .
But as I 've argued before , the evidence shows carbon offsets are a con – a way of salving our consciences , not the environment .
Then they say they put money back into Fiji .
But last July , the government there decided to introduce a tax on the bottled water being shipped off the island to pay for clean water for ordinary Fijians .
The bottling companies went ballistic and threatened to shut down factories .
The government gave up .
The typhoid continues .
And what of my caffeine fix ?
I would have it running intravenously into my veins 24/ 7 if I could – but the comedian - activist Mark Thomas has persuaded me , in his excellent new book Belching Out The Devil : Global Adventures With Coca - Cola , that I have to find a different dealer to Coke .
In Carepa in north - western Colombia , Coca - Cola has a fairly typical bottling plant .
Until 1994 , the workforce was unionised , and successfully bargained for the basic workplace benefits we all want : bonuses , overtime and healthcare .
But the corporation wanted to cut costs – and around the same time , the armed gangs arrived .
The far - right militia the AUC presents itself as " the defenders of business freedom " in Colombia – they massacre trade unionists .
Soon after they showed up , Enrique Gomez Granado – one of the Coke - plant union leaders – was shot in the face on his doorstep , in front of his wife and kids .
Five more union leaders were hunted down and murdered .
There was , as Thomas puts it , " a campaign against the union at the Coca - Cola plant " .
The workers at the factory claim their plant manager would sit outside the factory with AUC paramilitaries , laughing and joking with them .
Once the union was destroyed , the managers of the bottling plant promptly slashed the workers ' wages : experienced workers went from earning $ 380 a month to $ 130 .
At first , Coke said they were n't responsible for the behaviour of their subcontractors – even though they own a controlling share in this bottling company .
Then they said " we take accusations regarding labour rights violations seriously " .
But in Carepa , Thomas found that " to this day , the Coca - Cola Company has not investigated the alleged links of Colombian bottling plant managers with the paramilitaries , despite a man being shot dead under their logo " .
Still the death - threats continue , pledging anyone " bad- mouthing the Coca - Cola Corporation ... will be dealt with as they prefer : death , torture , cut into pieces , coup de grace .
No more protests ! "
This is not a lone horror - story .
Thomas found children working for Coke contractors in El Salvador , and workers in Turkey beaten for trying to join a union .
But the most striking story is from Plachimada , a village in Kerala , India .
In the 1990s Coke opened a plant and began pumping half a million litres a day out of the underground aquifer .
Suddenly the water in Plachimada 's wells turned bad .
A lab report for the BBC found it was now " so acidic it would burn up your insides .
Clothes could tear in such water , food will rot , crops will wither " .
The village 's children had to stop going to school and spend all day fetching water from far away .
As compensation , Coke 's Indian subsidiary gave the local villagers their left - over industrial sludge to use as fertiliser .
Incredibly , another test by the BBC found the " fertilizer " was filled with poisons .
The doctors who examined it warned it could cause kidney failure or severe mental disability .
Responding to this study , Sunil Gupta , Coca - Cola India 's vice - president , said : " It 's good for them because they are poor . "
Yes , it will be annoying for me not to have my favourite drinks .
But it 's considerably more annoying to watch your children die of typhoid while your fresh water is being shipped off for the rich to quaff , or to be shot in the face for running a trade union .
In 2009 , I do n't want to drink oil , or blood .

Up to 70 protesters are blocking workers from entering the premises of the US weapons manufacturer Raytheon in Derry this morning as part of a protest against the Israeli attack on Gaza .
The Derry Anti-War Coalition says the company is being targeted because of its involvement in producing weapons being used by the Israeli military in Gaza .
Raytheon is the world 's third largest arms manufacturer and makes Patriot , Sidewinder and Tomahawk missiles .
However , it says its Derry operation only makes civilian aviation systems .
Two years ago , protesters in Derry stormed its offices and threw computers and files out of the windows , but were later cleared of theft and damage charges after arguing that they were trying to save lives .
Vital car - parts maker Robert Bosch is to lay off 170 manufacturing workers in the latest blow to the car industry .
Workers were informed this morning of the news , after which about 200 assembled near the main gates of Robert Bosch in Centre Road , Clayton .
Australian Manufacturing Workers Union national secretary Dave Oliver said the company had been unreasonable and had recently asked workers to effectively take a 50 % pay cut - a claim rejected by the company .
" A lot of people can't sustain that [ the pay cut ] , " he said .
While conceding the industry was under considerable pressure , he said Robert Bosch had been unwilling to share the pain .
The Muslim oversensitivity to any perceived insult is in directly inverse proportion to how much hate Muslims themselves are willing to display for others .
If you go by Muslim standards , removing a man wearing a t - shirt with Arabic words off a plane is an unacceptable display of Islamophobia , but banning an Israeli tennis player from Dubai is completely legitimate .
Drawing cartoons of Mohammed as a terrorist is not acceptable , but calling for the deaths of the cartoonists is .
Writing a book parodying Islam is unacceptable , but murdering the book 's translators around the world is reasonable .
Israeli checkpoints on the Gaza border are unacceptable examples of apartheid , but Saudi Arabia barring all non-Muslims from entering the city of Mecca or from holding Saudi citizenship -- is their right .
A protest against Hamas and Al Queda that desecrates their flags , which have verses from the Koran on them , is unacceptable offensive to Muslims -- but Muslim student associations waving those same flags is something that no one may question .
A Muslim " refugee " who is arrested for illegally entering a European country is being imprisoned solely out of " Islamophobia " , as are the terrorists held in Guantanamo Bay -- but Westerners who enter a Muslim country lose all rights and may be imprisoned , tortured and flogged on the flimsiest of allegations from a Muslim .
Western countries expecting that a Muslim woman remove her Hijab for an ID photo is Islamophobia .
However Muslim countries have the right to demand that even the House Speaker and First Lady cover up their hair when visiting a Muslim country .
When a Muslim man has woman 's underwear put on his head , while detaining for trying to kill American soldiers , that is the vilest crime against humanity .
However when Muslim men hang and flog women for adultery ... that is their culture and we have no right to judge .
Not unless we 're Islamophobes , that is .
Muslim paranoid fears of Western culture can legitimately express themselves in banning magazines , Valentine 's day celebrations and movies .
However any Western resistance to the Koran or Arabic is a clear sign of Islamophobia .
A Koran in a toilet is a hate crime .
However burning the contents of the Library of Alexandria because " if it's not in the Koran , it 's superfluous " , is a legitimate expression of Muslim views on non-Muslim literature .
Prejudice against Muslims is unacceptable .
But Muslim prejudices against women , Jews , Christians , gays , Buddhists , Zoroastrians , Atheists , and just about everyone else -- are part of their culture .
And who are we to judge if they feel they have a right to hate and kill anyone who is n't a Muslim male .
The problem with all of these examples is that Muslims want to have it both ways .
On the one hand they want a blank check that allows them to treat any negative feedback as Islamophobia .
On the other hand they want to be able to express any degree and form of hatred for others and support for terrorism in public forums without any repercussions .
What Muslims really want is Political Correctness for us , and none for them .
They want a chain around our necks with the leash in their hand , while the other hand waves a Hizbollah flag .
And that can't work .
If Danish cartoonist can't draw Mohammed , then Muslim protesters should at the very least be unable to call for the murder of their political opponents .
If Christian pastors are to be censored for denouncing Islam , then the Finsbury Park Mosque rabble should be too .
Neither hate nor tolerance can be a one way street , yet Muslims have exploited charges of Islamophobia to do just that .
Saudi backed organizations such as CAIR or the MSU routinely spread hate , and then are outraged when anyone calls them to account for it .
Canada 's largest group , the Canadian Arab Federation , had no problem being part of rallies featuring Hamas and Hezbollah flags .
They did have a problem when Canada 's Immigration Minister Jason Kenney criticized them for it , so naturally the President of the CAF called him a " professional whore " .
Kenney in turn responded by saying , “ We should not be rewarding those who express views that are contrary to Canada ’s best liberal values of tolerance and mutual respect ” and announced plans to pull the CAF 's funding .
Naturally the CAF 's response was to cry Islamophobia .
The Canadian Arab Federation decided to host pro-Hamas articles on its site , to push for airing Al Jazeera in Canada , to participate in openly terrorist rallies and then respond to criticism by insulting the Immigration Minister .
But naturally the consequences of all that only came due because of Islamophobia .
Muslims have gotten too comfortable sweeping a lot under the rug by crying Islamophobia .
But that implies that they actually wish to be part of a tolerant multicultural society , where everyone 's rights are respected .
By their actions and agendas however , that is not the society they wish to be a part of .
Neither in Riyadh , Tehran , Gaza , Karachi or London , Paris and Detroit .
It is up to Muslims themselves to decide what role they wish to play abroad and in the global culture .
They can be intolerant fanatics who stay at home and expect everyone else to stay at home too .
Or they can be open and tolerant enough to live side by side with others .
But they can't be intolerant fanatics who expect us to be tolerant and open toward their fanatical intolerance .
Not on our dime .
That is the problem , and it is a Gordian Knot that Muslims can either try to untie themselves , or someone will wind up cutting through it for them .

Seperti biasa pada kesempatan kalia ini kami ingin …
When working the latest incarnation of my System IG compiler , I used a thingy which I now realize ought to be characterized as a design pattern .
It substantially changed the way I was thinking about the code , which is what makes it interesting .
Summary : separate an algorithm into certificate constructors and a search algorithm .
A large class of algorithms can be considered , in some way , as search algorithms .
It is given a problem and searches for a solution to that problem .
For example , typically you would n’t phrase the quadratic formula as a search algorithm , but it is — it ’s just a very smart , fast one .
It is given a , b , and c and searches for a solution to the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 .
The certificate design pattern separates the algorithm into two modules : the certificate module and the algorithm .
The certificate module provides constructors for solutions to the problem .
For each correct solution , it is possible to construct a certificate , and it is impossible to construct a certificate for an incorrect solution .
The certificate module for the quadratic formula algorithm might look like this :
module Certificate ( Certificate , certify , solution ) where data Certificate = Certificate Double Double Double Double certify :: Double -> Double -> Double -> Double ->
Maybe Certificate certify a b c x | a *x ^2 + b*x + c == 0 = Just ( Certificate a b c x ) | otherwise =
Nothing solution :: Certificate -> ( Double , Double , Double , Double ) solution ( Certificate a b c x ) = ( a , b , c , x )
There is only one way to construct a Certificate , and that is to pass it a solution to the quadratic equation .
If it is not actually a solution , a certificate cannot be constructed for it .
This module is very easy to verify .
The algorithm module is obvious :
module Algorithm ( solve ) where import Certificate import Data .
Maybe ( fromJust ) solve :: Double -> Double -> Double ->
Certificate solve a b c = fromJust $ certify a b c ( ( - b + sqrt ( b^2 - 4*a* c ) ) / ( 2*a ) )
Here , we use the quadratic formula and construct a certificate of its correctness .
If we made a typo in the formula , then certify would return Nothing and we would get an error when we fromJust it ( an error is justified in this case , rather than an exception , because we made a mistake when programming — it ’s like an assert ) .
The client to the algorithm gets a certificate back from solve , and can extract its solution .
All the information needed to verify that the certificate is a correct certificate for the given problem should be provided .
For example , if Certificate had only contained x instead of a , b , c , x , then we could have implemented solve like :
solve a b c = certify 0 0 0 0
Because that is a valid solution , but we have not solved the problem .
The client needs to be able to inspect that a , b , c match the input values .
Maximally untrusting client code might look like this :
unsafeSolve a b c = let ( a ' , b ' , c ' , x ) = solution ( solve a b c ) in assert ( a == a ' && b == b' && c == c ' ) x where assert True x = x assert False _ = error " Assertion failed "
Here we can give any function whatsoever for solve , and we will never report an incorrect answer ( replacing the incorrectness with a runtime error ) .
This is certainly overkill for this example , but in the System IG compiler it makes a lot of sense .
I have a small set of rules which form well - typed programs , and have put in much effort to prove this set of rules is consistent and complete .
But I want to experiment with different interfaces , different inference algorithms , different optimizations , etc .
So my Certificate implements combinators for each of the rules in my system , and all the different algorithms plug into that set of rules .
So whenever I write a typechecker algorithm , if it finds a solution , the solution is correct by construction .
This gives me a lot of freedom to play with different techniques .
Verification rules can be more involved than this single function that constructs a certificate .
In the System IG compiler , there are 12 construction rules , most of them taking other certificates as arguments ( which would make them certificate “ combinators ” ) .
I ’ll show an example of more complex certificate constructors later .
What is interesting about this pattern , aside from the added correctness and verification guarantees , is that is changed the way I thought while I was implementing the algorithm .
Instead of being master of the computer , and telling it what to do , it was more like a puzzle I had to solve .
In some ways it was harder , but I attribute that to redistributing the workload ; it ’s harder because I am forced to write code that is correct from the get - go , instead of accidentally introducing bugs and thinking I ’m done .
The other interesting mental change was that it often guided my solution .
I would look at the certificate I ’m trying to create , and see which constructors could create it .
This gave me an idea of the information I was after .
This information is the information necessary to convince the client that my solution is correct ; I cannot proceed without it .
Theoretically , the algorithm part could be completely generic .
It might just do a generic search algorithm like Dijkstra .
If it finds a certificate , then it has solved your problem correctly .
Solutions for free !
( But this will not be practical in most cases — it might not yield a correct algorithm by other criteria , such as “ always halts ” ) .
Here ’s an example of a more complex certificate .
The domain is SK combinator calculus , and a Conversion is a certificate that holds two terms .
If a Conversion can be constructed , then the two terms are convertible .
module Conversion ( Term ( .. ) , Conversion , convId , convCompose , convFlip , convS , convK , convApp ) where infixl 9 :* data Term = S | K | Term :*
Term deriving ( Eq ) data Conversion = Term :<-> Term convTerms ( a :<-> b ) = ( a , b ) convId t = t :<-> t convCompose ( a :<-> b ) ( b ' :<-> c ) | b == b' = Just $ a :<-> c | otherwise = Nothing convFlip ( a :<-> b ) = b :<-> a convS ( S :* x :* y :* z ) = Just $ ( S :* x :* y :* z ) :<-> ( x :* z :* ( y :* z ) ) convS _ = Nothing convK ( K :* x :* y ) = Just $ ( K :* x :* y ) :<-> x convK _ = Nothing convApp ( a :<-> b ) ( c :<-> d ) = ( a :* c ) :<-> ( b :* d)
The export list is key .
If we had exported the ( :<->) constructor , then it would be possible to create invalid conversions .
The correctness of a certificate module is all about what it does n’t export .
I ’m wondering what the best way to present this as an object - oriented pattern is , so I can insert it into popular CS folklore ( assuming it ’s not already there ;-) .
Inductive Inference and Machine Learning by Minimum Message Length ( MML ) encoding .
Also see models & parameters , William of Ockham , Thomas Bayes , R. A. Fisher , and C. S. Wallace .
There is a non-Technical Introduction [ here ] .
For a hypothesis H and data D we have from Bayes :
P( H&D ) = P ( H ) .
P( D|H ) = P ( D ) .
P( H|D )
P( H ) , prior probability of hypothesis H
P( H|D ) , posterior probability of hypothesis H
P( D|H ) , likelihood of the hypothesis , actually a function of the data given H .
From Shannon 's Mathematical Theory of Communication ( 1949 ) we know that in an optimal code , the message length of an event E , MsgLen( E ) , where E has probability P( E ) , is given by MsgLen( E ) = - log 2 ( P( E ) ) :
= MsgLen(H ) + MsgLen( D|H )
= MsgLen(D ) + MsgLen( H|D )
Now in inductive inference one often wants the hypothesis H with the largest posterior probability .
MsgLen( H ) can usually be estimated well , for some reasonable prior on hypotheses .
MsgLen( D|H ) can also usually be calculated .
Unfortunately it is often impractical to estimate P ( D ) which is a pity because it would yield P( H|D ) .
However , for two rival hypotheses , H and H '
= MsgLen(H ) + MsgLen( D|H )
- MsgLen( H') - MsgLen( D|H ' )
= posterior - log odds ratio
Consider a transmitter T and a receiver R connected by one of Shannon 's communication channels .
T must transmit some data D to R. T and R may have previously agreed on a code book for hypotheses , using common knowledge and prior expectations .
If T can find a good hypothesis , H , ( theory , structure , pattern , ... ) to fit the data then she may be able to transmit the data economically .
An explanation is a two part message :
( i ) transmit H taking MsgLen( H ) bits , and ( ii ) transmit D given H taking MsgLen ( D|H ) bits .
The message paradigm keeps us " honest " :
Any information that is not common knowledge must be included in the message for it to be decipherable by the receiver ; there can be no hidden parameters .
This issue extends to inferring ( and stating ) real - valued parameters to the " appropriate " level of precision .
The method is " safe " :
If we use an inefficient code it can only make the hypothesis look less attractive than otherwise .
There is a natural hypothesis test :
The null - theory corresponds to transmitting the data " as is " .
( That does not necessarily mean in 8 - bit ascii ; the language must be efficient . )
If a hypothesis cannot better the null - theory then it is not acceptable .
A more complex hypothesis fits the data better than a simpler model , in general .
We see that MML encoding gives a trade - off between hypothesis complexity , MsgLen( H ) , and the goodness of fit to the data , MsgLen ( D|H ) .
The MML principle is one way to justify and realise Occam 's razor .
Continuous Real - Valued Parameters
When a model has one or more continuous , real - valued parameters they must be stated to an " appropriate " level of precision .
The parameter must be stated in the explanation , and only a finite number of bits can be used for the purpose , as part of MsgLen ( H ) .
The stated value will often be close to the maximum - likelihood value which minimises MsgLen ( D|H ) .
If the - log likelihood , MsgLen ( D|H ) , varies rapidly for small changes in the parameter , the parameter should be stated to high precision .
If the - log likelihood varies only slowly with changes in the parameter , the parameter should be stated to low precision .
The simplest case is the multi-state or multinomial distribution where the data is a sequence of independent values from such a distribution .
The hypothesis , H , is an estimate of the probabilities of the various states ( eg. the bias of a coin or a dice ) .
The estimate must be stated to an " appropriate " precision , ie . in an appropriate number of bits .

Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip have reportedly fired five rockets over the border into Israeli territory but there is no indication of casualties .
One rocket damaged a school in the southern city of Ashkelon but the building was closed at the time , the Israeli military say .
A second hit open ground outside the city and three fell just beyond Gaza without causing damage , they add .
There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the attacks .
Both Israel and the main Palestinian militant group in Gaza , Hamas , declared unilateral truces after Israel ended its three - week Gaza offensive on 17 January .
Several rocket strikes and other attacks from Gaza have been reported since then , apparently involving smaller militant groups .
Israel has also carried out air strikes .
Fidel Castro has said he doubts he will make it to the end of Barack Obama 's four - year term as US president and has instructed Cuban officials to start making decisions without taking him into account .
In an online column titled Reflections of Comrade Fidel , the 82 - year - old former Cuban president suggested his days were numbered , saying Cuban officials " should n't feel bound by my occasional Reflections , my state of health or my death " .
" I have had the rare privilege of observing events over such a long time .
I receive information and meditate calmly on those events , " he wrote .
" I expect I wo n't enjoy that privilege in four years , when Obama 's first presidential term has ended . "
He did n't elaborate , but the lines had the ring of a farewell .
" I have reduced the Reflections as I had planned this year , so I wo n't interfere or get in the way of the [ Communist ]
Party or government comrades in the constant decisions they must make , " he wrote .
Castro stepped down in July 2006 to undergo emergency surgery and has n't been seen in public since .
He turned over the presidency to his younger brother , Raùl , in February last year after nearly half a century as Cuba 's leader , but his periodic essays have continued to carry weight .
They are diligently read in full at the top of midday and nightly radio and television newscasts before any other national or international story .
At times , they have even appeared to contradict the words of his brother , prompting speculation over who is really in charge .
Yesterday 's essay came out on a government website shortly before the nightly news , but newscasters chose not to mention it , instead reading a column Castro had released on Wednesday .
The bulk of yesterday 's column was devoted to praising Obama , the 11th US president since the Cuban revolution , in part for his decision to close the US prison at Guantànamo Bay in Cuba .
Castro recalled his thoughts as he watched Obama assume the " leadership of the empire " .
" The intelligent and noble face of the first black president of the United States ... had transformed itself under the inspiration of Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King into a living symbol of the American dream , " he wrote .
Castro praised Obama as honest , writing : " No one could doubt the sincerity of his words when he affirms that he will convert his country into a model of freedom , respect for human rights in the world and the independence of other nations . "
However , Castro suggested Obama would succumb to threats greater than his own qualities : " What will he do soon , when the immense power that he has taken in his hands is absolutely useless to overcome the unsolvable , antagonistic contradictions of the [ US ] system ? "
Obama has said he will not end the US embargo on Cuba without democratic reforms on the island , but will ease limits on Cuban - Americans ' visits there and on the money they send home to relatives .
He has also offered to negotiate personally with Raùl Castro .
Before Castro's latest two columns he had n't been heard from in more than a month , fuelling rumours that he had suffered a stroke or lapsed into a coma .
Those rumours were dispelled on Wednesday when he met the Argentininian president , Cristina Fernandez , the first foreign leader known to have done so since 28 November .
Fernandez said Castro wore the tracksuit that has become his trademark since he fell ill .
Raùl Castro , 77 , said on Wednesday that his older brother spent his days " thinking a lot , reading a lot , advising me , helping me " .
In an interview published yesterday by the Russian news agency Itar - Tass , Raùl Castro said Cuba would insist that the Obama administration close the entire US naval base at Guantànamo Bay – not just the prison camp for suspected terrorists .
" We demand that not only this prison but also this base should be closed and the territory it occupies should be returned to its legal owner – the Cuban people , " Castro was quoted as saying , repeating a long - standing demand .
EIGHTEEN years ago , Ronnie Guie considered buying a treadmill or a stair - climbing machine to stay in shape .
Then one day on his lunch hour at Con Edison in Astoria , Queens , two co-workers invited Mr. Guie to take a walk to the top of the 10 - floor building .
He was breathing heavily by the time he got there , but was hooked : he had found his workout for free .
“ For me , it ’s a quick fix , ” he said .
At 59 , Mr. Guie says he still has the same waist size ( 30 inches ) and weight range ( 150 to 155 pounds ) that he did when he was 17 , thanks to his five - day - a - week regimen .
He climbs the concrete stairs usually 10 times or so in an hour , depending how much time he has .
“ I get the results out of it — and it ’s not easy , ” he said .
“ But I always feel great . ”
Stairs are everywhere , of course , but they are rarely embraced as an option for getting into shape .
They wait in the stale air wells of high - rises ( especially in dense urban centers like New York City ) , or on stationary machines in the corners of health clubs now inundated by the more popular , but less strenuous , elliptical machines .
Many stairwells are n’t even accessible , often because of post - 9/11 security concerns .
But when they are , or are opened especially for runners going up , they provide a workout that returns maximum value in minimum time , with low impact .
And going up is much better for your knees than going down .
“ Stair climbing will give you a little more bang for your buck because of the vertical component , ” said Cedric Bryant , chief science officer for the American Council on Exercise .
Compared to jogging or cycling at a moderate pace without much of an incline , stair climbing , Dr. Bryant said , “ will be a bit more challenging and therefore allow you to burn more calories for that same amount of time . ”
Newswise — Abolishing patent and copyright law sounds radical , but two economists at Washington University in St. Louis say it 's an idea whose time has come .
Michele Boldrin and David K. Levine see innovation as a key to reviving the economy .
They believe the current patent / copyright system discourages and prevents inventions from entering the marketplace .
The two professors have published their views in a new book , Against Intellectual Monopoly , from Cambridge University Press .
" From a public policy view , we 'd ideally like to eliminate patent and copyright laws altogether , " says Levine , John H. Biggs Distinguished Professor of Economics .
" There 's plenty of protection for inventors and plenty of protection and opportunities to make money for creators .
It 's not that we see this as some sort of charitable act that people are going to invent and create things without earning money .
Evidence shows very strongly there are lots of ways to make money without patents and copyright . "
Levine and Boldrin point to students being sued for ' pirating ' music on the internet and AIDS patients in Africa dying because they cannot afford expensive drugs produced by patent holders as examples of the failure of the current system .
Boldrin , the Joseph Gibson Hoyt Distinguished Professor in Arts & Sciences and Chair of the economics department says , " Intellectual property is in fact an intellectual monopoly that hinders rather than helps the competitive free market regime that has delivered wealth and innovation to our doorsteps . "
The authors argue that license fees , regulations and patents are now so misused that they drive up the cost of creation and slow down the rate of diffusion of new ideas .
Levine explains , " Most patents are not acquired by innovators hoping to protect their innovations from competitors in order to get a short term edge over the rest of the market .
Most patents are obtained by large corporations who have built portfolios of patents for defense purposes , to prevent other people from suing them over patent violations . "
Boldrin and Levine promote a drastic reform of the patent system in their book .
They propose the law should be restored to match the intent of the U.S. Constitution which states : Congress may " promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writing and discoveries . "
They call on Congress to reverse the burden of the proof on patent seekers by granting patents only to those capable of proving that :
" ¢ their invention has social value
" ¢ a patent is not likely to block even more valuable innovations
" ¢ the innovation would not be cost - effective absent a patent
The authors acknowledge that such drastic reform is unlikely and outline an incremental approach for Congress to gradually reduce the scope of patents , regulation and licensing .
Nevertheless , their call for changing the system is urgent .
The economists compare intellectual monopoly ( patents ) to medieval trade monopolies which were proven to be economically detrimental .
They write , " For centuries , the cause of economic progress has identified with that of free trade .
In the decades to come , sustaining economic progress will depend , more and more , on our ability to progressively reduce and eventually eliminate intellectual monopoly . "
Professors Boldrin and Levine maintain a blog on this topic : www.Againstmonopoly.org.
Mobile games will always be popular it seems , as there are new versions of even the oldest mobile games being released all of the time .
In this article , we ’re going to talk about why mobile games have become the # 1 option for most people gaming on the go , as well as what people look for in some of the more popular titles like Fortnite hack & fortnite hacks and warzone hack & warzone hacks .
Mobile gaming is a big deal because it allows you to have some fun on the road , while consoles require a TV and an entire set up to be played .
Smartphones getting better over the years is yet another reason why mobile games are an obvious choice , but we ’ll get to that later on in the article .
One thing is for sure , mobile games are going to only get better as we move forward with pubg hack & pubg hacks .
Gamers are excited to see what the future holds , but for now , we can still enjoy the games that have already been developed .
Sometimes you can even find a version of your favourite board game rendered into a mobile title , which is encouraging for those “ old school gamers ” that do n’t believe in the video variety .
Sarkscape is yet another mobile game that people enjoyed during its run , and it could even be considered one of the pioneering games within the mobile industry with tools like csgo hack and csgo hacks .
When the iPhone came out and people were sick of their Blackberry phones with Brickbreaker , it only made sense for video game developers to dip their toes into a new pool .
Ted Kaczynski , the convicted bomber who blew up dozens of technophilic professionals , was right about one thing : technology has its own agenda .
The technium is not , as most people think , a series of individual artifacts and gadgets for sale .
Rather , Kaczynski , speaking as the Unabomber , argued that technology is a dynamic holistic system .
It is not mere hardware ; rather it is more akin to an organism .
It is not inert , nor passive ; rather the technium seeks and grabs resources for its own expansion .
It is not merely the sum of human action , but in fact it transcends human actions and desires .
I think Kaczynski was right about these claims .
In his own words the Unabomber says : “ The system does not and can not exist to satisfy human needs .
Instead , it is human behavior that has to be modified to fit the needs of the system .
This has nothing to do with the political or social ideology that may pretend to guide the technological system .
It is the fault of technology , because the system is guided not by ideology but by technical necessity . ”
I too argue that the technium is guided by “ technical necessity . ”
That is , baked into the nature of this vast complex of technological systems are self - serving aspects – technologies that enable more technology , and systems that preserve themselves — and also inherent biases that lead the technium in certain directions , outside of human desire .
Kaczynski writes “ modern technology is a unified system in which all parts are dependent on one another .
You ca n’t get rid of the ‘ bad ’ parts of technology and retain only the ‘ good ’ parts . ”
The truth of Kaczynski ’s observations does not absolve him of his murders , or justify his insane hatred .
Kaczynski saw something in technology that caused him to lash out with violence , but despite his mental imbalance , he was able to articulate that view with surprising clarity his sprawling , infamous 35,000 - word manifesto .
Kaczynski murdered three people ( and injured 23 more ) in order to get this manifesto published .
His despicable desperation and crimes hide a critique that has gained a minority following by other luddites .
The center section of his argument is clear , remarkably so , given his cranky personal grievances against leftists that bookend his rant .
Here , in meticulous , scholarly precision , Kaczynski makes his primary claim that “ freedom and technological progress are incompatible , ” and that therefore technological progress must be undone .
As best I understand , the Unabomber ’s argument goes like this :
Personal freedoms are constrained by society , as they must be .
The stronger that technology makes society , the less freedoms .
Technology destroys nature , which strengthens technology further .
This ratchet of technological self - amplification is stronger than politics .
Any attempt to use technology or politics to tame the system only strengthens it .
Therefore technological civilization must be destroyed , rather than reformed .
Since it cannot be destroyed by tech or politics , humans must push industrial society towards its inevitable end of self - collapse .
Then pounce on it when it is down and kill it before it rises again .
In short , Kaczynski claims that civilization is the disease and not the cure .
He was n’t the first to make this claim .
Rants against the machine of civilization go back as far as Freud and beyond .
But the assaults against industrial society speed up as industry sped up .
Edward Abbey , the legendary wilderness activist , considered industrial civilization to be a “ destroying juggernaut ” wrecking both the planet and humans .
Abbey did all he could personally to stop the juggernaut with monkey wrenching maneuvers – sabotaging logging equipment and so forth .
Abbey was the iconic Earth Firster who inspired many fire throwing followers .
The luddite theorist , Kirkpatrick Sale , who unlike Abbey , railed against the machine while living in a brownstone in Manhattan , refined the idea of “ civilization as disease . ”
Kirk Sale and I had a public debate which led to public bet of $ 1,000 on whether civilization would collapse by 2020 ( me nay , he yay ) .
Recently the call to undo civilization and return to a purer , more humane primitive state has accelerated in pace with the supposed advent of the Singularity .
In 2008 John Zerzan published an anthology of contemporary readings focused on the theme “ Against Civilization ” .
Derrick Jensen penned a 1,500 word treatise on how and why to topple technological civilization , with hands - on suggestions of the ideal places to start – power and gas lines and the information infrastructure .
Kaczynski had read earlier jeremiads against industrial society and arrived at his hatred of civilization in the same way many other nature lovers , mountain men , back - to - the - earthers have .
He was driven there in a retreat from the rest of us .
Kaczynski buckled under the many rules and expectations society put up for him .
He said , “ Rules and regulations are by nature oppressive .
Even ‘ good ’ rules are reductions in freedom . ”
He was deeply frustrated at not being able to integrate into professional society , which he groomed himself for .
His frustration is echoed in these words from his manifesto :
Modern man is strapped down by a network of rules and regulations …
Most of these regulations cannot be disposed with , because they are necessary for the functioning of industrial society .
When one does not have adequate opportunity to go throughout the power process the consequences are … boredom , demoralization , low self - esteem , inferiority feelings , defeatism , depression , anxiety , guilt , frustration , hostility , spouse or child abuse , insatiable hedonism , abnormal sexual behavior , sleep disorders , eating disorders , etc .
[ The rules of industrial society ] have made life unfulfilling , have subjected human beings to indignities , have led to widespread psychological suffering .
By “ feelings of inferiority ” we mean not only inferiority feelings in the strictest sense but a whole spectrum of related traits : low self - esteem , feelings of powerlessness , depressive tendencies , defeatism , guilt , self - hatred , etc .
Kaczynski suffered these indignities , which he blamed on society , and escaped to the hills where he perceived he could enjoy more freedoms .
In Montana he built a cabin without running water or electricity .
Here he lived a fairly self - sustained life – away from the rules and the reach of technological civilization .
( But just as Thoreau did at Walden , he came into town to restock his supplies . )
However his escape from technology was disturbed around 1983 .
One of the wilderness oases Kaczynski loved to visit was a “ plateau that dated from the Tertiary Age ” a two - day hike from his cabin .
The spot was sort of a secret retreat for him .
As Kaczynski remembers , “ It ’s kind of rolling country , not flat , and when you get to the edge of it you find these ravines that cut very steeply into cliff - like drop - offs .
There was even a waterfall there . ”
The area around his own cabin was getting too much traffic from hikers and hunters , so in the summer of 1983 he retreated to his secret spot on the plateau .
As he tells an interviewer later in prison ,
“ When I got there I found they had put a road right through the middle of it ”
His voice trails off ; he pauses , then continues , “ You just ca n’t imagine how upset I was .
It was from that point on I decided that , rather than trying to acquire further wilderness skills , I would work on getting back at the system .
Revenge .
That was n’t the first time I ever did any monkey wrenching , but at that point , that sort of thing became a priority for me . ”
It is easy to sympathize with Kaczynski ’s plight .
You politely try to escape the squeeze of technological civilization by retreating to its furthest reaches , where you establish a relatively techno - free lifestyle and then the beast of civilization / development / industrial technology stalks you and destroys your paradise .
Is there no escape ?
The machine is ubiquitous !
It is relentless !
It must be stopped !
The Unabomber cabin in lower left .
Ted Kaczynski , of course , is not the only wilderness lover to suffer the encroachment of civilization .
Entire tribes of indigenous Americans were driven to remote areas by the advance of European culture .
They were not running from technology per se ( they happily picked up the latest guns when they could ) , but the effect was the same – to distance themselves from industrial society , to remove themselves from the advancing culture .
Kaczynski argues that it is impossible to escape the ratcheting clutches of industrial technology for several reasons .
One , because if you use any part of it , the system demands servitude ; two , because technology does not “ reverse ” itself , never releasing what is in its hold ; and three , because we do n’t have a choice of what technology to use in the long run .
In his words , from the Manifesto :
The system HAS TO regulate human behavior closely in order to function .
At work , people have to do what they are told to do , otherwise production would be thrown into chaos .
Bureaucracies HAVE TO be run according to rigid rules .
To allow any substantial personal discretion to lower - level bureaucrats would disrupt the system and lead to charges of unfairness due to differences in the way individual bureaucrats exercised their discretion .
It is true that some restrictions on our freedom could be eliminated , but GENERALLY SPEAKING the regulation of our lives by large organizations is necessary for the functioning of industrial - technological society .
The result is a sense of powerlessness on the part of the average person .
It is not possible to make a LASTING compromise between technology and freedom , because technology is by far the more powerful social force and continually encroaches on freedom through REPEATED compromises .
Another reason why technology is such a powerful social force is that , within the context of a given society , technological progress marches in only one direction ; it can never be reversed .
Once a technical innovation has been introduced , people usually become dependent on it , unless it is replaced by some still more advanced innovation .
Not only do people become dependent as individuals on a new item of technology , but , even more , the system as a whole becomes dependent on it .
When a new item of technology is introduced as an option that an individual can accept or not as he chooses , it does not necessarily REMAIN optional .
In many cases the new technology changes society in such a way that people eventually find themselves FORCED to use it .
Kaczynski felt so strongly about the last point that he repeated it once more in a different section of his treatise .
It is an important criticism .
Once you accept that individuals surrender freedom and dignity to “ the machine ” and that they increasingly have no choice but to do so , then the rest of Kaczynski ’s argument flows fairly logically :
But we are suggesting neither that the human race would voluntarily turn power over to the machines nor that the machines would willfully seize power .
What we do suggest is that the human race might easily permit itself to drift into a position of such dependence on the machines that it would have no practical choice but to accept all of the machines decisions .
As society and the problems that face it become more and more complex and machines become more and more intelligent , people will let machines make more of their decision for them , simply because machine - made decisions will bring better result than man -made ones .
Eventually a stage may be reached at which the decisions necessary to keep the system running will be so complex that human beings will be incapable of making them intelligently .
At that stage the machines will be in effective control .
People wo n’t be able to just turn the machines off , because they will be so dependent on them that turning them off would amount to suicide .
..
Technology will eventually acquire something approaching complete control over human behavior .
Will public resistance prevent the introduction of technological control of human behavior ?
It certainly would if an attempt were made to introduce such control all at once .
But since technological control will be introduced through a long sequence of small advances , there will be no rational and effective public resistance .
I find it hard to argue against this last section .
It is true that as the complexity of our built world increases we will necessarily need to rely on mechanical ( computerized ) means to managing this complexity .
We already do .
Autopilots fly our very complex flying machines .
Algorithms control our very complex communications and electrical grids .
And for better or worse , computers control our very complex economy .
Certainly as we construct yet more complex infrastructure ( location - based mobile communications , genetic engineering , fusion generators , autopilot cars ) we will rely further on machines to run them and make decisions .
For those services , turning off the switch is not an option .
In fact , if we wanted to turn off the internet right now , it would not be easy to do if others wanted to keep it on .
In many ways the internet is designed to never turn off .
Finally , if the triumph of a technological takeover is the disaster that Kaczynski outlines – robbing souls of freedom , initiative , sanity , or the environment of its sustainability – and if this prison is inescapable , then the system must be destroyed .
Not reformed , because that will merely extend it , but eliminated .
From his manifesto :
Until the industrial system has been thoroughly wrecked , the destruction of that system must be the revolutionaries ’ ONLY goal .
Other goals would distract attention and energy from the main goal .
More importantly , if the revolutionaries permit themselves to have any other goal than the destruction of technology , they will be tempted to use technology as a tool for reaching that other goal .
If they give in to that temptation , they will fall right back into the technological trap , because modern technology is a unified , tightly organized system , so that , in order to retain SOME technology , one finds oneself obliged to retain MOST technology , hence one ends up sacrificing only token amounts of technology .
Success can be hoped for only by fighting the technological system as a whole ; but that is revolution not reform .
… While the industrial system is sick we must destroy it .
If we compromise with it and let it recover from its sickness , it will eventually wipe out all of our freedom .
For these reasons Ted Kaczynski went to the mountains to escape the clutches of the civilization and then later to plot his destruction of it .
He would make his own tools ( anything he could hand fashion ) while avoiding technology ( stuff it takes a system to make ) .
His small one - room shed was so well - constructed that the Feds later moved it off his property as a single intact Lego - like piece , and put it in storage ( it now sits reconstructed in the Newseum in Washington , DC . )
His place was way off the road ; he used a mountain bike to get into town .
He dried hunted meat in his tiny attic , and spent his evenings in the yellow light of a kerosene lamp crafting intricate bomb mechanisms .
The bombs were strikes at the professionals running the civilization he hated .
It was evident that while the bombs were deadly , they were ineffective in achieving his goal since no one knew what their purpose was .
He needed a billboard to announce why civilization needed to be destroyed .
He needed a manifesto published in the major papers and magazines of the world .
Once they read it a special few would see how imprisoned they were and they would join his cause .
Perhaps others would also start bombing the chokepoints in civilization .
Then his Freedom Club ( FC ) would be a real club of more than himself .
The attacks on civilization did not materialize in bulk .
Occasionally an Earth Firster would burn a building in an encroaching development or pour sugar into a bulldozer ’s gas tank .
During the otherwise peaceful protests against the G7 , some anti-civilization anarchists ( who call themselves anarcho - primitivists ) broke fast - food store - front windows and smashed property .
But the mass assault on civilization never happened .
The problem is that Kaczynski ’s most basic premise , the first axiom in his argument , is not true .
The Unabomber claims that technology robs people of freedom .
But most people of the world find the opposite .
They gravitate towards venues of increasing technology because they recognize they have more freedoms when they are empowered with it .
They ( that is we ) realistically weigh the fact that yes , indeed , some options are closed off when adopting new technology , but many others are opened , so that the net gain is a plus of freedom , choices , and possibilities .
The gray hoodie under the plastic bag appeared on his police sketches .
Consider Kaczynski himself .
For 25 years he lived in a type of self - enforced solitary confinement in a dirty ( see the photos and video ) smoky shack without electricity , running water , or a toilet – he cut a hole in the floor for late night pissing .
In terms of material standards the cell he now occupies in the Colorado Admax prison is a four - star upgrade : larger , cleaner , warmer , with the running water , electricity and the toilet he did not have , plus free food , and a much better library .
In his Montana hermitage he was free to move about as much as the snow and weather permitted him .
He could freely choose among a limited set of choices of what to do in the evenings .
He may have personally been content with his limited world , but overall his choices were very constrained , although he had unshackled freedom within those limited choices .
Sort of like , “ you are free to hoe the potatoes any hour of the day you want . ”
Kaczynski confused great latitude within limited choices as superior over modest latitude in an expanding number of choices .
His workbench where he made bombs .
I can only compare his constraints to mine , or perhaps anyone else ’s reading this today .
I am plugged into the belly of the machine .
Yet , technology allows me to work at home , so I hike in the mountains , where cougar and coyote roam , most afternoons .
I can hear a mathematician give a talk on the latest theory of numbers one day , and the next day be lost in the wilderness of Death Valley with as little survivor gear as possible .
My choices in how I spend my day are vast .
They are not infinite , and some options are not available , but in comparison to the degree of choices and freedoms available to Ted Kaczynski in his shack , my freedoms are overwhelmingly greater .
This is the chief reason billions of people migrate from mountain shacks – very much like Kaczynski’s – all around the world .
A smart kid living in a smoky one - room shack in the hills of Laos , or Cameroon , or Bolivia will do all he / she can to make their way against all odds to the city where there are – so obvious to them – vastly more freedom and choices .
They would find Kaczynski ’s argument that there is more freedom back in the stifling hut they just escaped from plain crazy .
The young are not under some kind of technological spell that warps their mind into believing civilization is better .
Sitting in the mountains they are under no spell but poverty ’s .
They clearly know what they give up when they leave .
They understand the comfort and support of family , the priceless value of community acquired in a small village , the blessings of clean air and the soothing wholeness of the natural world .
They feel the loss of immediate access to these , but they come to the city anyway because in the end , the tally favors the freedoms created by civilization .
They can ( and will ) return to the hills to be rejuvenated .
My family does n’t have TV , and while we have a car , I have plenty of city friends who do not .
Avoiding particular technologies is certainly possible .
The Amish do it well .
Many individuals do it well .
However the Unabomber is right that choices which begin as optional can over time become less so .
First , there are certain technologies ( say sewage treatment , vaccinations , traffic lights ) that were once matters of choice but that are now mandated and enforced by the system .
Then , there are other systematic technologies , like automobiles , which are self - reinforcing .
Thousands of other technologies are intertwined into these systemic ones , making it hard for a human to avoid .
The more that participate , the more essential it becomes .
Living without these embedded technologies requires more effort , or at least more deliberate alternatives .
This web of self - reinforcing technologies would be a type of noose if the total gains in choices , possibilities and freedoms brought about by them did not exceed the losses .
I argue that our continued embrace of more technology is further proof that we have made the calculation as we head for the greater good .
Anti-civilizationists would argue that we embrace more because we are brainwashed by the system itself and we have no choice to but to say yes to more .
We ca n’t say no to more than a few individual pieces , so we are imprisoned in this elaborate artificial lie .
It is possible that the technium has brainwashed us all , except for a few clear - eyed anarcho - primitivists who like to blow up stuff .
I would be inclined to believe in the anarchy if the Unabomber ’s alternative to civilization was more clear .
After we destroy civilization , then what ?
From Green Anarchy Primer
I ’ve been reading the literature of the anti-civilization collapsatarians to find out what they have in mind after the collapse .
Anti-civilization dreamers spend a lot of time devising ways to bring down civilization ( befriend hackers , unbolt power towers , blow up dams ) , but not so much on what replaces it .
They do have a notion what the world looked like before civilization .
According to them it looks like this ( from the Green Anarchy Primer ) :
Prior to civilization there generally existed ample leisure time , considerable gender autonomy and equality , a non-destructive approach to the natural world , the absence of organized violence , no mediating or formal institutions , and strong health and robusticity .
Then came civilization and all the ills ( literally ) of the earth :
Civilization inaugurated warfare , the subjugation of women , population growth , drudge work , concepts of property , entrenched hierarchies , and virtually every known disease , to name a few of its devastating derivatives .
Among the green anarchists there ’s talk of recovering your soul , making fire by rubbing sticks , discussions of whether vegetarianism is a good idea for hunters , but there is no outline of how groups of people go beyond survival mode , or if they do .
We are supposed to aim for “ re-wilding ” but the re-wilders are shy to describe what life is like in this re-wild state .
One prolific green anarchy author , Derrick Jensen , dismisses the lack of alternatives to civilization and says simply , “ I do not provide alternatives because there is no need .
The alternatives already exist , and they have existed – and worked – for thousands and tens of thousands of years . ”
He means of course tribal life , but not modern tribal ; he means tribal as in no agriculture , no anti-biotics , no nothing beyond wood , fur and stone .
The great difficulty of the anti-civilizationists is that a sustainable desirable alternative to civilization is unimaginable .
We can not picture it .
We cannot see how it would be a place we ’d like to move to .
We ca n’t imagine how this primitive arrangement of stone and fur would satisfy each of our individual talents .
And because we cannot imagine it , it will never happen , because nothing has ever been created without being imagined first .
Despite their inability to image a desirable coherent alternative , the archo- primitivists all agree that some combo of being in tune with nature , eating low - calorie diets , owning very little and using only things you make yourself , will bring on a level of contentment , happiness and meaning we have not seen for 10,000 years ( literally ) .
But if this state of happy poverty is so desirable and good for the soul why do none of the anti-civilizationists live like this ?
As far as I can ell from my research all self - identifying anarcho - primitivists live in modernity .
They compose their rants against the machine on very fast desktop machines .
While they sip coffee .
Their routines would be only marginally different than mine .
They have not relinquished the conveniences of civilization for the better shores of nomadic hunter - gathering .
Except one : The Unabomber .
Kaczynski went further than other critics in living the story he believed in .
At first glance his story seems promising , but on second look , it collapses into the familiar conclusion : he is living off the fat of civilization .
The Unabomber ’s shack was crammed with stuff he purchased from the machine : snowshoes , boots , sweat shirts , food , explosives , mattresses , plastic jugs and buckets , etc. – all things that he could have made himself , but did not .
After 25 years on the job , why did he not make his own tools separate from the system ?
It looks like he shopped at Wal - mart .
The food he scavenged from the wild was minimal .
Instead he regularly rode his bike to town and there rented an old car to drive to the big city to restock his food and supplies from supermarkets .
He was either incapable of supporting himself without civilization , or unwilling to .
Unabomber shack attic .
Besides lacking a desirable alternative , the final problem with destroying civilization as we know it is that the alternative , such as it has been imagined by the self - described “ haters of civilization ” , would not support but a fraction of the people alive today .
In other words , the collapse of civilization would kill billions .
Ironically the poorest rural inhabitants would fare the best , as they could retreat to hunting gathering with the least hurdle , but billions of urbanites would die once food ran out and disease took over .
The anarcho - primitives are rather sanguine about this catastrophe , arguing that accelerating the collapse early might save lives in total .
Again the exception seems to be Ted Kaczynski , who reckons with the die - off in this post - arrest interview :
For those who realize the need to do away with the techno - industrial system , if you work for its collapse , in effect you are killing a lot of people .
If it collapses , there is going to be social disorder , there is going to be starvation , there are n’t going to be any more spare parts or fuel for farm equipment , there wo n’t be any more pesticide or fertilizer on which modern agriculture is dependent .
So there is n’t going to be enough food to go around , so then what happens ?
This is something that , as far as I ’ve read , I have n’t seen any radicals facing up to .
Presumably Kaczynski personally “ faced up ” to the logical conclusion of taking down civilization ; it would kill billions of people .
He must have decided that murdering a few more people up front in the process would not matter .
After all , the techno - industrial complex had snuffed out the humanity from him , so if he had to snuff out a few dozen humans on the way to snuff out the system that enslaves billions , that would be worth it .
The death of billions would also be justified because all those unfortunate people under the grasp of technology were now soulless , like he was .
Once civilization was gone , the next generation would be really free .
The ultimate problem is that the paradise the Kaczynski is offering , the solution to civilization so to speak , is the tiny , smoky , dingy , smelly wooden prison cell that absolutely nobody else wants to dwell in .
It is a paradise billions are fleeing from .
Civilization has its problems but in almost every way it is better than the Unabomber ’s shack .
The Unabomber is right that technology is a holistic , self - perpetuating machine .
He is wrong to bomb it for many reasons , not the least is that the machine of civilization offers us more actual freedoms than the alternative .
There is a cost to run this machine , a cost we are only beginning to reckon with , but so far the gains from this ever enlarging technium outweigh the alternative of no machine at all .
Auto - tuning , the practice of digitally " repairing " off - key vocal tracks , is more visibly prominent than ever .
But it 's even more ubiquitous than people realize , and some musicians and fans are n't happy about it .

Auto - tune really only entered public consciousness with the release of that one Cher song that 's somehow still playing in malls more than a decade later .
And lately , some rappers , most notably T - Pain and most distressingly Kanye West , have taken up the robotic vocal torch .
Even stark minimalist Bon Iver used the software , made by Antares Audio Technologies , on his most recent EP .
But Time 's recent article explains that auto - tune is used on just about every major - label pop album these days , from Britney Spears to Faith Hill .
It 's now assumed that auto - tuning will be applied to almost any recording that does n't specifically refuse it .
Some , including legendary producer Rick Rubin and possible love of my life Neko Case , are n't fans of the near - required use of auto - tuning .
Rubin notes that many classic recordings were only achieved after repeated attempts , and that emotion and passion can be lost with the use of the software .
Case , in typical brash honesty , declared , " That shit sounds like shit ! " regarding auto - tuned singers , and compared it to the artificiality of diet soda .

We often forget that it 's the imperfection of vocals that can make them the most powerful .
There 's nothing wrong with glossy bubblegum like T - Pain , but to use auto - tuning indiscriminately can absolutely kill honest emotion .
On the other hand , it 's hard not to like T - Pain ; his unabashed lack of singing ability does n't make him a lesser pop artist , and his pledge to create an iPhone app that would allow anybody to auto - tune themselves into a crooning robot actually sounds like a great idea .
Britney , you can fix your warble all you want , but leave the serious music alone , okay ?

Bat For Lashes ’ new single ‘ Daniel ’ is the lead single from Natasha Khan ’s rather excellent second album ‘ Two Suns ’ ( due April 6 ) .
It finds her coming over all ‘ Tango In The Night ’ - era Fleetwood Mac , and is accompanied by the kind of enigmatic , atmospheric video we ’ve come to expect from Natasha Khan .
The video Features Natasha ’s alter ego Pearl – A persona described as “ a destructive , self - absorbed , blonde , femme fatale of a persona who acts as a direct foil to Khan ’s more mystical , desert - born spiritual self . ”
Whether it ’s Bat For Lashes , Natasha Khan or “ Pearl ” we ’re not fussy , we ’ll take it .

Updated with this response from the company :
On November 14 , 2008 , Sun announced a series of changes designed to align its cost model with the global economy and accelerate the introduction of compelling open source innovations .
As part of that effort Sun announced a global workforce reduction of approximately 5,000 to 6,000 employees , representing approximately 15 % to 18 % of the Company ’s global workforce .
Sun can confirm that today layoff notifications were given to approximately 1,300 employees as part of that action .
Reductions were made across all levels , including vice presidents and directors .
Sun continues to make choices to align strategically , geographically and operationally with its plan for long term growth .
We believe the restructuring will result in a more efficient coverage model with resources aligned to growth opportunities .
We believe the number of positions that will be eliminated , when combined with the other cost cutting measures and organizational changes being implemented , will put the Company on track for improved financial performance .
Last November , Sun Microsystems said it would be laying off up to 6,000 employees — or around 18 percent of its workforce — after a weak first quarter performance .
The cuts are happening today , we ’re hearing from a well - placed source , ahead of the company ’s second - quarter earnings report next Tuesday .
The server and software company is facing hard times as the market has shifted from closed - source to open - source software technologies , like Linux , and it is facing stiff competition from larger rivals like IBM and HP .
To boot , a significant portion of the company ’s business is in the financial sector — clients that are n’t in a position to make large purchases these days .
Sun has been experimenting with software - as - a - service and other models to help it gain market share , and most prominently purchased open - source database company for MySQL for $ 1 billion last year .
Here ’s some more from the strategy announcement it released in November :
As part of this effort , Sun is announcing a global workforce reduction and alignment of its Software organization into new business groups – Application Platform Software , Systems Platforms , and Cloud Computing & Developer Platforms – with a focus on boosting open source momentum and growing new sectors of the market who view technology as a competitive weapon .
Thousands of small mirrors -- heliostats -- focus sun 's rays
Solar power history is being made in Southern California .
Southern California Edison and BrightSource Energy from Israel have signed the world ’s largest solar energy deal .
Now awaiting approval from the California Public Utilities Commission , when the contracts are fulfilled — this could happen by as early as 2013 — the Israeli - California sun project will power almost 1 million California homes .
Israel Kroizer , the chief operating officer , and president of BrightSource in Israel says that when completed , it will be the world ’s largest solar energy project .
Some 1,300 megawatts of energy will be created , with the first plant to be built in Ivanpah , California , expected to generate 286,000 megawatt - hours per year .
The project will also create more jobs in the region .
“ It ’s the biggest solar energy project ever signed , ” Kroizer emphasizes , and when complete it will be the largest solar energy plant in the world , he adds .
Towering Sun Stations
Last year , BrightSource created a media sensation when it launched its pilot plant in Israel ’s Negev Desert .
Employing thousands of tiny mirrors called heliostats , BrightSource unveiled the Luz Power Tower — the LPT 550 — to reflect sunlight from the heliostats onto a boiler atop a tower .
Producing steam from the concentrated heat , the steam is piped to a turbine to generate electricity .
Built with water - conserving principles in mind , the BrightSource system uses air - cooling to convert the steam back into water .
The environmentally friendly closed cycle solution is , according to the company , designed to offer the highest operating efficiencies and lowest costs in the industry .
“ We opened a pilot in Israel last year — a demo plant to run some tests — and we were really satisfied with the results .
Now we are focusing in the States , and will respond to the [ solar energy ] tender being published in Israel .
Israel is a target market for us , but it ’s not the same size as the US , ” said Kroizer .
As part of the deal with its American partner SCE , BrightSource will maintain its engineering and logistics facilities in Israel .
Equipment will be purchased from around the world , while the company ’s corporate offices for project and business development and financing will continue working out of Oakland , California .
BrightSource , which was officially founded in 2004 , and started operating in 2006 , employs 30 people in the US , and 90 in Israel .
Arizona and New Mexico Next
In a few months , Kroizer says , BrightSource will start constructing the solar project in the US , and next on its list for solar energy power plants are other sun-drenched states — all over southwest California , Arizona and New Mexico .
In the United States , BrightSource ’s partner SCE , is the country ’s leading buyer of renewables .
In 2007 , it purchased about 80 percent of all the solar energy used in the US .
As the largest electric utilities company in California , it serves a population of about 13 million people , living within a 50,000 - square - mile area in central , coastal and Southern California .
“ These contracts represent a significant addition to our renewable portfolio , which is already the nation ’s largest . ” said Stuart Hemphill , the VP of Renewable and Alternative Power at SCE .
“ This innovative solar technology helps to further our position as the nation ’s largest purchaser of solar energy , as well . ”
The World Economic Forum voted BrightSource as a 2009 Technology Pioneer .
It was the only solar company to win this year ’s award , and is recognized for helping industrial customers reduce their dependence on fossil fuels .
While BrightSource ’s contribution is significant — the new plants will prevent two million tons of carbon dioxide greenhouse gases emissions from entering the atmosphere annually ( about 335,000 cars - worth of emissions ) — it ’s not a golden bullet solution .
Says Kroizer : “ I think it ’s important to have a variety of energy solutions .
Solar energy wo n’t solve the world ’s problems ; we need a variety of solutions and solar can be one of them .

MUSIC NEWS - STEVEN ADLER , former drummer for GUNS N' ROSES , has been ordered to check back into rehab after his recent arrest for failing to complete a court - ordered community service .
The musician was detained by cops on January 26 , 2009 and held for not completing the order in the time frame established by the judge .
The community service was a result of his previous arrest back in July 2008 for possession of narcotics , being under the influence and for an outstanding arrest warrant .
The rocker pled no contest to a charge of heroin possession at LA Superior Court to avoid a jail term for the earlier arrest , and was out on probation while ordered to complete a rehab program in Pasadena , California in December 2008 .
After his his latest run-in with the law , Adler appeared in court in Los Angeles this Friday ( Febr 6 , 2009 ) when the judge handling thes case ordered Adler to check back into the Cri-Help Treatment Center in North Hollywood on Monday morning , February 9 .

Claims that secret agents working for MI5 and MI6 watched and encouraged the torture of a second British resident held by the Americans must be investigated by the police , politicians , lawyers and human rights groups said last night .
Fresh allegations in the High Court this week will increase pressure on the Government to open a judicial inquiry into collusion between the CIA and British security services in torture during the " war on terror " .
Shaker Aamer , 42 , the final British resident in Guantanamo Bay , claims that like Binyam Mohamed , he was tortured in American custody in 2002 .
On Thursday the Attorney General took the unprecedented step of calling in Scotland Yard to investigate allegations that MI5 collaborated in the alleged torture of Mr Mohamed .
Mr Aamer 's case is believed to be one of 15 similar new cases .
In a legal claim against the Government to be lodged at the High Court this week , Mr Aamer 's lawyers allege that MI5 and MI6 were complicit in the torture of Mr Aamer .
A claim letter sent to Government lawyers alleges : " UK intelligence services officers were present whilst Mr Aamer was beaten .
They provided information and encouragement to his US torturers .
They made no attempt to stop his ill - treatment or any enquiries into his well - being . "
The British Government has requested the release of Mr Aamer from Guantanamo Bay , where he is on hunger strike .
There are no terrorism charges against him .
Dominic Grieve , the shadow Home Secretary , last night called on the Government to investigate Mr Aamer 's allegations .
" These disturbing claims only strengthen the case for a judicial inquiry into allegations of British collusion in torture , " he said .
" Britain 's reputation will be dragged through the mud if they go unanswered . "
According to an MI5 senior manager , known as " Witness A " , the Security Service was aware of transfers of prisoners from Pakistan to Afghanistan during this period .
Witness
A's evidence in the case of Binyam Mohamed , given last year but only released on Friday , suggests at least some of these transfers were believed to be unlawful .
Mr Aamer 's lawyer Irène Nembhard , of Birnberg Peirce , is asking the British Government to disclose the identity of the US and UK agents involved in her client 's interrogation , detention and torture .
Mr Aamer is married to a British citizen with whom he has four children , including a son he has never seen .
He says he went to Afghanistan in 2001 to work with charities .
He was sharing a house with Moazzam Begg , the British man released from Guantanamo Bay in 2005 , when he was forced to flee the US - led invasion .
He says he was held by an Afghan militant group , who passed him to the Northern Alliance who sold him to the Americans .
The CIA arranged his detention in Afghanistan and transfer to Guantanamo Bay .
Mr Aamer says an MI5 officer , who gave his name as " John " , was present while he was tortured in Afghanistan in January 2002 .
" John " was the name given by Witness B , the MI5 agent who interrogated Binyam Mohamed .

If you spend the majority of your time among stores , restaurants and skyscrapers , it may be time to trade in your stilettos for some hiking boots .
A new study in Psychological Science reveals that spending time in nature may be more beneficial for mental processes than being in urban environments .
Psychologists Marc G. Berman , John Jonides , and Stephen Kaplan from the University of Michigan designed two experiments to test how interactions with nature and urban environments would affect attention and memory processes .
First , a group of volunteers completed a task designed to challenge memory and attention .
The volunteers then took a walk in either a park or in downtown Ann Arbor .
After the walk , volunteers returned to the lab and were retested on the task .
In the second experiment , after volunteers completed the task , instead of going out for a walk , they simply viewed either nature photographs or photographs of urban environments and then repeated the task .
The results were quite interesting .
In the first experiment , performance on the memory and attention task greatly improved following the walk in the park , but did not improve for volunteers who walked downtown .
And it is not just being outside that is beneficial for mental functions — the group who viewed the nature photographs performed much better on the retest than the group who looked at city scenes .
The authors suggest that urban environments provide a relatively complex and often confusing pattern of stimulation , which requires effort to sort out and interpret .
Natural environments , by contrast , offer a more coherent ( and often more aesthetic ) pattern of stimulation that , far from requiring effort , are often experienced as restful .
Thus being in the context of nature is effortless , permitting us to replenish our capacity to attend and thus having a restorative effect on our mental abilities .
FRENSTAT , Czech Republic 
A political coup has shaken the Czech Republic since Boleslav the Kind Hearted Forever was ousted as king of Wallachia , a sleepy kingdom where locals drink 110 - proof plum brandy for breakfast and use a wheat - backed currency pegged to the dollar .
The faux Kingdom of Wallachia is nestled in the northeast corner of the Czech Republic , 230 miles from Prague .
It was founded in 1997 by the itinerant photographer Tomas Harabis , its current foreign minister , as an elaborate practical joke .
The ruse quickly captured the imagination of Czechs , long drawn to black humor and parody , and Wallachia , which also happens to be a real place , became one of the country ’s biggest tourist attractions .
Its success has led to a real - life battle over who owns the kingdom , which generates hundreds of thousands of euros in revenue each year .
The kingdom has the requisites of authentic statehood , including a currency called the jurovalsar ; consulates in the Arctic Circle and Togo ; a Royal Wallachian Navy , consisting of 40 wooden canoes ; a bright yellow Communist - era limousine for use by visiting dignitaries ; and a burgundy passport , covered with a picture of the pagan god Radegast , that Mr. Harabis says he has used to cross the border from Canada to Alaska .
Researchers at the Swedish medical university Karolinska Institutet have shown for the first time that the active training of the working memory brings about visible changes in the number of dopamine receptors in the human brain .
The study , which is published in the journal Science , was conducted with the help of PET scanning and provides deeper insight into the complex interplay between cognition and the brain 's biological structure .
" Brain biochemistry does n't just underpin our mental activity ; our mental activity and thinking process can also affect the biochemistry , " says Professor Torkel Klingberg , who led the study .
" This has n't been demonstrated in humans before , and opens up a floodgate of fascinating questions . "
The neurotransmitter dopamine plays a key part in many of the brain 's functions .
Disruptions to the dopamine system can impair working memory , making it more difficult to remember information over a short period of time , such as when problem solving .
Impaired working memory has , in its turn , proved to be a contributory factory to cognitive impairments in such disorders as ADHD and schizophrenia .
Professor Klingberg and his colleagues have previously shown that the working memory can be improved with a few weeks ' intensive training .
Through a collaborative project conducted under the Stockholm Brain Institute , the researchers have now taken a step further and monitored the brain using Positron Emission Tomography ( PET scans ) , and have confirmed that intensive brain training leads to a change in the number of dopamine D1 receptors in the cortex .
Their results can be of significance to the development of new treatments for patients with cognitive impairments , such as those related to ADHD , stroke , chronic fatigue syndrome and ageing .
" Changes in the number of dopamine receptors in a person does n't give us the key to poor memory , " says Professor Lars Farde , one of the researchers who took part in the study .
" We also have to ask if the differences could have been caused by a lack of memory training or other environmental factors .
Maybe we 'll be able to find new , more effective treatments that combine medication and cognitive training , in which case we 're in extremely interesting territory . "
Positron Emission Tomography is a medical imaging technique based on the decay of radioactive isotopes that is able to produce three - dimensional pictures of the movement of signal substances in the living body .
Karolinska
Institutet has been able to invest in the world 's most powerful PET scanner for brain imaging thanks to a financial contribution by pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca .
JavaScript is a programming language that started off simply as a mechanism to add logic and interactivity to an otherwise static Netscape browser .
In the years since its introduction , it has not only supplanted a variety of other competing languages and technologies to become the standard for browser - based programming , but it has also expanded beyond the client space to become a dominant language on the server side , as well .
What JavaScript can be used for The Hyper Text Transport Protocol , or HTTP , was designed to do exactly what the name implies , which is to transport HTML text across a network for viewing .
But the problem with HTML is that it is completely static , providing no capabilities to implement logic .
Basic features we currently take for granted , such as input validation , autocorrect , progress bars or causing a graphic to change during a mouse rollover , would all be impossible for a browser to perform without some type of scripting capability .
As a result , when the web first rose to prominence , every vendor in that space provided some mechanism to make HTML web pages more interactive .
Alternatives to JavaScript Microsoft promoted a competitor to JavaScript named VBScript , along with plug - in technologies , such as ActiveX Data Object ( ADO ) .
Sun Microsystems promoted Java applets that were cross-platform and could be used in any browser .
Many other technologies came and went as the internet matured .
In the end , JavaScript won the battle for popularity , and it is the only client - side scripting technology supported by the Chrome , Firefox , Safari and Internet Explorer browsers .
JavaScript is an interpreted language , as opposed to compiled languages , such as C++ and Java .
This means that the code written in JavaScript does not go through an intermediary compilation stage in which the source code is transformed into machine language that is easy for a CPU to process .
Instead , JavaScript is interpreted on the fly by the computer processing it .
Because JavaScript code is not packaged in a CPU - friendly form , such as Java bytecode or a binary executable , program execution can be slower than a comparable program written in Scala or F#.
However , modern JavaScript engines are highly optimized , and inefficiencies are rarely noticeable when using modern hardware .
Short note on JavaScript versus Java Given the first four letters of the name , a misconception exists that JavaScript and Java are similar .
While it is true that Java and JavaScript share some very basic syntax elements , such as the use of semicolons to terminate a statement , the use of curly braces to delineate code block , and similar constructs to create looping and iterative structures , the similarities end there .
The two languages do not originate from the same vendor , the two languages are not maintained by the same consortium , and fundamental language features , such as object orientation and strong typing , are major instances in which the two differ .
Java and JavaScript are two very separate and distinct programming languages that should not be confused with one another .
Basics of JavaScript programming HTML provides a special < SCRIPT > tag that enables developers to embed JavaScript within the markup of the page .
Variable declaration using the var keyword in JavaScript is very straightforward and does not involve a complex set of initialization rules as one might see in Java or C++.
JavaScript is known as an untyped language , which means that variables can take on a variety of different forms as a program executes .
For example , in the following program , a variable named greeting is declared and is initialized to a text string .
But , on the next line , the greeting variable is assigned to an integer value of 10 .
A new variable named product is then initialized to the value of the greeting variable multiplied by itself .
var greeting = ' Hello World ' ;
greeting = 10 ;
var product = greeting * greeting ;
Using JavaScript's var keyword to declare variables
Because it is permissible for a variable named greeting that is created as a text string type String to change on the fly to a variable of type integer , JavaScript is known as a weakly typed language .
In a strongly typed language like C++ or Java , this type of variable transformation would trigger a compilation error .
JavaScript 's let vs. var Historically , the var keyword has been used to instigate the declaration of a variable .
However , when using the var keyword , the variable can end up having a broader scope than was originally intended , which can cause conflicts with other parts of the code that might declare a similarly named variable .
Version 6 of the ECMAScript standard introduced the let keyword for declaring variables .
Both var and let share the same syntax , but variables declared using JavaScript 's var keyword are scoped to the function in which they are declared , whereas the JavaScript let keyword keeps the variable scoped to the block in which it was declared . {
let greeting = ' Hello World ' ;
greeting = 10 ;
let product = greeting * greeting ;
}
JavaScript functions versus methods
The content of the < SCRIPT > tag can either be code to be invoked as soon as a user encounters the < SCRIPT > tag or it can contain JavaScript functions .
JavaScript functions are analogous to what other languages would call methods .
These JavaScript functions contain code that can be triggered by a browser - based event , such as a mouse click , page load , form submission or keystroke .
It is also common to have one JavaScript function invoke another to perform supplemental work .
Example of JavaScript code
The following is a simple example of a rock - paper - scissors application coded using HTML and JavaScript .
The < SCRIPT > tag contains a JavaScript function called playRoshambo , which is triggered by the onclick event of the user clicking on an anchor link that contains the text paper .
The result of playing the game is displayed within the < div > tag named results .
< script >
playRoshambo = function ( clientGesture ) {
// server always chooses rock
if ( clientGesture=='rock ' ) {
result = " tie " ;
}
if ( clientGesture== ' paper ' ) {
result = " win " ;
}
if ( clientGesture=='scissors ' ) {
result = " lose " ;
}
document.getElementById('results ') .innerHTML
= result ;
}
</ script >
Which one will it be ?<br/>
< a href= " # " onclick =" playRoshambo ( ' paper ' ) " > paper </a>
< div id =" results " ></div >
Modern JavaScript libraries
The basic JavaScript engine that comes packaged with a modern browser only provides a basic and rudimentary set of APIs for software development .
To perform complicated tasks , such as implementing an Ajax - based request - response cycle or even performing advanced DOM parsing or string manipulations , a great deal of code needs to be written .
Further complicating the task of writing code to achieve common yet complex programming tasks is the fact that there are differences between each of the major vendors in terms of which versions of JavaScript they implement , as well as how bug - free those implementations are .
To address the differences between browsers while at the same time providing prepackaged code for performing very common tasks , JavaScript libraries have become a mainstay of browser - based UI development .
The most popular JavaScript library in use today is jQuery , while competitors such as Prototype and Dojo remain quite popular .
Shortcomings of JavaScript
Two common criticisms of JavaScript is the fact that it is weakly typed and that it is not an object - oriented language .
Software developers tend to prefer strongly typed object - oriented languages because these features tend to accelerate software development while also helping to maintain a high degree of software quality .
However , because JavaScript has become the de facto language of internet browsers , being able to write high - quality , bug - free code has become a priority for many members of the software development community .
As a result , new languages , such as TypeScript , have emerged that are both strongly typed and object - oriented .
TypeScript looks very much like JavaScript , although it enforces strong typing and provides features for developing in an object - oriented manner .
TypeScript is also a compiled language , as opposed to JavaScript , which is interpreted .
However , unlike Java or C++ where the source code is compiled into bytecode or binary , TypeScript compiles into pure JavaScript that can be optimized based on the target browser .
Researchers who found chunks of a meteorite in Saskatchewan last November believe they 're getting close to answering a key question : where in space did it come from ?
University of Calgary graduate student Ellen Milley , who was part of the team that found space rocks in an area known as Buzzard Coulee southeast of Lloydminster , was at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon Monday to talk about what the team has learned .
So far , it looks like the meteorite did n't come from the asteroid belt beyond the orbit of Mars , she said .
The road to reaching that conclusion began when the space rocks fell Nov. 20 .
It was a night when hundreds of people across Western Canada witnessed a spectacular fireball across the sky caused by the estimated 10 - tonne rock .
Video surveillance cameras at motels and gas stations captured the flashes of brilliant light and the shadows they cast .
A week later , Milley was part of the team led by U of C geologist and geophysicist Alan Hildebrand at Buzzard Coulee .
It was she who spotted the first meteorite fragment in a frozen pond .
Later , she studied the flashes and shadows from the various surveillance and amateur videos .
She used the information to plot the fireball 's path as it fell to Earth and then tried to figure out its orbit .
Milley 's tentative conclusion , which she discussed in Saskatoon Monday , was that it did n't look like the space rock came from beyond the orbit of Mars .
" It looks like it 's a very kind of tight inner solar system orbit , " she said .
" It 's not something that 's extended into the asteroid belt . "
If she 's correct , it would be the first time researchers have found debris from a meteorite so close to Earth , Milley said .
In terms of the composition , Milley and her colleagues have determined it's a relatively common type of meteorite with a high iron content .
However , there is still much more to learn about it , they say .
More than 100 fragments have already been recovered , but this spring , researchers will be resuming their search for more .
They 'll be scouring the fields around Buzzard Coulee in search of an estimated two tonnes of rock that are believed to be studding the ground .

It ’s not long since I am writing critical to Islam .
Though I cherish no malice against Muslims , but , whenever an article of mine is published , I get many hate mails from Muslim readers .
Muslims often say that there are many scholars in Islam who had contributed enough to the mankind .
After few days of extensive google search , I came across a great Muslim scholar , named Ibn Baz .
This article is a humble and sincere attempt to glorify his wonderful contribution to the mankind .
Every effort has been made to write a very serious one , but Muslim readers might wrongly find this article a satire or a spoof !
Please do n’t blame me for your mistakes !
This article is , indeed , a very serious one .
I will always appreciate Ibn Baz ’s enthusiasm and salute him with deep sense of respect for his massive contribution to the modern science .
Hope , this time I will be able to please the Muslim readers .
Thank you . ]
One of the mystifying capabilities of the human brain is embodied in the genius .
A genius is an individual with astounding creative talents and distinguished mental abilities .
They are able to generate new ideas .
A new idea cannot be called creative unless it is quite hard to come by .
It is a common mistaken idea that geniuses are born , not made .
If we look at the lives of world ’s greatest geniuses like , Shakespeare , Da Vinci , Socrates , Einstein , Gutenberg , Ibn Baz , Edison , Newton and many others ; we will soon realize that almost all of them have many common personality characteristics .
Any common people can develop these characteristics and operate on a genius level .
As per Dr. Barrios ( 1980 ) , geniuses have a strong desire to work hard and for long and continually accumulate information .
Thomas Alva Edison said " Genius is ninety - nine percent perspiration and one percent inspiration " .
Geniuses are highly motivated and do not bother about what common people will think if they are different .
They have the courage to do something which others might consider impossible .
These characteristics enable geniuses to come up with and develop new and fruitful ideas , which simpletons of their days cannot think of .
The common folks had seen many geniuses and have benefited from their extraordinary constructive talents from time to time .
One such genius is Ibn Baz .
He hailed from Saudi Arabia ( the land of Prophet Muhammad ) and his full name is “ Shaikh Abd - al - Aziz Ibn Abd - Allah Ibn Baaz ” ( the name means - Servant of the almighty Allah , or , son of the servant of Allah ) .
He is better known by the short name ‘ Ibn Baz ’ ( though there are many uncanny similarities between Mr. Ibn Baz and Mr. Bin , these are coincidental only ) .
From the very childhood days he was very fond of memorizing Koran and learning Islamic religious scriptures ( Saudi Gazette , 1999 ) .
He believed that there could not be any knowledge beyond Koran and Ahadith ; and hence it was unnecessary to learn anything else other than the religious scriptures of Islam .
At the age of sixteen , Ibn Baaz contracted a serious eye infection .
His sight deteriorated and by the age of twenty he was completely blind .
But , since he was a true genius , he never gave up .
Despite of his blindness , he determinedly continued to study Islam under the direction of some of the most renowned Islamic thinkers of his day , such as the Sheikh Shanqeeti and many other Islamic scholars of different pedigree .
An article published in ‘ Saudi Gazette ’ highlighted the educational background of this genius , as follows
“ The subjects he studied included Arabic language and Islamic science including the interpretation of Holy Qur’an , the Prophet ’s ( pbuh ) Traditions , jurisprudence and Islamic history .
As an Islamic visionary he fully understood the influence of history on the Ummah and worked hard to ensure that the evil influences which did affect people in the past did not repeat itself in the present age . ”
( Anon , 1999 )
Shortly , his creative Muslim brain was completely Islamized and , hardly any Islamic scriptures were left for him to study .
By this way he became a great scholar and highly respectable nobleman in Saudi Arabia .
There were no science left in Koran and Ahadith which he did not pull out and learn .
In infidel world there are many scholars who can be called a ‘ walking encyclopedia ’ , but Ibn Baz soon became a ‘ walking Koran & Ahadith ’ .
Throughout his life , this great Islamic genius was totally devoted to comprehend scientific miracles of Koran and had issued many fataawa ( fataawa - plural of " fatwa " , means edicts ) for the development of human civilization , starting from 1940 onwards ( Wikipedia , 2006 ) .
A staff writer of ‘ Arab News ’ ( a leading newspaper published from Saudi Arabia ) reported on 15th May 1999 , “ He has issued thousands of fatwas on various contemporary social and economic issues on the basis of the Qur’an and Sunnah ” .
His first fatwa was ‘ employment of non-Muslims in the Arabian Gulf forbidden by Islam . ’
After few decades , this genius gave another fatwa ‘ Non-Muslim troops should be deployed on Saudi Arabia soil to defend the Kingdom from the Iraqi army ’ ( Kepel , 2004 ) .
This fatwa seems to be just a reversal of the first one , but we have to understand that geniuses always think differently and they develop new creative ideas from time to time .
It is not easy for a simpleton to understand the creative capacities of a genius .
He had authored many books to benefit mankind which are full of wisdom .
His books are always best - sellers within Muslim world only .
The most famous of his discovery is that which is stated in the book named , “ Evidence that the Earth is Standing Still . ”
This scientific research work was published by Islamic University of Medina , Saudi Arabia , during 1974 .
On page 23 of this academic research work he talked about his brilliant discovery and cited many references from Koran and Ahadith .
He confidently challenged the age - old belief of earth ’s rotation and quoted as follows ,
“ If the earth is rotating as they claim , the countries , the mountains , the trees , the rivers , and the oceans will have no bottom and the people will see the eastern countries move to the west and the western countries move to the east . "
Parvez Hoodbhoy had mentioned the above valuable scientific conclusion of Ibn Baz , in his book " Islam and Science : Religious Orthodoxy and the Battle for Rationality " .
On page 49 , he wrote ,
" .. The Sheikh ( Abdul Aziz Ibn Baz ) authored ... a book in Arabic entitled Jiryan Al - Shams Wa Al - Qammar Wa-Sukoon Al - Arz .
This translates into Motion of the Sun and Moon , and Stationarity of the Earth ...
In an earlier book , he had threatened dissenters with the dire fatwa or takfir ( disbelief ) , but did not repeat the threat in the newer version . "
( Language and grammar unchanged )
The news of this great discovery of Ibn Baz spread like a wild fire throughout the world and soon many Muslims probably had accepted the credibility of ‘ motionless geocentric earth theory ’ .
However , the infidel world ( including many western educated Muslims ) was hesitant to accept his opinion .
Judith Miller , wrote in his book ‘ God has Ninety - Nine Names ’ , on page 114 ,
" When he ( Sheikh Bin Baz ) had condemned what he termed the Copernican ' heresy , ' insisting , as the Koran said , that the sun moved , Egyptian journalists , much to President Nasser 's delight , had mercilessly mocked the leading cleric as a reflection of Saudi primitiveness . "
So , the Egyptian journalists did not value his ‘ freedom of speech ’ .
It is a ‘ crime ’ to subdue the creative competence of a great genius like Ibn Baz at the beginning stage .
It is a ‘ stupidity ’ to ridicule great geniuses like Ibn Baz .
Again , during 1993 , the fertile Islamic brain of this Muslim genius again started working overtime .
On one fine morning , the great genius opened his personal copy of Holy Koran , pulled out some scientific miracles from Allah ’s Holy book and came out with a new discovery that ‘ earth is flat ’ .
This was recorded by Carl Sagan in his book “ The Demon - haunted World : Science as a Candle in the Dark ” .
Sagan wrote ,
“ In 1993 , the supreme religious authority of Saudi Arabia , Sheik Abdel - Aziz ibn Baaz , issued a edict , or fatwah , declaring that the world is flat .
Anyone of the round persuasion does not believe in God and should be punished . ''
( Language and grammar unchanged )
and ,
" That is a well - known religious edict , or fatwa , issued two years ago by Sheik Abdel - Aziz ibn Baaz , the supreme religious authority of Saudi Arabia .
The blind theologian 's status gives his fatwas great weight , though his opinions have often raised eyebrows or embarrassed worldly Saudis ... "
( Language and grammar unchanged )
Soon the whole world ( except the infidels and civilized Muslims ) started accepting the new scientific discovery .
As example ; on 12th February , 1995 , on page A - 14 an article was published under the title “ Muslim Edicts take on New Force ” , where Yousef Mohammad Ibrahim wrote " The earth is flat .
Whoever claims it is round is an atheist deserving of punishment . "
There are many verses in Koran as well as there are many Ahadith , which indicate that earth is flat ( Sina , n.d ) .
But again , the great Islamic scholar Ibn Baz changed his mind as before .
He denied that he had described the ‘ Flat earth theory ’ ( Kepel , 2004 ) , when his theory was gaining popularity amongst Muslims .
There was no clue available why he suddenly abandoned his excellent scientific conclusion .
Perhaps , this is one of the characteristics of a genius .
However , he confirmed that his koranic belief about “ the motionless state of the earth and sun revolves around the earth ” is still intact even after so much ‘ merciless ’ mockery of Egyptian journalists ( Kepel , 2004 ) .
Another Islamic scholar , Sheikh Muhammad Tantawi said “ he ( Ibn Baz ) did not fear any criticism while expressing his Islamic viewpoints ” , ( Arab News , 1999 ) .
His strong determination proved that he was a true genius .
Probably those ‘ shameless ’ journalists were not aware of his professional achievements .
This great scholar held the position of Grand Mufti of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Head of the Council of Ulema ( Senior Scholars ) - 1993 to 1999 CE .
This position refers to the highest official of religious law in a Sunni Muslim country .
The Grand Mufti issues legal opinions and edicts , fatwa , on interpretations of Islamic law both for assisting judges in deciding cases as well as for private clients .
Other remarkable achievements include ( Saudi Gazette , 1999 ; Riyadh Daily , 1999 ; Arab News , 1999 ) ,
Vice President , and later President of the Islamic University in Medina , 1960 CE to 1970 CE
Chairman of the government department of Scientific Research and Ifta ( guidance ) with the rank of Minister .
1974 H to 1993 H .
President of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Fataawa .
Judge of Kharj For 14 years ,
Honorable teacher amongst faculty of Shariah [ Islamic Law ] of Riyadh Institute of Science from 1951 CE to 1960 CE .
In 1981 CE , he was awarded the King Faisal International Prize for Service to Islam .
In addition to his intensive activities , he used to attain seminars and deliver lectures in different Islamic universities till his death ( Riyadh Daily , 1999 ) .
His favourite topic was – the importance of adherence to Sunnah ( the Prophet ’s teachings ) .
Today , most of the prominent judges and religious scholars , University lecturers , scientists and top government officials of Saudi Arabia are his students which also includes the Education Minister of Saudi Arabia .
Though his success story was quite impressive , he never received any award from outside Saudi Arabia .
The infidel world did not pay serious attention to his discoveries , though there was much curiosity about this Muslim genius and many newspapers of western world published his ‘ flat , rigid , geocentric earth and rotation of sun ’ fataawa .
Ibn Baz died during 1999 .
The Mullahs allover the Islamic world must have used local mosques ’ loud speaker to inform Allah about the mighty arrival of Ibn Baz to paradise .
It is hoped that Ibn Baz did not have to wait much to get a rightful place in Islamic heaven .
This is the misfortune with many great geniuses .
Often geniuses are misunderstood at the beginning .
Sometimes they are laughed at and ridiculed or thought to be crazy .
The fact is that , geniuses are so advanced that the society of their day rejects their ideas .
It is the future generation , who confirm their status of genius .
As example , when Galileo challenged the existing cosmic map and geocentric earth theory , he was ordered imprisoned which was later commuted to house arrest by the Catholic Church ( During 1992 , Pope John Paul II expressed regret for how the Galileo affair was handled ) , when Sir Isaac Newton was inspired to formulate his theory of universal gravitation by the fall of an apple from a tree , he was ridiculed .
There were cartoons which suggested that the apple actually hit Newton 's head , and that impact and pain in fact sensitized him of the force of gravity ( no pain , no gain ! ) .
Similarly , when Ibn Baz condemned the ‘ heliocentric Copernican system ’ , the Egyptian journalists targated him mercilessly with mockery .
Another great philosophical genius was Socrates who was accused of corrupting the youth and interfering with the religion of the state and sentenced to death .
At least Ibn Baz did not have to die to defend his scientific discovery .
Darwin ’s evolution theory was also not accepted at the beginning by the academicians .
Einstein 's research paper on general relativity was not liked and thought to be wrong by most of the members of Royal Astronomical Society of England .
Similarly , the ‘ Motionless earth , Flat earth and Sun revolve around the earth ’ discoveries of Muslim genius Ibn Baz are not taken seriously yet .
It is just a matter of time .
That day is not far away , when the great discoveries of this Islamic scholar will be recognized by the whole world .
With the further advancement of science and technology , in the future , the infidels will agree that the earth is really motionless and flat , and the sun revolves around the earth .
This will prove that the scientific miracles of Koran and Ahadith are not laughable matter at all and on that day Islam will take over and rule the flat and motionless earth from one edge to another and the leftover Infidels will be thrown ‘ overboard ’ from the edge of the flat earth for not believing in Koran .
Muslims will offer their five time obligatory prayer on the flat and motionless earth and the sun will circle around Makkah ‘ round the clock ’ by Allah ’s divine instruction .
The death of this genius was a great loss not only to Saudi Arabia , but also for the whole Muslim world .
When this great scholar died , the loss of " his erudition and reputation for intransigence " was so great the Saudi government was said to have " found itself staring into a vacuum " unable to find a figure able to " fill bin Baaz 's shoes . " ( Kepel , 2004 ) .
‘ Arab News ’ reported ( 1999 ) that more than fifty thousand people came forward to carry his body to his burial ground at Makkah , while millions of Muslims performed funeral prayers .
King Fahd said that the Islamic world was shoked hearing the sad news ( Arab News , 1999 ) .
The news of his death was so unbearable that many Muslims must had been wallowing on the ground as if they were orphaned .
Many of them must have been soaking their long beards with endless teardrops .
The death of Ibn Baz is a great loss to the mankind as a whole .
In fact the whole world is still “ staring into a vacuum ” because a genius like Ibn Baz is very rare to find out .
He was an original genius of too high standard .
There is not another genius in ten million like him .
It is difficult to replace him .
Life is an ocean of grief and sorrow .
Modern fast lifestyle , work pressure , unhealthy competition , jealousy , political unrest ( intentionally , I did not mention the Islamic terrorism , because in this article I am glorifying a Muslim genius and it is a wrong place to talk about Islamic terrorism ) are increasing day by day and no way leveling off .
Everywhere , there are lifeless , sad , and long faces to see .
It looks like , slowly people are forgeting to smile .
This is the time when the whole world looks forward for the geniuses like Ibn Baz .
However , it is not late yet .
The present Islamic scholars should try to fill up the “ vacuum ” as early as possible and start digging up new scientific miracles from the Holy Koran and Holy Ahadith and put up the new findings in the form of many fataawa for the whole world to see .
There are enough scientific miracles in Holy Koran and Holy Ahadith which can amuse the infidels for next several decades , if not centuries .
This is the only way Muslim scholars can make a positive contribution to the mankind by bringing back the long lost smile on others face .

Did you hear the one about the shopkeeper who was slapped with a police ban on his jokes ?
When a policeman called at Bob Singh 's shop to offer him some advice on his jokes , he thought someone was having a laugh .
But the smile was wiped off his face when the officer told him there had been a complaint about the gags he prints on leaflets advertising his corner shop 's Christmas offers .
Even though the leaflets have amused customers for more than a decade , police said they could offend people and warned the shopkeeper that he could face prosecution for a public order offence .
Bob Singh feels he has been gagged
Now Mr Singh , 36 , has been forced to withdraw all his humorous leaflets advertising seasonal discounts at his Landmark store in Port Talbot , South Wales .
He said : ' I could n't believe my ears .
I thought they were joking - but they were deadly serious .
' This proves the world has gone completely crazy .
Why are the police getting involved in something like this ?
' The bizarre thing is that they would n't tell me which jokes were offensive , what was offensive or who had complained about them .
' There 's no bad language in them or racism although a couple are a bit saucy - but they are not offensive .
' We 've been doing this for years and I 've never had a problem until now .
I get the jokes off the internet . '
Mr Singh has now put a sign in the front window saying : ' We would like to apologise to anyone who may have been offended by the contents of our Christmas leaflet .
In future we will try to be more politically correct . '
Shop assistant Debbie Llewellyn said : ' It is political correctness gone mad .
It is incredible that somebody could be offended enough to go to the police about it . '
South Wales Police defended the officer 's actions , saying that he gave ' appropriate advice ' after a complaint from a member of the public who found the jokes offensive .
Sergeant Simon Merrick said : ' The content of promotional material has been brought to our attention as being potentially inflammatory and offensive .
' The distributor has been appropriately advised and instructed to withdraw the leaflets . '
Tory MP for Shipley Philip Davies , a patron of the Campaign Against Political Correctness , said : ' I just think it 's absolutely mindless that police are wasting time on this kind of stuff when there are so many violent offences being carried out in the country .
' The police officer would have been better off telling the person who complained to develop a better sense of humour rather than going to call on a shopkeeper .
' The jokes may not be very good , but that 's a long way from being a criminal offence . '
U.S. President Barack Obama will visit Canada on Feb. 19 in his first official trip abroad , the White House announced Wednesday .
No details of the trip , including what city he would visit , were announced , but CBC News has learned that his destination will be Ottawa .
Although Parliament will not be sitting that week , it may be recalled so Obama can address a joint sitting , CBC's Paul Hunter reported .
Former presidents Bill Clinton , Ronald Reagan , John F. Kennedy , Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman have addressed Parliament previously .
" This is a testament , not just to the size of our trading relationship and the closeness of our alliance , but also the strength of our friendship , " Prime Minister Stephen Harper told the House of Commons .
" I look forward to an important and productive working visit . "
Obama had already pledged his first official foreign trip would be to Canada but had not specified a date .
" Canada is a vitally important ally , " White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters .
" The president looks forward to the opportunity to speak with Prime Minister Harper and visit our neighbour to the north . "
The Obama administration also provided scant details about the visit , except to say that the flailing economy will be a top item of discussion .
" Without getting into what the bilateral agenda might be for that trip , it 's safe to say that the health of each economy and the health of the global economy will be a large part of that agenda , " Gibbs told the daily White House briefing .
" And I strongly anticipate , as was the case when the then president - elect met with the leader of Mexico , that trade will be part of that docket . "
Obama met with Mexican President Felipe Calderon earlier in January before taking office .
Former president George W. Bush made his first foreign visit to Mexico .
Last week , Harper spoke with Obama following his inauguration and congratulated him .
The Prime Minister 's Office said Harper and Obama discussed the economy , his trip to Canada , energy , environment and the war in Afghanistan .
A recent poll , conducted before Obama took the oath of office Jan. 20 , showed large support for the new president , with 81 per cent of Canadians holding a positive view of him .
David Biette , the director of the Canada Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars , told the Canadian Press he suspects Obama will likely forgo a lot of pomp and circumstance and concentrate on discussing common issues between the two countries , such as the economic crisis , trade , Afghanistan , energy and climate - change policy .
" I doubt very much he 'll be staying overnight , or that there will be a big ceremonial dinner or any of that sort of thing , " said Biette .
" The president will be in and out and simply want to get things done , " he said .
" Canada will see a very practical president , and it will pull a lot of Canadians out of the clouds .
There wo n't be a lot of ceremony ; he 'll be there intending to get down to business . "
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iranian voters said Monday that whoever wins June ’s presidential election must make fixing Iran ’s economy and halting relentless price rises a priority .
Former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami ( C ) looks on as he attends a ceremony by a group of reformist clerics in Tehran , February 8 , 2009 .
Khatami , who pushed for detente with the West when in office from 1997 to 2005 , said on Sunday he would run in Iran 's June presidential election .
REUTERS / Morteza Nikoubazl
That was their message a day after Mohammad Khatami , who pushed for detente with the West when president , said he would challenge Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , whose four years in office have seen Iran become more isolated over its disputed nuclear work .
“ For me it is the resolution of the economic problems that is of prime importance .
Whoever can solve these problems should gain power , ” said Mohsen Rasouli , a 41 - year - old taxi driver .
Western capitals , who say Iran wants atomic bombs despite Tehran ’s denials , will watch the vote closely , although the president can only influence rather than decide policy , which is ultimately determined by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
But many voters said they would not be guided by nuclear diplomacy or whether Iran should respond to an overture by U.S. President Barack Obama to try and end 30 years of hostility .
“ I will vote for ( Khatami ) without hesitation .
Just look at prices under Khatami .
Honestly , they were about one third of what they are now , ” said housewife Mehri Nasrollahzadeh , 54 .
Prices for food , fuel and other basics have risen sharply under Ahmadinejad , who critics say has spent windfall earnings when oil prices were high without saving enough for now , when they have tumbled .
Ahmadinejad ’s backers say he has spread wealth more fairly in the world ’s fourth largest oil exporter , as he pledged to do in 2005 when he was the surprise winner .
They say inflation , which hit 30 percent last year but is now falling , is a global issue and say Ahmadinejad has plans to deal with it .
“ A change in the country ’s management will lead to more chaos , ” said Reza Moghaddasi , a 36 - year - old civil servant .
ISOLATION
But some Iranians also worry about Iran ’s isolation .
The U.N. Security Council has slapped three rounds of sanctions on the Islamic Republic since 2006 because Iran has failed to allay suspicions that its nuclear plans are military not peaceful .
“ Although economy plays an important role in this election it is hard to say it will be the determining factor , ” said political analyst Ali Rashidi , adding some voters worried about their pockets , while others wanted broader reforms .
Khatami , a cleric who was president from 1997 to 2005 , came to power promising political and social change .
He presented a softer image of Iran to the West .
But hardliners who held and still hold key levers of power blocked most of his reforms .
Ahmadinejad , the first non-cleric president in more than a quarter of a century , won over many of the poor with a down - to- earth style and regularly berates Western “ hegemony . ”
Some Iranians say that ’s just the approach Iran needs .
“ He has the power and courage to bargain and haggle with the West .
We can even foresee a normalization of relations with America during his tenure , ” said builder Farshad Azari , 41 .
Obama has said he will extend a hand of peace if Iran “ unclenches its fist . ”
But the opening has come with a threat of tougher sanctions if Iran does not halt the part of its atomic work that most worries the West : uranium enrichment .
Some analysts say Washington may not make a more detailed offer before the June race .
Iran has dismissed U.S. demands and has set tough conditions for any dialogue , such as telling U.S. troops to quit bases in Iraq , Afghanistan and elsewhere .
Some analysts say this is also a bid partly to buy time until after the presidential election .
While other politicians have also thrown their hat into the ring , Ahmadinejad and Khatami have been the focus of attention .
Analysts say the result may depend on whether Ahmadinejad retains the support of the supreme leader , who has publicly praised him and whose words could sway millions of loyalists .
And , in a system where the president is not the most powerful figure , some wonder if Khatami can really deliver change when his previous efforts were so regularly compromised .
“ I hope this time around he will have enough power to fulfil his pledges , ” said 25 - year - old beautician Houriyeh Najafi .
Government safety investigators canceled a public briefing about an August 28 , 2008 explosion that killed two persons at a chemical plant in Institute , West Virginia after operators of the plant said that public discussion of the accident could jeopardize “ sensitive security information . ”
Bayer CropScience , which runs the plant , told the U.S. Chemical Safety Board that relevant information about the plant is protected from public disclosure under the terms of the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 , as interpreted by U.S. Coast Guard regulations .
The Board , which is an independent federal agency that investigates industrial accidents , canceled the March 19 public meeting while it seeks to evaluate the Bayer secrecy claims .
See “ Board Cancels Hearing Under Bayer Pressure ” by Ken Ward , Jr. , The Charleston Gazette , February 25 , 2009 .
On their face , the Bayer secrecy claims do not seem well - founded .
The Maritime Transportation Security Act ( pdf ) invoked by Bayer states ( at section 70103 ) that certain facility security information “ is not required to be disclosed to the public . ”
That apparently means its disclosure cannot be compelled under the Freedom of Information Act , but it does n’t say that disclosure of such information is prohibited .
Coast Guard regulations ( pdf ) implementing the Act state that the plant information could be “ sensitive security information , ” which is protected from public disclosure .
But compliance with those regulations is binding only on “ covered persons , ” a category that does not include the U.S. Chemical Safety Board .
So these provisions would appear to have little relevance to this case , and to impose no non-disclosure obligations on the Chemical Safety Board .
“ The whole purpose of these homeland security rules is supposed to be to increase public safety , not to reduce it , ” said one federal official who expressed skepticism regarding Bayer ’s reading of the secrecy requirements .
“ We deserve the right to know in a timely manner what is happening in our community that could have such major effects on our health and safety .
We also deserve the right to tell you our concerns and so inform the remainder of this investigation , ” wrote Maya Nye of People Concerned About MIC [ methyl isocyanate ] and a coalition of other citizens groups in a letter to the Board this week .
A decision on how the Chemical Safety Board will proceed in this case is pending .
Meanwhile , the Bayer CropScience plant was cited last week for multiple violations by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration .
See “ Bayer Plant Cited for 13 Serious Violations Including Safety Issues ” by Tony Rutherford , Huntington News , February 27 , 2009 .
I originally wrote the story below for the magazine Touch the Soil .
Not everybody who worries about food security and is interested in doing something about it has access to plenty of land or money to buy land and necessary equipment .
I was in this situation a few years ago and rather frustrated by it .
Perhaps this story will give others some ideas , and I should note that Touch the Soil is a great source of information about the food system and efforts to transform it at all levels .
I am the parent of two boys who attended Brookside Elementary School in the town of Willits , CA .
On the first day of school in August 2005 I wandered to the back of the school yard and noticed that a one acre grassy field was essentially unused behind preschool buildings on the grammar school campus .
From my knowledge of soils in the area I knew I was standing on a balanced loam , and within minutes decided it was an ideal site for a school farm specializing in vegetables and fruits .
A non-profit administering the adjacent Head Start preschool agreed to be the farm ’s fiscal agent , and a local master gardener agreed to help me make sound decisions .
I wrote a proposal to the school board for establishing Brookside Farm and the project was approved January 2006 .
The land was essentially free , but I had nothing else other than some ideas , a lot of friends , and interest in learning how to become a farmer .
Not wanting to go into financial debt or spend a lot of my own money to do this , I started raising funds within the community .
Local businesses helped with supplies .
Local service clubs and individuals gave money .
By December 2006 we had a very sturdy fence and cover crops sown .
An orchard , berries , and table grapes were planted that winter .
Following a CSA model , in early 2007 and 2008 we sold farm shares as our primary income .
This year two of the twelve shares were bought by the preschool , with the rest going to private households .
I have many reasons for wanting to farm , but for the school system I focused on the need to improve student health and education .
From my proposal to the district :
Educators are increasingly aware of how nutrition and physical activity influence the learning process .
Students fed a balanced diet of high quality foods are more likely to be able to pay attention , cause fewer disruptions to others , and be ready to learn .
Opportunities to develop sturdy bones , strong muscles , efficient hearts , balance and coordination also positively impact academic achievement .
The common sense wisdom comes down to this : a healthy body is better able to support the development of a good mind .
School board members worried that I could burn out and leave a mess on their property .
Until food is more highly valued , the risk of farm failure is real .
I argued that this project would garner widespread community support , and provide a tangible economic return in the form of food .
I believe a role exists for public institutions to add economic stability to local farms by seeing that they are valued not only for the food they produce , but for a variety of cultural , educational and environmental benefits .
The existence of a working farm gives school kitchens an incentive to incorporate fresher , healthier produce into their meals .
My long term goal is for the farm to be fully supported by the schools , but the process of incorporating more fresh produce into busy institutional kitchens takes time .
I regularly provided vegetables to the kitchens and asked what was most easily used .
Clearly by now the kitchen staff desire to serve Brookside Farm produce , but their ability to do so varies .
The smaller preschool kitchens have had no trouble including fresh veggies , whereas the elementary school cafeteria feels understaffed .
The school cafeteria prefers items that require little preparation time , such as cherry tomatoes , while the preschool will use anything grown .
Students thoroughly enjoy visiting the farm .
To improve their experience , I am working with the school ’s garden - educator and a high school art class to produce a trail system with signage along the route .
Signs will connect the activities and parts of the farm to basic curricula standards , e.g. , concepts of numbers and distance ingrained by trail lengths ; cardinal directions relative to the position of the sun in the sky ; basic plant morphology and seasonal life cycle diagrammed , etc .
A local foundation is funding a “ Kid ’s Garden ” within the farm that will be managed by the garden - educator .
Beds and tools will be tailored to their body size , and creative use of plantings can tie into specific learning goals .
Here ’s how I explained the educational value to the district :
Directly related to education is the fact that children are very tactile beings who learn faster and retain knowledge better when they are physically and emotionally engaged in the subject … a school farm provides a dynamic , living laboratory of objects and processes that lend purpose to the abstractions of the classroom .
As a biologist I am naturally drawn towards working with soil , plants and associated critters , but I became personally interested in farming through my understanding of the converging crises of resource depletion , pollution , and economic instability .
Brookside Farm is also a demonstration project for methods of food production , preservation and distribution that do n’t rely on fossil fuels , do n’t pollute , and do n’t damage soil health .
This mission attracted the partnership of Post Carbon Institute , which supported the farm ’s development by hiring my co-worker for nearly two years , Chris Hansen .
It is not a lonely farm , disconnected from the people it serves by distance and commodity markets , but a social hub .
Students , parents , teachers , CSA members , worker volunteers , college classes , neighbors and food activists visit regularly .
Harvest day is Tuesday , and in the afternoon farm members arrive for their produce baskets .
At the same time , Brookside Farm serves as a distribution point for other CSAs selling meat , eggs , milk , cheese , grains , herbs , and olive oil from other farms in the county .
Tuesday evening is a regular potluck at the farm .
Wednesday mornings will often find my friend Sara slicing produce to fill the solar food dryers .
I can expect Austin , a 17 - year old independent study student , to show up once or twice a week in the mornings .
Because it servers so many functions and is still relatively new , Brookside Farm keeps growing .
This year we installed an irrigation system .
I placed four bee hives on site .
Our perennial plants , such as culinary and medicinal herbs , are growing and need maintenance .
A photovoltaic electric system is being erected .
And we now have two vermiculture bins for composting food scraps from downtown organic restaurants .
Not having grown up on a farm , all these projects teach me new hands - on skills .
I am looking forward to constructing an equipment shed and a greenhouse as time and resources allow .
The substitution of fossil fuels for labor in agriculture has created an abundance of cheap food and a dearth of farmers .
Part of my struggle at Brookside Farm is employing more labor intensive , but ultimately more sustainable , practices while still keeping the food in line with price expectations .
So far this has meant that CSA share sales are less than the cost of production , with the difference made up by grants , donations , and a lot of volunteer labor .
With the new photovoltaic system I will begin using more time saving tools that can run on renewably generated electricity , but many of these are capital intensive .
As a new farmer of course I have learned a great deal about the predilections of various crops and their pests .
But what interests me more to consider is how my character has changed .
As a farmer I am viscerally aware of my dependence upon forces beyond my control and at great scale .
I now face the world with greater humility .
When I plant a seed or a tree , I know that it will take time to bear fruit and this imbues me with greater patience .
My body is required to get up and work day after day , and because I have a responsibility towards the farm I must maintain my health .
Therefore , I have learned to work at a pace that is steady and earnest , not quick and exhausting .
And although each winter I make plans about how the season will unfold and what my schedule will be , no year is average and I have learned to deviate from my path when appropriate , knowing that survival requires adaptation to reality .
These lessons are as good as anything I learned while still in school .
Final Note :
This article was written a few month ago .
I am now selling shares and planning for the 2009 planting season .
Worries include the potentially severe drought in California , opportunities include installation of a 14,000 gal water tank to collect rainwater from adjacent buildings .
From June through September last summer the farm used 25,000 gallons of water .
A big change this year is that the Farm Manager ( that would be me ) is getting paid .
The tragic scene in Portrush on Sunday after Ryan Quinn , was killed by a train on Friday night the line is still closed .
Ivan Quinn leaves the medal he would never have won without his son ’s encouragement at the spot where Ryan was killed last Friday
The grief - stricken father of murdered teenager Ryan Quinn has said he will always be haunted by his son ’s final words just moments before he was struck by a train .
Ivan Quinn was the last person to speak to his son on the phone before the train struck him , killing him instantly .
An emotional Mr Quinn also spoke for the first time of how he said goodbye to his 14 - year - old son with a kiss on his forehead as he lay dead on the tracks .
“ I was the last person to talk to Ryan when it happened .
He was talking to me from his mobile phone .
I ’ll be haunted by that conversation .
I ’m very distraught .
I have a lot of things to deal with in my own head .
I was the only one that got a chance to kiss his forehead at the scene , ” he said .
Mr Quinn described Ryan as his inspiration and said the family has been left distraught by his death .
“ We are all totally devastated and are just trying to pull together as best we can .
Ryan was one of the most bubbly wee lads I ever knew .
He was my inspiration .
He was smart and intelligent and was doing well at school .
He had everything to live for .
He was very close to his sister , they grew up together .
She is devastated . ”
Ryan was killed as he tried to flee from a gang in Portrush on Friday night .
Police believe he had been assaulted at McLaughlin ’s bar earlier in the evening and had been trying to escape his attackers across a field when he became trapped in a railway sleeper on the railway line between Portrush and Coleraine .
Unable to free himself he made a desperate phone call to his father who arrived on the scene minutes after his son was killed .
It is understood that while the train driver saw Ryan he was unable to stop the train before he hit him .
Mr Quinn said he is struggling to get through each day without his son .
“ It is unbelievable .
This is the worst nightmare you can imagine .
That last conversation will stay with me .
I am finding this very difficult .
I really feel for his mother and my daughter at the minute .
“ I am trying to be strong for them .
“ His friends have been wee stars , every one of them .
They have been giving his sister so much support .

Have you ever looked up to someone or admired something about another person that really inspired you ?
Well , there are certain qualities about a person ’s character that enable them to inspire others , and there are steps you can take to awaken these same qualities in yourself .
Here ’s how :
Stick With What You Love
Inspiring others is n’t easy .
The success rate of those who attempt to inspire is incredibly low when the measurement of success is based on the percentage inspired as opposed to the actual number inspired .
Huge motivational seminars with thousands of attendees typically make a real lasting impact in only a few people ’s lives .
If you look at those same odds for yourself , you might easily be discouraged if you hope to inspire others by doing something you do n’t truly love to do .
If , however , you do love something dearly , you wo n’t care how successful you are at inspiring others and you will continue to persevere ( on many levels ) no matter how many times you fail .
When people doubt you , and when people laugh at your failures , you will continue to do what you love because you love it .
So having that depth , that love and passion for something , will protect you from all potential failures .
Will you make the most of failures and continue to drive your passions ?
Will you inspire others even when you do n’t succeed at first ?
What do you love ?
Think Big and Noble
Once you establish a foundation for which you have great passion , start thinking big .
How many people could you potentially inspire based on your niche of expertise ?
Are there ways you can expand your impact ?
Do n’t look to inspire one person , look to inspire hundreds !
Remember , this goes back to the low success rate percentages , as you will likely not succeed with working to inspire at a very small level .
You need to think big and have many people available to inspire .
Fifty people out of a thousand is only five percent , but it ’s still fifty people .
Share your ideas with as many people as possible and allow them grow your influence beyond your initial ideas for inspiration .
Thinking big is not only about inspiring more people , but also about the impact you have on each person .
Do n’t settle on making minor changes in a person ’s life if they need a total makeover .
Instead , aim to change everything .
Look to inspire in many areas instead of just one .
Think big about the positive impact you might have and this will give you a much better chance of leaving some kind of impression .
If you promote a hundred ways for someone to change or heal and they take on just one , you have still helped them !
Another useful way to inspire others is to support an established noble cause or practice , such as saving the environment or feeding the poor .
It ’s much easier to gain attention , followers , and support for noble causes than it is for individual gain or what some might think are more selfish reasons .
An offer to change something that has a positive impact on the global society is far more attractive to onlookers than some short lived , localized venture .
So keep those areas of influence as big as possible !
Be Expressive
Passion is something you must have and be willing to express it if you really want to inspire others .
You can gain a lot of influence just by publically expressing that you are excited and passionate about a topic .
You make it much harder to inspire others if you are boring an unenthusiastic .
Expressive passion is contagious because of the curiosity it stirs in others .
You ’ll get people wondering why you love what you love so much .
Naturally , some of them will take the time necessary to understand what it is about the topic that moves you .
Practice What You Preach
You need to remain actively involved in the field in which you intend to inspire others .
It ’s the age old saying of “ practice what you preach , ” and it holds true for anyone trying to inspire others .
Ultimately , if you really want to inspire others to do something then this ‘ something ’ should be a big part of your life .
You do n’t necessarily need to be an expert at it , but you do need to be passionately involved .
Keep an Open Door
You must always maintain an open invitation to everyone you encounter .
Personally welcome others , and listen to their needs .
Once you are involved with them , keep it personal and always maintain a healthy line of communication .
Offer a Guiding Hand
The best part of inspiring others is to have interest in not only what you do , but to also recognize your followers and have an opportunity to see them grow and change as well .
Offer to share your personal stories , teach them things you ’ve learned along the way , talk about your failures and achievements , and ask them questions about their own progress .
Help them avoid the mistakes you ’ve made in the past , and always maintain a positive outlook on their forward progress .
Be Consistent
Consistency in actions , information , and moral standards is also extremely important .
If you constantly change your methods , your interests , and the field in which you hope to inspire others , you will have little success .
People want to see and associate your ideas with a reliable plan that they can follow .
You need to demonstrate this consistency through your actions , but you can also compliment your actions with inspirational story telling .
Story telling allows you to reproduce important past experiences as a means to guide and inspire others .
Make sure use stories that embrace the consistency of your actions .
Stay Positive
The process of inspiring others comes with no shortage challenges and negative naysayers .
To get past this , you must stay positive , work past failures , and present optimism openly to others no matter what the circumstances are .
Doubt is a very contagious disease , and if you show any of it , you can easily destroy any positive influence you might have instilled in a person .
And there you have it :
My thoughts on how to inspire others .
I ’d love to hear your feedback , thoughts and comments on the subject .
Which of these points have the biggest impact to you ?
Have I left something out ?
Do you have any personal experiences or inspirational stories to share ?

A coalition of health advocates , looking to seize the momentum of a new administration , will meet with members of President - elect Barack Obama 's transition team next week in Washington , D.C. , to push for a ban on bisphenol A .
The fact that Obama 's team is willing to meet now - with all the other pressures facing the incoming administration - sends a strong signal that the president - elect is open to making environmental health issues a higher priority than the Bush administration .
A meeting has been set , but participants are sketchy on details of who will be there because they say they do not want to call it to the attention of chemical manufacturers .
Chemical - makers have lobbied fiercely for years against any ban on the controversial chemical used to make baby bottles and thousands of other household products .
The government has sent mixed signals on the safety of bisphenol A or BPA .
Different agencies under the Bush administration have reached different conclusions about the risks .
As a result , there has been no uniform policy on the chemical .
With influential members of Congress calling for a ban on BPA , health advocates say they are optimistic .
" I believe this will be banned , " said Janet Nudelman , director of program and policy for the Breast Cancer Fund , an advocacy group aimed at preventing the disease , who plans to be at the meeting .
BPA has been linked to heart disease and diabetes in humans and has been found to interfere with chemotherapy for breast cancer patients .
Animal studies have linked it to prostate and breast cancer , obesity , reproductive failures and behavioral problems , even at extremely low doses .
The meeting next week will deal with a host of environmental topics , but a key element will be a push to outlaw BPA .
" BPA has emerged as the newest and most frightening of toxic chemicals and that needs to be addressed urgently , " Nudelman said .
Shortly after Obama was elected last month , a group of environmental health advocates representing 36 organizations sent a letter to his transition team decrying the influence of chemical - makers .
" Recent reports about industry influence and possible interference with our chemical regulatory policy on chemicals at the FDA , EPA and other agencies threaten the confidence of all consumers about American products , and about our government 's role in protecting health , " the letter said .
" As we are sure you know , storms of controversy over chemicals in everything from shower curtains and lipstick , to baby bottles , infant formula , canned food , cars , toys and even pet food have increasingly unnerved parents and anyone concerned about public health . "
The Journal Sentinel reported earlier this year that the American Chemistry Council , which represents chemical - makers , helped write significant portions of the Food and Drug Administration 's draft declaring BPA to be safe .
An FDA subcommittee later ruled that the FDA had ignored dozens of valid studies that found BPA to be harmful , and it recommended that the agency reconsider its ruling .
The group is asking for Obama to move quickly .
" Though its effects may not be as obvious , the deregulation of the chemical industry has hurt the United States just as much as the deregulation of Wall Street , with effects likely to last generations , " the group wrote .
" Scientists , physicians , health advocates , worker organizations , parent groups , health - affected groups and many others view fundamental reform to current chemical laws as urgent and necessary to protect children , workers , communities , and the environment now and in the future . "
Bills in both the House and Senate will be re-introduced shortly after a new Congress is inaugurated next month .
The House bill calls for a total ban on BPA in food and beverage packaging .
The Senate bill limits the ban to products for children .
Even though neither bill has been formally introduced , the principal authors have already signed up more than 20 co-sponsors in Congress .
Canada has declared BPA to be toxic and is moving to ban it in baby bottles , the lining of infant formula containers and all children 's tableware .
The meeting next week comes at the same time that several agencies are gathering for a summit to brainstorm ways to help consumers move away from dependence on BPA .
The chemical is used to make dental sealants , eye glasses , DVDs , computer screens , bike helmets and medical equipment .
It is released when heated , and mimics estrogen .
Last month , the Journal Sentinel tested 10 food containers for the presence of BPA .
All 10 items were found to be leaching toxic levels of the chemical when heated , even products marked " microwave safe . "
Chemical - makers say BPA is safe .
But a growing legion of scientists has expressed concern .
Manufacturers have begun to remove BPA from their products as consumers steer clear of the chemical .
" That 's the tipping point , " Nudelman said .
" Retailers know they wo n't win arguments with parents .
They 'll shop someplace else . "
Democrats and Republicans Oppose Liberty
James Joyner · · 17 comments
Tyler Cowen passes along a “ study ” by Daniel Klein and Jason Briggeman which “ finds ” that conservative magazines are anti-liberty :
Conservatives say they are for small government and individual liberty , but a content analysis of leading conservative magazines shows that most have preponderantly failed to take pro-liberty positions on sex , gambling , and drugs .
Besides many anti-liberty commissions , the magazines may be criticized for anti-liberty omission — that is , failing to oppose anti-liberty policies .
Magazines investigated include National Review , The Weekly Standard , The American Enterprise , and The American Spectator .
We find that National Review has had the strongest record on liberty on the issues treated , while the others have preponderantly failed to be pro-liberty or have even been anti-liberty .
Matt Yglesias piles on :
On the other hand , conservative do take the freedom of business enterprises to have a negative impact on the quality of the air you breath , the quality of the water you drink , and the stability of the climate you live in very seriously .
They ’re also pretty keen on the freedom of employers to discriminate on the basis of race , gender , religion , and sexual orientation .
These are important freedoms to many Americans .
Meanwhile , of course , liberal magazines like The American Prospect , Washington Monthly , and Mother Jones are all about teh freedom .
Unless we ’re talking about , say , gun ownership , private property rights , school choice , free expression on radio , and a host of other issues where the left is anti-progress and anti-liberty .
Of course , neither conservatives nor liberals would couch their policy preferences in terms of limiting freedom but rather in terms of protecting some higher value .
But if your solution to a problem is “ There Oughta Be a Law , ” then you ’re against liberty in that instance almost by definition .

Money is 'a medium of exchange , a unit of account , and a store of value . '
However , absent from the view of Monetarists and Keynesians ( and the ' money ' Wikipedia page ) , is an additional role for money , a role that 's given an important place by Austrian Business Cycle Theory .
Money should be a measure of the aggregate of society 's savings - - its future capacity for growth .
Unless someone tries to force it to tell lies , money , in its interaction with other goods , gives both the society as a whole and individual entrepreneurs a measure of the society 's ability to take on new projects ( or not ) .
There 's a good reason why Monetarists / Keynesians wo n't consider this .
A money that measures would n't support their fantasies of what ' monetary policy ' is expected to accomplish .
To them , money needs to be a vehicle that government can manipulate to ' stimulate ' economic activity and create ' optimism . '
Repeat that last sentence out loud once , and for most of us that 's enough to appreciate the fundamental dishonesty of the concept .
Still we could throw that out , stipulate to the erroneous ' greater good , ' and simply look at the effects after decades of manipulated money , credit and financial opinion -- the ' greater good ' is itself in ruins .
The criminality ( the Madoffs et al ) is a red herring -- only a fraction of the waste from a process that was natural and inevitable under artificial credit creation .
The Federal Reserve and the government got exactly what they asked for ' if more and more credit is created , with more and more ' stimulus ' and ' optimism ' to get us all moving and spending , could there be any doubt that the average modern society will have no shortage of people willing to get ' creative ' in order to soak this up ?
The exact path of the creativity is difficult to know in advance , but nothing will stop a party like that , other than the eventual clear vision by a critical mass of economic actors of the scary , unsustainable wasting of our limited resources .
Since it 's the normal and predictable side effects of fiat money credit creation -- not spontaneous greed , random mistakes , or insufficient ' stimulus ' -- that is the primary cause of these bubbly , wasteful financial disasters , what form of money could stop the cycle ?
A gold standard ranks well on measurability -- just flop it onto a scale and there it is -- a measure .
And Monetarists generally do n't like gold , which you 'd think would be a perfect recommendation .
However , while many Monetarists have used a need for monetary expansion as an excuse to be profligate morons , there 's a little kernel of real world worry at the twisted heart of the issue .
A gold monetary standard has an eventual problem : once the standard is generally established , the modern trend would n't take more than a century or two before there 's a strain to find new sources of money , a strain that would continue ratcheting up until loans at interest become impossible .
Someday , there would be ' peak gold . '
It 's a distant flea of a problem compared to the immediate brontosaurus that Monetarists saddle us with daily .
However , a few centuries can pass surprisingly quickly ( especially for the unborn , who have very little concept of time ) .
So we 're looking for a money that is non-static , but nevertheless a real measure of a society 's ability to create new goals and move forward , or conversely , would appropriately stall us out when we 're not ready .
We need a limitless limitation .
A few thousand years ago , a food - backed currency -- stored food , if absent the problem of spoilage - - would have taken a good rough reckoning of a society 's future capacity .
Today we need to be able to do a lot more than eat in order to accomplish our work .
But I 'd suggest that energy would be a good measure for today 's economies , since we need it in pretty much anything we do .
If we have sufficient energy stored to take on a project ' it 's as safe as it can estimably be to take it on .
If not , then we know we'd get stuck with a half finished project and the waste and risk associated with that 'we would have to wait .
( The way we needed to wait on ' improving housing affordability . ')
We can also theorize that the payment of interest will never be a problem with an energy monetary unit .
Until we 're capable of building a ' Dyson Sphere " enclosing the solar system , we wo n't run out of energy potential ( and who knows , even that might be a pit stop on the way to the stars ? ) .
Is it a little odd to propose that we literally have money to burn ?
Comparatively , no , it 's not .
How much stranger that for money we 've chosen an unmeasurable paper standard .
We measure anything and everything .
People have even tried to figure out if a human soul has weight , but for money , of all things , we 'd rather pretend ?
The one thing that we think we do n't need to measure is our savings versus our consumption -- our stored capacity to use resources -- our future on earth ?
( If I did n't know how inherently trustworthy government is , I 'd suspect we were being manipulated or something . )
A currency that can be spent literally , or saved literally , is a chance to stop pretending that savings , or lack thereof , has nothing to do with our future .
A chance to uninduce the self - induced march of the bubbles .
Let 's go back to optimism for a moment .
As you can perhaps tell already , I 'm not entirely a fan .
President Obama has ' The Audacity of Hope , ' but the implied rarity of hope in the political sphere is a little disingenuous .
The value of ' optimism ' is unquestioned in politics , especially if it 's yours .
You can pretty much imagine any president saying when criticized something like : ' Look , any plan will be criticized , but I believe in optimism -- you can't always listen to the naysayers . '
( Maybe there 's a reason there 's always naysayers -- maybe all the plans have sucked ?
We are , after all , where we are , and did n't get here overnight .
Every presidential plan is a central plan , with a clear theoretical basis for sucking . )
Optimism is n't just the universal political habit of mind , but the most common in general .
Perhaps optimism deserves some of its boosterous reputation , but in the end as a mass state of mind , it can turn very quickly into an excuse for lazy thinking .
Money and economics in particular have been heuristically much too glib , and not to be too dramatic , it 's conceivable we could pay for it with our lives .
It is n't only that we 've managed to stupidly fool ourselves into underestimating the savings we need for our own not much more than day to day living , and then , what 's needed to have a future equal to or better than the past .
It 's not just that we 've decided , out of nothing , that doing nothing is not an option , while spending trillions of dollars is a must .
( Mandatory trillions spent on something somewhere - - we ' know ' it must be spent , but how , where , what -- that we do n't know . )
To me there 's still much more , as long as we 're throwing our fiat currency habitual non-measurement of resources into the mix .
We also appear to be underestimating by many orders of magnitude the level of saving that we need to give us a near certainty of sustaining a human civilization indefinitely .
We 've added a lot of dependencies in our modern system that have n't even been tested by an historical sized natural disaster ' a San Francisco earthquake , or a Krakatoa .
What about something many orders of magnitude bigger , which might have a very high probability over a period of a thousand years or so -- the natural disasters that we know have happened in early or pre-history ?
( If a thousand years seems like a long time , consider that that still gets a double digit percent chance that it would occur in the lifetime of yourself , your child , or your grandchild . )
These , along with potential manmade disasters ( where perhaps rightly , many people would place even more emphasis ) , put us on the footing of 'it 's a matter of when , not if , ' a place that I 'd contend we would n't be if we had a hundred or so times our current savings .
( Say for example that most countries had started work on an energy currency system 50 years ago , had because of this perhaps developed more advanced energy accumulators , and now had the above type magnitude of real savings in energy .
Say further that tomorrow someone is able to prove that pollution - caused global warming is real , with a best model estimate 90 % certainty of ending modern civilization .
With that evidence , and those usable savings , then these countries would have potential to mothball most industry for a decade or more , working instead entirely on changing that outcome , rather than just waiting for a civilization - ending catastrophe . )
A long , long time ago ( in the title ) , I mentioned ' carbon ' in the monetary unit .
Now , I 'll carefully disappoint half the readers who were waiting for the good stuff , while providing ( temporary ) relief to the other half , who had probably been saying , ' Carbon ?
Is this idiot one of those ' cap and traders ' ?

Not only did they forcibly strip search but they left her naked in her cell for hours .
All because she accidentally handed the wrong id to the cops - it was her dead sister 's license she carried as a memento .

Baloney .
No one should or does carry a dead sister 's driver 's license as a " memento , " handing it to police who ask for identification .

Reason # 527 as to why the BS flag should be banned .
Steve Jobs ' latest health statement is contradictory and makes little sense , according to an expert who says it could mean Jobs has anything from hyperthyroidism to a new form of cancer .
There are three medical threads running through the statement , said Robert Lustig , a prominent neuroendocrinologist at the University of California , San Francisco — and they " do n't add up to a very strong cable . "
On Monday morning , shortly before MacWorld 2009 — which , until he canceled , was scheduled to feature Jobs as keynote speaker — opened in San Francisco , the Apple CEO released an official statement about the ongoing weight loss that has left him gaunt and panicked his company 's investors .
" Doctors think they have found the cause — a hormone imbalance that has been ' robbing ' me of the proteins my body needs to be healthy .
Sophisticated blood tests have confirmed this diagnosis , " he wrote .
" The remedy for this nutritional problem is relatively simple and straightforward , and I 've already started treatment . "
His words set off an avalanche of speculation , ranging from knee - jerk skepticism — " ' Hormone imbalance ' ?
Please .
Sorry , not buying it " — to thoughtful analyses of his 2004 pancreatic tumor removal or possible thyroid disorders .
Common to all , however , is a paucity of meaningful detail .
" His email is specifically vague , and I 'm sure it 's meant to be , " Lustig said .
" He does n't want us to know what 's going on . "
The first thread , said Lustig , is the hormone imbalance , suggesting an endocrine problem .
Second is Jobs ' loss of protein .
He does n't attribute this to loss by urination , which would suggest a plasma - cell cancer called multiple myeloma , or loss by defecation , which would implicate his pancreatic cancer history .
If Jobs ' weight loss were related to the latter , Lustig said , he would likely display other symptoms , including severe flushing and massive diarrhea , which have not yet been described .
The third thread is the " straightforward " remedy for his
" nutritional problem . "
According to Lustig , that conflicts with the rest of Jobs ' statement .
" Endocrine problems are not nutritional , and vice versa , " he said .
" Hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss .
Endocrine deficiency could cause weight loss .
But they do n't rob your body of proteins , and the remedies are n't nutritional . "
Neither would nutrition suffice to treat cancer .
" There 's no way to put these threads together , " said Lustig , though he refused to rule out a cancer - related complication .
" It 's not possible to dismiss anything in terms of this , " he said , and called speculation " very silly . "
Dong Chan and Monica Skarulis , endocrinologists at the National
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases , agreed with
Lustig 's assessment of Jobs ' statement as insufficiently detailed to merit speculation .
" I have no knowledge of his condition , " said Chan , " and will not comment . "
Asked whether armchair diagnoses are reasonable or productive , Skarulis replied , " Unfortunately , no .
There are so many processes that lead to the final common pathway of weight loss , and the metabolic processes ( hormonal and otherwise ) that lead to [ nutrient breakdown ] are complicated .
Need more data ! "

Uproar as football fans are told to be quiet during matches
Gagged : Andrew Leigh belongs to the lively section of fans targeted in the letter
Football fans are furious after their club told them to keep quiet during matches .
Middlesbrough supporters were told they could cheer when their team scored - but must keep the noise down at all other times .
With Middlesbrough struggling against relegation - and just one goal scored in the last nine games - the club 's edict could make for a very quiet stadium .
Fans in one corner of the club 's stadium were asked to stop the ' constant banging and noise ' following complaints from other home fans .
A letter handed out before Saturday 's match warned : ' Make as much noise as you like when we score .
But this constant noise is driving fans mad . '
Fans in block 53A were so angry that many protested by turning their backs on the game against Wigan Athletic .
Now they are calling for the resignation of the club 's safety manager Sue Watson , who wrote the letter .
It was aimed at a group of fans called Red Faction who have congregated in the Riverside stadium 's south - east corner in order to create a singing area .
Complaints had been received by other fans in the same block about ' persistent standing and the constant banging and noise coming from the back of this stand ' , the letter said .
Red Faction member Andrew Leigh , 46 , from Middlesbrough , said : ' Are they going to give us prompt cards to tell us when we can sing and when we can 't ?
This is a working class sport and a passionate sport . '
Quiet , please : Middlesbrough fans look on as David Wheater , right , battles Wigan Athletic 's Amr Zaki during Saturday 's home match
Fellow fan Stephen Fenwick , 45 , has sat in the block for years and says the Red Faction 's decision to move there has rejuvenated the atmosphere .
He said : ' It 's made the games so much more enjoyable - they are just trying to give the game a bit of life . '
Hush : Middlesbrough FC 's safety officer Sue Watson wrote the letter
Former Middlesbrough player Bernie Slaven was incredulous when he was first handed a copy of the letter at the ground .
He said : ' I thought it was joke .
Do they want the place to be like a morgue ? '
Former referee Jeff Winter said more applause , not less , would help the team .
' For fans who do n't like noise on sat afternoon I suggest they go down the library , ' he added .
The club today apologised to fans upset by the letter .
A Middlesbrough FC spokesman said : ' The fans ' backing is absolutely essential and we would never discourage passionate support .
' The letter was designed to ask those fans new to block 53A to continue to back the team with passionate and noise but do have respect for fellow fans too .
' However , we totally accept that the letter was not well worded and understand the strength of feeling on this issue . '
In today ’s world , everyone downloads and buys music from the internet , making physical record albums obsolete , which is very sad news for Paul Mawhinney .
Paul has the world ’s largest record collection that he has been accumulated throughout his lifetime .
He used to run a record store , and he would always put away the last copy of an album for himself .
Due to his declining health and old age , Paul has decided to put the collection on sale for a mere $ 3 million when it was appraised at a whooping $ 50 million , yet no one has given a solid offer .
Regardless of our technological advances , sometimes holding an album in your hands just feels a little bit different .
1. Introduction
RDFa is a family of attributes intended for the embedding of RDF data in XML markup [ RDFA ] .
Its best known application is XHTML +RDFa — a format for embedding RDF data in XHTML documents — but RDFa can be incorporated into any XML - based or DOM - like file format .
Indeed , the recent SVG Tiny 1.2 recommendation includes RDFa [ SVGTINY12 ] .
One limitation of RDFa is that it is only capable of embedding a single RDF graph per document .
As this limitation is shared by RDF / XML [ RDFXML ] , N - Triples [ NTRIPLES ] and Turtle [ TURTLE ] , most people would not class it as a weakness of RDFa .
However , a number of formats catering for multiple graphs do exist : Notation 3 [ N3 ] , TriX [ TRIX ] , TriG [ TRIG ] and N - Quads [ NQUADS ] all include support for multiple graphs , allowing each graph to be identified with a URI , and thus be referred to by other graphs .
In the SPARQL Query Language for RDF [ SPARQL ] , graph names are used to construct the default graph to query and also to restrict the query to certain named graphs .
Another use case for multiple graphs is describing assertions .
A particular collection of RDF triples is bundled up as a graph and called an an assertion .
We can then use another graph to describe that assertion — who asserted it ?
When ?
Has it been verified by an independent resource ?
Graphs can also be used to model information that has changed over time .
For example one graph might say that Ethelred the Unready is ruler of England ; another might say that Elizabeth II is ruler of England .
We could then use a third graph to note that the first graph was true in AD 1009 , whereas the second is true in AD 2009 .
This document investigates one possible method for marking up multiple graphs in RDFa .
It does require some small changes to the RDFa parser to implement , but is backwards - compatible with parsers that do not support multiple graphs .
2. Design Decisions
All graphs generated are subsets of the default RDFa graph .
This was a very important decision and is a core feature of the techniques outlined in this document .
Processing RDFa using these techniques yields the same information as the standard RDFa algorithm : it just divides it into different " pots " .
Each pot is a " subgraph " .
The RDFa graph generated by graph - unaware processors is the union of all the subgraphs .
There is no information that can be gleaned from the standard RDFa algorithm that cannot be gleaned from the subgraphs .
There are no triples generated by the standard RDFa algorithm that do not slot into one of the subgraphs .
The intersection of the subgraphs is nil .
Each triple generated by the processing algorithm is placed in exactly one subgraph .
( Of course , if the same triple is expressed twice on a page , then it may be placed into a different subgraph each time . )
3. Markup for Graphs
The attribute to use for marking up different subgraphs is graph in the same namespace as other RDFa attributes .
By default RDFa attributes are not in any namespace , so neither is graph .
Although the value space of this attribute is the set of URIs and blank nodes , graph has a lexical space identical to about .
Therefore , if the base URI of the document is http://example.com/document then the attribute graph= " foo " represents the URI http://example.com/foo .
This allows any absolute or relative URI to be used as a named graph .
Safe CURIEs and blank nodes are allowed .
When the graph attribute has been set on an element , all triples found on that element and its descendants are taken to be part of the subgraph specified .
The following is an example XHTML document using multiple graphs :
< html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xmlns:foaf = " http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ " xmlns:dc= " http://purl.org/dc/terms/ " xmlns:mind = " http://example.com/mind# " > < head > < title > Example of Named Graphs in RDFa </ title > </ head > < body > < p about = " _: gavin " typeof = " foaf : Person " > < span property =" foaf : name " >
Gavin</ span > < span rel= " mind : thinks " resource= " #gavins_thoughts " > thinks that </ span > < span typeof = " foaf : Document " graph= " #gavins_thoughts " > < i property = " dc:title " > Moby Dick < /i > was written by < span property = " dc:creator " >
Herman Melville </ span > </ span > </ p> < p about= " _:smithy " typeof = " foaf : Person " > < span property =" foaf : name " > Smithy < / span > < span rel= " mind : thinks " resource= " #smithys_thoughts " > thinks that </ span > < span typeof = " foaf : Document " graph= " #smithys_thoughts " > < i property = " dc:title " > Moby Dick < /i > was written by < span property = " dc:creator " >
Melville Herman</ span > </ span > </ p> </ body > </html >
The information above can be represented in Notation 3 [ N3 ] as :
@prefix foaf : < http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> . @prefix dc : < http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix mind : < http://example.com/mind#> .
_:graph0 = { _:gavin a foaf : Person ; foaf : name " Gavin " ; mind : thinks <# gavins_thoughts > .
_: smithy a foaf : Person ; foaf : name " Smithy " ; mind : thinks <# smithys_thoughts > . } . <# gavins_thoughts > = { _:node1 a foaf : Document ; dc:title " Moby Dick " ; dc:creator " Herman Melville " . } . <# smithys_thoughts > = { _:node2 a foaf : Document ; dc:title " Moby Dick " ; dc:creator " Melville Herman " . } .
3.1 . Triples on Multiple Elements
In RDFa , many triples are generated from attributes split across multiple elements .
A slightly contrived example :
< div > < div about= " #joe " > < div > < div rel= " foaf:homepage " rev=" foaf : primaryTopic " xmlns : foaf = " http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ " > < p > < a href = " http://joe.example.com/ "
>http://joe.example.com/</a>
</ p> </div> </div> </div> </div >
When subgraphs are specified , it may seem unclear as to which graph the triples should be added .
< div graph= " #g1 " > < div graph= " # g2 " about = " #joe " > < div graph= " #g3 " > < div graph= " # g4 " rel= " foaf:homepage " rev=" foaf : primaryTopic " xmlns : foaf = " http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ " > < p graph= " #g5 " > < a graph= " # g6 " href = " http://joe.example.com/ "
>http://joe.example.com/</a>
</ p> </div> </div> </div> </div >
The rule is that a triple is added to the graph of the element which set the predicate of the triple .
So , in the previous example , the following Notation 3 is generated .
@prefix foaf : < http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> . <# g1 > = {} . <# g2 > = {} . <# g3 > = {} . <# g4 > = { < # joe > foaf : homepage < http://joe.example.com/> . < http://joe.example.com/> foaf : primaryTopic < # joe > . } . <# g5 > = {} . <# g6 > = {} .
4. Processing Graphs
The standard RDFa processing sequence [ RDFA ] requires only minor modifications to allow for multiple graphs .
The modifications required are as follows :
The initial context created should have a variable called [ graph ] .
The initial value for this is a newly created blank node .
After stage 5 in the sequence , but before stage 6 , the [ current element ] should be checked to see if there is a graph attribute .
If there is , then the attribute 's value should be converted to a URI depending on how the lexical space of the attribute is defined , and the [ graph ] variable should be set to that URI .
Any triple created in stages 8 , 9 or 11 is considered to be in the graph specified by [ graph ] .
In stage 10 , not only are the predicate and direction stored for each incomplete triple , but also the current value of [ graph ] .
Any triple created in stage 12 is considered to be in the graph stored in the incomplete triples list .
In stage 13 , the new evaluation context is passed the new value of [ graph ] .
4.1 . Other Attributes : “ Private Agreement ”
An alternative attribute , such as id may be used to markup graph information rather than graph , but only through private agreement between producers and consumers .
An alternative attribute may have a different lexical space .
It is not meant by " private agreement " that consumers and producers would need to personally discuss and agree on an attribute to be used .
Instead , a consumer that needs a named graph facility would publish a link to this draft in their documentation together with the specific details of how their parser consumes named graphs .
People then targetting that particular consumer would follow the directions in the consumer 's documentation .

C. Future Development Ideas
The Arizona Department of Transportation has begun soliciting bids for highway projects using the first batch of federal stimulus funds , and it says historic drops in construction costs mean the money likely will pay for more roadwork .
The dismal economy , which is more pronounced in Arizona 's hard - hit construction business , has made contractors hungry for work , and bids have been coming in 10 to 20 percent lower than expected .
Arizona should complete more than the 41 stimulus projects planned if ADOT can award contracts before the economy rebounds .
" It means our dollars will go further , " U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood told The Arizona Republic on Thursday .
" It will last maybe until the economy improves . "
Construction prices have fallen sharply since last summer , and state transportation departments across the country are already realizing millions of dollars in savings as a result .
That was a cornerstone of President Barack Obama 's $ 787 billion economic - stimulus package : Spend heavily now while there are bargain prices .
So far , the government has steered $ 3 billion to 33 states for roughly 1,000 highway projects , LaHood said .
" This is a big infusion of money into the economy , " he said .
The window of opportunity wo n't last indefinitely , and what happens next to the construction economy will dictate how far the state can stretch its stimulus money , or whether savings dry up before they complete the list of highway projects .
For now , a historic global plunge in the prices of materials and a nationwide shortage of construction work will result in bids for stimulus projects up to 20 percent cheaper than comparable projects a year ago , said Kenneth Simonson , chief economist for the Association of General Contractors of America .
" I call it a limited - time sale , " Simonson said .
" It 's the most widespread slowdown in materials in my 37 years as an economist . "
Brutal job market
Simonson 's view is shared by the construction industry , highway planners and other economists .
Labor costs , too , are expected to stay low , and nowhere has the construction labor pool been worse hit than in Arizona .
From January 2007 to January 2009 , Arizona shed one - third of its construction jobs , nearly triple the national rate of industry job losses .
Next worst was Nevada , with a 25 percent decline , and all but one state west of the Continental Divide saw double - digit losses .
Tim James , an economics professor at Arizona State University 's W.P Carey School of Business , says ADOT can expect low bids for the rest of the year .
" I do n't think there will be a big price hike later because there are enough people out there hungry for work , " James said .
" There are some big deflationary pressures at work . "
Low bid results
ADOT need look no further than the California Transportation Department , the largest in the country , for proof of favorable bids .
In bids opened this month , all but two came in under estimates , an average of 23 percent lower than expected .
The largest , a water - drainage job , came in at less than half the state 's official estimate .
" It 's consistent with what we 've been seeing .
We 've been running at about 22 percent savings for a while , " Caltrans Office Engineer John McMillan said .
" It 's a great opportunity to keep our program going . "
In 2008 , ADOT saved $ 157 million from lowered bids , or 16 percent of the expected price .
Top ADOT officials told the State Transportation Board and state lawmakers recently that they hope those savings continue to be realized for the $ 350 million in stimulus contracts the agency is managing .
The biggest of the 14 projects , worth an estimated $ 86 million , that ADOT advertised this week is a $ 43 million job to widen Interstate 10 between Verrado Way and Sarival Avenue in the West Valley .
But if costs climb again , as they have in the past after natural and man-made disasters , projects will be cut from the list .
ADOT is meting out work in roughly $ 80 million batches to avoid overheating the bidding market or slowing down projects by overworking state engineers .
Economists and highway planners think construction prices will stay low until the home - building market rebounds .
Effect on Arizona
Which areas of the state win or lose is a matter of timing .
Not all projects or regions are equal because priority lists have been split into three : for Maricopa and Pima counties and the rest of the state .
As the money gets spent , ADOT will work down the priorities of each region .
Maricopa County has five large projects on the priority list .
Even if savings continue apace , the region still could not afford the next project on its list .
That 's not the case in rural Arizona , whose leaders opted for numerous small , mostly repaving jobs , to stimulate the local economy .
At the current savings rate , rural Arizona could undertake three more projects , and even more if ADOT directs savings from the other regions .
About half the rural projects involve pavement repairs , heavily affected by the price of asphalt , the tarry byproduct of oil refining used for road surfaces .
Its price , however , is the most volatile of highway - construction raw materials .
As the price of crude oil shot up last year , asphalt prices spiked 46 percent by September .
When crude fell , asphalt costs slipped 16 percent by January .
That makes rural Arizona 's projects more susceptible to the swings of the global oil market .
Other essential highway - building materials have fluctuated less .
After steel prices peaked in August , costs slipped 35 percent as the global economy slumped , according the Producer Price Index kept by the U.S. Bureauof Labor Statistics .
But cement costs have been stable since early 2007 .
These products are more likely to affect Maricopa County projects , which involve widening roads and improving interchanges .
A more general indicator , the Turner Building Cost Index , measures inflation in the construction industry , accounting for both materials and labor .
Over the past year , construction costs have fallen 2.6 percent , according to the index .
The stimulus package , the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , requires ADOT to spend half the money by July and the rest by mid-February .
It remains unclear how long ADOT can expect savings on materials and labor to continue , as the commodity markets adjust to stimulus spending and contractors learn from each other 's bids .
Political witch 's brew
Currently , no plan exists for distributing potential savings or absorbing unforeseen costs .
If the state has to pivot , it sets up another political squabble like the one that occurred early this month when the State Transportation Board decided to allocate stimulus money by a set formula .
The Maricopa Association of Governments complained that their region had been short - changed .
" I do n't think they 've thought through that .
If the projects in this area come in under budget , we should n't be penalized for costs in another , " MAG Transportation Director Eric Anderson said .
ADOT may face political and economic pressure to meet a goal of getting all 41 projects under contract by Memorial Day .

Quake Live is a re-working of 1999 title Quake III : Arena Classic game Quake III will be re-released for the web browser on Tuesday , highlighting the rapid development in web games .
It runs inside browsers after the installation of a software plug - in .
" It is a significant step which proves browser games can be sophisticated , " said Michael French , editor of games industry magazine Develop .
Quake Live is a version of a PC game which was first launched in 1999 .
The game is being released free of charge for browsers by id Software , and is supported by advertising .
It opens to the public as a beta later on Tuesday .
Mr French said : " A lot of the foundations of the mechanics of modern shooters were established by Quake .
All kinds of people could now be exposed to games for the first time
Michael French , Develop Magazine
" It makes a lot of sense for id to be trying new avenues for their intellectual property .
" One of the things id has always been known for is being cutting edge in graphics but also for finding new ways to get their games to gamers . "
Id Software is not the first company to offer browser versions of games that were once synonymous with physical formats : Garage Games offers web versions of games like Fallen Empire and Marble Blast Online , while there are also a number of online multiplayer titles such as PMOG .
High profile But Quake is the most high - profile PC franchise to branch out into the browser space .
Mr French said : " It proves that consumers are willing to try these things .
All kinds of people could now be exposed to games for the first time .
" There is no console or hardware in the way .
This is gaming for people who are more used to using Facebook . "
Mr French said browser - based games had already surpassed the graphical sophistication of titles that used to rely on console hardware such as the original PlayStation .
" You wo n't play this and be put off thinking it is old fashioned or ugly .
It is very playable and watchable , " Mr French said .
However , he said browser games were not yet a substitute for a dedicated piece of gaming hardware .
The games industry will be watching id software 's browser developments very closely .
" The Massively Multiplayer Online space is certainly the area most likely to move to browser .
Some well - known role playing game franchises could also move to the browser and are probably already in development . "

A magic bailout of Citigroup and Bank of America is underway .
Supposedly this bailout will not require any new capital .
Details can be found in a Joint Statement by the Treasury , FDIC , OCC , OTS and the Federal Reserve on the economy .
A strong , resilient financial system is necessary to facilitate a broad and sustainable economic recovery .
The U.S. government stands firmly behind the banking system during this period of financial strain to ensure it will be able to perform its key function of providing credit to households and businesses .
The government will ensure that banks have the capital and liquidity they need to provide the credit necessary to restore economic growth .
Moreover , we reiterate our determination to preserve the viability of systemically important financial institutions so that they are able to meet their commitments .
My Comment
" We announced on February 10 , 2009 , a Capital Assistance Program to ensure that our banking institutions are appropriately capitalized , with high - quality capital .
Under this program , which will be initiated on February 25 , the capital needs of the major U.S. banking institutions will be evaluated under a more challenging economic environment .
Should that assessment indicate that an additional capital buffer is warranted , institutions will have an opportunity to turn first to private sources of capital .
Otherwise , the temporary capital buffer will be made available from the government .
This additional capital does not imply a new capital standard and it is not expected to be maintained on an ongoing basis .
My Translation
This new capital will not cost anyone anything .
It will be dispensed by magic fairies and recovered at a later date .
We cannot share exactly how this magic works because under the rules of the magic ministry , we would be stripped of our magic hats and lose the rights to dispense magic if we did .
Trust us .
This is the proverbial free lunch that everyone says does not exist .
However , like magic pixie dust , it does exist , it really does .
Any government capital will be in the form of mandatory convertible preferred shares , which would be converted into common equity shares only as needed over time to keep banks in a well - capitalized position and can be retired under improved financial conditions before the conversion becomes mandatory .
Previous capital injections under the Troubled Asset Relief Program will also be eligible to be exchanged for the mandatory convertible preferred shares .
The conversion feature will enable institutions to maintain or enhance the quality of their capital .
My Comment
" Currently , the major U.S. banking institutions have capital in excess of the amounts required to be considered well capitalized .
This program is designed to ensure that these major banking institutions have sufficient capital to perform their critical role in our financial system on an ongoing basis and can support economic recovery , even under an economic environment that is more challenging than is currently anticipated .
The customers and the providers of capital and funding can be assured that as a result of this program participating banks will be able to move forward to provide the credit necessary for the stabilization and recovery of the U.S. economy .
Because our economy functions better when financial institutions are well managed in the private sector , the strong presumption of the Capital Assistance Program is that banks should remain in private hands . "
Although the housing bust , credit crisis , and market swoon undoubtedly take center stage these days , another drama is playing out on Wall Street : high - profile investment fraud .
The tally of money managers recently accused of bilking investors out of billions of dollars is growing : Bernard Madoff and his alleged Ponzi scheme ; R. Allen Stanford , accused of swindling investors with high - yielding certificates of deposit ; and a handful of others arrested in fraud probes .
Investing con artists certainly are n't new on the scene , but many have been flying under the radar for years , says Jeff Layman , chief investment officer of BKD Wealth Advisors , based in Springfield , Mo . " These scams are contingent on getting a continuous inflow of investor dollars , " he says .
" But when those dollars stop coming in and investors are looking to withdraw , things implode . "
So what makes investors fall for scams in the first place ?
Psychological persuasion techniques are the key , says John Gannon , senior vice president for investor education at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority .
Using actual transcripts of fraudsters in action , FINRA put together a list of five common scam tactics :
The " Phantom Riches " Tactic .
This is the classic too - good - to - be - true pitch .
Think lofty interest rates on traditionally conservative CDs — as in the Standford case — or guaranteed double - digit returns à la Madoff .
" Look around in this market — there are very few places where you can get that kind of return on your money , " says Gannon .
These days , scammers prey on investors who are disillusioned by the so - called " Lost Decade " for stocks , which points to data showing that the stock market is trading below what it was ten years ago .
" They send the message that wealth accumulation has been unrewarding over the past 10 to 12 years , " says Layman , who adds that baby boomers are often targeted in this scheme .
" You 've got people on the doorstep of retirement who need big returns but do n't need risk , so when someone says they can generate 8 percent to 10 percent returns , that 's obviously very appealing . "
The bottom line :
If someone promises an investment return that is unnaturally high or steady , the warning alarm should start sounding .
The " Source Credibility " Tactic :
A scary truth is that anyone can call himself or herself a financial planner or adviser , so it pays to check with national organizations that issue credentials ( they include the National Association of Personal Financial Advisers , the Financial Planning Association , and the Certified Financial Board of Standards . )
" It 's easy to fake a diploma on the wall ... people see alphabet soup after someone 's name , and they automatically think it means expertise , " says Gannon .
" And remember , anyone can put on a suit . "
After you make sure that the person you 're dealing with is accredited , you should also make sure product he or she is selling is registered with the SEC .
Hedge funds are an example of an investment that 's not registered , Gannon says : " In the Madoff situation , people truly had no idea what he was doing with their money — there was the fuzzy idea that he had an algorithm to make profits , but no one had a good understanding how he was going about making money . "
If you do n't understand how the investment generates returns , think twice .
The " Social Consensus " Tactic : Scam artists may employ a sort of peer pressure by claiming that other investors have already invested , such as those in your social circle or perhaps your church .
" Madoff had people in country clubs in Florida investing , " says Gannon .
Dean Barber , president of Barber Financial Group in Lenexa , Kan. , says fraudsters sometimes use the allure of exclusivity :
In the Madoff case , people believed because this guy had been around a long time and had some big clients . "
When investment frauds occur , it 's often when a client signs on with a manager ( financial adviser ) who 's also the the custodian of the account .
A custodian , which would include the Fidelitys and Charles Schwabs of the world , is in possession of your investment account and issues periodic statements of transactions .
The manager of assets executes those transactions .
It 's a good idea to keep managers and custodians separate , which ensures that all power wo n't fall into one person 's hands .
The " Reciprocity " Tactic :
In this situation , a fraudster will offer to do a small favor in exchange for a big one .
For example , a free lunch at an investment seminar may make you feel obligated to invest .
Or you might be offered a break on commissions if you buy now .
Bogus operators sometimes con older investors through free - lunch seminars that are followed by calls from salespeople a few days later ( a common recommendation is to liquidate securities and use the proceeds to buy indexed or variable annuities ) .
According to a recent study by the North American Securities Administrators Association , nearly half of all investor complaints submitted to state securities agencies came from the senior set .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Thrust into the spotlight as a Republican rising star , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has been depicted as an up - and - comer capable of helping reshape the party and jockeying for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination .
Being tapped to give the GOP response to President Obama 's address elevates Gov. Bobby Jindal 's standing in the party .
And now , Jindal 's party is putting him on a national platform , awarding the once little - known congressman the political plum of delivering the Republican 's televised response to President Barack Obama 's address to Congress Tuesday night .
" The speech is very important .
This is his coming - out party , " said G. Pearson Cross , head of the University of Louisiana 's political science department , who has observed Jindal 's political rise .
" His speech will put a face on the name . "
And put a fresh face on the Republican Party .
The GOP , still reeling from election beatings in 2006 and 2008 , is looking to revamp itself by rebuilding from the states up and reaching out to young voters .
At 37 , the popular Louisiana governor embodies that mission , experts say .
" The job is very important in framing the Republican message really for the rest of the year , " said Nick Ayers , executive director of the Republican Governors Association , referring to the response speech Tuesday .
" Gov. Jindal provides the outside - the - beltway , not D.C. , perspective .
And he 's one of the smartest policy minds in the country .
He 's not perceived as a overtly political person . "
Being tapped for this prime - time speech , a job normally for congressional leaders , has helped to elevate Jindal 's standing in the party dominated by old pros , including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader John Boehner , as well as personalities , such as Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
" It 's time for another generation to come into play , " said GOP strategist Ed Rollins , a CNN contributor .
" A lot of Republicans came of age under Reagan , which was 25 years ago ... and we just have n't built on that with young people . "
Rollins , a veteran of the Reagan White House , called Jindal , a first - generation American born to Punjabi parents , a " young dynamic governor " with " appeal to younger voters . "
The governor is a " textbook Republican " who is " scary smart , " Cross added .
And , having an accomplished minority figure represent your party 's message does n't hurt , he said .
" The Republican Party very strongly wants to have a new look , " he said .
" They 're saying , ' We 're not just a party of old white guys ' and he 's part of that appeal . "
Born Piyush Jindal in Louisiana 's capital , Baton Rouge , he called winning his first election in 2004 to the U.S. House of Representatives " the ultimate embodiment of the American dream . "
He was only 33 .
By age 28 , the former Rhodes Scholar had already served in three high - profile jobs , including head of Louisiana 's Department of Health and Hospitals and president of the University of Louisiana system .
Aside from his rapidly paced career moves , his ethnic background and the making of his American identity have been points of interest .
Jindal , while his legal name remains Piyush , publicly goes by " Bobby " -- a nickname he reportedly picked up from the youngest " Brady Bunch " character as a preschooler .
A Hindu by birth , he converted to Catholicism after his grandfather 's death .
" Coming from a family of recent immigrants reflects the opportunities in this country , and that 's a principle the Republican Party represents , " said David Winston , a Republican pollster and strategist .
Jindal , in a statement , said he is looking forward to hearing Obama 's address and that he 's honored to be delivering the Republican response immediately following the president 's speech .
" Here in Louisiana , we have first - hand experience with reforming government and cutting taxes to stimulate our economy in uncertain times .
This is a terrific opportunity to talk about our great state to the nation . "
But Democrats say the problem is the message , not the messenger .
" It does n't matter if it 's Gov. Jindal or Gov. Palin or Mitch McConnell , " said Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis .
" At the end of the day , the policies they support are not the policies the American people support . "
Obama is expected to focus on the economic crisis and the $ 787 billion stimulus bill among other issues during his first congressional address , and Jindal will likely rebut with a push for fiscal responsibility , Kofinis said .
" He 'll probably flash back to the past , talking about fiscal responsibility and ignoring the fact that over the last eight years the Republicans have been the poster child for fiscal irresponsibility , " he said .
The governor has been a vocal conservative critic of the stimulus package , highlighting what he considers waste at a White House meeting with governors on Monday .
Jindal spoke to a large group of reporters after the session Monday , noting items such as $ 1 billion in added spending for the national census and $ 50 million in federal spending for the arts .
iReport.com : What do you want to hear from Obama and Jindal ?
It 's " not apparent to me why they had to be in the stimulus package , " said Jindal , while adding that his fellow Republican governors nevertheless wanted to give Obama " every opportunity " to succeed in sparking an economic recovery .
Jindal has announced plans to reject $ 100 million of stimulus funding for his state , saying it would require Louisiana to change its unemployment laws .
Several other governors have expressed similar concerns .
Jindal made history in 2007 when , at 36 , he was elected the nation 's first Indian - American governor and the youngest in office .
And he drew major national attention last year when he was widely thought by pundits to be on then - Republican presidential John McCain 's short list for vice president .
" All the elements of who he is make him an attractive figure , particularly with the difficulty Republicans had with attracting the youth vote , " Winston said .
" Having a younger member of the party is something to be desired . "
Palin got the job , though Jindal did not slip into obscurity with many analysts still looking to him as a potential presidential candidate .
And although Jindal has said he 's focused on his job as governor , his presidential ambitions are " one of the worst kept secrets in Louisiana , " Kofinis said .
Jindal was expected to headline the Republican National Convention in August , but canceled to oversee his state 's response to Hurricane Gustav .
iReport.com :
How are you coping with the economy ?
His state still recovering from Hurricane Katrina , Jindal ordered a mandatory evacuation and called up some 3,000 National Guardsmen to coordinate the exodus .
Jindal 's actions were in stark contrast to former Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco 's shaky and largely criticized reaction to Katrina .
The little - known Jindal , who narrowly lost the 2003 gubernatorial election to Blanco , won the post outright in the 2007 primary with 54 percent of the vote .
Republicans in Washington took notice .
Boehner , R - Ohio , and McConnell , R- Kentucky , support the idea of Jindal serving as the official GOP spokesman Tuesday night .
" Gov. Jindal embodies what I have long said : The Republican Party must not be simply the party of opposition , but the party of better solutions , " Boehner said when he announced that Jindal was slated to give the response .
A recent CNN / Opinion Research Corporation survey indicates that Mike Huckabee and Sarah Palin top the list of potential 2012 Republican presidential hopefuls , attracting about one - third of Republicans and independents who lean toward the GOP , from among those surveyed .
The survey is an early measure of possible support , not a horse - race snapshot .
Jindal , falling behind former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , grabbed the backing of 19 percent .
Florida Gov. Charlie Crist drew 7 percent .
Analysts say Jindal lacked name recognition .
Tuesday night 's speech will raise his profile .
As for 2012 , Winston said it 's too early to know who the front - runners will be , but expect to see more of Jindal .
" We 'll see more of him , but along with other folks , " said Winston , pointing out Giuliani , Palin and Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele .
" Without a clear central person , i.e. George Bush , there are a lot of people who step forward to determine which direction the party will go . "

Lawmakers ask :
Why are taxpayers footing Gonzales 's legal bills ?
Nick Juliano
Published : Monday November 24 , 2008
Print This Email This
Two members of Congress are demanding answers following revelations that taxpayers are paying up to $ 24,000 per month to foot former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales 's legal bills .
Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) and Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) , who chair the Judiciary committees in their respective chambers , wrote to Attorney General Michael Mukasey on Monday demanding to know the details of the arrangement .
At issue is a lawsuit filed against Gonzales alleging that he oversaw discrimination in two Justice Department programs aimed at recruiting law students into federal service .
During his time in office , department officials systematically denied entry to liberal applicants and only admitted Republican supporters .
Administration of the Department of Justice Honor Program and Summer Law Intern Program were two of the many areas in which Gonzales is alleged to have politicized the Department .
The politicization scandal , best known for the firing of nine US Attorneys who refused to pursue partisan charges , contributed to Gonzales 's resignation in disgrace last year .
Several law students who were denied entry to the honors and intern programs are suing Gonzales , alleging they were unfairly disqualified .
The Justice Department is paying Gonzales 's bills .
The government has the authority to pay for private attorneys for employees who were sued for actions they performed as a part of their official duties .
But , as Conyers and Leahy note , the conduct at issue in Gonzales 's case was criticized by the Justice Department 's own Inspector General and Office of Professional Conduct .
" Given the Inspector General 's findings of violations of Department policy and Federal law in connection with the politicization of Department hiring , on what basis did the Department determine that the conduct at issue in this lawsuit was within the scope of Mr. Gonzales 's employment and that his representation is in the interest of the United States ? " the two ask .
A full copy of the letter is reprinted below ( .pdf here ) :
The Honorable Michael B. Mukasey
Attorney General of the United States
United States Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue , N.W .
Washington , D.C. 20530
Dear Attorney General Mukasey :
We write to follow up on reports that the Department will be covering legal expenses for former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in connection with findings of politicized hiring for the Department of Justice Honor Program and Summer Law Intern Program .
Department of Justice Inspector General Glenn
Fine released a report this past June which concluded that hiring was improperly politicized , including in 2006 when , the report concluded , several Department officials engaged in hiring practices that constituted misconduct and also violated the Departments policies and civil service law that prohibit discrimination in hiring based on political or ideological affiliations . 
Following the publication of the Inspector Generals report , several individuals whose applications for employment through these programs were turned down during the period that the hiring process was improperly politicized have filed suit against Mr. Gonzales and others who held senior positions at the Department at the time .
Recent press accounts indicated that the Department of Justice has decided to pay up to $ 24,000 a month for a private attorney to represent Mr. Gonzales in connection with this lawsuit .
As far as we can tell , the Department has thus far failed to confirm or publicly account for any aspect of this arrangement .
Under section 50.16 of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations , the Department may provide for a private attorney for a current or former employee sued individually for conduct within the scope of his employment , but the Government should not pay for private representation if the Attorney General or his designee determines that the employees actions do not reasonably appear to have been performed within the scope of his employment  or that representation is not in the interest of the United States . 
There is precedent for disclosure of information to Congress about this type of arrangement .
In May 2003 , for example , U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth ordered the release of similar information regarding fees paid by the Department of the Interior to private attorneys to defend its employees in a class action lawsuit .
Judge Lamberth wrote that  the Court believes that Congress should have all available information at its disposal in order to inform the process of appropriating funds for court - appointed officials and attorneys  fees in the case .
We would appreciate your responses to these questions on this issue :
What is the arrangement the Department has reached with Mr. Gonzales in connection with representation in this matter , and why has that arrangement not been made public ?
Who made the decision to pay for Mr. Gonzaless private legal expenses in connection with the politicization of hiring at the Justice Department , and how , when , and on what basis was the decision made ?
Please include with your response any standing guidelines governing the procedures for retention and payment for private counsel for individual employees or former employees .
For what other current or former Department officials has the Department decided to pay legal expenses in connection with these matters ?
Given the Inspector Generals findings of violations of Department policy and Federal law in connection with the politicization of Department hiring , on what basis did the Department determine that the conduct at issue in this lawsuit was within the scope of Mr. Gonzaless employment and that his representation is in the interest of the United States ?
We look forward to your responses to these questions .
Thank you for your time and consideration .
Sincerely ,
PATRICK LEAHY JOHN CONYERS , JR .
Chairman , U.S. Senate , Chairman , U.S. House of Representatives ,
Committee on the Judiciary Committee on the Judiciary

NEW YORK / SAN FRANCISCO , Feb 24 ( Reuters ) - San Francisco may lose its main newspaper , the San Francisco Chronicle , as owner Hearst Corp cuts a “ significant ” number of jobs and decides whether to shut or sell the money - losing daily .
The privately held New York - based publisher already is considering shutting a second West Coast paper , the Seattle Post - Intelligencer , in the face of a devastating decline in advertising revenue and big losses .
Founded shortly after Gold Rush fever hit California in the mid-19th century , the Chronicle has long been an essential part of daily life for many Bay Area residents , even as it sometimes disappointed or outraged them .
But the Chronicle lost more than $ 50 million last year and this year ’s losses to date are worse , Hearst said on its website on Tuesday .
It said the paper has lost “ major ” amounts of money since 2001 , a year after Hearst bought the paper .
“ Survival is the outcome we all want to achieve .
But without the specific changes we are seeking across the entire Chronicle organization , we will have no choice but to quickly seek a buyer for the Chronicle or , should a buyer not be found , to shut the newspaper down , ” said Hearst Corp Chief Executive Frank Bennack Jr.
More than 100 employees gathered in a conference room to hear the news from Editor Ward Bushee and Publisher Frank Vega after receiving a message about a mandatory staff meeting .
“ Some people were crying at the meeting , ” said Rachel Gordon , 47 , a transportation reporter at the paper .
“ But people are trying to get the newspaper out for tomorrow . ”
“ We knew it was going to be ominous when we got that message , ” Gordon added .
“ [ Vega ] said Hearst really wants to make this work , that shutting us down is a last resort . ”
A Hearst spokesman declined to say whether the company has hired an adviser or banker to try to sell the paper .
The paper employs 275 news staff and is the 12th - largest in the United States , according to the U.S. Audit Bureau of Circulations , with average weekday circulation of 339,430 .
It is the 19th - largest paper by Sunday circulation .
Circulation fell 7 percent as of the six months ended Sept. 30 , 2008 , compared with the same period a year earlier .
The Pulitzer Prize - winning Chronicle was founded in 1865 , about a decade and a half after gold was found in California .
With the help of the local literary crowd , including Mark Twain and Bret Harte , the paper captured the largest circulation west of the Mississippi .
It covered the biggest events in the city ’s history , from the earthquake and fire of 1906 to the assassination of its mayor , George Moscone , and the state ’s first openly gay elected official , Harvey Milk , in 1978 .
The paper has reflected many changes in U.S. culture first seen in its own often cutting - edge city , including the shift from beatnik -- a word it may have coined -- to hippie in the 1950s and ‘ 60s and the shock waves from the AIDS pandemic in the city ’s sizeable gay population .
“ I hate to see a newspaper go , ” says writer Elizabeth Dietz , 63 , of Los Altos , south of San Francisco .
“ I just hate it .
I think we still need our newspapers and there ’s just nothing like that ancient old Chronicle .
Even though it ’s irritating , it ’s an institution .
I can not imagine it not being there . ”
The Chronicle is the latest U.S. paper to face the threat of extinction if its owners cannot find ways to cut costs .
Advance Newspapers ’ Star - Ledger in Newark , New Jersey , cut its newsroom staff by 40 percent last year .
Hearst has said it might take the Seattle Post - Intelligencer online only or close the paper if it cannot find a buyer by mid-March .
Other papers , including EW Scripps Co's SSP.N Rocky Mountain
News , could fold if a buyer is not found .
The Chronicle and its unions are expected to begin discussing the situation later Tuesday and on Wednesday .
Doug Cuthbertson , who represents the Northern California Media Workers Guild , declined to comment on the talks .
Hearst owns several other papers throughout the United States including the Times Union in Albany New York , and the Houston Chronicle .
It also owns magazines such as Marie Claire and O , The Oprah Magazine .

The hand gel can contain up to 70 % alcohol levels A hospital in Dorset is one of many removing alcohol - based hand cleaning gel from reception areas in a bid to stop visitors drinking it .
The National Concern for Healthcare Infections says the gel , which contains up to 70 % alcohol levels , is being stolen and mixed with other drinks .
Two homeless people died in London last year after drinking the gel .
The Royal Bournemouth Hospital has removed dispensers from reception areas and those in wards are now supervised .
Dr Bill Gransden , director of infection control at the hospital , said : " [ Visitors ] have the opportunity to wash their hands and apply the gel in the clinical area , which is the ward next to where the patients are .
We have heard many stories of people going along and putting it into their orange juice
Neil Manser , National Concern for Healthcare Infections
" That will be very closely supervised by nursing and other clinical staff .
" Where it really matters , next to the patient and in that environment , I am happy we have got really good supervision . "
He said there had been no reports of incidents or bottles of the gel being stolen .
But it is one of many hospitals in the UK to bring in the extra measures after recommendations from the National Patient Safety Agency .
Poole General Hospital said it was aware of the problem but said its dispensers were already only available at the entrances to wards .
While Southampton University Hospitals NHS
Trust said it was carrying out a risk assessment before making any changes .
Neil Manser , co-founder of National Concern for Healthcare Infections , said : " Unfortunately we have people in this society who are addicted to alcohol .
" We have heard many stories of people going along and putting it into their orange juice . "

Numerous investors and banks across Wall Street refused to deal with Bernard Madoff for several years before his ultimate arrest on fraud charges , amid widespread rumours of suspect activity at his broking and fund management business , it is becoming clear .
And in an explosive new revelation , Wall Street 's chief regulator , the Securities and Exchange Commission , actually investigated the rumours and discovered that Mr Madoff had lied to its officials – but gave him no more than a private rap on the knuckles .
As more investors in Europe and the US came forward yesterday to admit losses in the finance industry 's biggest - ever fraud , investigators are hearing numerous tales from market participants who had long believed that Mr Madoff 's impressive track record was being faked .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Astonishingly , many of these participants invested with Mr Madoff .
According to documents sent to the SEC in 2005 by Harry Markopolos , the Boston accountant who first raised red flags about Mr Madoff in 1999 and finally got the regulator to launch an investigation more than six years later , several hedge fund managers who were funnelling money into Madoff Investment Securities said they thought the Wall Street veteran was " subsidising " investment returns in down months and " eating the losses " to make his results seem smoother and less risky .
Mr Madoff was arrested last Thursday after confessing to two sons who worked in the broker - dealer arm of the family business that his investment management returns were " all just one big lie " , saying his fraud could have cost investors $ 50 bn .
That would make it the biggest - ever so - called Ponzi scheme .
In such a fraud , a money manager simply pays existing clients with money coming in from new ones .
A Wall Street veteran for almost 50 years , and a founder and former chairman of the Nasdaq stock exchange , Mr Madoff was widely respected .
But there were many who were suspicious of the secrecy with which he guarded his investment technique .
The system he said he used , buying shares and trading options , could not mathematically have produced the returns he claimed , many people thought .
According to one widespread rumour , he was using insider trading at his broker - dealer business to juice returns .
The SEC investigated that rumour , among others , in 2005 , in an inquiry that took in concerns that Mr Madoff operated as a " white label " hedge fund , running money on behalf of other funds without that fact being disclosed to their investors .
The SEC also took extensive testimony from Mr Markopolos , who had told them years earlier that – most likely – Mr Madoff was running " the world 's largest Ponzi scheme " .
The conclusion was that Mr Madoff was indeed evading disclosure rules , and the SEC forced him to register formally as an investment adviser , which would open him up to regular inspections by the organisation – but it did not subpoena documents or dig further .
In his testimony , Mr Markopolos had warned the SEC : " I 've found that wherever there is one cockroach in plain sight , many more are lurking behind the corner out of plain view . "
The SEC has launched an internal investigation into its failures in the Madoff case .
Donald Langevoort , law professor at Georgetown University and a former special counsel at the SEC , said the latest revelations were " dumbfounding " .
He said : " What we 've learnt is that the SEC actually investigated whether Mr Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme .
They took aim at exactly the right target .
And they missed . "
The SEC and the FBI were continuing to examine documents at Mr Madoff 's offices in Midtown Manhattan yesterday .
They are focusing on the role of his wife , Ruth .
Mrs Madoff , who has a degree in nutrition , co-edited a cookbook in 1996 called The Great Chefs of America Cook Kosher , but she was also involved in the family business and investigators are examining if she kept secret records tracking payments .
Her lawyer said she had not been charged with any wrongdoing .
RISE : Jacqui Smith will get more money
As most of the UK suffers pay freezes - or even reductions - due to the dismal economic situation , MPs will see their salary jump 2.33 per cent from April 1 , it emerged today .
The Westminster rise brings their parliamentary pay - before allowances - up from £ 63,291 to around £ 64,766 .
News of the extra money set to pour into MPs ' pockets came as the row over expenses reached boiling point today .
Humiliated Home Secretary Jacqui Smith was facing demands to resign after her husband admitted paying to watch adult films using her taxpayer - funded expenses .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown today appealed today for Smith to be allowed to get on with her work as Home Secretary , saying : “ This is very much a personal matter for Jacqui .
She has made her apology , her husband has made clear that he has apologised .
“ The best thing is that Jacqui Smith gets on with her work , which is what she wants to do . "
Ms Smith promised she would repay the money and yesterday her husband , Richard Timney , apologised to her – but not to taxpayers .
Calls were growing today for Ms Smith to step down .
Former shadow Home Secretary David Davis said : “ I do n’t call for people to go unless I think there is absolutely a smoking gun .
“ But I think in this circumstance the sympathy for her will be even less than it otherwise would have been because she ’s not that good at her job . ”
Ms Smith is already facing a sleaze probe over at least £ 116,000 in expenses she claimed for the upkeep of her family home under MPs ’ second - home allowance – while claiming that her sister ’s house in London was her main residence .
The latest embarrassing episode , revealed ­exclusively in yesterday ’s Sunday Express , is seen by many as the final nail in her political coffin .
News that MPs ’ basic pay is to be boosted will anger those who are already outraged that salaries are topped up by expenses and allowances worth up to around £ 180,000 a year to pay for their offices , staff and travel and the cost of spending time away from home while working at Westminster .
( CNN ) -- Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps admitted to " regrettable " behavior Sunday and vowed it would n't happen again after a British newspaper published a photograph of the swimmer smoking from a bong .
" I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way , " swimmer Michael Phelps said in a statement released Sunday .
" I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment , " the record - setting American athlete said in a statement issued Sunday .
" I 'm 23 years old , and despite the successes I have had in the pool , I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way , not in a manner that people have come to expect from me , " Phelps said .
" For this , I am sorry .
I promise my fans and the public -- it will not happen again . "
People often use bongs to smoke marijuana .
Phelps won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , China , four years after he won six gold medals at the Summer Olympics in Athens , Greece .
He has received numerous corporate endorsements totaling millions of dollars .
His statement was also posted on his Facebook page , followed by comments of both support and admonishment from fans .
In a separate statement , the U.S. Olympic Committee said it was " disappointed in the behavior recently exhibited by Michael Phelps . "
" Michael is a role model , and he is well aware of the responsibilities and accountability that come with setting a positive example for others , particularly young people , " the committee said .
" In this instance , regrettably , he failed to fulfill those responsibilities . "
However , it added , " Michael has acknowledged that he made a mistake and apologized for his actions .
We are confident that , going forward , Michael will consistently set the type of example we all expect from a great Olympic champion . "
The picture , billed as an exclusive by the tabloid News of the World , showed Phelps using a water pipe during what it said was a November party at the University of South Carolina .
In 2004 , Phelps was arrested on charges of driving under the influence in Salisbury , Maryland .
Phelps pleaded guilty and received 18 months probation in that incident , issuing an apology afterward .
" Getting into a car with anything to drink is wrong .
It 's dangerous and it 's unacceptable .
I 'm 19 , but was taught that no matter how old you are , you take responsibility for actions , which I do , " Phelps told ESPN .
The Olympic swimmer is one of 12 Olympic athletes that have pledged to " My Victory , " an initiative launched last year by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency to keep competitive sports clean of cheating and drug use .

You can't have an ginormous fantasy epic without at least three different races — elf , human , dwarf , etc. — and you can't have elves and dwarfs without racism according to fantasy standard - setter J.R.R.
Tolkien .

In typical BioWare fashion of reinventing the plot wheel , Dragon Age : Origins aims to redefine the fantasy genre ; and it'll start by rearranging the racial tension between your standard fantasy stock types .
Normally , say BioWare headmen Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk , high fantasy like Tolkien 's dictates that elves are creatures that " sashay through the countryside " – they 're very pretty , very aloof and very , very elitist .
" So , " said Muzyka , " here 's an example of elves being different in Dragon Age : Elves were enslaved by the humans at one point in Dragon Age , so they hate humans , they despise them .
Humans in turn have a lot of disrespect towards elves . [...]
That 's something that has n't really been done before is introducing a lot of racial tension and back story and intrigue behind the scenes that 's sort of totally optional , but it makes the world feel that much richer and real . "

Certainly , BioWare is no stranger to racial tension — you could n't expect the sheer number of alien species in Mass Effect 's galaxy to all get along with each other , right ?
But this is the first I 've heard where you get to make a conscious choice to be the oppressor — or even the oppressed .
" Your experience ... is going to be very different depending if you choose to play an elf origin story or a human , " said Muzyka .
In a way , it does n't sound different than making the choice to have Shepard be a man or a woman .
But there 's a subtle difference to Dragon
Age that you do n't see in Mass Effect or even in close fantasy cousin The Witcher : Shepard was Shepard ; Geralt was Geralt — the main character was somebody else .
If BioWare has their way in Dragon Age , there wo n't be that layer of separation between player and character .
You 'll be the racist ; you 'll be the persecuted — depending on which race you play .
" We 're defining a new type of fantasy genre , " Muzyka explained .
" That 's one of our goals is to make this a landmark event in fantasy , defining something that has n't been done before quite the way we 're doing it — dark heroic fantasy . "
Newswise — Variations in mismatch repair genes can help predict treatment response and prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer , according to research from The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center presented today in advance of the American Society of Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium .
In the study , single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in genes involved in DNA mismatch repair were associated with response to gemcitabine ( Gemzar ) - based preoperative chemoradiation , tumor resectability ( the likelihood of removing the entire tumor ) , and overall survival .
" Gemcitabine is a major chemotherapeutic agent used to treat pancreatic cancer , but we do n't understand why some patients respond and most patients do not , " said Donghui Li , Ph.D. , the study 's lead author and professor in M. D. Anderson 's Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology .
" There has been no biomarker for pancreatic cancer used in the clinic to predict response .
Our research interest has been to determine whether genetic variation in DNA repair can be a predictor of treatment response or a prognosis factor for patient survival . "
DNA repair is a complicated process , Li noted , with various mechanisms responsible for identifying and correcting different types of DNA damage .
Mismatch repair genes correct mistakes in DNA replication or trigger cell death ( apoptosis ) if repair is not possible .
Ensuring cell death is critical to preventing the runaway cell division that occurs in malignant tumors .
In the study , Li's group obtained DNA samples from 154 patients with potentially resectable pancreatic adenocarcinomas who were participating in phase II clinical trials of preoperative gemcitabine - based chemoradiation .
The researchers evaluated 15 SNPs ( also called genotypes ) among eight mismatch repair genes ( EXO1 , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH3 , MSH6 , PMS1 , TREX1 , and TP73 ) and correlated them with tumor response to gemcitabine , the likelihood of achieving complete tumor resection , and overall survival .
Individually , five genotypes were associated with tumor response to preoperative gemcitabine - based chemoradiation ; six were associated with tumor resectability , and ten were associated with overall survival .
However , the combined effects of several genotypes on patient survival were dramatic .
For example , 20 of 25 patients with 0 to 1 abnormal genotype were alive at the completion of the study ( after a median follow - up time of 49.9 months ) .
In contrast , median survival times were 36.2 months for patients with 2 adverse genotypes ; 23.9 months for those with 3 ; 16.3 months for those with 4 ; 13 months for those with 5 ; and 8.3 months for those with 6 - 7 .
If confirmed by other researchers , these findings could have a profound effect on how pancreatic cancer is treated .
Having established biomarkers like abnormal mismatch repair genes , for example , would make choosing which patients might benefit from surgery much easier , Li explained .
" The doctor always faces a tough choice , " Li said .
" Among the pancreatic tumors that are technically respectable , 25 - 30 percent might have very small tumors that have already metastasized to the liver or other organs .
For these patients , the tumors recur very shortly after surgery , so these patients actually do not benefit from the traumatic and difficult surgery . "
The study results also suggest that variations in mismatch repair genes could be useful in determining which patients will respond best to gemcitabine - based chemoradiation .
Having this information would allow physicians to move more quickly to give alternative drugs to a patient unlikely to respond to gemcitabine , Li explained .
" We hope that in the future we will be able to run a genetic test that will help doctors predict a patient 's outcome and help them select the best therapy for each patient , " Li concluded .
Li's research was funded by grants from the National Cancer Institution , including M. D. Anderson 's prestigious Specialized Program Of Research Excellence ( SPORE ) for pancreatic cancer , and a research grant from the Lockton Research Funds .
In addition to Li , co-authors on the all - M. D. Anderson team include : James L. Abbruzzese , M.D. , professor and chair of the Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology ; Xiaoqun Dong , M.D. , Li Jiao , M.D. , Ph.D. , Yanan Li , also of the Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology ; Douglas B. Evans , M.D. , Department of Surgical Oncology ; Huamin Wang , M.D. , Ph.D. , Department of Pathology ; and Kenneth R. Hess , Ph.D. , Department of Biostatistics .

When humans look into outer space and its amazing distant realms , sometimes all we really want to find is someplace like home .
Another planet like Earth , that is .
Soon , a new NASA telescope mission called Kepler may finally make that happen .
Set to launch March 5 from Florida 's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , the $ 550 million Kepler telescope is designed to detect extrasolar planets that are the same size as Earth , orbiting around stars the same size as the sun , at a range similar to Earth 's distance from the sun , and with orbits of about one year , like ours .
" The whole mission was designed around this goal , " said Kepler co-investigator William Cochran , an astronomer at McDonald Observatory at the University of Texas at Austin .
" If we find no Earth - like planets , then we can say with great confidence that Earths like ours are rare . "
Although more than 300 exoplanets have been discovered around other stars , none have been quite as small as Earth , and even the ones that come close do n't usually orbit in what 's called the habitable zone — the range in which temperatures would be favorable for life .
The results from Kepler could be important in trying to predict how common life , and even intelligent life , is in the galaxy .
A famous calculation called the Drake equation aims to quantify how many extraterrestrial civilizations might exist in our galaxy that we could be able to communicate with .
The equation , devised in 1960 by Frank Drake of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute , or SETI , takes into account many factors , such as the rate of star formation in the galaxy , the fraction of stars with planets and the fraction of planets that are habitable .
If Kepler can help estimate the frequency of Earth - size planets , astronomers will be a lot closer to making an accurate estimate with the Drake equation .
Kepler differs from most planet - hunting projects , which use the Doppler - shift method to search for stars that wobble due to the small gravitational pull of an orbiting planet .
With existing technology , that method can only detect planets that are more massive than Earth , whose gravitational pull is large enough to tug at their parent stars with a strength we would notice .
Instead , Kepler will use a powerful optical telescope to detect the slight dimming of light that results when a planet moves between us and its star .
This technique , as opposed to the Doppler method , does not depend on a planet 's mass , so is better suited to reveal smaller planets .
" This could be a really fabulous mission , " said UCLA astronomer Benjamin Zuckerman , who studies extrasolar planets , but has no direct involvement in the Kepler mission .
" The nice thing about this mission , if it works as well as they hope , is that whatever result it gets is interesting .
Either they find something , or they can put a strong limit on the frequency of Earth - sized planets . "
After Kepler 's launch , the telescope will begin continuously observing a single field of view , in which the brightnesses of 100,000 stars will be monitored for changes resulting from transiting planets .
It will begin collecting data within days of its launch and the first results could be released by next fall .
" The number of stars we are looking at is such that if it turns out Earth - like planets are common , we should find 30 to 50 of them , " Cochran told Wired.com .
If Kepler finds planets that could be Earth twins , it wo n't be able to detect whether or not they host life .
Other missions , such as a potential NASA observatory called the Terrestrial Planet Finder or the European Space Agency 's Darwin , will have to investigate those possibilities .
After its launch , Kepler is set to observe for at least three and a half years , with the possibility of extending its run if things go well .
The observatory could find Earth - size planets with quick orbits within months , but detecting planets with periods closer to one year will likely happen toward the end of Kepler 's mission .
" The only planets we can detect are those for which we are looking edge - on to the orbit , " Cochran said .
" Then for those where we are looking edge - on , the planets that we 'll see most easily are the ones with the shortest periods . "

This is not a joke .
Americans for Prosperity , an anti-Employee Free Choice
Act group , is hiring Joe the Plumber to speak at rallies against the average working class in America .
Joe the Plumber is hitting the campaign trail again !
He ’s been pressed into service to do a series of events throughout Pennsylvania rallying opposition to the Employee Free Choice Act , the organizer of the events confirms .
Mr. Plumber will speak at rallies against the measure in Pittsburgh , Harrisburg , and Philadelphia on March 30th and 31st , according to a spokesperson for the anti-EFCA group Americans for Prosperity .
“ The public loves Joe the Plumber , ” the spokesperson , Mary Ellen Burke , claimed to me .
“ They see him as a role model . ”
Asked whether Joe the Plumber had any particular knowledge or expertise about EFCA that might explain the decision to enlist him , Burke said that he was being enlisted to provide a “ grassroots perspective ” and “ the working perspective ” on the measure .
Pressed on whether Joe the Plumber has any particular claim to being a spokesperson on the issue , Burke replied that “ he represents the American worker . ”
Burke could n’t immediately say whether Joe the Plumber was being paid for his appearances .
Wonder if he 'll tell the anti-EFCA crowds they make him horny , too .
Sounds like a sure recipe for success .
The public does n't love Joe the Plumber , insane conservatives do .
This only makes things look so much worse for Republicans in this country .
How weak and foolish Susan Collins or Olympia Snowe must feel seeing that Joe the Plumber is being billed as a celebrity in the GOP .
It 's so pathetic .
I guarantee you that after his run dies -- well , OK , it may never die , because they are a leaderless party , and he 's about as qualified as any of them -- but when it does and if a union job opens up for him , he 'll take it in a second .

LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST AB 390 , as introduced , Ammiano .
Marijuana Control , Regulation , and Education Act .
Existing state law provides that every person who possesses , sells , transports , or cultivates marijuana , concentrated cannabis , or derivatives of marijuana , except as authorized by law , is guilty of one or more crimes .
This bill would remove marijuana and its derivatives from existing statutes defining and regulating controlled substances .
It would instead legalize the possession , sale , cultivation , and other conduct relating to marijuana and its derivatives by persons 21 years of age and older , except as specified .
It would set up a wholesale and retail marijuana sales regulation program , including special fees to fund drug abuse prevention programs , as specified , to commence after regulations concerning the program have been issued , and federal law permits possession and sale consistent with the program .
It would ban local and state assistance in enforcing inconsistent federal and other laws relating to marijuana , and would provide specified infraction penalties for violations of these new marijuana laws and regulations , as specified .
It would make other conforming changes .
By creating various infractions for violations of regulations and laws created by this act , this bill would impose a state - mandated local program .
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state .
Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement .
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason .
Vote : majority .
Appropriation : no .
Fiscal committee : yes .
State - mandated local program : yes .

On December 14 , less than two weeks before his final White House Christmas , President George Walker Bush made a last pilgrimage to Iraq , the country which will , more than anything else , define his presidency .
During the otherwise unmemorable news conference , someone threw a shoe at him [ video ] .
The president was clearly not prepared for this turn of events .
More than a bit flustered , he commented that the perpetrator of this act was trying to attract attention to himself and that it was rather much like being “ booed ” at a political rally or having someone “ wave ” with not all his fingers held up .
Not exactly .
I watched a CNN video clip of the “ shoe throwing ” and the presidential response with a group of Muslim and Christian graduate students at the Center for Religious and Crosscultural Studies at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta , Indonesia .
We watched the film over and over for nearly half an hour , all of us roaring with laughter .
Many of us , for once , felt sympathy for President Bush , for whom there is , generally speaking , almost no sympathy here .
No one can blame him for being surprised and confused by the event , but some of his aides must certainly have understood how it would resonate in the Muslim world .
Boundary of Holiness
Throughout the Muslim world , and in most of Asia , shoes are ritually impure .
They are “ dirty ” in more than the material sense of the word .
One does not , ever , wear shoes or sandals in mosques , shrines , temples , or in most instances in peoples ’ homes .
In my travels in Asia over the past three decades I have often encountered signs at the entrances to holy places reading something like : “ Boundary of Holiness .
Footwearing Strictly Prohibited . ”
Muslims remove their shoes and wash their feet , hands , and faces before prayer to purify themselves .
There is also a long history of diplomatic impasses and political conflict stemming from the refusal of western envoys to remove their shoes while visiting Muslim and other Asian capitals , and the refusal of Asian monarchs to make exceptions to accommodate Westerners ’ discomfort at the thought of appearing shoeless in official capacities .
To throw a shoe at a visiting head of state and erstwhile ally is very close to the ultimate expression of disgust and defiance .
Viewing the “ shoe clip ” and listening to my students , I could not help but recall another event involving shoes and Iraq and two very “ nontraditional students . ”
When the war began I was teaching an undergraduate class on local Muslim cultures at Arizona State University .
One of my students was an army reservist whose education had been interrupted by the first Gulf War and feared that he would be “ called up ” because he is a medevac helicopter pilot .
The second was a very young and charming Iraqi woman , whose family had suffered horribly under Sadam Hussein and who more than anything else hoped that the war would be over quickly so that she could return to her own country .
I still hear from both of them occasionally .
He served two tours of duty in Iraq and finally finished his degree .
She is studying for a masters degree at the American University in Cairo and has not been able to return to Iraq .
It should come as no surprise that we spent much of the semester talking about the war , Iraq , and Saddam .
This , of course , included the atrocities perpetrated by the Iraqi regime .
I knew that it was going to be difficult ; I did not know how difficult .
At one point my Iraqi student burst into tears .
She grew very angry , pulled off one of her ( very ) high - heeled shoes and started banging it on the table .
Between her sobs she explained : “ I hate him !
I hate him for what he did to the Kurds and what he did to my father . ”
( She is Kurdish ; her father was tortured and killed by Iraqi security forces . )
Pointing at the reservist she said in a voice seething with anger : “ You catch him .
You give him to us , the women of Iraq .
We will take care of him .
Shooting is too good for him !
Hanging is too good for him !
We will beat him to death with our shoes !
That is what he deserves ! ”
The reservist was more than a bit taken aback , as were we all at the sudden transformation of our normally mild - spoken and pleasant colleague .
He replied : “ Yes ma’am but that could cause some problems with the folks from the Judge Advocate ’s office … but I think you ’re telling me that when I get over there I should be on the lookout for women with shoes ? ”
“ That ’s right , ” she replied , and continued : “ If Iraqi people come at you with shoes , you have lost their hearts and lost the war and God help us all . ”
The Associated Press has reported that thousands of Shi’ah Muslim have demonstrated in support of Mutradha al Zeidi , the 28 - year - old Cairo man arrested by Iraqi police in connection with the incident .
He has been hailed as a hero throughout the Muslim world and is now referred to as “ The Shoe Thrower . ”
AP seems to have missed the symbolic significance of his assault weapon of choice .
My Indonesian students understand the meaning of shoes perfectly well .
They almost agreed with my Iraqi student ’s assessment and the implications of the “ shoe throwing ” incident .
One commented that in a symbolic sense this will have more important and longer lasting consequences than the attempted “ shoe bombing . ”
Sometimes symbolic violence is , historically speaking , more damaging than physical violence .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

PHOENIX – A federal court ruled that a class action lawsuit charging that Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio illegally profiled Latinos can proceed .
In July 2008 , five individuals and Somos America , a Latino community - based coalition , sued Arpaio , the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office ( MCSO ) and Maricopa County , claiming that they or their members were unlawfully stopped and mistreated by law enforcement agents because they were Latino .
The county asked the U.S. District Court in Arizona to dismiss the lawsuit in October , but today 's ruling clears the way for the lawsuit to go forward .
The court recognized that Latino appearance is of " little or no use " in determining which individuals should be stopped by law enforcement seeking " illegal aliens , " and that reasonable suspicion of a traffic violation does not justify questioning of drivers or passengers about immigration status .
" At stake in this case is a matter of acute public importance .
Law enforcement practices that target a group based solely on the color of their skin have no place in America , " said Peter Kozinets , an attorney at Steptoe & Johnson LLP in Phoenix who argued the case .
" This is a critical step in protecting the rights of all people in this country . "
The American Civil Liberties Union , the ACLU of Arizona , the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund ( MALDEF ) and lead counsel Steptoe & Johnson LLP are representing the five individuals and Somos America and charge that the policies and practices of Arpaio and the county are discriminatory and unlawfully violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution , Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Arizona Constitution .
The amended lawsuit builds upon an earlier complaint filed in December 2007 .
" We 're encouraged that the sheriff 's office 's practice of targeting people simply because of the color of their skin can now be fully examined in a court of law , " said ACLU of Arizona Legal Director Dan Pochoda , one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs .
" Sheriff Arpaio 's discriminatory policies have no place in a free country .
We do not want to live in a place where you can be stopped for no reason and asked for ' your papers please . ' "
Arpaio has launched a series of so - called " crime suppression sweeps " in Maricopa County in Latino neighborhoods and in areas where Latinos work as day laborers .
Maricopa County residents and local officials alike have complained that the conduct of the sheriff and his office go well beyond the scope of the MCSO 's legal authority and often results in the harassment of Latinos .
" We are very pleased that this important case will be heard , " said MALDEF staff attorney Kristina Campbell .
" In America we value fairness and equality , but Sheriff Arpaio 's sweeps have resulted in the harassment of Latinos and violated their civil rights .
There 's nothing fair about that . "
Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon has denounced Sheriff Arpaio and last April , after the MCSO engaged in sweeps in the town of Guadalupe , Gordon formally requested that former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey launch a Justice Department investigation into Sheriff Arpaio's and the MCSO 's " discriminatory harassment , improper stops , searches and arrests " of Latino persons in Maricopa County .
Gordon has also publicly stated that the sweeps are interfering with the work of undercover city police officers and federal agents .
Lawyers on the case , Ortega Melendres , et al. v. Arpaio , et al. , include Mónica Ramírez of the ACLU Immigrants ' Rights Project ; Pochoda of the ACLU of Arizona ; Campbell and Nancy Ramirez of MALDEF ; and Kozinets , David Bodney , Karen Hartman - Tellez and Isaac Hernandez of Steptoe & Johnson LLP .
Today 's ruling is online at : www.aclu.org/immigrants/gen/38709lgl20090210.html

On the ride over to Concord ( for the DMV hearing pertaining to Lauran ) some fellow liberty activists and I spotted a City of Keene police cruiser speeding along Route 9 in Hillsborough .
As you can see in the video , the driver is obviously concerned about the safety of the drivers around him with his excessive speed , tailgating , and swerving .
The video is narrated so it ’s best you watch it , since I ’d just be repeating what ’s said .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0WWN8R-qq4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC6P056PG34
Later at the DMV hearing , I could n’t hide the large smirk on my face .
The DMV bureaucrat claimed Lauren endangered the safety of other drivers on the roads , because of her disobedience to the law , not because she actually posed a threat or hurt anyone .
Double standards ?
Hypocrisy ?
I think the answer is quite clear and exposes the state of the current social order .
On a side note , there were no City of Keene police officers present at the hearing for Lauren so the end destination of this cruiser is still unknown .
UK Air Force deploys world ’s most advanced spy plane
February 11 , 2009 by intelNews
By IAN ALLEN | intelNews.org |
Britain ’s Royal Air Force ( RAF ) has announced the official deployment of what it describes as “ the most advanced long - range , airborne surveillance system of its kind in the world ” .
The aircraft - based system is called ASTOR ( Airborne Stand - Off Radar ) and is installed on Raytheon ’s Sentinel R1 jets .
The ASTOR radar is reportedly so advanced that it can detect target movement over “ thousands of square miles , looking deep into valleys , picking out well - used enemy routes and mapping vehicle activity ” , and can even perform during bad weather at night .
What is more , the twin - engine aircraft can do all that while flying up to 7.5 miles above ground level , thus staying clear of any engagement by most air - defense systems , including surface - to - air missiles .
Britain ’s Defense Ministry has said the per-unit cost of this new system is around £ 200,000 ( nearly $ 300,000 ) .
It also revealed earlier this month that the radar - equipped jets were successfully tested in Afghanistan in November and December of 2008 .
More information about the ASTOR system and the Sentinel R1 can be found here ( in .pdf ) .
So President Obama got his stimulus bill .
For a mere $ 787 billion , he has pledged to " save or create " 3.5 million jobs .
That 's only $ 224,857 and change per job !
( If I still have my job next year , will he take credit for saving it ? )
But wait .
Only 3.5 million jobs ?
Why so few ?
It 's not like creating jobs is difficult .
Egypt built more than 100 pyramids beginning sometime in the third millennium B.C. to house the corpses of the pharaohs and their significant others .
Think of all the jobs that project created .
I 'll bet the unemployment rate was something any pharaoh could have proudly campaigned for reelection on -- if he faced election , that is .
Pyramid building is one heck of a public - works project .
Its economic significance was not lost on that great advocate of full employment through public works , John Maynard Keynes .
The British economist , so in vogue today , famously wrote in " The General Theory " ( 1936 ) , " Pyramid - building , earthquakes , even wars may serve to increase wealth " .
In fact , pyramids are even better than the usual government project .
Keynes said : " Two pyramids . . . are twice as good as one ; but not so two railways from London to York . "
Ancient Egypt 's success has many applications today .
We could have full employment overnight if the government simply outlawed machines .
Today 's 7 percent unemployment rate would vanish .
Again , we find an endorsement in Keynes 's " General Theory " : " ' To dig holes in the ground , ' paid for out of savings , will increase , not only employment , but the real national dividend of useful goods and services " .
Exhibit B is Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
I do n't mean his public - works projects , like the Civilian Conservation Corps .
I 'm talking about his most serious job - creating operation : the draft .
In September 1940 , Roosevelt signed the Selective Act , which ordered all males 21 - 35 to register for military service .
" Of the 16 million persons who served in the armed forces at some time during the war , 10 million were conscripted , and many of those who volunteered did so only to avoid the draft ... " writes Robert Higgs in " Depression , War and Cold War . "
The draft marked the beginning of the end to the double - digit unemployment that had plagued America for a decade .
Two years earlier , Roosevelt 's treasury secretary , Henry Morgenthau , lamented , " [ A ] fter eight years of this Administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started " .
The draft was the answer they had sought all that time .
So creating jobs is not difficult for government .
What is difficult for government is creating jobs that produce wealth .
Pyramids , holes in the ground and war do not produce wealth .
They destroy wealth .
They take valuable resources and convert them into something less valuable .
Instead of iPods , great art , cures for diseases and machines that replace back - breaking work , we get the equivalent of digging holes and filling them up .
Under President Obama's " stimulus " plan , jobs will be created to weatherize buildings , construct schools and wind turbines , and repair roads and bridges .
But outside the market process , there is no way to know whether those are better uses of scarce capital than whatever would have been produced had it been left in the private economy .
Since government services are paid for through the compulsion of taxes , they have no market price .
But without market prices , we have no way of knowing the importance that free people would place on those services versus other things they want .
So although we 'll see the government putting people to work and even some new schools and bridges , we wo n't be able to calculate how much wealth we 've lost because scarce resources were misallocated by the politicians .
Nevertheless , we can be sure we will have lost .
If the government 's projects were truly worthwhile , they would be undertaken by private efforts , and in their quest for profits , entrepreneurs would handle them more efficiently .
Remember this when President Obama begins to boast about how successful his stimulus plan is .
Michelle Obama 's fashion sense is being closely followed President Barack Obama 's wife Michelle is the cover girl for the March edition of fashion magazine Vogue .
It is only the second time an American First Lady has taken the place of a model on a Vogue cover - the other was Hillary Clinton in 1998 .
Mrs Obama , who was photographed wearing outfits she chose herself , says she is aware her wardrobe is under scrutiny .
" I 'm not going to pretend that I do n't care about it .
But I also have to be practical , " she told Vogue magazine .
Annie Leibovitz photographed Mrs Obama wearing a magenta silk dress designed by Jason Wu for the cover portrait .
It is the second time she has chosen to wear one of his creations for a high - profile public appearance .
She wore a long white gown by Wu for the inauguration balls on 20 January .
Mrs Obama 's sense of style has proved influential .
On the day she dressed her family in clothes from J Crew for her husband 's inauguration , the company 's shares leapt 10 % .
In the accompanying interview for Vogue , Mrs Obama also talks about her role as a social hostess .
" We want entertaining in the White House to feel like America , that we are reminded of all the many facets of our culture .
The Latino community , the Asian - American community , the African - American community ... hip -hop , spoken word - we want to bring the youth in , for them to hear their voices in this , " she said .
On her self - declared role as " mom - in - chief " she will try to take her daughters Malia and Sasha to school every morning , though she acknowledges this may not always be possible .
" I like to be a presence in my kids ' school .
I want to know the teachers ; I want to know the parents . "
Apart from Bess Truman , Vogue has photographed the wife of every American president since 1929 when President Herbert Hoover 's wife , Lou Henry Hoover , was featured .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - With many U.S. newspapers struggling to survive , a Democratic senator on Tuesday introduced a bill to help them by allowing newspaper companies to restructure as nonprofits with a variety of tax breaks .
“ This may not be the optimal choice for some major newspapers or corporate media chains but it should be an option for many newspapers that are struggling to stay afloat , ” said Senator Benjamin Cardin .
A Cardin spokesman said the bill had yet to attract any co-sponsors , but had sparked plenty of interest within the media , which has seen plunging revenues and many journalist layoffs .
Cardin ’s Newspaper Revitalization
Act would allow newspapers to operate as nonprofits for educational purposes under the U.S. tax code , giving them a similar status to public broadcasting companies .
Under this arrangement , newspapers would still be free to report on all issues , including political campaigns .
But they would be prohibited from making political endorsements .
Advertising and subscription revenue would be tax exempt , and contributions to support news coverage or operations could be tax deductible .
Because newspaper profits have been falling in recent years , “ no substantial loss of federal revenue ” was expected under the legislation , Cardin ’s office said in a statement .
Cardin ’s office said his bill was aimed at preserving local and community newspapers , not conglomerates which may also own radio and TV stations .
His bill would also let a non -profit buy newspapers owned by a conglomerate .
“ We are losing our newspaper industry , ” Cardin said .
“ The economy has caused an immediate problem , but the business model for newspapers , based on circulation and advertising revenue , is broken , and that is a real tragedy for communities across the nation and for our democracy .
Newspaper subscriptions and advertising have shrunk dramatically in the past few years as Americans have turned more and more to the Internet or television for information .
In recent months , the Seattle Post - Intelligencer , the Rocky Mountain News , the Baltimore Examiner and the San Francisco Chronicle have ceased daily publication or announced that they may have to stop publishing .
In December the Tribune Company , which owns a number of newspapers including The Baltimore Sun , The Chicago Tribune and The Los Angeles Times filed for bankruptcy protection .
Two newspaper chains , Gannett Co Inc and Advance Publications , on Monday announced employee furloughs .
It will be the second furlough this year at Gannett .

CAIRO , Egypt ( CNN ) -- Israeli and Hamas negotiators have " almost reached agreement " on a long - term truce for Gaza , a spokesman for Hamas told CNN early Friday .
Hamas supporters stand on the rubble of a building hit by an Israeli strike .
Tahir Annono , who is in Cairo for the truce meetings , said that more meetings would take place Friday and Saturday , and on Sunday an announcement would be made .
It was not immediately clear if Israel was in agreement .
Hamas ' deputy leader , Moussa Abu Marzouk , said that the truce would last for 18 months and that all commercial border crossings between Gaza and Israel would be opened .
Marzouk spoke after a meeting at a Cairo hotel between representatives of Hamas and Egyptian intelligence officials .
Egypt has been working to broker an agreement between the two sides .
Israel and Hamas , the Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , declared separate , tentative cease - fires January 21 following more than three weeks of fighting in Gaza .
Marzouk said that any discussion of a prisoner exchange was " a separate issue " that had " nothing to do with the truce . "

Leadership changes in Cuba could bring opportunities , the report suggests
The US economic embargo on Cuba " has failed " and should be re-evaluated , senior Republican Senator Richard Lugar argues in a report .
" We must recognise the ineffectiveness of our current policy and deal with the Cuba regime in a way that enhances US interests , " Senator Lugar says .
President Barack Obama has promised a new look at US policy towards Cuba , including easing travel restrictions .
But he has said he believes the embargo is an " inducement " for change in Cuba .
Senator Lugar , the senior Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a hugely influential figure in US politics , says Washington 's policies towards Havana have been ineffective .
" After 47 years ... the unilateral embargo on Cuba has failed to achieve its stated purpose of ' bringing democracy to the Cuban people ' , " he says .
" It may have been used as a foil by the regime to demand further sacrifices from Cuba 's impoverished people . "
Have Your Say After 47 years an embargo is not going to facilitate a regime change Sam Compton , USA Senator Lugar 's views are contained in a report that was drawn up by a member of his staff and was due to be released on Monday .
" By directing policy toward an unlikely scenario of a short - term democratic transition on the island and rejecting most tools of diplomatic engagement , the US is left as a powerless bystander , watching events unfold at a distance , " the report says .
It stops short of calling for the trade embargo to be lifted but does urge : an end to restrictions imposed during the Bush administration on travel and remittances to Cuba
reinstituting formal co-operation on migration and tackling drug - trafficking
allowing Cuba to buy US agricultural products on credit .
The report , which comes a year after Fidel Castro officially handed over power to his brother , Raul , suggests leadership changes provide an opportunity to rethink policy .
Growing consensus Washington 's long - standing economic isolation of Cuba is one of the most ideological and controversial elements of US foreign policy , says BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus .
But this report points to growing cross-party consensus that this policy has to change , he says .
Sales of US farming goods have been allowed since 2000 but on a cash basis President Obama has indicated that he would be open to dialogue with Cuba 's leaders .
He also supports easing restrictions on the number of visits Cuban - Americans can make to the island and the amount of money they can send .
During last year 's presidential election campaign , Mr Obama said the embargo had not helped bring democracy to Cuba but he added that it did provide an " inducement " to change .
The Obama administration has so far not devoted much attention to Cuba and Latin America , given more pressing issues at home and abroad .
But an administration official told the Washington Post newspaper that it was " not unreasonable " to expect that Mr Obama would ease the limits on family travel and remittances to Cuba before he attends the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago in April .
In a separate development , a bipartisan bill to restore the right of US citizens to travel to Cuba was presented in the US House of Representatives earlier this month .

Richard Metzger is Boing Boing 's current guest blogger .
Okay , I 'll admit that I came to the immense pleasures of Canada 's greatest export , " Trailer Park Boys " a little late in the party .
By the time I downloaded a 17GB torrent file of " the complete Trailer Park Boys " it was indeed just that , complete , with a bow on top .
Two feature films and seven TV series , a total of 56 episodes of some of the funniest television I have ever seen .
My wife and I positively gorged ourselves on these shows .
We 'd often watch six a night , one after the other like it was comedy crack .
Finally after three weeks or so , the well ran dry .
No more " Trailer Park Boys " !!
We were majorly bummed out .
We went through withdrawal symptoms .
We were sad .
It was bad , real , real bad .
But then –hooray– they did a new Christmas special !!
Hearing THAT was the best present I could have gotten , believe me !
And the Christmas show ended with the set - up to a new feature film that will appear in 2009 , " Countdown To Liquor Day . "
In my household , this was off - the - scale good news .
Here is a selection of short –but exemplary – clips from " Trailer Park Boys . "
If like me , you somehow tragically managed to live your life without being acquainted with the distinctly UN - subtle comedic charms of Canada 's favorite bad boys , Julian , Ricky , Bubbles ( and let 's not forget Mister Lahey , the greatest screen lush since WC Fields ) and you find that these clips tickle your funny bone , rejoice , you have hours and hours of the most side - splitting humor still to discover .
And if you are already a TPB fan –and you know who you are– post in the forums and encourage other Boing Boing readers to check out this masterpiece of mirth and mayhem .
Who knows , maybe even Coop will get around to watching the DVD I gave him ?
Ricky and Bubbles fight

Breaking up is hard to do -- perhaps even more so during a recession .
Sallie Frederick is divorcing but can't sell her home , so she 's still living with her husband for now .
Just ask Sallie Frederick of Darien , Connecticut .
She and her husband of 15 years are divorcing , but they both live in the house they can't sell because of the sour state of the economy .
" My husband lives in the guest room , and he comes home on Wednesday nights early to have dinner with the kids , and the other nights he comes home late to give me my space , so it 's , it 's not perfect , " she told CNN 's " Your $ $ $ $ $ " program .
" It 's been difficult . "
The stress of the country 's economic meltdown is taking its toll on marriages .
And while there is no definitive evidence that says people seek divorce more or less frequently during an economic slump , what is clear is that couples in marital turmoil are feeling extra stress because of the economy .
Some , like the Fredericks , can't leave their current situation because the financial costs are too great and because it 's too difficult to sell their house .

Others may jump into divorce because of the economic strain or because divorce during hard times could be weirdly profitable .
The Cordell and Cordell law firm , which bills itself as one of the largest divorce firms in the country , has been running radio ads suggesting people whose assets have tanked may want to consider divorce because they 'll lose less money to their partner , said Joseph Cordell , the firm 's principal partner .
Cordell said the advice is meant only for couples who are certain they want to divorce .
" For guys that know they 're going to end up getting divorced , they really need to realize that , oddly enough , it 's when they can least afford it that it can make the most sense , " he said .
Gary Becker , an economics professor at the University of Chicago , said past recessions have led to more couples splitting up " mainly because of the uncertainty and unemployment of both spouses . "
But those separations may not result in legal divorce because of the costs , he said .
Sallie Frederick , whose husband declined to comment for this story , says she began divorce proceedings in October and expects the divorce to be final in about a month .
But their house is n't likely to sell in this slow market .
That means truly splitting up may be months off .
" Right now there are 20 houses in town on the market that are in our price range , and there are no buyers , " she said .
" So my broker has pretty much prepared me that the house is going to sit for quite a while . "
Divorce attorney Raoul Felder says couples such as the Fredericks are making the smart financial choice by living together through separation .
" People have to decide how much they hate each other , because if they can still live with each other , and the house or the apartment is big enough , they ought to stay together and wait for a rising market , " Felder says .
Divorce financial planner Gabrielle Clemens says many couples do n't have the $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 to hire an attorney for the process .
" If you can't even retain a lawyer and you have nothing to divide up except for debt , then I think you 're better off to wait , " she said .
" I think that 's what a lot of people are doing . "
Cordell said a contested divorce involving child custody could cost up to $ 30,000 .
Divorce attorney Felder says deciding to divorce right now is a " guessing game " about the economy .
On average , he said a divorce takes eight months .
Couples have to decide if they think the economy will be any better by the time the divorce is done .
" You have got to do a very careful arithmetic , " Felder says .
" The best advice you can give people , if they can stand it :
You are swimming against the tide at this point .
Tread water a little bit .
Wait for the economy to rebound . "
Staying together -- even for a few more months -- could save thousands of dollars .
" A little misery is worth a lot of money , " says Felder .
" So try to stay married if you possibly can . "
That leaves couples who are divorcing and want to live apart , like Sallie Frederick and her husband , in limbo .
Sallie Frederick , who has a business as a life coach , says the difficulty of what a lot of men and women are going through is the uncertainty .
" What is going to happen in a month ?
What is that picture going to look like ?
I do n't know , " she said .
" I do n't know where am I going to be living .
It 's the unknown that I think is frightening . "

Comment on this article
Reputed to have come from Donald Trump ’s publicity people , the following tale found its way into the news media via the magazine Forbes in February 1996 :
This may well be the public relations gesture of the year .
During the 1995 Christmas holidays , Donald Trump and Marla Maples find themselves marooned in their stretch limo with a flat tire on a busy stretch of New Jersey highway .
Finally , a passing motorist spots the limo in distress and offers to help the chauffeur change the tire .
Driver says , sure .
Before the re-tired limo rolls off , the darkened window rolls down and an effusive Trump asks what he and his wife can do to repay the favor .
Just send my wife a big bouquet of flowers , says the guy , handing Trump a card with his wife ’s name and their address .
Two weeks later a gargantuan bouquet of orchids arrives with a card reading , “ We paid off your home mortgage , Marla and Donald . ”
The Trumps flackery wo n’t reveal the lucky chap ’s name , but Informer hears Trump forked over more than $ 100,000 for the gesture .
Eyebrows should have been raised by this tale , as even back in the mid-1990s it was already a recognized urban legend that had been told about many other celebrities .
Casting doubt on the notion that it subsequently became a true legend was the lack of checkable details provided by Trump ’s people , as exemplified by 1996 news reports that noted “ The Trumps flackery wo n’t reveal the lucky chap ’s name , but Informer hears Trump forked over more than $ 100,000 for the gesture . ”
!function(r,u,m,b,l,e){r._Rumble=b , r[ b ] || ( r [ b ] =function ( ) {( r [ b ] ._=r[ b ] ._| | [ ] ) .push ( arguments ) ; if( r[ b]
._.length==1){l=u.createElement(m),e=u.getElementsByTagName(m) [0] ,l.async=1,l.src= ” https://rumble.com/embedJS/ucxbq”+(arguments[1].video?’.’+arguments[1].video:”)+”/?url=”+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+”&args=”+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify([].slice.apply(arguments))),e.parentNode.insertBefore(l,e)}})}(window, document , “ script ” , “ Rumble ” ) ;
Rumble ( “ play ” , { “ video ” : “ v3t25r ” , ” div ” : “ rumble_v3t25r ” , ” autoplay ” : 2} ) ;
Speaking plainly , we have an unsubstantiated rumor of celebrity good - deeding being spread by those who work for a man who courts the limelight at every opportunity .
The tale ’s details are fuzzy , too : one version has the event occurring while Donald Trump was married to Ivana and driving in Michigan , yet other versions place it during his marriage to Marla and had him driving in New Jersey or in Canada near Casino Niagara .
In every case what ’s lacking is confirmation from the lad whose mortgage was paid , the limousine driver , or anyone who worked at the tire - changer ’s bank ( and would thus have been in on the mortgage ’s retirement ) .
Is it reasonable to assume someone so rewarded would fail to tell his family , friends , and co-workers about his encounter with a famous millionaire , especially the part about the wealthy one ’s repaying a small kindness in so overwhelming a fashion ?
Is it reasonable that his wife would similarly remain silent ?
If you think not , you should be asking why the tire - changer ’s name is still unknown , why his story did n’t escape into the community where he lives and from there make its way to the media , why you ’ve yet to see so much as one televised interview with him .
In fact , back in 1997 , when the Donald Trump version of the tale was still relatively new , Trump ’s office was actively denying its truthfulness :
The implausible story making the rounds at Toronto doughnut shops is that somebody ’s newphew ’s friend ’s cousin , Joe , was driving down Highway 401 in his pickup truck when he spotted a white stretch limousine , with its hood up , on the shoulder .
Joe , being a good samaritan , stopped to help .
Within minutes , he got the limo running and a grateful driver asked for Joe ’s card so he could send him a little something .
“ Nah , ” Joe said .
“ It was nothing .
I was just trying to be helpful . ”
The driver insisted , so Joe gave him a card and forgot about it .
A week later , he got a call from his bank informing him that his $ 160,000 mortgage had been paid off by Donald Trump , who was a passenger in the limo .
“ We ’ve heard the story , ” said an irritated - sounding assistant of Mr. Trump ’s at his New York office .
“ No , it is n’t true . ”
The story also fails the plausibility check : would n’t the driver of the limousine be able to change a tire on his own , or at least be able to make a cell phone call to AAA for assistance with a minor mechanical problem ?
Trump ’s first wife , Ivana , could — and indeed did — change a tire when sidelined with a flat , making it all the more surprising Trump ’s chauffeur lacked this skill yet apparently kept his job ( especially in light of his employer ’s notorious impatience with those who fail to perform ) .
Gulling a number of people was The Donald ’s own confirmation of the tale during a January 2005 episode of his television series , The Apprentice .
When asked about the veracity of this legend by one of those vying for the show ’s ultimate prize , Trump simply responded , “ That ’s true . ”
For many , his saying so was all the proof that mattered .
Yet he is far from the first celebrity to claim an item of contemporary lore as an anecdote from his own life ( see our page about the Hare Dryer legend for a number of such examples ) .
Moreover , news accounts from 2016 revealed that Trump had long been posing as a publicist to brag about himself , and he has a decades - old reputation for being less than truthful about himself , as illustrated by this excerpt from a 1997 New Yorker article :
Alair Townsend , a former deputy mayor in the Koch administration , once quipped , “ I would n’t believe Donald Trump if his tongue were notarized . ”
In time , this bon mot became misattributed to Leona Helmsley , who was only too happy to claim authorship .
Last fall [ 1996 ] after Evander Holyfield upset Mike Tyson in a heavyweight title fight , Trump snookered the News into reporting that he ’d collected twenty million bucks by betting a million on the underdog .
This prompted the Post to make calls to some Las Vegas bookies who confirmed — shockingly ! — that nobody had been handling that kind of action or laying odds close to 20 - 1 .
Trump never blinked , just moved on to the next bright idea .
The legend of the good Samaritan , the disabled car , and the celebrity ’s generosity has been told of others over the years .
It ’s a classic windfall legend .
Each of us would like to believe an ordinary kindness on our part would result in manna from heaven falling our way , which is why this legend speaks directly to us .
We can see ourselves on the receiving end of all those golden goodies , and it reaffirms our faith in the world in that we want to believe good deeds do n’t go unrewarded .
Oscar Wilde used a similar plot for his 1891 short story “ A Model Millionaire . ”
In it , Hughie is a lad who has stopped to visit an artist friend .
He is momentarily left alone in the company of the wretch the painter is using as his model and is touched by the old man ’s tattered appearance .
He slips the beggar a gold sovereign , realizing it ’s all the mad money he has for the month but that the elderly fellow needs it so much more than he does .
The beggar smiles , pockets the coin , and thanks Hughie .
We later discover the beggar is in reality Baron Hausberg , a millionaire who for no clearly stated reason enjoys posing for this particular artist .
The Baron sends a wedding gift of £ 10,000 to Hughie as his way of thanking the young man who was moved to help an unfortunate .
We also found a Henry Ford version of this legend in a 1954 collection of inspirational tales :
Honk - honk , honk - honk , honk - honk - honk .
The old - fashioned horn was bellowing as the mechanical contraption came around the bend and rushed along the dusty road .
The engine was roaring and the radiator hissing as the long - suffering warrior did twenty - five miles per hour .
It was one of the earliest Ford cars ; the Methuselah of engineering .
Men said it would never die a natural death : it would either commit suicide or be smashed by modern unpredictables .
Honk - honk , chug - chug - chug ; and the wizened old farmer , with a thick growth of beard darkening his chin , steered his car homeward .
Suddenly , ahead of him he saw a beautiful car drawn up by the roadside .
It was an immaculate product of modern engineering .
Long and low , its lines were fascinating ; but it was at a standstill !
As the farmer drew nearer he recognized that some kind of engine trouble had interrupted the progress of the other travellers .
The shining bonnet of the beautiful car had been lifted , and the chauffeur , with cap pushed well back on his head , was perplexedly staring at the unresponsive engine .
With a sound of squealing brakes the old car was brought to a halt , and as a rusty door swung open , the farmer came out to ask , “ What ’s wrong ? ”
The stranger responded , “ I do n’t know .
The engine has stopped . ”
The newcomer looked inside the bonnet , and then announced his readiness to tow the car to the garage seven miles away .
The stranded driver casually lifted his eyebrows and answered , “ You ’ll tow me to the garage ! ”
What with ?
That ! ”
And his finger indicated the noisy model T .
The farmer ’s chest expanded , and he seemed about to explode ; but the eruption died , and he answered , “ Yes , with that .
You ’ll see . ”
He lifted a rope from the back of his car , placed it in position , and said , “ Now get in , and I ’ll show you . ”
Slowly the great car was taken along the roads , and finally , as the garage came into view , the farmer smiled and prepared to stop .
“ Well !
She did it , did n’t she ? ”
The two drivers were then joined by a third man , who all the while had been sitting in the back of the broken - down limousine .
Quietly he asked , “ What do I owe you , sir ? ”
The farmer ’s eyes narrowed as he repeated , “ What do you owe ?
Nothing .
It ’s a ____ of a do if we ca n’t help each other without being paid for it .
No. Nothing .
Pleased to help you .
Good day . ”
He coiled his rope , climbed into the driving seat , and soon disappeared in a cloud of dust .
The silent passenger calmly watched his departure , and then smiled .
He nodded and quietly repeated to himself , “ It ’s a ____ of a do if we ca n’t help each other without being paid for it . ”
In due course the wheezy , asthmatical model T reached the end of its career .
It has not been placed on record whether the end came suddenly , or whether the closing months were marred by internal disorders .
The fact is that the old car succumbed to the ravages of time , and was given a respectable funeral in the junk yard .
The day after the ceremony , the bereaved farmer was somewhat astounded to find a new Ford car standing a few yards from his door .
The old man paused .
Had someone called ?
No !
He rubbed his eyes ; the car was so new , so glossy , so desirable .
He walked around it , and then opened the door to inspect the interior .
He saw a message written on a label tied to the steering wheel .
“ It ’s a ____ of a do if we ca n’t help each other without being paid for it . ”
The passenger who had offered in vain to pay for the towing of his car had been the great manufacturer — Henry Ford .
Probably he had been fascinated by the achievement of one of his earlier models , and when its proud owner refused remuneration , he thought of another way to pay his debt .
Probably he commissioned the garage owner to keep watch , and when the old model T ceased to function , to present , with Henry Ford ’s compliments , a new car to the kind - hearted farmer .
In 1989 the variation of the moment of the unrecognized celebrity rescued by a Samaritan starred Mrs. Nat King Cole .
Car troubles supposedly stranded her on the shoulder of a Los Angeles freeway , and she was said to have rewarded the kind man who stopped to render assistance with a new car ( variously reported as a Cadillac , Lincoln , or Rolls - Royce . )
In 1997 a version of the Mrs. Nat King Cole legend tied to the death of her husband was circulating on the Internet .
It appears to have been lifted word for word from the 1997 book Chicken Soup for the Woman ’s Soul :
One night , at 11:30 PM , an older African - American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rain storm .
Her car had broken down , and she desperately needed a ride .
Soaking wet , she decided to flag down the next car .
A young white man stopped to help her — generally unheard of in those conflict - filled 1960s .
The man took her to safety , helped her get assistance and put her into a taxi cab .
She seemed to be in a big hurry !
However , she wrote down his address , thanked him , and drove away .
Seven days went by and a knock came on the man ’s door .
To his surprise , a giant combination console color TV and stereo record player were delivered to his home .
A special note was attached .
The note read :
Dear Mr. James :
Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night .
The rain drenched not only my clothes but my spirits .
Then you came along .
Because of you , I was able to make it to my dying husband ’s bedside just before he passed away .
God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others .
Sincerely ,
Mrs. Nat King Cole .
Though it ’s a lovely story , it too did n’t happen .
Nat King Cole died of lung cancer at dawn on 15 February 1965 in Santa Monica , California .
He was hospitalized in December 1964 , and on 25 January 1965 his left lung was removed .
At least from the date of his operation until his death , Maria Cole was with him every day .
There was no opportunity for her to have been stranded in the rain beside an Alabama highway in the weeks leading up to her husband ’s death .
She was sitting with him when he passed away , and none of the newspapers that commented on her vigil made mention of a last - minute dash to the hospital , an automotive breakdown , or a helpful Samaritan who got her there in time .
Another version of the car breakdown legend gives the famous person as Perry Como and has him mailing his rescuer a set of keys to a new car .
This tale is told as happening all over the place , so I wonder at Perry ’s ability to buy all these people cars but not provide himself with reliable transportation .
Yet another twist has the disabled car story happening to Como ’s wife , and the payoff she provides is either a color TV or tickets to her husband ’s upcoming concert .
It ’s also told of Mrs. Leon Spinks , and the reward she grants are tickets to her hubby ’s upcoming fight in New Orleans .
( Moral of the story : if you want the big ticket items , do n’t settle for rescuing the wife of a celebrity ; hold out for the man himself . )
In February 2000 , a version starring Bill Gates began circulating on the Internet :
Apparently a couple returning home from a skiing trip in British Columbia spots a disabled car at the side of the road and a man in distress .
Being good citizens they stop to help .
The car has either a flat tire and the Good Samaritan fixes it quickly .
The man was very grateful , but had no cash with him to reward them , so asked for their name and address so he could send them a little something .
A week later the couple receives a call from their banker stating that their mortgage had been paid and $ 10,000 had been deposited in their account by a very grateful Bill Gates .
Getting back to Donald Trump , we find that on at least one verifiable occasion he ’s known to have bestowed largesse on a helpful stranger .
Trump ’s 79 - year - old mother was mugged in 1991 , suffering broken bones and severe facial bruises .
A passing truck driver who witnessed the assault brought down the mugger and handed him over to justice .
( The robber was later sentenced to 3 to 9 years in prison ) .
The Donald had dinner with the rescuer , his sister , and his son ; offered the Samaritan a better job ; and gave him a check for an undisclosed amount .
Even with a straight news story like this , a bit of manufactured memory has changed many people ’s recall of the event .
There are those who now swear they saw Donald Trump hand over an oversized , Ed McMahon - type check on TV .
Likely this “ Publisher ’s Clearing House ” mental image fits in better with our notion of how a celebrity would reward an ordinary fellow , hence the substituted memory .

Just Disgusting .
Too angry to write now , but I will later .
It ’s not a joke neither any mind reader .
MIT researchers Brandon Taylor and Michael Bove have invented a “ bar of soap ” .
This will be able to tell you what gadget you ’re pretending to use based on how you hold it .
Let ’s take a look on its structure and specifications .
It has 72 capacitive sensors and a three - axis accelerometer .
The prototype has a small screen that says what it believes you ’re pantomiming — camera , phone , PDA , gamepad , and remote control are demonstrated in the accompanying video .
For example let ’s take an example , if baseball is stuffed with sensors and used to determine what kind of pitch you have .
It will also good for high - tech golf clubs that inform you how incorrectly you are holding it and how much power and angle will require for the target .
So we will soon see this with some of the great player for their practice gadget .

Proofs are Programs : 19th Century Logic and 21st Century Computing
As the 19th century drew to a close , logicians formalized an ideal notion of proof .
They were driven by nothing other than an abiding interest in truth , and their proofs were as ethereal as the mind of God .
Yet within decades these mathematical abstractions were realized by the hand of man , in the digital stored - program computer .
How it came to be recognized that proofs and programs are the same is a story that spans a century , a chase with as many twists and turns as a thriller .
At the end of the story is a principle for designing programming languages that will guide computers into the 21st century .

Over in Europe , antitrust officials are just now gearing up an investigation into Microsoft ( MSFT ) for bundling IE with Windows .
But in Obama 's America , when it comes to antitrust , Google ( GOOG ) is the new Microsoft .
At least that 's what Christine Varney , Obama 's pick to head up the Justice Department ’s antitrust division , thinks .
Bloomberg has dug up a fascinating talk Christine gave last year , waving off Microsoft and warning on Google 's power .
And Christine knows a thing or two about Microsoft and antitrust :
In the Clinton administration , she lobbied the government on behalf of Netscape to investigate the Windows - maker .
The whole thing is worth a read .
We recently saw a proposed Yahoo ( YHOO ) - Google search deal scrapped on antitrust grounds , it looks like we should expect even more scrutiny of Google moves in this administration .
“ For me , Microsoft is so last century .
They are not the problem , ” Varney said at a June 19 panel discussion sponsored by the American Antitrust Institute .
The U.S. economy will “ continually see a problem -- potentially with Google ” because it already “ has acquired a monopoly in Internet online advertising , ” she said .
In her remarks at the American Antitrust Institute , Varney advocated aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws to curb the conduct of individual companies that dominate an industry .
She did n’t return a reporter ’s telephone call seeking comment today ...
Her comments on Google last year combined praise for the company along with her warnings .
The Mountain View , California - based company , owner of the world ’s most popular search engine , is a “ spectacular ” innovator that became the dominant online advertiser through “ terrific work , ” Varney said .
She also said Google had “ lawfully ” obtained its monopoly .
Still , Google is “ quickly gathering market power in what I would call an online computing environment in the clouds , ” she said , using a software industry term for software that is based on the Internet rather than in individual personal computers .
“ When all our enterprises move to computing in the clouds and there is a single firm that is offering a comprehensive solution , ” Varney said , “ you are going to see the same repeat of Microsoft . ”
SDXC , the new memory card spec announced at CES , promised exciting things , storage - wise .
Pretec demonstrated the first card that 'll support the standard , and at a mere 32 GB and 50 MB /s , well , it 's a step .

The SDXC standard claims a maximum capacity of 2TB , with read / write speeds of up to 104MB /s .
There 's no doubt that , at 50 MB/s , Pretec has achieved impressive speeds , but the company probably should have waited until they could put together an SDXC card with a greater actual capacity than existing SDHC products .
Still , to see an actual product so soon after the standard was announced is heartening , although Pretec has n't yet hinted at a price or release date .

— Diana Furchtgott - Roth , is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and former chief economist at the U.S. Department of Labor .
The views expressed are her own . —
At the very time that the Senate is debating whether to spend $ 800 billion or $ 900 billion to stimulate the economy , the government is considering other legislative and regulatory initiatives that would impede economic recovery .
Growing Protectionism
By inserting protectionist provisions that require some goods financed by the stimulus bill to be made in America , Congress is risking a trade war with important trading partners in Europe and Asia .
A trade war would reduce exports , potentially destroying millions of American jobs .
Cutting Defense Spending
Although Congress is trying to revive the economy by expanding domestic spending , the Pentagon is reportedly facing budget cuts next year .
But with President Obama promising to deploy more troops to Afghanistan , America needs more defense spending , not less .
America needs to purchase more weapons , ordnance , vehicles , and body armor so that our troops have the best equipment possible .
Defense supplies are generally made in America , and production employs Americans with a wide range of skills .
If America increases regular forces by 100,000 and hires 100,000 more civilians to support them , these individuals would acquire useful skills when they leave the Defense Department for the private sector .
Their presence would enable the Pentagon to bring home reserve and National Guard troops , some of whom have been deployed for over a year .
Individual Emissions Standards for States
Earlier this week auto companies revealed that sales had reached a 27 - year low .
Yet , under a new directive from President Obama , states such as California would be able to set their own emissions standards , which will be — you guessed it — stricter than federal law .
This would complicate engineering and production , raise costs , and send the industry into an even greater decline .
Since California is America ’s largest car market , companies would have to make lighter , more fuel - efficient cars that consumers might not want to purchase .
Domestic companies would be particularly hard - hit because they make larger cars .
It makes no sense for Congress to bail out Detroit with loans and give tax deductions for purchases of new cars and trucks , while at the same time decimating the market of the Big Three .
More red ink for the auto industry , and more layoffs across America .
Employee Free Choice Act
This misnamed bill would change the law to allow workplaces to be unionized without secret ballots .
A workplace could be unionized if a majority of workers sign an open card in favor of unionization — a process known as “ card check , ” exposing workers to union intimidation .
This bill passed the House in the 110th Congress and will be soon brought up in this congressional session .
One of the bill ’s House sponsors was House Committee on Education and Labor Chairman George Miller .
In 2001 , he and five colleagues wrote to the state arbitration board of Puebla , Mexico , saying , “ we feel that the secret ballot is absolutely necessary in order to ensure that workers are not intimidated into voting for a union they might not otherwise choose . ”
If Mexicans deserve a secret ballot , so do Americans .
States where employees do not have to join a union in order to work have lower average unemployment rates than other states , so it would not be surprising if increased unionization would raise unemployment rates .
As well as protectionism , cuts in defense spending , unionization by intimidation , and arbitrary environmental standards , the economic stimulus bill would open the floodgates of deficit spending .
The ensuing debt would burden Americans far into the future .
The Democrats , who control both the White House and Congress , should know better .
No wonder consumers are scared , financial markets are tumbling , and unemployment continues to rise .

PRESIDENT
Obama has laid out an ambitious agenda for dealing with our energy needs and climate change : he proposes to double the supply of renewable energy within three years , establish a cap - and - trade program to reduce carbon emissions and use federal stimulus dollars to help homes , businesses and governments use energy more efficiently .
This is the right blueprint for increasing the number of green jobs , encouraging economic growth , ensuring that the United States has the energy it needs at reasonable prices , and reducing the risk of global climate change .
But as Congress translates this grand plan into legislation , lawmakers should resist calls to add an extensive and costly new transmission system that would carry electricity from remote areas like Texas , the Great Plains and Eastern Canada to places with high energy demands like Boston , Chicago and New York .
This idea is being promoted by energy companies and by elected officials who see it as an economic development opportunity for their particular state or region .
Long - distance transmission lines are needed , they argue , to ensure that the president ’s energy goals are met .
But there are better  and cheaper  ways to get more clean power flowing to the big cities .
Renewable energy resources are found all across the country ; they do n’t need to be harnessed from just one place .
In the Northwest , the largest amount of green power comes from hydroelectricity .
In the Northeast , the best source may be the wind over the ocean , because it blows harder and more consistently there than on land .
Offshore wind farms have been proposed for Delaware , Massachusetts , New Jersey and Rhode Island .
In the Southwest , solar energy can be tapped on a large scale .
And in the Southeast , biomass from forests may one day be a major source of sustainable power .
In each area , developing these power sources would be cheaper than piping in clean energy from thousands of miles away .
Unlike our federal highway system , which is needed to transport goods across the country , or the “ information superhighway ” of the Internet , which is the fastest way to carry information around the world , long - distance transmission lines have no inherent value .
On the contrary , the farther electricity is transported , the more of it is dissipated .
“ Line loss , ” as this is called , gobbles up an estimated 2 percent to 3 percent of electricity nationally .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
With their fourth - quarter financial results , asset - management firms will likely turn a spotlight on some of the worst - ever numbers reported by the sector , as borne out by falling asset values , investor redemptions and declining margins , according to analysts .
In light of the bleak outlook , analysts who follow the sector have been busy cutting their bottom - line estimates for most money managers .
" We believe the fourth quarter is likely to go down in the record books as the sharpest one - quarter decline in operating earnings for most asset managers , " said Robert Lee , analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods , in a report published Tuesday .
And while the fourth quarter will be bad -- a vivid reflection of the collapse in global financial markets that gained momentum in October and carried over into November -- the outlook for 2009 is n't much better .
" Sharply lower managed asset levels and the resulting drop in revenues will drive operating margins significantly lower , as expense reductions fail to offset the impact on the top line , " said Matt Snowling , analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey , in a research report dated Jan .
8 .
The managers most likely to see the greatest year - on - year decline in operating earnings , Snowling told clients , are those that " historically exhibit the greatest operating leverage " -- T. Rowe Price Group TROW , - 0.82 % , Franklin Resources Inc. BEN , - 0.79 % and Janus Capital Group JNS .
Broad - based pain
Lee cut target prices and estimates for the fourth quarter as well as 2008 and 2009 for some of the asset managers that he covers .
The biggest reductions in fourth - quarter estimates were for BlackRock Inc. BLK , - 0.68 % and Janus .
Specifically , Lee revised his estimate for Janus to a quarterly loss of 4 cents a share , down from a profit of 18 cents a share previously , and halved his quarterly profit estimate for BlackRock , to 80 cents a share from $ 1.61 a share .
He also reducted his 2009 profit estimate for Janus the most , by more than 21 % , to 59 cents a share from a prior forecast of 75 cents a share .
" We expect [ Janus ' ] flow trends to be pressured in the fourth quarter and into 2009 , somewhat exacerbated by the recent weakness in performance in key growth products , " said Lee .
In a similar vein , Credit Suisse analyst Craig Siegenthaler highlighted what called deterioration in how Janus funds hae performed .
Janus " displayed the largest deterioration in relative fund performance over the past month , as the percentage of assets under management rated four or five stars declined from 62 % to 47 % , " Siegenthaler wrote in a Jan. 6 research note .
" This level is still 13 % above the average asset manager ; however , Janus ' levels have declined significantly since August due to weaker fund performance at some of its large flagship funds ( Contrarian and Overseas Funds are ranked fourth quartile in 2008 ) . "
Because Janus ' funds are mostly distributed through third - party , retail channels , inflows and redemptions are more sensitive to relative fund performance , Siegenthaler noted .
The asset - management sector 's worst performers on a relative basis during December , he added , were Calamos Holdings CLMS and AllianceBernstein AB , - 1.53 % .
" Calamos has 4 % of assets under management rated four or five stars , while AllianceBernstein has 19 % of assets under management , " he wrote .
See story about Siegenthaler 's view on AllianceBernstein 's future .
Shares of Calamos gave up 8.7 % this month as of early Tuesday trading , while AllianceBernstein lost 3.8 % .
Franklin's fall
Late Monday , Franklin reported an 18 % quarterly drop in its assets under management , to $ 416 billion as of Dec. 31 from $ 507 billion on Sept. 30 .
This reflected a " combination of record outflows and a sharp drop in equity and fixed - income markets during October , " said Snowling .
Siegenthaler said it was becoming more likely that the firm would have to " significantly reduce " its headcount to avoid a large contraction in margins .
In response to the assets data , Siegenthaler said he 's reduced his 2009 earnings estimate for Franklin , to $ 3.58 a share from $ 4.27 a share , while Snowling trimmed his projection to $ 3.59 a share from $ 3.62 previously .
" Our reduced estimates reflect lower average daily assets under management in the near term , as well as some marginal benefit from a less international sales mix on Franklin 's distribution margin , " said Snowling .
Keefe Bruyette 's
Lee sounded a bullish note on Frankin , his top pick among firms in the sector .
" Despite difficult near - term operating trends , we think Franklin has one of the more robust global business models among the asset managers we follow , and we believe that the company remains very well - positioned to generate organic growth over time , " he said .
A glimpse ahead
Snowling said he has a cautious view on asset managers .
He cited concern over how successfully firms could cut their expenses in the midst of their problems , and he's also doubtful about the prospect for net inflows into mutual funds at a time when many people are struggling financially .
For his part , Lee 's more hopeful about asset managers ' prospects , saying that fixed - income funds should be the first to benefit .
" The long - term secular demographic forces that have been driving the asset - management industry for the past several decades remain substantially unchanged as both individual and retail investors around the world will need to continue to invest their assets , " he said .
" While the environment remains a challenge , asset - management stocks should be early beneficiaries of any improvement in the capital markets , " Lee added .
Henry Hitchings 's book is aptly titled .
Words do have a secret life , or rather a secret past .
George Steiner , quoted here , put it well : " When using a word we wake into resonance ... its entire previous history . "
In the case of English , that 's a lot of history to explore : even by the most conservative estimate there are 700,000 words in our current lexicon .
English also became English through fundamental changes in grammar and pronunciation , but Hitchings is only concerned with vocabulary .
That could have resulted in a book that was just an extended footnote to the OED 's compressed etymologies , and it is hard to imagine this book being written without the digital version of the great dictionary which makes it possible , for instance , to find instantly all of the English words taken from Basque ( since you ask , " anchovy " and " basque " ) .
But etymology is just Hitchings 's starting point ; he shows us that the history of our vocabulary is the history of our place in the world
The book has a broad chronological sweep , from pre-Roman Britain to the latest street slang , but individual chapters tend to work through particular cultural encounters or themes , sometimes with extended digressions .
A chapter called " Powwow " is a masterly focused account of our early exploration of America and our encounters with its languages .
A chapter called " Connoisseur " manages to encompass not only the 18th century 's extensive borrowings from French , but also the era 's vogue for grammar books and dictionaries , the rise of scientific writing , the use of Italian terms in music , and the lexicon of travel and exploration , including an account of our first confrontations with Australian aboriginal languages .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
We talk about " borrowing " words .
It 's a shorthand way of describing a complex process .
Hitchings uses it , just as he talks about writers " coining " words when he really means that their earliest printed appearance so far unearthed is in their works .
But he also gives an intelligent account of what really happens when two languages come into contact .
There is an exchange of terms ; but the breadth and depth of that exchange is dependent upon the strength of the relationship .
And it is not just about us learning their language : they need to learn ours , bringing their words – their nouns , principally – with them .
That helps explain the huge differences in the extent to which borrowing took place .
We have taken more words from French than anywhere else , because theirs is a culture with which we have been intimately engaged for 1,000 years .
But we also took a surprising amount from native American languages , because we settled there and – at the beginning – enjoyed fruitful relationships with them .
In contrast , we took next to nothing from aboriginal Australian languages .
Is English inherently a " promiscuous " language , especially willing to take part in these exchanges ?
Hitchings thinks not .
The extent of its borrowings has more to do with the political realities of England 's ( and later Britain 's ) involvement with the world .
On the other hand , the shift away from an Old English grammar based upon inflectional word - endings to one based on word order has made it easy for words to be accommodated ; most new words come from adaptations of existing terms , rather than borrowing .
One of the themes of the book is the recurring tension between those who want the language to be pure , simple and Germanic and those who relish promiscuity , complexity , and the new .
Hitchings points out that words only come into the language because there is a need for them , and finds a few harsh – and funny – words for those purists who have , over the centuries , fought battles over individual words .
At the same time , he concedes that " there are compelling reasons for ... wanting a large degree of stability in our language " .
The only serious argument I have is with Hitchings ' conventional account of the Anglo - Saxon invasion of " Celtic " south and east Britain .
Only a tiny clutch of nouns and a few more placenames survived , suggesting a kind of linguistic Year Zero .
But by his own account , no such cleansing has taken place elsewhere in the world , even where there were actual genocides .
I have been persuaded by the alternative explanation , put forward in Stephen Oppenheimer 's The Origins of the British , that the pre- and post -Roman inhabitants of England spoke a Germanic language that was seamlessly incorporated into Old English .
But Hitchings is far more informed on these matters than I am .
His bibliography runs to 27 pages , and the book is admirably footnoted and indexed .
The scholarship , though , is unobtrusive .
Even in the denser sections , this clever , persuasive , delightful book is studded with entertaining observations , whether he 's telling us that " poppycock " comes from the Dutch for " doll 's shit " , or that the Australian language Guugu Yimidhirr has a special vocabulary reserved for talking to one 's brother - in - law .
Ruby AST for Fun and Profit
Anytime you execute a Ruby application , or any language for that matter , the parser has to scan the source , split it into recognizable tokens , and construct an Abstract Syntax Tree ( AST ) before the instructions can be turned into executable machine code .
Sometimes this is done as a separate preprocessing step ( compiled languages ) , and sometimes it is done on the fly ( dynamic languages ) .
Now the less academic version : an AST to a program is what the DOM is to a web - page - and we all know how useful that is !
It turns out that having access to the AST of a program can be incredibly powerful .
Ever wondered how your IDE populates the method names in a separate window ?
How about refactoring tools ?
Detecting code smells ?
Or maybe even translating Ruby to Lolcode ?
Let ’s see how it ’s done …
In order to get access to the Ruby AST you ’ll either need the ParseTree , or RubyParser gem developed by Ryan Davis and Eric Hodel .
Functionally , they are equivalent , but ParseTree is implemented via RubyInline ( with C extensions ) , and RubyParser is a recent rewrite motivated by a need for a cross platform gem for JRuby , Rubinius , MRI , and others .
Out of the box , Ruby allows us to view methods of any object ( obj.methods ) , variables ( obj.instance_variables ) , hierarchies ( obj.class ) , but oddly enough , it does n’t provide a full blown ‘ view_source ’ method on an object to see its underlying definition .
It is definitely an interesting thought experiment to think why this is such a hard problem for most languages , but for our purposes , Ryan and Eric have solved it already :
To those of you familiar with Lisp flavors , the AST view will look surprisingly familiar .
All the syntactic tokens are gone ( commas , semicolons , etc ) , and only the underlying structure remains .
With a little ingenuity we can now reverse - engineer this tree into Ruby code !
Which , surprise , surprise , is exactly what Ruby2 Ruby ( another gem by Ryan Davis ) does :
Ruby AST for Fun and Profit
While ParseTree has been around for more than a year , it is only recently that the community has started picking it up .
Chris Wanstrath gave a great presentation ( slides ) at Goruco ‘ 08 about his new ParseTree powered project Ambition : “ a framework for writing adapters which turn plain jane Ruby into some sort of domain specific query which can be executed ” .
Similarly , Marc Chung gave a great talk at RubyConf ‘ 08 ( slides , code ) , in which he talks about mapreducerb , a simple Map - Reduce implementation in Ruby , and a handful of other interesting projects .
Getting started with the Ruby AST
To simplify the process of walking the generated Ruby AST you can leverage the sexp_processor gem , which provides a mini framework for processing all of the nodes .
All you have to do is implement a SexpProcessor class and define some behaviors .
Ever wanted to build a Ruby to Lolcode translator ?
It ’s not that hard :
ruby2lolz.git - Ruby to Lolcode translator
Or , maybe put some lolz into your API .
Give RubyParser a try , have some fun !
Eggs are packed full of nutrients Limiting egg consumption has little effect on cholesterol levels , research has confirmed .
A University of Surrey team said their work suggested most people could eat as many eggs as they wanted without damaging their health .
The researchers , who analysed several studies of egg nutrition , said the idea that eating more than three eggs a week was bad for you was still widespread .
But they said that was a misconception based on out - of - date evidence .
There is cholesterol present in eggs but this does not usually make a great contribution to your level of blood cholesterol
Victoria Taylor
British Heart Foundation Writing in the British Nutrition Foundation 's Nutrition Bulletin , they said eating saturated fats was far more likely to cause health problems .
Researcher Professor Bruce Griffin said eggs were actually a key part of a healthy diet , as they were particularly packed full of nutrients .
Ingrained misconception
He said : " The ingrained misconception linking egg consumption to high blood cholesterol and heart disease must be corrected .
" The amount of saturated fat in our diet exerts an effect on blood cholesterol that is several times greater than the relatively small amounts of dietary cholesterol .
" The UK public do not need to be limiting the number of eggs they eat - indeed they can be encouraged to include them in a healthy diet as they are one of nature 's most nutritionally dense foods . "
While elevated blood cholesterol levels increase the risk of heart disease , only around a third of the cholesterol in the body comes from the diet .
Other factors such as smoking , being overweight and physical activity can influence blood fat and cholesterol levels and heart disease risk .
The British Heart Foundation ( BHF ) dropped its advice to limit egg consumption to three a week in 2007 in light of new evidence .
However , research by the British Egg Information Service suggests 45 % of consumers still believe it was sensible to limit consumption .
Victoria Taylor , a senior BHF dietician , said : " We recommend that eggs can be eaten as part of a balanced diet .
" There is cholesterol present in eggs but this does not usually make a great contribution to your level of blood cholesterol .
" If you need to reduce your cholesterol level it is more important that you cut down on the amount of saturated fat in your diet from foods like fatty meat , full fat dairy products and cakes , biscuits and pastries . "
In 2007 the Egg Information Service was banned from re-running a television commercial from the 1950s which urged viewers to " go to work on an egg " to celebrate its 50th anniversary .
The Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre said the slogan went against the principle of eating a varied diet .

If my thesis is correct -- that much of the work done on the Perl language , the Perl culture , and its ecosystem including CPAN in the past ten years has made the language easier to use and Perl programs more maintainable -- then Perl fans have a lot of work to do to overcome the weight of bad code and creaky tutorials found in the wild .
Browse PerlMonks for ten minutes , and you 'll see that many petitioners receive the useful advice to use the strict and warnings pragmas in new code .
Similarly , I 've started all of my recent tutorials with the line use 5.010 ; to take advantage of say , given / when and other new syntactic features .
Add to that some of the nice CPAN code which extends the language and adds even more great features ....
... and the result is that a " modern Perl program " will contain at least three and probably several lines of identical boilerplate code which serves only to enable nice new features to make it easier to write powerful , effective , and maintainable Perl programs .
Worse yet , many of these features should be on by default .
Do you really want to tell people that they should use say instead of print ... "
" because the former is shorter and more concise and more convenient if you have to explain that they have to use the feature pragma to enable it explicitly ?
I wrote a proof - of - concept module called Modern : : Perl to solve this problem .
It has five lines of code .
Add use Modern : : Perl ; to your program and it will automatically enable the strict and warnings pragmas , and will make available all of the features of Perl 5.10 .
There 's still more than one way to do it , but is n't that easier than telling people to copy and paste long lists of modules to enable great features that should be available by default ?
Surely modern
Perl should minimize copying and pasting and should remove artificial barriers between novices and experts .

Call me a government geek , but there is something about this that I just love .
You can fill out an application here .
India may be spending billions on its high tech space programme but its spending on sewers is decidedly low tech and deadly , reports the BBC's Rupa Jha .
I live smelling death , but it is fine .
Rewa Ram , sewer worker I will never forget the sight of that thin short man , wearing nothing but cotton underpants , strapped into a harness arrangement , disappearing down into a dark manhole beneath the streets of my home city .
The diameter of the hole was so small that he bruised himself while slipping down .
Inside was a dark well , full of sewage , with giant cockroaches sticking to the wall .
Before he climbed in I asked him his name .
I was really surprised when he answered flamboyantly , " Rewa Ram - Son of Khanjan . "
I thought : " He must be educated , seems to speak some English . "
But when I asked him , he said : " No. I 'm a complete illiterate . "
When I looked down that hole into the drains of Delhi , the smell was overwhelming .
Down below , he was coughing , trying hard to keep breathing .
He was struggling to clear a blockage with his bare hands .
Dizzying smell
All of a sudden , a pipe protruding into the drain above his head started spewing out water and human faeces that poured over his body .
I began to feel dizzy just looking down into this mess .
My nostrils were filled with that obnoxious smell , a bit like of rotten eggs .
I wanted to vomit .
I felt weak and wanted to run away from the smell .
I was born and brought up in India and for the past 15 years I have lived in Delhi , the capital city of one of the world 's most rapidly growing economies .
I am a member of the growing , upwardly mobile middle class .
I suppose I represent the " roaring Tiger " India , but I am regularly shocked and surprised when I see the struggle for dignity that so many face here .
Literally beneath the glitter of the big city lies a vast network of these dark drains , where so many Rewa Rams are struggling with toxic gases and human waste .
They suffer disease and discrimination in return for cleaning the city 's sewage system .
Deadly job Rewa Ram is just one of thousands of sanitation workers in India who work hard to keep the cities , towns and villages clean .
Most of them come from the community of lower caste Dalits as they are known , or untouchables .
Health experts working in the field told me most of these workers would die before their retirement because of the poor health and safety conditions they work in .
Their life expectancy is thought to be around 10 years less than the national average .
India 's economy is growing rapidly , but not all are feeling the benefits Dr Ashish Mittal , an occupational health consultant , did a survey of the working conditions of sewage workers .
He told me most of the workers suffer from chronic diseases , respiratory problems , skin disorders and allergies .
He said they are constantly troubled by headaches and eye infections .
I am not surprised .
Rewa Ram was pulled out when he started feeling dizzy from the toxic fumes in the manhole .
They were thick with a mixture of methane and hydrogen sulphide , both considered potentially fatal by the health experts .
He needed water to clean himself , just a splash on his face could have made him feel better .
His colleagues started banging on doors of the rich neighbourhood where he was working .
Nobody opened their gate .
Ancient sewers Human rights activists and trade unionists I have talked to ask a simple question .
If the government of India can spend billions on its space programme , if Delhi can reach all its targets for the beautification of the city in time for the 2010 Commonwealth Games , including an underground train system , then why can't the sewage system be modernised ?
Why does it still rely on sending practically naked men down below the streets to clear the drains with their bare hands , being exposed to noxious gases which could take them to a premature grave ?
Activists ask why India spends so much on space and so little on sewers I put these questions to the authorities .
The reply ?
" We are trying our best . "
It did not really feel good enough after what I had seen .
The law courts have passed several orders banning human beings from going into the sewage system unless it is an emergency .
In Delhi it looks as if every day is an emergency in the sewers .
Smell of death I asked Rewa Ram , still breathless and covered with the sewage from the drain : " How do you feel about having to do this work ? "
With folded arms , he replied : " I am not educated , I come from a very poor family of untouchables .
What else can I expect ?
" At least I have a government job and I am able to feed my children .
I get into this hell everyday but then this is my job .
" I live smelling death , but it is fine . "
But is it fine ?
Why should he expect so little just because he comes from a lower caste and is not educated ?
How can our so - called civil society be so indifferent to the millions like him ?
I , for one , am left feeling guilty .

Here is a selection of your comments so far .
Being an Indian myself who was brought up in the streets of Delhi , I feel equally guilty for being part of the system which cannot be changed to improve the lives of millions of Indians like Rewa Ram .
It is an excellent article by Rupa Jha showing the realities of so called ' Modern India ' , a true dedication to the profession of journalism .
Preet Singh , United Kingdom Rewa Ram has more dignity and integrity than those of a so called higher class have and his story moved me .
We are all interdependent on each other and need to sweep away discrimination because of class or religion and treat each other with compassion .
If not as a planet or species we have had it
Graham , haywards heath uk This is just like 1st half of the movie Slumdog Millionaire .
Poverty at its worst ... We Indians have learnt to turn a blind eye to the plight of our fellow countrymen who are struggling everyday and everyone is just busy leading their own selfish lives including me .
It 's high time that educated middle class people like us make an effort to make the government accountable for their actions and decisions .
Dimple , UK
It will be a good idea for Rupa Jha to follow up on this story with authorities asking them for the work safety rules
If they exist .
If they do , see to what extent they are followed .
Should also follow up with the court to see what they consider emergency and what safety provisions starting from clothes , boots , gloves , respirators , hazardous gas detectors etc are to be provided for such emergency work .
Does his employer provide adequate insurance in case he dies performing his work ?
If he belongs to union , what are they doing to protect him ?
Do they lobby the legislators to write laws for his safety and if not followed hold his employers liable for his death ?
Perhaps an investigative reporting may shake up the authorities and something good may happen for these workers .
Bharat Shah , USA
It is a pathetic state of affairs , indeed .
However , the change has to come from the top .
For instance , in the state of Tamil Nadu , humans have been replaced by special machines to go down into sewers .
Sustained pressure from the media forced the authorities to do this .
Change takes time and such changes need to be done fast and everywhere .
Raju , Saudi Arabia
I really got the shock of my life after reading this .
Being such a great nation , India surely MUST look into these issues and take the necessary actions immediately .
Harshula , Sri Lanka
This is a national disgrace .....
Karan Kharyal , India Very interesting and investigative report .
Thomas Kallachil , Scotland
It is indeed a good attempt by Rupa to bring out the helplessness of the sewer workers .
These kinds of things are often downplayed by the Government and people tend to forget them .
This will be a harsh reminder for the people of India .
A Chandrayaan does bring joy to the nation but the basics have to be set right first .
Rahul Nair , India
This man , Mr. Rewa Ram is wearing rubber gloves .
I live in East Delhi , and I 've never seen a sewage worker wearing these gloves .
They only have their pants on when they go into the sewage .
I appreciate articles like this , but this article does n't even begin to describe what these ' people ' go through .
Newspapers around here often talk about Human Rights abuse in countries like China , but I ask myself , " What Human Rights are they talking about ? ? ? "
Words like ' appalling ' cannot portray so many things going on here .
Anonymous Foreigner , India Poverty in Africa is a tragedy , whereas in India it is a scandal .
The Indian state and society have the means and wealth to remove extreme want , but refuse to engage with the issue .
The gap between intentions and actions has always been a problem in this country , and it only seems to be getting worse .
James whewell , UK A friend of mine pointed me to this story .
We started discussing this , and he suggested that may be we can try raise money to give masks and clothing to these hard working citizens .
These are some of the questions that came up during over conversation .
Hoping that the author of the article and / or readers can provide some answers .
1 ) What are the number of people who do this kind of work ?
2 ) What is the body that employs them ?
3 ) Is there any local organization that would be interested in delivering these guys at least basic safety gear ?
Manish , USA Rewa Ram and millions like him , have been stripped naked by the centuries of apathy dealt out to them by the Hindu caste system .
They have but existed , inspite of all odds .
They do not owe anyone anything , yet they feel obliged .
They are not inferior yet they feel it .
A mass psychosis of this scale can only begin to hint at the atrocities and isolation they have had to sustain .
Today modern India lives off them , in sewers , in construction sites , in filthy sweat shops , taking advantage of their ' lowly ' temperaments .
Its true , if he was not working with the government , he would have been bonded to a labour agent for a few grains of rice .
But to his credit , everyday he goes deep down into the sewer risking his life , he breaks away a little bit from his ' destiny ' and social confinement .
The question I would ask him would be if his children go to school , only because only then will they surface above the drain ( underground ) and see the sky .
I appreciate your piece and the analogy intended , but I wish for you to bridge Rewa Ram and the space programme , only then can you hit anything .
Gaurav Roy Choudhury , India I totally agree with the feelings of Rupa , this gentleman and people like him deserves far better treatment and this case study could serve as an example of still persisting cast based societal bias in India , as it were a century ago .
India is the only poor country in the world that spends too disproportionally for space programs and for a billion of its poverty stricken citizens like Rewa Ram .

While any structure built in a way that lessens its footprint is welcomed , some of the buildings that people try to turn green simply make no sense .
LEED certification , in all its greatness , does not take the building ’s intended purpose into account ; this leaves us with some hilarious , unabashedly self - contradicting buildings .
Here are the ten of the most laughable green buildings :
1. BP ’s Helios House Gas Station – Los Angeles , Cal .
Yes , there is an LEED - certified gas station .
It ’s actually a nice building , complete with rainwater collection , solar panels , recycled building materials , and LED lighting .
However , do n’t think you ’ll be able to refuel with biodiesel or charge up your electric car — they ’re only in the petroleum - dealing business .
How green of them , right ?
2. Justin Timberlake ’s Golf Course / Lodge – Woodstock , Tenn .
So Justin Timberlake decided that he wants to buy a golf course and fix it up with an LEED - certified lodge .
While it ’s an improvement compared to most other golf courses , the fact remains that maintaining a golf course takes chemicals and lots of water .
In the United States alone , golf courses total more than 1.7 million acres and consume around 4 billion gallons of water every day .
How does a green lodge counteract the water used to maintain the course ?
Justin , if you really want to be green , you should have turned it into a wildlife sanctuary instead .
3. Nestle Pure Life Water Bottling Plant – Boiling Springs , Tenn .
While this is n’t the only LEED - certified water bottling plant , it ’s listed for having the most greenwashed name .
Ozarka , Arrowhead , Ice Mountain , and Deer Park water bottling plants also have LEED certifications of some sort , but they could n’t compete with Pure Life in the name department .
If anyone needs a reminder of why bottling water is a bad idea , here are five reasons to ditch the bottle .
Oh , and Nestle as a whole wo n’t be getting an award for their treatment of the planet and its people any time soon .
4. Logan Airport Terminal A – Boston , Mass .
Activists in England have put their freedom on the line protesting against a third runway at the enormous Heathrow Airport ; do you think they ’d be more satisfied with the runway if the airport terminal was LEED certified , with solar panels and the whole bit ?
You ’d be right to assume they would n’t , because whether they take off from a green building or not , airplanes are still one of the top causes of global warming .
5. Toyota Car Dealership – Rockwall , Tex .
While Toyota is almost synonymous with green when it comes to cars , in reality they ’re not much better than any other car company .
They have a full line of vehicles , including four - wheel - drive SUV ’s , some of which are 8 - cylinder .
In fact , their entire fleet ’s average gas mileage is worse than Chevrolet ’s .
Perhaps they should clean up their cars before trying to green their dealerships ?
6. Antilia Tower – Mumbai , India
While this probably will not be LEED certified , it has been often mentioned as being one of the greenest building concepts on the planet .
While it does look beautiful and will act as a giant carbon sink in the middle of the city , there ’s a major problem : it will be the home of one family .
No matter how green this building is , that is a complete waste of space in a city known for its overcrowding .
7. Civic Center Parking Garage – Santa Monica , Cal .
The only green parking garage I want to see would be located at a train or bus station for people to drop off their cars to finish their commute on mass transit .
To quote every politician involved in the 2008 campaign , “ You can put lipstick on a pig , but it ’s still a pig . ”
8. Vacation Home Development – Las Vegas , Nev .
You only need one house , people !
Granted that seven of these eight homes are 1/12 shares , these homes are being built in a desert ( Las Vegas ) and if anyone needs a water - capture system , it ’s people who live there year - around .
Simply due to their excess , vacation homes may be the least environmentally - friendly structures on earth .
9. Spaceport America – New Mexico
Another case of the rich attempting to make the rest of us think they ’re doing the world a favor .
Recreational space travel , at least with the current technology , is a huge and unnecessary carbon polluter .
But hey , the spaceport will be LEED certified , so everything ’s going to be fine , right ?
10 . Every Fancy New Building – Dubai , United Arab Emirates
I know , I know — I cheated on this one .
I could n’t pick just one since they ’re all ridiculous for the same reason .
The government is intent on making Dubai one of the biggest , most gaudy places on earth .
Perhaps to compensate for unending excess , they ’ve mandated that all new buildings must have specific eco-minded properties , but when you take all of it in at once , you know it ’s nothing but a giant waste of resources .

Speaking about the premise of his latest book , God is Not G reat , renowned author and prominent atheist Christopher Hitchens describes religion as belonging to " the superstitious , fearful childhood of the race " , in an interview which takes in Hitchens ' concern over the influence of religious groups over the education system and his fears over a growing global tide of theocracy .
" There would be cruelty , violence and warfare even if there was no religion " , Hitchens claims , " but what I mean to say is that the religious part of our brain is part of the less highly evolved bit " .
These are not the prices I ’m looking for .

Let us never negotiate out of fear .
But let us never fear to negotiate .
- John F. Kennedy
In December 2008 , well - known marketing consultant John Jantsch asked me what my small business predictions were for 2009 .
This was my answer :
2009 will be the year for small businesses to get advertising at 70 - 90 % off .
Recessions mean budget cuts for larger corporations , which means advertising cancellations , just as in the “ dot - com depression ” of 2001 and 2002 .
There will be fire sales on remnant advertising , whether print , TV , radio , or online .
In 2002 , I bought $ 250,000 + of radio advertising for $ 10,000 because a big pharma advertiser pulled out a week before the ads were to go live .
If you play your cards right , you can cut your CPA ( cost - per- acquisition ) in half .
The following sample dialogue demonstrates exactly how someone can buy $ 250,000 + of media for $ 10,000 , and how you can reap the rewards of an advertising collapse .
If you ’d rather acquire profitable customers for pennies instead of dollars , this article is for you …
Jedi Minds
Tricks : How to Get $ 250,000 of Advertising for $ 10,000
Life is not fair .
For those who understand the few rules that matter in negotiation , this is good news — it ’s possible to get much more than others expect to offer you .
Negotiating is , for most , an uncomfortable attempt at impromptu haggling .
For the experienced “ dealmaker ” , a more useful term , it is a planned sequence of predictable objections and responses that can be orchestrated to produce the desired outcome .
It ’s like planning three or four moves ahead in chess , forcing an opponent to put themselves in check - mate .
Some of the most effective strategies and set-ups are illustrated in the following sample dialogue for a print advertisement .
The dealmaker ( D ) in question has planned the entire sequence and all questions in advance .
Note : Even if you do n’t practice all of these common gambits , some of which can end up being games of mutual make - believe , it is important to recognize them or you cannot counter them .
To preserve the flow of the dialogue and its usefulness as a template , the principles are put in parentheses ( ) when used and then explained at the end of the article .
I have used three of them alone ( 1 , 5 , and 7 ) to get more than $ 250,000 of radio advertising on 150 + stations for $ 10,000 , $ 20,000 full - page print advertisements for less than $ 4,000 , and 50 % off of car purchases , among others .
Negotiating is predictable and learnable .
Simple phrases and questions can be used over and over again to reap huge dividends .
Practice small , practice often , and view it as a game — it ’s a game worth winning .
First introductory call :
D : “ Hi , may I speak with someone about advertising in your magazine ? ” ( Transfer to Cheryl ) “ Hi , Cheryl , my name is _______ and I ’m Director of Marketing at ________ Company .
We ’re considering advertising with you but are also looking at [ competing magazine A ] and [ competing magazine B ] .
When does the next issue close and go to print ?
Can you please e-mail me your rate card and current discounts ? ”
June 20th at 3:30 pm ( 1 ) :
D : “ Hi , Cheryl , we ’re deciding today which magazine we ’re going with .
You ’re competing against [ competing magazines ] and we can only choose one .
We ’re looking to do a full 12 - month roll - out but are doing a one - or two - month test first .
What is the best price you can offer on a full - page four - color ad ? ” ( 2 )
Cheryl : “ Hmmm … well , I suppose we could do $ 2,500 . ”
D : “ $ 2,500 ?!! Yikes … ” ( 3 )
( or “ $ 2,500 ?!!
Wow .
Based on the other mags , I was expecting a lot less … ” )
30 seconds of excruciating silence later :
Cheryl : “ Uh … It ’s possible we could go as low as $ 2,300 , but I ’d have to speak with my boss . ”
D : “ What else could you add to that ?
Could we write a product review , add in a 1/6th - page ad , a classified ?
Perhaps we could get a one - time mailing to your subscriber mailing list ?
It ’s important that we make this first time a homerun . ” ( 4 )
Cheryl : “ I ’d have to check . ”
D : “ OK , well I need to get on the phone with my board [ partner , supervisor , etc. ] in 15 minutes .
I ’ll tell you now that $ 2,300 is n’t very competitive .
Can you call me in ten after speaking with your boss ? ” ( 5 )
10 minutes later :
Cheryl : “ We can do $ 1,850 but just this once .
I can also give you a product review of 300 words and a classified . ”
D : “ Is that really the best you can do ? ” ( 2 )
Cheryl : “ I think so . ”
D : “ I have authorization right now to pay $ 1,200 ( 6 ) , but I ’d need to go through my [ superior of some type ] otherwise .
Can you ask your boss now if we can do that ? ”
Two minutes later :
Cheryl : “ She said that we can do $ 1,500 . ”
D : “ I have to speak with my [ superior ] .
I ’ll call you back in five minutes . ”
Five minutes later :
D : “ Hi , Cheryl .
Here ’s the situation .
I have them on the other line and they want to decide on one magazine now .
I want to go with you guys but you ’re higher than the other two competitors .
We ’re not that far apart here .
If we can just split the difference and do $ 1,350 , I can fax you the insertion order now and have a check FedEx ’d overnight to arrive at your desk tomorrow morning .
I have 20 minutes before FedEx closes .
Can we split the difference to $ 1,350 and I ’ll get the check off ?
Let ’s just do it and call it a day . ”
Cheryl : ( after a pause and speaking with someone in the office ) “ OK , $ 1,350 it is .
Where should I send the insertion order ? ”
—
That is how a hypothetical dealmaker gets a $ 5,000 package for $ 1,350 .
How $ 5,000 ?
In addition to the main full - page ad , he or she secured a 1/2 - page product review worth at least $ 1,500 and a classified ad worth $ 500 , bringing the total package value to $ 5,000 , purchased at 73 % off .
Here are the principles in order used :
Principle 1 : Negotiate just prior to the other side ’s deadlines .
If purchasing advertising , find out when the space or air time must be filled and negotiate last minute .
No one will sell you hard goods such tractors for $ 5 to get rid of them , but this happens all the time with ad space , as it is worth $ 0 if not filled .
It expires like food products on a shelf .
The same approach can be used for cars if you find out when new models come in or when sales quotas are calculated .
In this dialogue , assuming the deadline for ad submission is June 30th and the rate card for a full - page ad is $ 3,000 , the follow - up call is around June 20th at around 3:30 pm your time ( just prior to FedEx drop - off deadlines ) .
Principle 2 : Make them negotiate against themselves .
Give them multiple chances to lower their own price before making an offering yourself .
People will often offer less than you were planning to ask for .
Principle 3 : Use a “ flinch ” whenever someone mentions their first discounted offer .
Recoil in shock and then be silent .
DO NOT speak , even if the other side says nothing for minutes ( I often check e-mail during this battle of wills ) .
The tension is uncomfortable , and the salesperson usually fills this void with a concession .
Principle 4 : Increase value while lowering price .
Ask for bonuses as you negotiate on the original dollar amount .
Most people across the negotiating table let these slip while too focused on negotiating a single price .
Our goal is to get the most advertising per dollar , so add to the package as you cut price .
This also gives you items to later concede or remove for further discounts .
Principle 5 : Never be the ultimate decision maker .
Having partners or superiors , often imagined , with veto power allows you to negotiate hard and make impossible demands without being viewed as a bastard and damaging the ongoing relationship with the other side .
This is the same reason business people perfectly capable of negotiating their own deals use lawyers as go - betweens : to blame points of disagreement on “ legal ” and create a non-hostile bargaining environment where egos do n’t collide .
Principle 6 : Use intelligent “ bracketing . ”
If the list price is $ 2,000 and I want to pay $ 1,500 , for example , I ’ll offer $ 1,000 , creating a $ 500 buffer on either side of the target price .
The other side will offer $ 1,750 , I ’ll compromise at $ 1,250 , and then we ’ll settle at $ 1,500 .
“ Let ’s just split the difference ” creates the illusion that they are getting a concession from us when , in fact , it was all pre-planned .
Principle 7 : Practice using the “ firm offer . ”
This is when , rather than asking the non-committal “ Can you do $ ___ ? ” you make an if - then commitment such as “ If you can do $ ____ , we will pay you now . ”
The latter is an offer of payment rather than idle haggling .
To circumvent this entire phone conversation , it is possible to use a pre-emptive firm offer and send an e-mail stating that you are prepared to immediately pre-purchase one ad — whether full - page , half - page , or 1 / 3rd - page ; whichever they prefer — at 30 % or 40 % of rate card .
To make this “ firm offer ” even harder to resist , FedEx them three signed checks for 30 % of each of those ad sizes and tell them to cash one , whichever preferred , or rip them all up .
—
Negotiate once per item ( whether a one - page ad or a 12 - month radio campaign ) and do it hard .
Once a price is agreed upon , do not renegotiate the price again .
Be tough as hell but be fair .
A deal is a deal .
Here are a few other tips for purchasing media :
1 . If dealing with national magazines , consider using a print or “ remnant ad ” buying agency such as Manhattan Media or Novus Media that specializes in negotiating discounted pricing of up to 90 % off rate card .
Feel free to negotiate still lower using them as a go - between .
2 . Ask for a 15 % “ mail - order discount ” or “ first - time advertiser discount ” .
3 . Ask for a discount for paying upfront vs. net - 30 or ask for the standard 2 % discount for paying net - 10 instead of net - 30 .
This can often be negotiated with their accounting after settling on the ad price with a sales rep .
4 . Once you have strong cash - flow and know ads in a certain magazine are consistently profitable , offer to pre-pay 3 - 12 issues at a time for an additional 30 - 40 % off .
Do n’t ask — make a firm offer to show that it ’s not window shopping .

Advertisement British doctors are debating whether it is ethical to start clinical trials to allow voice box transplantation .
The task force has been set up as developments in stem cell technology make the development a possibility .
A team of scientists believe they may be able to transplant a voice box in such a way that the patient would not need to take anti-rejection drugs .
Each year around 1,000 patients in the UK will lose their voice box - the larynx - because of cancer or trauma .
The larynx creates and controls sound through muscle and cartilage interacting with the vocal cords .
But when it is removed - in a procedure known as a laryngectomy - the patient is left with a permanent breathing hole in their neck .
The difficulty of restoring the complicated nerve and muscle functions has , to date , been beyond surgery .
So the only option to them is to have an artificial voice , either through a vibrating machine they put on their throat , or placing a small device in a permanent breathing hole in their neck which is activated by putting their finger over the hole .
Tom Foot , from Weston - Super - Mare , uses this technique to talk .
He lost his voice box because he used to smoke .
He said : " The easiest part was recovering from the surgery .
" The most difficult bit is getting used to not being able to have meaningful conversations - and that it was a different voice , it was n't my voice . "
New hope Despite years of research , there has only ever been one voice box transplant in the US , and the patient still needed to breathe through a hole in his neck .
But now there is the possibility that improved stem cell technology could make it a possibility to develop a voice box for transplantation .
Tom Foot uses an artificial voice A similar technique was used last year to give Claudia Castillo an artificial windpipe .
She was given a donated organ which was covered with her own stem cells to trick her body into thinking the organ was part of her .
She can now live a normal life without having to take powerful anti-rejection drugs .
The international scientists behind the new project are now applying for funding to try to do the same thing with voice boxes .
One of the team , Professor Anthony Hollander , from Bristol University , said they faced a big challenge .
He said : " In addition to windpipe tissue which will have to be created - the cartilage and the epithelium - we also have to create muscle because the voice box is a moving part and needs to move in co-ordination with breathing .
" We do n't yet have a good way of taking stem cells and creating muscle and we need to figure out exactly how to do that and then how to implant that muscle and have it co-ordinate with the moving voice box . "
Task force consideration
The Royal College of Surgeons is about to debate these technical challenges , the potential benefits of such surgery and ethical dilemmas they throw up .
For instance , since these are not a life - saving procedures , do the benefits outweigh the significant risks of harm from surgery ?
Among the members of the task force is Professor Martin Birchall , from University College London , who led the team on the windpipe transplant .
He said : " We , as a task force , have to ask ourselves whether we are finally entering the right window where a marriage of technology and of need mandates that we can go forward with this procedure .
" Before now , the prevailing view has been that the balance has been strongly in favour of not going ahead .
" But we feel there have been sufficient technological advances to make us seriously revisit the case for developing and making routine this procedure .
" We have to ask ourselves is it right to subject a patient to the risks of surgery for a procedure which is not life - saving . "
Patient support
Another patient who lost his voice box , Dave Williams from Bristol , would welcome a transplant .
He said he often has to come into hospital because of complications from his implant .
Mr Williams said : " What people do n't realise is when they have this operation there are a few things you can't do - one thing is smell , another is swim , and another is shout . "
The pan-European team that has developed the stem cell technique should find out by April whether they have secured the 6 m euros they need for the project to begin .
If they get the go - ahead , then laboratory work should start this year .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -
The nearly complete skeleton of a massive Columbian mammoth who died during the last ice age has been dug out of a construction site near the La Brea Tar Pits in downtown Los Angeles , a remarkable find even in the fossil - rich area , scientists said Wednesday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The mammoth , dubbed “ Zed ” by researchers at the Page Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits , likely died in his late 40s some 40,000 years ago and was found near an unprecedented treasure trove of fossils that workers stumbled upon while digging the foundation for an underground parking garage .
“ What makes this so special , so exciting for us is that Zed is a complete specimen , ” laboratory supervisor Shelley Cox said while showing off his dirt - encrusted , dinner table - sized brown pelvic bone for reporters .
“ And he ’s really big compared to the mammoths we ’ve recovered from La Brea before , ” Cox said .
“ The tusks are considerably larger than anything we had expected . ”
The Columbian mammoth was a species of elephant that became extinct near the end of the last ice age .
Included in the cache of fossils were some 700 specimens , including a large prehistoric American Lion skull , lion bones , bones from dire wolves , saber - toothed cats , juvenile horse and bison , teratorn , coyotes , lynx and ground sloths .
The discovery is expected to double the size of the museum ’s collection .
Though the La Brea Tar Pits , in the city ’s mid-Wilshire district , are the site of the richest ice age deposits in the world , many fossils pulled out of the dirt and asphalt - like muck are jumbled with other bones .
Mammoths are a rare find .
Like all animals discovered at the site , Zed became stuck in a tar pit along a river bed and ultimately died of exhaustion or starvation .
Researchers believe his skeleton remained largely intact because soon after he died he was washed away by a flood and then covered by enough sediment , sand and debris to keep predators from making off with parts of the carcass .
They estimate his skeleton is 80 percent complete , missing only a hind leg and a vertebrae .
While most mammoth tusks , which are made up of fragile material called dentine , are only found in small chunks , Zed ’s are intact and a remarkable 10 - feet long .
Examination of Zed ’s bones shows he was between 47 and 49 years old , suffered from arthritis and had broken three ribs during his lifetime , possibly in fights with other mammoths .
Carbon dating is expected to show he lived between 38,000 and 42,000 years ago and had long lain under a department store parking garage .

Lawmakers , regulators and industry officials have declared that a " smart grid " is necessary for the nation 's energy security and clean energy future , but the technology has yet to be adopted nationwide .
The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will examine the smart grid dilemma in a hearing tomorrow with discussion on what exactly a smart grid is made up of , the benefits -- including jobs -- it creates and what barriers restrict its implementation .
" Clearly , everyone agrees we should do more , " Chairman Jeff Bingaman ( D - N.M. ) said in an interview .
" But we know we have to get down to the details of what does that mean . "
Bingaman said there is likely to be a smart grid component in upcoming energy legislation that he hopes to introduce and mark up in the next four to five weeks .
Despite including $ 11 billion for smart grid initiatives in the economic stimulus bill , lawmakers , businesses and the public alike are still absorbing what a digitized , intelligent grid could do for renewable energy , consumption behavior and information , and grid operation and efficiency .
Advocates for smart grid technology have been trying to get their voice heard for more than seven years and have welcomed the recent exposure and attention it has received as an enabler of renewable energy .
But there is some worry about more near - term applications of smart grid technology getting lost within the transmission and renewable energy discussion .
" Smart grid is much more down on the distribution level that is much easier and cheaper to get to , " said Steve Hauser , head of market development at GridPoint , an intelligent energy management company , and a president emeritus at the GridWise Alliance .
In a smart grid hearing last week in the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming , Tom Casey , CEO of Current Group LLC -- a smart grid software and analysis company -- took more than five minutes to explain to lawmakers that the smart grid is more than meters seen in residences or devices in appliances .
" A smart grid , in many ways is like an Internet for electricity , a network of devices that are monitored and managed with real - time communications and computer intelligence , " Casey said .
Frederick Butler , who is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and will testify at tomorrow 's hearing , is a strong advocate for the smart grid , especially for improving the communication system and other components on the distribution system before pushing smart meters into houses and buildings .
Within the $ 11 billion allotted for smart grid technology in the stimulus package is $ 4.5 billion for smart - technology matching grants .
A majority of the grants , however , will likely go to smart metering programs since many of those projects are already before public utility commissions and can put the stimulus money to work and create jobs faster .
Barriers
Regulators and utilities have been hesitant to adopt smart grid technology since it is evolving and , like any computer software , can often require costly upgrades .
It also currently lacks standards and industry - wide consistency -- all of which could be quite costly to consumers if companies choose technology that becomes obsolete .
Energy Secretary Steven Chu recently told a Center for American Progress clean energy forum that it is policies and standards , and not technology , that is holding up wider implementation of smart grid technology .
Bingaman is likely to ask representatives of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the National Institute of Standards and Technology the status of creating smart grid standards for protocols and information management to achieve integration of different smart grid devices and systems as mandated in the 2007 energy bill .
NARUC and FERC also formed a " smart grid collaborative " one year ago to facilitate the implementation of the smart grid .
The collaborative -- led by Butler and FERC Commissioner Suedeen Kelly -- aims to inform federal and state regulators about technological developments and other issues regarding the smart grid and what impacts there could be on consumers .
Smart grid technology also carries significant upfront costs that may end up saving companies and consumers in the long run but can create some barriers at the beginning of the project .
Advocates of smart grid technology say Congress should consider more incentives for smart grid investment , including accelerated depreciation .

If you have a question concerning the content of this post , please feel free to contact me .
First off , I have to say that it took me some time before I could sit down to write this review of the latest episode of BSG “ Blood on the Scales ” .
There was just so many powerful , emotional moments that it was hard to sit and process all the myriad of thoughts and sentiments swirling inside my mind .
It was as if the roller - coaster was finally coming into the station and I was still reeling from the last drop in the ride , in need of a few moments to regain my bearings .
It ’s storytelling at its best – causing a tangible reaction or impact on the viewer of the work instead of allowing them to be a passive audience looking in from the outside .
So , let ’s get back inside and poke around .
One thing I ’m appreciating with every episode is how they are attempting to make this an ensemble effort and for the most part , doing that by being honest with regards to the strengths of the characters that they ’ve established so far .
Starbuck , for example , has been a major pain in the side for many BSG viewers lately because of her portrayal as this sulking , broody child whose not getting the desired ( not to be confused with required ) attention from Mommy and Daddy .
In the last two episodes , it ’s like a switch went off and we ’re back to seeing the ballsy , frak - collecting - prisoners that ultimately is what suits the character best .
Helo has been reduced to a half - conscious man lying on the floor – as opposed to a half - conscious man walking around without much purpose .
And the list goes on .
Sure , it ’d be nice to see more dimensionality with these characters , but they tried and it did n’t work .
So , it ’s nice to see them move on and use them more as facilitators for the plot instead of trying to make them central to the storyline , especially with the clock rapidly ticking down .
However , once again , I ’m wishing we ’d get more time with Baltar .
Yet again , we get this great scene demonstrating a fuller , evolving character with Gaius – this time between Gaius and one of the Cylon Six models – that shows us the character is starting to acknowledge his true identity .
I loved how when Gaius looked at the Six model he flinched , reflecting his concern that perhaps he was seeing this woman again in his mind ’s eye .
But when he realizes she ’s for real , it ’s a moment of clarity where he ’s finally free of all the baggage and façades and can truly see himself .
The fact that he ends up reaching out to Gaeta as he sits for his last meal is not only poignant as a scene , it ’s a wonderful cap to the relationship that these two had , one Gaeta alludes to when he mentions Gaius ’ reputation as a scientist .
You ca n’t help but remember how Gaeta would run around following Gaius asking him all these details about his Cylon detector and Gaius looking down on him as being just another groupie in awe of his brilliance .
Granted , Gaius does n’t forfeit his ego as seen with his patronizing remark about the “ provincial intelligence ” of his followers as well he should n’t because that egotism is a part of who he is .
But in this scene aboard the Cylon ship , he finally realizes that it should n’t be everything and that he must take responsibility for his life and what dependencies he creates around him .
Hopefully , we ’ll get to see more of Gaius and his new found acceptance of who he really is and what that will bring to his character .
I also enjoyed watching Tyrol running around the ship through all these backwater conduits because it reasserts the character ’s fundamental identity .
The reality for Tyrol is that Galactica is his life , it ’s who he is and watching him roaming around this gargantuan ship without a map is a testimony to his relationship with this environment .
Indeed , these scenes help to bring the character full circle from his sense of disconnect and disillusionment when he no longer served the ship since as this episode showed , only Tyrol could have stopped the ship because he knew what needed to be done .
The fact that after he saves the day , he sees that the ship is starting to fall apart , worn out from all the stress of over use and old age , is not only a new concern for the fleet of how they will continue to survive without any defence capabilities , but also for Tyrol as he ’s poised to lose the last thing that means anything to him .
Obviously , another big player in this episode is Adama and his relationship not only with Tigh and Roslyn , but with the fleet as well .
Zarek ’s ploy to attempt to break Adama by telling him that Tigh had been killed trying to escape was one of the episodes ’ poignant moments as it not only shed more light on the depth of his friendship and loyalty to Tigh , but also because we see Gaeta seeing his past relationship with Adama given his appreciation for how the news of Tigh ’s death would affect Adama .
Of course , the fact that he so quickly used this information to skewer Adama regarding his willingness to work with a Cylon helped to reinforce the notion that Gaeta was on a one - way path with no turning back .
On an aside , it was wonderful to see them bring back the Romo character , even if it was for a brief stint .
Having him point out the whole court - martial as being a circus affair was particularly delightful considering his effort to free Gaius of his accountability for what happened on New Caprica .
Then there ’s the fatal move that Zarek plays in claiming that they ’ve executed Adama as a ruse to get Roslyn to surrender .
Her visceral reaction to the news was the turning point , the beginning of the end for Gaeta and Zarek as they both realize just how vital Adama is to the fleet .
Indeed , seeing even the rebel Cylons reacting to the news of Adama ’s demise helped to draw the idea that while others might blame Adama for their current predicament , they ’re not ready to go on without him .
This no doubt was a key reason why his emotion - tinged address to his execution squad that he was taking back his ship shook them out of this insanity .
Watching the crew falling back in line behind Adama as he marches back to the CIC worked as a great visual metaphor to the fleet re-grouping around their leader , around the man who despite everything , did help them to survive this long .
The reunion between Adama and Roslyn near the end is a wonderful reminder again about the fleet ’s humanity and it serves as a stark contrast to the harsh realities that are to come with the episode ’s conclusion .
And this brings us to the fallen hero and the real focus of this story arc – Felix Gaeta .
As I mentioned to some fellow BSG fans during some discussions on Twitter , since “ A Disquiet Follows My Soul ” we ’ve seen Gaeta ’s internal turmoil being played out through the pain and agony he was experiencing in his amputated leg .
And this episode carried that imagery with such heart - aching beauty right to the very end .
As he did in “ The Oath ” , we see Gaeta struggling with this inner pain right at the start , groping at his leg in the CIC while trying to get a handle on things – his inability to soothe that pain and discomfort in his leg mirroring his sense of helplessness to stop the situation from escalating and having more blood on his hands .
But the most illuminating moment had to be when Gaeta was in Adama ’s quarters , where he once again grimaces in pain before walking over to sit in the ‘ old man ’s chair ’ , massaging his amputated leg to try and stop this ever - present pain in his leg to no avail .
Undoubtedly , Gaeta had hoped that when this moment came , he would be relieved of this agony , that his efforts would in fact put things back in order and with it , a release from this haunting , ever - lurking feeling that ’s been his driving force of late .
This continued torment he feels despite accomplishing what he set out to do evokes images of Lady MacBeth , desperately trying to wash off the memory of Duncan ’s blood on her hands ; despite succeeding in getting what they want , both characters are still haunted by their actions from the past .
Indeed , the fact that he pushes others to carry out his order to execute Adama , changing his mind of being present for the very act , brings to mind Lady MacBeth ’s push to change the status quo toward something more appealing and yet refusing to be present for the actual act of murdering their leader .
Listening to Gaeta recalling the dreams of his youth at the episode ’s end reminds us of who he is , that unlike Zarek who no doubt hopes some will create a legacy of his being a martyr , this is someone who set off to do good , to do right by others .
And yet , somewhere along this path fraught with chaos and despair , he slowly began to lose that part of himself only to find it again at the bitter end .
Lady MacBeth has this line shortly before her demise “ Here ’s the smell of the blood still : all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand . ”
In many ways , this is also telling of Gaeta , that the blood of those who died on New Caprica has never washed off the hands of his conscience .
And while we can dispense with Zarek – or at least I know I can as my previous reviews demonstrate – letting go of Gaeta is not so easy and his demise is all that more painful not only because we can recall who he was at the start of this series ’ journey , but also thanks to the continued use of time codes during the episode which reminded us that this all happened over the period of one day .
Gaeta tells
Gaius at the end that he hopes that one day people will understand who he really is – an acknowledgement of how far removed he is from the man he used to be .
While some might question why Adama needed to execute him , this statement by Gaeta sheds some light on that , indicating that perhaps the only way he could be saved was by letting him go .
In that final scene when Zarek looks over at Gaeta , there is a shared look of acceptance over their fate that , although not for the same reasons , they did what they felt needed to be done .
His last words “ It stopped ” is not only a reflection of his release from the physical pain in his amputated leg that has driven him to this form of madness , but also of his final acceptance of the guilt and shame he feels for his past acts and that with his own death he can feel that justice would at last be delivered .
Knowing that he finally found that peace at the very last moment of his life is not only liberating for him , it is the ultimate tragedy of his character , as the only way for him to find that justice he so desperately sought was through the fleet ’s insistence that he pay the price for the mistakes that he had made with his very own life .
The proceedings last little more than a couple of minutes and are about as arduous as a consultation with an understanding GP .
The treatment meted out to those who find themselves submerged under a mountain of unpayable bills has come a long way since the time of Dickens ' Little Dorrit and each day in the final quarter of last year more than 300 people in England and Wales made their way through the bankruptcy courts – a considerable number of them voluntarily .
With the deepening recession expected to swell their numbers dramatically over the coming months the courts service and debt charities are braced for an avalanche of insolvencies in 2009 .
Bankrupts are barred from certain jobs and professions such as accountancy , they are also forbidden from running their own business .
For a year after insolvency they cannot borrow more than £ 500 without declaring their bankrupt status , while the court order stays on record for six years .
For those culpable in their own downfall the penalties are more serious .
But for most it is a price worth paying .

The dyslexic father
Harry Cooper , 41 and his former partner Julie , 38 , spent most of yesterday at the Citizens Advice Bureau ( CAB ) at the Royal Courts of Justice where dozens of indebted clients on the point of insolvency seek help each day .
The unemployed father of a large family suffers from dyslexia and has scarcely worked since leaving school .
He has been on incapacity benefit since before he first came into bitter dispute with a London council over an unpaid poll tax bill back in 1993 which has seen his bank accounts frozen and even resulted in him spending 24 hours in a police cell .
Since then and despite being declared bankrupt in 2006 against his will , he has found his outstanding arrears balloon from more than £ 2,000 to nearly £ 80,000 once taxes , professional and legal costs are added .
That morning with a CAB adviser , he had spent more than two hours on the phone trying to find an insolvency practitioner who was willing to take his case on legal aid – an increasingly common and frustrating state of affairs for those seeking to climb out of the debt mire .
" I feel very angry about what has happened , " says Mr Cooper .
" I like to hit out but I know that is not going to make it any better .
My ex-partner is losing weight and can't sleep .
It has affected the children – they can sense the stress and tension in the household .
This case could take another year and we could all be homeless by then .
I face losing everything I 've ever owned .
What makes me so angry is that I never owed the debt in the first place .
I have never owed a penny in my life to anyone .
If I have n't got the money , I just do n't have it . "
The pensioner
Frail and unsteady on her feet , Rosemary Hall dragged herself up the stairs of the High Court in London at a painfully slow pace .
In her hands she clutched the documents she needed to go bankrupt .
At the age of 76 and burdened with a £ 20,000 debt , the former beautician had been left no option .
Nevertheless , she felt little relief that soon her financial burden would be lifted .
" I feel shame , so ashamed .
I do n't feel relief , just guilty , " she said .
" I hate this .
I did n't want to go bankrupt .
I would prefer to solve it myself .
I feel I have not done my bit for my country .
I just could n't .
It all fell apart , " she said .
The retired widow from west Norwood , south London , had first got into trouble a few years ago , gradually building up a debt , helping out her children and seven grandchildren .
" I took out some loans to help my family when they lost their jobs .
When you are a mum , what else can you do ?
That 's what mothers do , " she said , explaining how the debt had spiralled as she took out more loans to cover her costs .
" With my pension ( £ 211 a week ) I tried my hardest but it was a vicious circle .
Suddenly everything got too much .
My sister was ill with cancer and I was caring for her for three months .
It was so traumatic , I just could not think straight .
There was all the shopping and the funeral expenses .
I sat down one day when I got home and I thought , ' what have you done ? ' "

She tried a variety of debt company solutions , took out consolidation loans and attempted to repay the money over a 10 - year period .
But she read the small print and realised her children would be burdened with her loans if she died .
" The banks should n't give credit to the elderly , people over 70 .
It should be stopped .
They should n't let them get credit cards , build up debt .
I 'm not blaming anybody but I think you get to an age when you are too old to have such debt .
" So I have had to swallow my pride and go bankrupt . "
The businesswoman
At Leeds County Court yesterday Rachel Brown was looking forward to ending her debt nightmare with mixed feelings .
" It is scary and a bit embarrassing , " said the 45 - year - old businesswoman , who until yesterday owed £ 40,000 .
For her the problems started when her husband suffered a severe nervous breakdown .
He was treated for bipolar disorder and psychosis and spent six weeks in hospital , but even when he was released his violent behaviour continued to drain the relationship and the family finances .
" I have a business and I managed and juggled everything but once you get a bad credit rating that is it , " said the mother of two .
" I have kept my head above water and I 've paid everything on time living on my overdraft of £ 1,900 .
But on 23 January the bank called it in .
I am a great believer that if you have built up debts you should pay them , but there was nothing I could do . "
As the credit lines dried up even the catalogues with which she had an unblemished credit record shopping for the family 's clothes pulled the plug on her .
" I have just split up with my husband and I feel like it is a new beginning .
I will never let the debts build up again .
I spent every day for years looking at my bank account on the internet .
It is the most terrible feeling you are fighting this dreadful thing .
I wish I had done it years ago . "
The security guard with 25 credit cards
Over the years Paulo Mandisie managed to get hold of more than 25 credit cards , accumulating £ 152,000 in debt .
Yesterday , the 38 - year - old looked weary as he came before the High Court to make himself bankrupt .
A security warden , he had struggled for months to keep up the interest payments alone but when his company declared they would no longer fund overtime , he was left penniless .
After paying his essential bills , he had just £ 40 a month for the rest of his costs .
" I was so depressed .
I still am .
I have a wife and two kids to look after .
It has really affected my health .
They start hounding you with calls .
I could n't answer the phone .
I have missed so many important calls because I did n't want to pick up the phone , " said Mr Mandisie , from south - east London .
" I was using credit cards to pay off debts . "
Just 10 days ago , even as he was preparing for bankruptcy , he was receiving texts from companies offering loans .
" They bombard you with leaflets .
Everyone convinces themselves they are going to pay it back but I have struggled for eight months and could n't cope . "
Bankruptcy would offer him the chance to start afresh , he said : " I 'll be very happy .
I can lead a clean life .
I 'm not going to touch easy credit again . "
The unemployed divorcee
Ivan Grant , an unemployed plasterer , 27 , who arrived at York Crown Court this week with his mother , owed various creditors £ 23,000 .
His was one of two cases to be heard that day by the reassuring figure of District Judge Wildsmith who discharged the business of the father of three going bust with a minimum of fuss and no sense or recrimination .
" It all started a couple of years ago , " said Mr Grant as he emerged from finalising the details of his bankruptcy over the telephone with the official receiver .
" My marriage broke down .
My wife used to pay all the bills ; she used to control all the money .
Then my work dried up as the building trade went into recession .
My mother has been helping support me to get me through this period .
I wish it had n't come to this .
" At the moment it feels like a big weight off my shoulders .
Now I can start thinking forward again .
I can move in with my girlfriend .
My advice to anyone in this situation is do n't stick your head in the sand like I did .
There were so many bills stacking up .
As a plasterer you need to run a vehicle .
I had to give my wife £ 350 a month for the children , " he said .
" I like a drink , which did n't help .
The more debt I was in the more I went to the pub .
It was a vicious circle . "

Bankruptcy : The legacy
If bankrupt , you may not :
* Obtain credit for over £ 250 without telling the lender you are bankrupt
* Act as a company director
* Take any part in the formation or management of a limited company without court permission
* Trade in any business under any other name unless you inform all persons concerned of the bankruptcy
* Practice as a charted accountant or lawyer
* Hold certain public offices , such as being a magistrate
IKEA Unveils Solar - Powered Lighting Product Line
March 10th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
After announcing its intentions to sell solar products last year , IKEA has come through with its promise .
The furniture superstore will soon stock solar - powered LED lights for outdoor use .
The lights , which should be released in the next 2 weeks , range from globes and chains to posts and work lamps .
Each light is equipped with a rechargeable battery that stores energy gathered from the sun .
At night , the devices switch on LED lights .
Since LEDs are more energy - efficient than incandescent bulbs , IKEA ’s lights last extra-long .
And with prices ranging from $ 6.99 to $ 19.99 , IKEA may just have the market cornered on solar - powered backyard lights .

Mark Perakh is a native of Ukraine .
He is a professor of physics ( emeritus ) at California State University Fullerton .
Before coming to the USA as a visiting scientist at the IBM Research Center , he worked for over a half a century as a researcher and university professor in four countries .
He has to his credit about 300 scientific papers , four books and several patents .
He was awarded several prizes for his research , including one from the Royal Society of London .
He has also been active in debunking various versions of crank science .
His latest book is Unintelligent Design ( 2004 ) .
Flagella Myths
by Mark Perakh
In 1996 a professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University named Michael Behe published Darwin ’s Black Box1 , in which he presented his concept of “ irreducible complexity ” ( IC ) .
Behe and his Intelligent Design ( ID ) colleagues claim that IC is strong evidence of “ design ” of biological systems , and ever since his book IC has acquired the status of one of the main pillars of the Intelligent Design platform .
The concept of irreducible complexity was in fact known for many years before Behe ’s book .
The Nobel Prize winning biologist Hermann J. Müller had already discussed it ( under the slightly different name of “ interlocking complexity ” ) in 1918.2 Some 10 years before Behe ’s book the same idea was explored by A. Graham Cairns - Smith .3
Unlike Behe , however , these pioneers did not claim that the concept in question was a great discovery on a par with those by “ Newton and Einstein , Lavoisier and Schroedinger , Pasteur , and Darwin ” ( as Behe asserted in Darwin ’s Black Box ) .
Neither did they claim that “ irreducible complexity ” was a “ marker ” of a supernatural design .
To the contrary , according to Müller , development of interlocking complexity in biological systems is to be expected from Darwinian evolution .
Therefore the concept in question , as such , evoked no resistance from mainstream science .
As an example of an allegedly irreducibly complex system Behe suggested a mousetrap .
Soon afterwards , in multiple publications by various Intelligent Design advocates , images of a mousetrap were endlessly reproduced .
The mousetrap , however , was not accepted by the mainstream scientific community as a genuine example of IC .
For example , professor of biology John McDonald suggested4 an animated illustration of how , starting with just a piece of a hook - shaped wire serving as a primitive mice - catching device , a full - fledged mousetrap can be gradually built up via two - part , then three - part , etc. contraptions , improving its mice - catching ability at each step in a Darwinian fashion .
Apparently finally realizing that a mousetrap was not a very successful choice for illustrating Behe ’s IC concept , ID advocates switched to another example — a bacterial flagellum , a “ device ” used by bacteria for motility .
5
By 2002 , the image of a flagellum had become a ubiquitous accompaniment to ID advocates ’ books , papers , lecture slides , etc .
According to one of the main advocates of ID , William Dembski , the flagellum had become the “ mascot ” of ID .
The image of the flagellum appeared on the cover of Dembski ’s book No Free Lunch6 , on creationist blogs , etc. Figure 1 ( above article title ) shows an image of a flagellum as it appears on Dembski ’s blog named Uncommon Descent .
Notice the smooth surface of the depicted contraption , its perfect symmetry , its tightly fitting components — features we usually see in man-made machinery .
This image is a product of an artist ’s imagination of how a flagellum “ must ” look .
Does this image truthfully represent the real flagellum ?
No .
Flagella are tiny organelles that ca n’t be seen directly by the unaided human eye .
Their dimensions are measured in nanometers ( billionths of a meter ) .
Modern versions of cryogenic electron microscopy and of X - ray techniques have , though , enabled scientists to form a pretty good understanding of flagellum ’s structure and shape .
Figure 2 shows a schematic model of a flagellum ’s structure .
7
This model ( one of several published in scientific literature ) is a theoretical interpretation of the data obtained via electron microscopy , and mainstream scientists construe it more as an idealized schematic than a true - to - life representation of a flagellum ’s actual structure .
ID advocates , however , happily treat such images as if they are real replicas of the tiny flagella , usually providing no disclaimers as to the degree of idealization inherent in such images .
In 2004 , when Dembski debated Professor Niall Shanks ( at UCLA ) he displayed8 a different image of a flagellum ( Figure 3 ) .
Unlike Figures 1 and 2 , Figure 3 is neither an artist ’s rendition , nor a schematic theoretical model ; it is a “ real ” electron - microscopic photographically obtained image .
While produced by scientists , such images are often exploited by ID advocates who are fond of pointing out their striking similarity to man-made machines .
However , such illustrations are misleading , picturing the flagellum in a geometrically perfect shape , fully symmetric and consisting of geometrically perfectly formed parts .
The real flagellum is far from having such a perfect geometric shape .
Unlike machines , which may be close replicas of each other ( say , all Jeeps of the same year have almost exactly the same shape ) the real flagella , first , have shapes with many deviations from a perfect geometric symmetry , and , second , there are no two flagella exactly identical .
Individual flagella differ in various respects , just as biological organisms vary from individual to individual .
Likewise , when I debated Behe on February 15 , 2008 on a Larry Kane ’s TV show on the Comcast network , Behe supported his pro-ID thesis by displaying the same images of a flagellum as shown in Figures 1 , 2 and 3 .
Behe ’s argument essentially boiled down to the stale asseveration that can be succinctly summarized as follows : “ You see — it looks like a man -made machine !
If it looks like a duck , then it must be a duck !
All machines we are familiar with have been designed .
Therefore the flagellum must be a product of intelligent design ! ”
Oddly , Behe and his ID friends seem not to realize that the “ it must be a duck ” argument is an obvious non-sequitur : there are numerous examples of objects whose appearance is deceptive .
Just think of the mimicry , so common in nature .
For example , look up the article on “ Mimicry ” in Wikipedia where examples are presented of animals looking like “ twigs , bark , leaves , or flowers ” etc. , thus negating the “ it must be a duck ” conclusion .
In fact the images that Behe , Dembski , and their ID colleagues show are often not pictures of real flagella .
Some of them are just products of an artist ’s imagination ( Figure 1 ) ; others are computer - generated images of imaginary machine - like contraptions .
The schematics like that in Figure 2 , while reflecting many actual features of flagella , are products of a modeling approximation which likewise can’t pretend to reflect adequately the actual structure of a tiny organelle .
However , some other pictures of flagella may indeed be “ real ” photographically obtained images ( Figure 3 ) .
Are the images in the latter category adequate representations of the flagella structure ?
Look again at Figure 3 .
It is , at a glance , impressive .
Indeed we see here a contraption which is symmetric , its structure machine - like , so it is easy to understand the satisfaction of Dembski and Behe at the sight of this contraption so neatly fitting in with their “ design ” hypothesis .
There are , however , two important details that must be noted .
The first detail is that the image in Figure 3 is a composite photo .
It is the result of a superposition of many photos , of several flagella , made from various angles .
This way the image in question is eliminating from view various imperfections which , unlike in man-made machinery , are inherent in every natural flagellum .
Moreover , the procedure of superposition of a number of photos eliminates from view the inevitable individual differences between various flagella , which radically distinguish flagella from “ designed ” machinery .
The second detail is that the resolution of this picture is insufficient to see the flagellum ’s intrinsic structure .
To appreciate the significance of this , recall , by analogy , the “ face on Mars , ” or Lowell ’s nonexisting Martian “ canals . ”
When the resolution is insufficient , we “ see ” nonexisting structures , which on closer inspection look dissolve into natural patterns .
This is equally true for the images of very small objects perused under insufficient magnification and / or resolution .
The images of flagella obtained at higher resolution , and assisted by other modern sophisticated methods of investigation , reveal the actual configuration of flagella , demonstrating that the seeming machine - like appearance of the flagella in Figure 3 is deceptive .
It should be noted that scientists often use such terms as “ machine ” when describing various biological assemblies .
This usage , however , unlike in case of ID advocates , is purely metaphorical , reflecting the superficial resemblance of certain biological structures to man-made machinery .
Scientists normally do not imply that biological entities are intrinsically similar to man-made machinery .
Perhaps such a usage by scientists is not very fortunate given ID advocates ’ misuse of the superficial resemblance between the designed man-made objects and natural biological entities .
We have to realize , though , that scientists by and large are not aware of ID advocates ’ misuse of such terminology , as only a small minority of scientists pay any attention to ID advocates ’ actions .
Let us look at a few selected illustrations of my thesis .
The detailed images of the flagella structure obtained via cryogenic electron microscopy combined with sophisticated X - rays techniques are exemplified in Figures 4 , 5 , and 6 .
These images , showing the actual configuration of the flagellum , have been selected practically at random from numerous similar images available in the scientific literature .
Instead of tightly - fit machine - like parts , we see in these pictures convoluted garlands of protein molecules .
These structures look similar to typical bacteriophage viruses5 , and have nothing in common with any man-made machine .
They vividly illustrate that the image shown in Figure 3 is deceptive and owes its machine - like appearance to the insufficient resolution ( not to mention the utter artificiality of the artist ’s renditions of flagella , whose variations serve as “ mascots ” of ID ) .
ID advocates often point to the allegedly fraudulent “ icons of evolution ” utilized by “ Darwinists ” for their nefarious purposes . 9
One such “ icon ” are the illustrations of embryos made by the 19th - century German biologist Ernst Haeckel .
In fact , the faults of Haeckel ’s embryological illustrations ( dated 1874 ) were revealed not by creationists but rather by the “ Darwinists ” themselves .10
On the other hand , creationists of various hues , including ID advocates such as Dembski and Behe , incessantly reproduce images of flagella that are often heavily doctored , without any disclaimers as to the great degree of idealization inherent in these images .
Indeed , look again at the images of flagella ’s actual molecular structure , as shown above in Figures 4 , 5 , and 6 , and it becomes obvious that real natural flagella are far from looking like man-made machines .
An interesting question arises :
Why ID advocates and other creationists , who so eagerly and persistently display pictures like those in Figures 1 , 2 , and 3 , never deign to show much more realistic representations of flagella structure such as those shown in Figures 4 , 5 , and 6 ?
If they are unaware of these better pictures , perhaps they should try to educate themselves regarding the entirety of the available information about flagella ?
If , though , they are familiar with the images such as those shown in Figures 4 , 5 , and 6 ( which are freely available both in print and on the internet ) could it then be that they are less interested in facts and truth and more focused on winning the “ cultural war ” by any means ?
We must conclude that the argument in favor of “ design ” of biological entities based on their alleged similarity to man-made machinery is not supported by evidence .

Consumer spending plunged in Q3 , and it 's likely to continue to get worse .
Why ?
Because U.S. consumers are broke , and the number of folks eager to lend us money despite this condition has gotten a lot smaller .
We were broke in 2000 , but we were able to borrow money to spend by tapping the " equity " in our houses .
Now we can't tap that equity anymore ( because it 's gone ) , so we 've moved on to credit cards .
Lenders are wising up to this , though .
And then where 's our spending money going to come from ?
John Mauldin's weekly letter lays it all out ( sign up here ) .
First , check out the decline over the past two years in home mortgage equity withdrawals .
That was a nice pot of spending money for a while .
Not anymore :
Despite home equity withdrawals plunging in the last six quarters , though , until recently we did not cut spending much .
We just switched creditors .
Specifically , we switched from mortgage lenders to credit card companies ( our emphasis ) :
So , did American consumers cut back on borrowing ?
Not if they had a credit card !
Total loans from commercial banks to consumers grew by $ 89 billion for the 12 months ending in September .
$ 61 billion of that was credit card debt , and the amount in recent weeks has exploded .
Let 's look at this analysis from my favorite slicer and dicer of numbers , data - wizard Greg Weldon ( www.weldononline.com).
Going with a Halloween theme :
" FAR MORE ' telling ' is the LOPSIDED degree to which Credit Card balance growth is ' contributing ' to total growth in Consumer Loans , a sign of intensifying ' stress ' on consumers , amid accelerating job loss , home price deflation , and equity - market paper wealth devaluation .
" Even the raging Frankenstein stops to note the shockingly UGLY data details :
Commercial Banks , Outstanding Credit Card Balances ... SOARED by an eye - opening +
$ 7.1 billion in the WEEK ending October 15th , representing a + 1.9 % single - week rate of expansion ... or ... nearly ONE - HUNDRED PERCENT annualized ( +98.4 % ) .
" Even more ' telling ' is the ' read ' acquired by contemplating the following pair of data FACTS :
* Credit Card Loans , 10 months Sep07 - thru - Jul - 08 ... up + $ 29.1 billion
* Credit Card Loans , 10 weeks Aug - 08 - to - mid - Oct - 08 ... up + $ 32.3 billion
" In other words , Commercial Bank ' exposure ' via the total amount of Credit Card ' loans ' outstanding has risen MORE in the last ten WEEKS , than it did in the previous ten MONTHS COMBINED !!!
" Moreover , the growth in the last ten - weeks , $ 32.3 billion , or about $ 600 million per ' shopping day ' since the beginning of August ... represents nominal growth of + 9.3 % ... or ... + 48.3 % annualized over the last ten weeks .
" According to American Express , delinquencies on credit payments rose to 4.1 % of all credit outstanding in the 3Q , up from 2.5 % in 3Q of 2007 , with Bank of America 's rate rising even more steeply , to 5.9 % in the quarter .
" Moreover , the ' pool ' of loans deemed ' uncollectable ' rose to a high 6.7 % in the 3Q , soaring from 3.6 % last September . " [ Emphasis mine . ]
What consumer spending there is has been fueled in part by credit card .
Greg notes this uncomfortable piece of data : the second largest " merchant - vendor " for credit card use is now McDonalds .
This suggests that many consumers are in serious distress when they need to get their $ 4 Big Mac and fries with a credit card .
Catch that ?
The second - largest credit - card vendor is now McDonalds .
Now , let 's say you 're a credit - card lender who has just watched all your friends in mortgage finance get fired after letting their credit standards go to hell .
How long are you going to keep lending to consumers at this rate ?
And what 's going to happen to consumer spending when you crack down ?

For as long as artificial sweeteners have been used , there has been a varying level of controversy over the safety of their use ; both for humans and the environment in general .
Saccharin and Aspartame have been plagued by health concerns raised by researchers for decades .
Most studies have shown that only in very high concentrations are they dangerous , however few long term ( > 10 years ) studies have been completed , so lower dose , chronic exposure has yet to be rigorously investigated .
Currently , most diet sodas use aspartame and saccharin , including my favorite , Coke Zero .
Another very popular sugar substitute , sucralose has begun to steal the spotlight away from aspartame in recent years , taking over popular drinks like Crystal Light , Tim Horton ’s and Starbucks coffee .
The chlorinated sugar substitute called sucralose ( commercially marketed as Splenda ( TM ) ) was first synthesized in 1976 , as part of a collaboration between Queen Elizabeth College in London and the Tate and Lyle Chemical Company .
It is manufactured by the selective chlorination of sucrose , in which three of the hydroxyl groups are replaced with chlorine atoms .
Supposedly the graduate student , Shashikant Phadnis , working on the synthesis misunderstood his professor ’s request to test the chemical as a request to taste the chemical .
Just goes to show , sometimes to make a lucrative discovery , a chemist must take the ultimate test !
Whatever happened , it has been found that Sucralose is approximately 600 times sweeter than sucrose , and since being introduced in the USA in 1998 , has become one of the leading sweeteners on the market .
One of the main reasons for this is that studies have shown that sucralose is highly stable ; it does n’t break down easily due to heat so cooking with it is safe .
It also does n’t dechlorinate over time , photo degrade under visible light , or biodegrade with common bacteria .
It is also very insoluble in fat cells , so all of us Americans do n’t have to worry about getting a heart attack on the treadmill ( at least not from sucralose ! ) .
In fact , sucralose is so darn stable , it does n’t even get broken down in waste treatment plants .
Meet Smitha Ramakrishna , a senior at Corona del Sol High School in Chandler , Arizona , who has been doing research at Arizona State University about sucralose ’s inability to be broken down and how this make affect the environment .
At only 17 years of age , she has been researching sucralose for nearly 2 years , as part of her greater goal of trying to help with global water issues .
She also founded an organization named AWAKE , which is dedicated to increasing her community ’s awareness about water - related issues .
She has found that after subjecting sucralose to treatments similar to those used by waste water treatment plants , the sweetener resisted bacterial digestion .
Only after a long time and under UV irradiation in the presence of high concentrations of titanium oxide ( TiO2 ) did the sugar break down .
Considering that few plants use these methods , the majority of sucralose in wastewater enters the ecosystem .
She does n’t say for sure what effect this will have , but says that preliminary studies suggest high concentrations of sucralose may poison fish .

That Splenda you ’re drinking will be in our water supply for a while
Personally , I think people should use xylitol more .
First studied in the 1970 ’s , almost no negative effects have been found due to ingestion of even 400 + grams a day ( imagine 400 + grams of sugar !
BLECH ! ) and many positive health effects have been proven ranging from plaque - reducing effects to boosting your immune system .
It is about as sweet as sucrose , and has 2/3 the caloric content .
That said , I am still gonna go get me a coke zero .

First up , we have Rachel Getting Married , Jonathan Demme ’s character drama from last fall , which scored an Oscar nomination for its star , Anne Hathaway .
This one somehow passed me by when it was in theaters , but I keep hearing great things and I definitely plan on checking it out this week .
Hathaway plays Kym ( you mean not Rachel ? ? ) who has been in and out of rehab for years and comes home to attend her sister ’s — Rachel ’s — wedding .
I ’ve got a feeling it ’s not going to be one of those sunshine and smiles weddings .
Also hitting stores is Milk , the little Gus Van Sant picture you may have heard about when its star Sean Penn picked up an Oscar a few weeks ago for Best Actor and the script by Dustin Lance Black won for Best Original Screenplay .
It really was a pretty good film about the first gay elected official , Harvey Milk , who won a San Fransisco supervisor seat .
It has a real energy to it and makes all of the by - the - numbers biopic shenanigans feel very fresh and involving .
One of the few films of last year that was fairly deserving of all its Oscar - season acclaim .
( Except that it should have been Mickey ! )
And not enough people saw Let the Right One In , but a big factor of that was probably due to the fact that it just was n’t playing in a whole lot of cities .
Well , now it ’ll be available in DVD stores everywhere and you can help right that wrong .
It ’s a gorgeously shot and fascinating movie that came in at number 8 on my list of the best movies of last year .
I can guarantee that you ’ve never seen a vampire film quite like this one .
It ’s the best in years .
I hesitate to say too much about this one right now , so check back this Friday for this week ’s ” Slide THIS in Your Machine , ” which will be all about the power and the majesty that is Let the Right One In .
Also keep an eye out for Role Models , the surprise hit comedy from last fall starring Paul Rudd , Seann William Scott , and McLovin .
The movie is about two aimless douchebags who work for an energy drink company , have a run-in with Johnny Law , and are forced into community service , participating in a big brother program .
It ’s a standard mainstream comedy with a standard mainstream premise –the most mainstream thing that director David Wain has ever done .
But here ’s the catch–it ’s really , really funny !
This is one of the best examples out there of basic formula done oh so right .
And for complete nerds such as myself there ’s a lot of really great KISS humor .
What ’s not to love ??
And for those interested , there ’s also Transporter 3 , or as I like to think of it –Diet Crank .
There ’s Jason Statham , there ’s karate , there ’s explosions , there ’s everything .
Every desire you could possibly have that leads you to want to see this movie will be sated .
I can pretty much guarantee that .
Jason Statham is a bit of a quandry to me .
He appears to be doing the same kind of stuff that Steven Segal , Jean - Claude Van Damme , and Dolph Lundgren are doing .
Just not direct - to - video .
Your day will come one day , Mr. Statham .
You just wait .
Also look for Cadillac Records , a true story about the music biz starring Beyonce Knowles , Jeffrey Wright , and Adrien Brody , The Boy in the Striped Pajamas , a Holocaust film from director Mark Herman , Mike Leigh ’s Happy Go-Lucky , which should have–and was going to–score an Oscar nomination for its star Sally Hawkins … and then did n’t , and Battle in Seattle , the writing / directing debut of actor Stuart Townsend , starring Charlize Theron .
We ’ve got a rerelease of Walt Disney ’s Pinocchio .
See the animated classic as it was before Roberto Benigni changed the way we all see America ’s favorite wooden puppet to that of a gangly , balding Italian guy .
And there ’s finally a rerelease of Howard the Duck .
Now it ’s been entirely too long since I ’ve seen this film , so I do n’t have the right clever or smug comment to make for this .
I ’ve failed .
Blu - Ray releases this week include Rachel Getting Married , Milk , Let the Right One In , Role Models , Transporter 3 , Battle in Seattle , Cadillac Records , Brokeback Mountain , and Se7en .
And as hard of a choice as it was , I ’ve made my pick for this week in Charlie Kaufman ’s terrific directorial debut Synecdoche , New York .
Structurally , it ’s the closest thing we ’ve had to a David Lynch film since … well , David Lycnh ’s last film , Inland Empire , but it ’s nevertheless a whole other beast .
Kaufman ’s signature neurotic comedy finds a nice home in this story about depressed playwright ( played by the always - excellent Philip Seymour Hoffman ) who spends the rest of life writing and perfecting and performing ( but never for an audience ) his magnum opus .
It ’s a fascinating , surreal , and very funny film .
I ’m all of a sudden finding myself at a bit of a loss to say anything that we have n’t already said about this one .
See , we here at MovieChopShop have written about this film more than a few times .
You can read about it in my top 10 , in Quaid ’s top 10 , and in a full article about the film that Quaid wrote last month , declaring it the Most Overlooked Film of 2008 .
So , yeah , we ’re all pretty enamored with the thing .
And why not ?
It ’s a hell of an amazing film .
It ’ll be available on DVD and Blu - Ray this Tuesday , along with everything else mentioned here .
Watch it for yourself and have your mind blown .

Electronic TakeBack Coalition Urges Panasonic to Recycle on Panasonic Jumbotron
November 26th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
It ’s not always easy to get giant corporations to pay attention to consumer demands , but the Electronic TakeBack Coalition may have found a way — by demanding that Panasonic create a national recycling program on a Panasonic jumbotron screen in Times Square .

New stats from Nielsen Online show that by the end of 2008 , social networking had overtaken email in terms of worldwide reach .
According to the study , 66.8 % of Internet users across the globe accessed “ member communities ” last year , compared to 65.1 % for email .
The most popular online activities remain search and Web portals ( with around 85 % reach ) and the websites of software manufacturers .
The far - reaching study also explored a number of other trends within the social networking space .
In 2008 , users spent 63 % more time on member communities than they did in the previous year .
However , within member communities , Facebook saw growth of 566 % in time spent on it by users worldwide .
As has been reported elsewhere , Facebook ’s fastest growth demographic is older users – the social network tacked on 12.4 million people between ages 35 - 49 in 2008 according to Nielsen .
Some other key findings from the report :
- Globally , Facebook reaches 29.9 % of global Internet users , versus 22.4 % for MySpace .
- MySpace remains the most profitable social network , generating an estimated $ 1 billion in revenue versus $ 300 million for Facebook in 2008 .
- Facebook is the top social network in all countries except Germany , Brazil , and Japan ( Nielsen still has MySpace as tops in US in the report , but as of January ’ 09 , that had changed ) .
- On Twitter , CNN , The New York Times , and BBC have the greatest reach among mainstream media companies as of late February .
Overall , most of these trends are n’t surprising if you ’ve been following the space , but nonetheless , tie some numbers to them .
Most impressive is the rise of Facebook , who is outpacing the growth of the social networking space on the whole by nearly tenfold .

Turns out he ’s in the process of redeeming himself .
Alexandra Penny explains at the Daily Beast :
By not entering into a plea bargain , he ’s saved his dirty secrets and implicated none of the others who helped him scheme and steal .
He ’s also “ saved ” sweet , innocent little Ruthie and his sons , brother , grandchildren , et al. — a whole slew of his skanky relatives . …
This is a magnanimous gesture [ especially for someone who is ] given to .
. . sociopathic selfishness to exponential extremes .
( If you ’re wondering about the tone of Ms. Penny ’s writing , she ’s among those Madoff wiped out . )
Still it ’s questionable whether he ’ll be able to protect his family , who seem increasingly complicit .
Lucinda Franks , also in the Daily Beast , writes :
Ruth Madoff , who was considered “ innocent at first , ” according to this source , is believed to have received at least $ 70 million from her husband and is now therefore an object of the investigation . …
One source said that eventually , some members of Madoff ’s family will either be indicted by the US attorney ’s office for the Southern District of New York or cop a plea .
Nevertheless , do n’t his attempts to protect his family make you think he might not be such a bad guy after all ?
All things considered , maybe he was just trying too hard to be a benefactor to his people .
So what if he skimmed a few dozen billion off on the side ?
It was all the interest of fortifying his family ’s estate .
Turns out though , he likely had little chance of copping a plea anyway .
Bloomberg.com reports :
The absence of a plea bargain is “ unusual , ” said Richard Strassberg , a lawyer with Goodwin Procter LLP in New York .
He said the government probably did n’t offer a deal .
“ If that ’s what happened , the government viewed the scope of the conduct to be so egregious that a plea deal was n’t warranted , ” . . .
It looks like he might be seeing the last of his penthouse today — a judge may revoke his bail today .
In that same hearing , writes Richard Wray at the Guardian :
His victims are being given the opportunity to address the court .
Normally victim ’s statements are heard at the time of sentencing [ but ] the judge has said that he will allow further representations to be made at that time .
[ Judge ]
Denny Chin urged investors to bear in mind where they are when they give their statements and try to avoid unleashing their anger .
“ I understand that emotions are high but we have to remember to conduct ourselves in the manner that is appropriate to a courtroom proceeding , ” he said .
Should Ms. Penny show up , let ’s hope she makes it through the hearing without a contempt of court charge .
Errata :
The only article that gives you a glimpse into the man ’s psyche is Madoff ’s World by Mark Seal in the new issue of Vanity Fair .
Meanwhile , we can expect to see a ratcheting up in intensity of Ms. Penny ’s already edgy doll art .
( Since the images are small , you ’ll need to blow them up .
Pun intended — you ’ll see what I mean . )
WINDFALL , N.C. , May 15 , 2005  --
Beneath the surface of this Southern town , with its lush evergreens and winding riverbanks , is a largely forgotten legacy of pain , secrecy and human indignity .
" My heart still bleeds , and it will forever bleed , because of what had happened to me , " local resident Elaine Riddick said .
Riddick was one of thousands of people secretly sterilized by the state between 1929 and 1974 .
From the early 1900s to the 1970s , some 65,000 men and women were sterilized in this country , many without their knowledge , as part of a government eugenics program to keep so - called undesirables from reproducing .
" The procedures that were done here were done to poor folks , " said Steven Selden , professor at the University of Maryland .
" They were thought to be poor because they had bad genes or bad inheritance , if you will .
And so they would be the focus of the sterilization . "
Sterilized Without Her Knowledge
Riddick was raped and became pregnant at the age of 13 .
Social workers labeled her promiscuous and too feeble - minded to ever be a responsible parent .
So , after giving birth in 1968 , Riddick was sterilized without being told .
She learned the truth years later , when she married and tried to have more children .
" They took so much away from me , " Riddick said .
" They took away my spirit and my soul . "
North Carolina sterilized close to 8,000 women in hospitals across the state .
Even though the practice ended more than 30 years ago , some say the time has come to make amends .
North Carolina was one of the first states out of 33 that once practiced sterilization to offer an apology .
State Rep. Larry Womble is crafting a bill to provide financial reparations .
Some wonder where the state will get the money .
" They say , ' Well , we can't afford it , ' " said Womble , a Democrat .
" Well , we can not not afford it . "
Riddick went on to earn a college degree and raise the son she had at 14 .
He now is an engineering consultant .
" I thank you , God , for giving me my child , " she said .
ABC News ' Keith Garvin originally reported this story for " World News Tonight " on April 23 , 2005 .
This is a moment of great danger for our country .
The force of this recession is shifting power from indebted countries to those with large currency reserves .
The recession 's power will play havoc with the future of our society .
The foundations of our economy will be changed fundamentally .
Our indebtedness enfeebles the range of our responses to what are cataclysmic forces .
The nature of government will change and its structure transformed .
Party politics will for the foreseeable future be in the preserve of children cut off from the real world .
We are still in a phoney war .
Over the past six years of boom the government has borrowed £ 200 bn .
It plans to make that almost an annual sum .
When the financial market signals that it is not going to accept offloading at £ 150bn plus of annual government debt into the indefinite future , the real political war will start .
The figures are chilling and are still almost unappreciated by our political class .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Over the past 40 years the best tax yield came in at 37.6 per cent , while public expenditure peaked at a fraction below 50 per cent , both of GDP .
At some stage the financial market will trump the political obsession about borrowing ever more and force a strict diet of bringing revenue and expenditure much more quickly into balance .
Let us put aside that all this borrowing is about a Keynesian reflationary package .
The plans are to borrow 10 per cent of GDP .
Keynes would be apoplectic at deficit financing on this scale .
Unless resolute action is taken here , there is a very serious possibility of a sterling crisis ( a real achievement with a floating exchange rate ) reacting with a gilt strike of such severity that the British economy will be permanently damaged .
Practically all commentators dismiss this scenario as scaremongering .
But it is important to remember that it is this very same group of commentariat that first publicised no crisis and then went along with the Government 's grossly over - optimistic predictions of a short setback and a quick recovery .
Since September it has seemed to me that the crisis will be worse in this country than elsewhere ( www.frankfield . co.uk ) .
Sterling remains vulnerable falling by nearly 30 per cent in the last few months .
Interest rates on gilts are rising while the offloading of government debt is still to commence in earnest .
Steeply rising gilt interest rates will push up long - term interest rates and cut the very roots of economic recovery .
At some stage , the sooner the better , the government will have to see that putting up taxes and bringing expenditure into line , are the two conditions to ensure that extra borrowing is forthcoming for a softer landing .
Where will the Centre Left stand on the issue of the hour ?
Progressive politics for over a century have been associated with increasing government expenditure .
How can Central Left progressives forge a policy when the only agenda is tax increases and real cuts in public expenditure ?
This real agenda should be grouped around five inter-related strategies .
First , tax increases are unavoidable even in the short run , and the Government should seize that necessity to help make our tax system more progressive .
In times of economic decline it is more , not less important , to protect the poorest by developing initiatives that shift any increase in the tax burden onto those with the widest shoulders .
Central to any progressive response must be the rooting out of what are called non structural tax allowances .
Allowing pension contributions at the standard rate only would raise £ 6 bn .
Second , how can the skills of service commissioners in local authorities , schools and hospitals , be brought up to the best so that cash limited budgets lead to real improvements in services ?
These two moves alone , of increasing taxes on some , and cash limiting public expenditure , will mark a step change to a political culture built on debt .
This programme must be implemented through the next Budget and requires the Prime Minister to open genuine discussion with the leaders of the other two major parties to get an agreement that matches the hour .
The third part of a progressive strategy involves returning to civil society parts of the government programme .
Pensions are a huge part of the State 's budget and are set to grow .
Yet the universal pension is woefully inadequate and the means - test pensioner budget is expected to gobble up even more money .
The Pension Reform Group is proposing fundamental reform .
Our universal funded scheme will be built up to run alongside the state pension with a goal of a guaranteed pension taking pensioners off means - testing .
The most important point as far as progressivism is concerned is that the governance of the new scheme has to be at arm 's length from the government .
This scheme is redistributive so as to pay the contributions of the poor , but richer taxpayers along with all of us gain a guaranteed pension which most of them could not buy in the private market .
The scheme also divides the risk the community should bare - guaranteeing a decent minimum to every pensioner – while allowing individuals to carry the risk of income above this level .
The scheme not only sets a downward trend for Government expenditure but helps achieve the fourth big change which must centre around increasing savings .
The compulsory contributions will help in this respect .
But by guaranteeing that all other income will be paid on top of the new guaranteed pension , there is a clear message that it pays to save .
Increased savings is what the banking system is crying out for .
The fifth part of the reform programme entails changing the mind set of politicians .
We are caught up in believing that it is the State that ensures social progress .
History teaches otherwise .
Secure social advance has been achieved by freeing up the basic impulses of human beings to do good , and to improve the conditions of their families and friends .
For politicians to learn that getting off the back of families and communities might be the best way to drive a social advance may be the hardest lesson that the new politics demands .
Frank Field is Labour MP for Birkenhead .
His paper on progressivism will be published by Demos this week
Martin Hyland and John Power ( 2007 ) .
The Category Theoretic Understanding of Universal Algebra : Lawvere Theories and Monads .
ENTCS 172:437-458 .
Both monads and Lawvere theories provide characterisations of algebraic structure , with monads providing the more general characterisation .
The authors provide an introduction to Lawvere theories , discusses their relationship to sets , and why monads became the more popular treatment .
Then they tackle the application of the theory to the semantics of side effects , where they argue that the generality of monads allow them to characterise computational phenomena that are not to do with side effects such as partiality and continuations , and argue that Lawvere theories more cleanly characterise what side effects are .
This paper is a good introduction to an important line of recent research done by Hyland &Power ; cf. also the LtU story Combining computational effects .

Unrest in Tennessee : House GOP chairman joins suit to overturn Obama 's presidency John Byrne
Published : Friday February 13 , 2009
Print This Email This Democrats say GOP congressman joining suit is ' from Mars ' A Supreme Court decision apparently is n't enough for Tennessee lawmakers in the House .
Despite the fact that the Court rejected an effort to contest President Barack Obama 's citizenship in a case earlier this year , four Tennessee lawmakers are still pushing a legal action to force the president to turn over his birth certificate and other documents to prove his citizenship .
It also comes after Obama posted a copy of his birth certificate on his campaign website .
Tennessee Republican congressmembers Eric Swafford , Stacey Campfield , Glen Casada and Frank Niceley have agreed to join a Russian immigrant in California 's case against Obama -- which contends he's not eligible to be president , the Tennessean 's Theo Emery reported Friday .
Casada is the chairman of the House Republican caucus .
Ironically , the House chairman said his action was intended to quell discussion on the issue .
" Let 's just put this to bed , " Casada told Emery .
" Yes , people may say , you 're just chasing some conspiracy theory .
It 's a simple act on his part to just do , and we 're done  move on . "
The Defend Our Freedoms Foundation has n't yet filed the suit , Emery adds .
" I agree to be one of the plaintiff 's in a legal action filed by Dr. Orly Taitz , Esquire for a Writ of Mandamus to obtain birth certificate , immigration records , passports and other vital records for Barry Soetoro , aka Barack Hussein Obama , " Rep. Eric Swafford said in a letter written on official House stationery .
Adds Emery : " Democratic lawmakers ridiculed the action Thursday at a weekly press conference , with one lawmaker asking , ' Who's Eric Swafford ? ' and another answering , ' He 's from Mars . ' "
Smear campaigns were launched against the then - presidential hopeful last August which alleged then - candidate Obama was not a natural born US citizen .
But a non-profit , national fact - checking organization concluded that " Obama was born in the U.S.A. just as he has always said " and an official from the Hawaii Health Department called speculation on his citizenship " pretty ridiculous . "
When I first saw a Mosin Nagant , I thought it was an ugly gun .
But , like a lot of things , the more you see of them , the more you can learn to appreciate them .
They kind of grow on you .
I guess it was when first watching “ Enemy At the Gates ” that I finally wanted to have one .
The Mosin Nagant is a bolt action rifle developed by the Russians and used in the First and Second World Wars .
It is a fairly “ roughly ” made rifle , and they turned out millions of them .
Those that are C&R ( Curio & Relic ) Forearms Collectors can make some really good deals on these rifles nowadays .
If you look for a while , you can find factory refurbished rifles that are in excellent shape .
I recently bought a couple of these interesting rifles .
They are the Mosin Nagant 91/30 , a rifle with a long barrel , and the M - 44 , a short carbine version with a folding spike bayonet .
Another popular version is the M - 38 , which is like the M - 44 , except without the folding bayonet .
Both these rifles fire the 7.62 X 54R cartridge .
The 7.62 means it is .308 caliber ( actually the Russians make the bullets .310 or .311 ) , and the 54 refers to the case being 54 millimeters long , and the “ R ” means “ rimmed ”
It is a powerful round , about equal to the .30 - 06 cartridge .
Here ’s a round between a 7.62 X 39 and a .30 - 06 round .
Notice how they package this ammo , wrapped in paper and tied with little multi-colored strings .
Tman says he can just imagine some Russian women in a factory somewhere , wearing babuchkas , tying these bundles of cartridges .
Military surplus ammo is currently available at very reasonable prices .
It is corrosive , but that is not a big problem with a bolt action rifle , as long as you clean it properly , immediately after shooting .
( More on this later . )
Cheap ammo means that you can shoot these old rifles a lot , for very minimal cost .
I bought the rifles from Classic Arms , Inc .
Both of my rifles have laminated stocks , which I tend to like .
I did not have to do very much to get them looking like they do .
They were excellent , right out of the box .
These old rifles usually have “ dark ” bores .
This is a result of the mostly uneducated Soviet troops shooting corrosive ammo and not cleaning the bores properly .
Corrosive ammo leaves salts deposited in the bore and just putting oil in the bore will not stop it from rusting .
You must wash the bore with water or a water - based solvent , dry it , and then clean and oil the bore .
My experience is that they usually shoot just fine , and the more I shoot them and clean the bores , the better they look and shoot .
Here I am shooting the 91/30 .
I find that these long rifles are pleasant to shoot , with more of a “ push ” than a “ kick ” .
A typical 50 yard group is in the 3 inch range or less , if I do my part .
Here I am shooting the M - 44 off the bench .
The short barrel on this rifle means that it “ barks ” kind of loud and kicks harder .
I ’ve also seen photos of these shot at dusk , and they have a muzzle blast that looks like an atomic explosion .
It shot a fine group , but high left .
Some folks report that the M - 44 will shoot better groups with the bayonet extended , so let ’s give that a try .
Intrestingly , the group was about the same size , but moved about 4 inches right and about 3 inches down , at 50 yards .
I folded the bayonet and tried another group , and sure enough , it moved back to the first location on the target .
But , of course , these are not target rifles , they are “ shooters ” .
Here I am shooting the M - 44 on my hind legs .
It barks loud and belches fire !
Conclusion :
These are interesting rifles and a fascinating part of history .
Cheap to buy and cheap to shoot .

Donned in sunglasses , Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski ceremoniously raises his arms in the air
In August 2008 , Oregon hatched a plan to be the first US state to have highway - side solar panels .
Four months later , on the snowy 19th day of December 2008 , engineers flipped the switch and the system started generating a modest amount of power .
This is a 104 kW system comprised of 594 panels .
Its annual production is estimated to be 128 megawatt - hours – enough to power about 10 typical homes for a year .
However , The Oregon Dept of Transportation ( ODOT ) is using it to power the lights at the I - 5 & I - 205 exchange .
During the day when the highway lights are off and the sun is out , the PV panels will spin the nearby electric meter backwards .
The result ?
ODOT ’s power bill for this area will be one third less than last year .
If ODOT is able to switch to more efficient highway bulbs in the future , these PV panels will account for an even larger percentage of the interchange ’s electric needs .
Below is an aerial view of the panels .
While there is no publicly available energy monitoring yet , here ’s January 20th , 21st , and 22nd ’s power production for this system .
If you are used to reading solar output charts , you can tell that the 20th was a clear sunny day ( the smooth hump ) .
The 21st & 22nd , on the other hand were cloudy .
The pilot program has gone well and is likely the first of many similar installations to come .
Expect to see more solar panels along the highways of Oregon and possibly even on other ODOT facilities .

Have you ever read a horoscope , taken an online personality test , or even had a keyring that told you what your personality was based solely on your name ?
Were you surprised at the accuracy of what was said about you ?
Perhaps what you should have been surprised by is your own gullibility .
Do n’t feel too bad about it though – we all do it .
It ’s what ’s known as the Forer effect , and it ’s just one aspect of mental bias .
The Forer Effect
Back in 1948 , psychologist Bertram R. Forer gave his students a personality test .
He ignored their answers , and then handed them , individually , the exact same result , which read in part :
You have a need for other people to like and admire you , and yet you tend to be critical of yourself .
While you have some personality weaknesses you are generally able to compensate for them .
You have considerable unused capacity that you have not turned to your advantage .
Disciplined and self - controlled on the outside , you tend to be worrisome and insecure on the inside .
At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing . [ … ]
( Forer effect , The Skeptic ’s Dictionary )
This was cobbled together from various horoscopes , and bore no relation to any of the students ’ answers .
Forer then asked his students to rate how accurate their profile was , on a scale of 0 – 5 ( with 4 being “ good ” and 5 “ excellent ” ) .
The average rating given was 4.26 .
Since 1948 , the test has been repeated hundreds of times with other student groups , and the accuracy evaluation is always around 4.2 .
So how can we explain the Forer effect ?
Most people are likely to accept claims about themselves that they want to be true – it ’s very hard to be objective about your own nature .
The Skeptic ’s Dictionary suggests that :
We tend to accept questionable , even false statements about ourselves , if we deem them positive or flattering enough .
It ’s a bit like a magic trick .
The profile uses psychological facts about human nature , such as our tendency to engage in “ subjective validation “ : believing statements are correct because they have a personal meaning or significance to us .
It also uses vague , unquantified language such as “ a certain amount ” , “ at times ” , “ tend to be rather unrealistic ” .
Since Forer ’s research , other psychologists have found that people are much more likely to rate positive statements about themselves as accurate .
Self - Fulfilling Prophecies
People who expect to be successful are more likely to succeed .
People who expect to fail are more likely to fail .
We live up to our expectations .
( Self - fulfilling Prophecies , Terry Bragg , TerryBragg.com )
Suppose we follow someone attending a business conference .
Perhaps they believe horoscopes , and read one that says a new connection will take the to the next level in your career .
How you think they ’ll act t the conferenc ?
Chances are they ’ll be prowling around networking during coffee breaks and lunch .
They ’ll meet lots of people , and perhaps one of them may indeed be able to give them that big break they need .
But … does this mean their horoscope was correct ?
In quantum mechanics , there ’s an axiom that the observer affects the observed .
It ’s impossible to track , say , the motion of an atom without influencing it .
Similar principles apply here : by knowing their horoscope , they end up making different decisions than if they were acting without this knowledge .
If you are someone who reads and believes horoscopes , try living a month without them , then reading them at the end of the month .
See if they still seem so accurate .
This is one of the reasons why the Law of Attraction works : you do n’t manifest something purely through the power of your thoughts , but your focus on what you want leads you to put yourself into situations where you ’re much more likely to make progress towards your goals .
Probable Coincidences
Another way in which positive thinking can go too far is when we read too much into coincidences .
Have you ever had the experience of thinking of a friend you ’d not spoken to in ages – followed by an unexpected phone - call or email from them ?
Amazing !
we think to ourselves , it must be a sign .
Of course , we wo n’t pay any attention to the dozens of times earlier in the day you daydreamed about chocolate chip cookies that failed to materialze .
There are several reasons why we place too much importance on events that are simple coincidences .
The two key ones that I want to look at here are :
Hindsight bias ( “ the inclination to see events that have occurred as more predictable than they in fact were before they took place ” )
We tend towards selective validation – noticing positive correlations and ignoring near misses .
Hindsight Bias
Hindsight bias is when people who know the answer vastly overestimate its predictability or obviousness , compared to the estimates of subjects who must guess without advance knowledge .
Hindsight bias is sometimes called the I - knew - it - all - along effect .
( Overcoming Bias : Hindsight bias , Eliezer Yudkowsky , Overcoming Bias.com )
When a jury or group of people are told the result of an event ( Eliezer gives the example of outcomes of historical battles ) , they ’re likely to rate this outcome as highly probable based on the evidence .
Control groups who do not know the actual historical outcome assign more realistic probabilities to the various possible outcomes .
This means that , when a coincidence occurs , we sometimes think “ I knew that was going to happen ” … even when , if we ’d been asked a few days before , we ’d not have rated that particular event as any more likely than others .
Selective Validation ( aka “ the Jeanne Dixon effect ” )
We forget all the premonitions of disaster we ’ve had which did n’t predict the future and remember vividly those few which seemed to do so .
Instances of seemingly telepathic thought are reported to everyone we know ; the incomparably vaster number of times this does not occur are too banal to mention .
( from J.A. Paulos , Beyond Numeracy )
Have you ever had a dream which came true ?
Quite possibly – but you ’ve probably also had hundreds of dreams which did n’t .
Like the students who were given
Forer ’s personality profile , we tend to tune out the details that do n’t fit , and focus on the few ones which suit us .
That might mean selective memory of events , or focusing on the predictions made by astrologers and psychics which do seem to come true .
This is known as illusory correlation .
Be aware that we ’re all prone to this innate bias , however intelligent or well - educated we are .
Next time you think that something ’s an unbelievable coincidence , or an uncannily accurate prediction , question whether you ’re unconsciously selecting evidence which happens to fit your viewpoint .
A common ploy used by psychics ( often called the Jeanne Dixon effect ) is to make dozens of predictions knowing that the more that are made , the better the odds that one will hit .
When one comes true , the psychic counts on us to conveniently forget the 99 % that were way off .
This makes the correct predictions seem much more compelling than they really are .
This is a conscious or deliberate form of subjective validation , or , put more simply , fraud .
( The Power of Coincidence : Some Notes on Psychic Predictions , Robert Novella , Quackwatch )
Do n’t Be So Smug – You ’re Not So Great
In addition to the biases discussed previously , there are a number of interesting biases we tend to have in relation to thinking about our own attributes in comparison to other peoples ’ .
Most of us have a tendancy towards putting outselves on pedestals .
When people are asked to rate themselves at skills , desireable behaviours and attributes , they ’re likely to say that they ’re “ above average ” .
For example , a survey of American college students found that 88 % of drivers rated themselves as “ above average ” drivers .
This is known as the Lake Wobegone effect :
[ The Lake Wobegone effect ] is named for the fictional town of Lake Wobegon from the radio series A Prairie Home Companion , where , according to the presenter , Garrison Keillor , “ all the women are strong , all the men are good - looking , and all the children are above average . ”
( Lake Wobegone effect , Wikipedia )
Another term for this is “ illusory superiority ” ; rating yourself as “ better ” than other people within a group .
This commonly occurs within professions and between colleagues or classmates .
For example , the University of Nebraska asked teachers to rate themselves in terms of teaching ability .
68 % of teachers believed they were in the top 25 % – a statistical impossibility .
If you flatter yourself for being a great cook , a brilliant employee or a fantastic friend , consider whether you ’re falling into the mental bias trap .
Should you really be so smug – or are you underestimating where the “ average ” lies ?
( And a warning to those reading this thinking “ I ’m not as prone to bias as the average person ” … you ’ve just found the bias blind spot . )
Thinking Cautiously
Ready to apply what we ’ve just discussed ?
Here ’s an example of a real life horoscope :
There ’s a difference between knowing you ’ll have to make decisions , which you do , and being ready to make them , which you ’re not .
You see yourself as being decisive , and so could worry that others might regard you as weak for leaving things open - ended .
That may be true , at least right now .
However , the time you invest in reflection between now and the Capricorn New Moon , on December 27 , will yield valuable insights about here - and - now issues and , more importantly , your future .
On the same day , the courageous Mars moves into your sign and , a day later , meets the uncompromising Pluto .
After that , there will be no question where your direction lies .
( The Times : Woman section )
Can you see how this uses what we ’ve seen above about our tendency towards positive , selective , thinking ?
For example , in the first sentence , we see the horoscope writer using a universal truth about human nature : we all know that we need to make decisions , and we all frequently feel that we ’re not ready to do so on some matters .
The second sentence also applies to most people – do any of you view yourself as indecisive ?
The third sentence ( “ That may be true , at least right now . ” ) is vague enough to allow a lot of room for disagreement – the words may and at least show that the writer is not committing his or her self .
The next sentence relies on creating a self - fulfilling prophecy , “ The time you invest in reflection … will yield valuable insights about here - and - how issues , and , more importantly , your future . ”
After reading this , many people would be encouraged to spend some time in reflection , with the expectation that this reflection would result in “ valuable insights ” .
But this is not predicted by the horoscope – it ’s caused by reading the horoscope .
Having a life coach or business mentor tell you to spend more time on reflecting on your life and career would have a similar effect .
[ reddit-me ]
Positive thinking and focusing on what you want in your life ( using the “ Law of Attraction ” if you wish ) can be very helpful in leading you towards your goals .
If you read horoscopes , predictions , or personality profiles provided by “ experts , ” however , proceed with caution .
Be aware of the mental biases that we all have , and look out for vague language , general statements , the creation of self - fulfilling prophecies , and a reliance on coincidence .
Do you tend towards overly positive thinking – or do you manage to take a balanced , rational view of coincidences and so - called psychic phenomena ?

During the next decade , cosmologists will attempt to observe the first moments of the Universe , hoping to prove a popular theory .
They ’ll be searching for extremely weak gravity waves to measure primordial light , looking for convincing evidence for the Cosmic Inflation Theory , which proposes that a random , microscopic density fluctuation in the fabric of space and time gave birth to the Universe in a hot big bang approximately 13.7 billion years ago .
A new instrument called a polarimeter is being attached to the South Pole Telescope ( SPT ) , which operates at submillimeter wavelengths , between microwaves and the infrared on the electromagnetic spectrum .
Einstein ’s theory of general relativity predicts that Cosmic Inflation should produce the weak gravity waves .
Inflation
Theory proposes a period of extremely rapid and exponential expansion of the Universe during its first few moments prior to the more gradual Big Bang expansion , during which time the energy density of the universe was dominated by a cosmological constant - type of vacuum energy that later decayed to produce the matter and radiation that fill the Universe today .
In 1979 , physicist Alan Guth proposed the Cosmic Inflation Theory , which also predicts the existence of an infinite number of universes .
Unfortunately , cosmologists have no way of testing that particular prediction .
“ Since these are separate universes , by definition that means we can never have any contact with them .
Nothing that happens there has any impact on us , ” said Scott Dodelson , a scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and a Professor in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Chicago .
But there is a way to probe the validity of cosmic inflation .
The phenomenon would have produced two classes of perturbations .
The first , fluctuations in the density of subatomic particles happen continuously throughout the universe , and scientists have already observed them .
“ Usually they ’re just taking place on the atomic scale .
We never even notice them , ” Dodelson said .
But inflation would instantaneously stretch these perturbations into cosmic proportions .
“ That picture actually works .
We can calculate what those perturbations should look like , and it turns out they are exactly right to produce the galaxies we see in the universe . ”
The second class of perturbations would be gravity waves — Einsteinian distortions in space and time .
Gravity waves also would get promoted to cosmic proportions , perhaps even strong enough for cosmologists to detect them with sensitive telescopes tuned to the proper frequency of electromagnetic radiation .
If the new polarimeter is sensitive enough , scientists should be able to detect the waves .
“ If you detect gravity waves , it tells you a whole lot about inflation for our universe , ” said John Carlstrom from the University of Chicago , who developed the new instrument .
Carlstrom said detecting the waves would rule out various competing ideas for the origin of the universe .
“ There are fewer than there used to be , but they do n’t predict that you have such an extreme , hot big bang , this quantum fluctuation , to start with , ” he said .
Nor would they produce gravity waves at detectable levels .
A simulation at this link portrays the distortions in space and time at the subatomic scale , the result of quantum fluctuations occurring continuously throughout the universe .
Near the end of the simulation , cosmic inflation begins to stretch space - time to the cosmic proportions of the universe .
Cosmologists also use the SPT in their quest to solve the mystery of dark energy .
A repulsive force , dark energy pushes the universe apart and overwhelms gravity , the attractive force exerted by all matter .
Dark energy is invisible , but astronomers are able to see its influence on clusters of galaxies that formed within the last few billion years .
The SPT detects the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) radiation , the afterglow of the big bang .
Cosmologists have mined a fortune of data from the CMB , which represent the forceful drums and horns of the cosmic symphony .
But now the scientific community has its ears cocked for the tones of a subtler instrument — gravitational waves — that underlay the CMB .
“ We have these key components to our picture of the universe , but we really do n’t know what physics produces any of them , ” said Dodelson of inflation , dark energy and the equally mysterious dark matter .
“ The goal of the next decade is to identify the physics . ”

Just two years after producing Starship Troopers , a book beloved of right wing militarists everywhere , Robert Heinlein came up with Stranger in a Strange Land , in which guns are seen as " a great wrongness " , personal and sexual liberation a " goodness " , monotheistic religion no better than a carnival trick and making money an absurd diversion from the real business of life .
It 's debatable whether this contrast is a testament to the variety of Heinlein 's talents , the complexity of his politics or the dangers of taking anything written in a novel as an indication of a writer 's own viewpoint .
What is certain is that in its own way , Stranger In A Strange Land is just as effective as Starship Troopers .
It might not be , as paperback covers declared it for years , " the most famous science fiction novel of all time " , but having sold more than 5 m copies , it 's certainly among the most influential .
Its enthusiastic promotion of free love made it a staple of the 1960s hippy movement .
It gave birth to a word that entered common counter - cultural parlance ( " grok " , meaning , roughly , to understand fully and with empathy ) .
Most notably of all it inspired a religion —
The Church Of All Worlds — which survives to this day .
These achievements seem all the more impressive given that Heinlein pumped out all 222,000 words of the thing in just two months .
It was too long , too controversial , and too damn strange for Heinlein 's editor , who lopped 60,000 words off before its publication in 1961 .
Many consider Heinlein 's original , published uncut in 1991 , to be the better book , but I went for the shorter version — after all , that 's the one that won the Hugo , and I figured there was only so much I could take .
By the time I got to the end of Stranger , I 'd certainly had my fill of bizarre - SF - sauciness and libertarian philosophy .
But that does n't mean I did n't enjoy it .
The book begins like a kind of extra-terrestrial Jungle Book .
It 's the story of Valentine Michael Smith , a human raised on Mars — by Martians — who finds planet Earth entirely alien when he first arrives there .
Heinlein has great fun pointing out human oddities and foibles as Michael tries to " grok " the world around him , while creating an enjoyably nasty future world governed by backroom deals , black propaganda , and ( decades before Nancy Reagan ) the astrological obsession of the wife of the nominal head of state .
There are plenty of tense moments as Michael and the people who befriend him escape and outwit various " security " goons and there 's plenty of intrigue as a political case is put forward for his survival .
Sure , there are hints of things to come in the form of busty nurses and beautiful secretaries frolicking in swimming pools , but this part of the book is relatively straight .
It 's only once he's got you hooked that Heinlein really lets the weirdness flow .
In the second half , Michael establishes his own religion based on his experiences on Mars , combined with a conviction that clothes are essentially pointless and that having sex with lots of people is a very healthy way of getting " closer " to them .
Mercifully , Heinlein does n't indulge himself much beyond a few lascivious hints about hot tubs , long kisses so powerful they make women faint , clothes magically disappearing and characters feeling wonderful the following morning ( at least , not in the version I read ) .
All the same , it 's easy to see why Jess Crispin wrote :
" If this is what SF fans hold up as a classic , no wonder the outside world thinks the geeks are all a bunch of loonies .
Ca n't we have a classic that does n't have orgies ?
Can we agree that Heinlein writes about free love and fascistic governments and pick another representative for the genre ?
Because this is obviously not working … "
But that 's just the kind adverse reaction Heinlein expected .
He said he wanted to slaughter " the biggest , fattest sacred cows " of western society — chief among which is monogamy .
Certainly the challenge Michael presents to conventional mores is provocative — and must have seemed especially so in 1961 — and it's all presented in an appealingly gentle way ( with the exception of the fact that Jill , one of the lead characters , is prone to homophobia and saying things like : " nine times out of ten , if a girl gets raped it 's partly her fault " ) .
The lovey - dovey joy of Michael and his followers also provides an effective contrast with the more sharply barbed satires on religion and the media .
So yes , it 's daft , but it 's also thoughtful and generally good fun .
Heinlein does have a tendency to lecture and harangue , but generally does an excellent job of making palatable some challenging ideas .
You have to be a particular type of person to take these ideas entirely seriously , but as " an invitation to think — not to believe " ( as the author once described it ) Stranger From A Strange Land is a resounding success .

Video showing a Chinese woman ’s three - minute freak - out at the Hong Kong Airport is quickly becoming a viral Internet sensation .
The woman apparently missed her flight to San Francisco .
The video starts as she charges at a guard standing at the gate and screams like a raging banshee .
That , of course , is just the beginning of the antics .
In case you ’re curious , some of the woman ’s screams seemingly translate to : “ I want to go , I want to go ! ”
Rather than ejecting her from the premises , oddly enough , the airport decided to let her go :
She and her two travel mates were reportedly booked onto a later flight headed to Los Angeles without any extra costs .

How To Create Less Selfish Societies ?
Let People Behave As They Wish , Say Researchers
Cooperation , despite being now considered the third force of evolution , just behind mutation and natural selection , is difficult to explain in the context of an evolutionary process based on competition between individuals and selfish behaviour .
But this puzzle , that has haunted scientists for decades , is now a little closer to be solved by research about to be published on the journal Physical Review Letters .
The work , by scientists in Portugal and Belgium , reveals that an increasing range of behaviours among the individuals of a population leads to cooperation , supporting the idea that democracy - where individuals are free to act as they wish - is in fact the path for better societies .
Jorge Pacheco one of the authors of the study says : " the results support the idea that behavioral differences , on a grand scale , are instrumental in shaping us as the most sophisticated cooperating machines on this planet what is particularly interesting as it contradicts some social and political dogmas – such as Maoism and Stalinism - which , sometimes with rather unfortunate outcomes , have tried to enforce reduced behavioral diversity , supposedly with an aim to improve society "
Richard Dawkins never gets tired of reminding us that evolution is based on the survival of the fittest and on selfishness .
Every cell , every living thing is designed to promote its own survival , if necessary at the expense of everything else .
Still , cooperation is very much alive , and more , is widespread , being found in a multitude of living beings from the cells of a multicellular organism to insects and of course humans - the “ big cooperators ” .
Some examples are easy to understand , like those among family members , but those are not enough to explain how an apparently disadvantageous behaviour is , nevertheless , so common .
The key , it seems , lies on specific conditions in which cooperators become the individuals with highest fitness , allowing their expansion within the populations .
Very few examples have been found so far , however , and the simple observation of biological processes does not seem to be able to provide many more answers .
An alternative is to use mathematical models to look for those conditions that allow cooperators to thrive .
With this in mind S. Van Segbroeck , J.M. Pacheco and colleagues from the University of Lisbon , Portugal and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and the Universite Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium developed an artificial society in which individuals engage in a mathematical game called the “ prisoner ’s dilemma ” ( or PD ) .
In PD individuals interact with the choice of cooperating or defecting ( not cooperate ) and while cooperators provide a benefit to their partners ( and pay a cost for that ) defectors , not only have no costs , but also rip the benefits given by the cooperators .
In the basic version of PD defectors “ win ” and cooperators gradually disappear .
But recently it has been found that adaptive social networks - like human populations where individuals change behaviour all the time making new acquaintances and breaking others , continuously shaping and reshaping the social network structure - supported cooperation .
This led Pacheco and colleagues to ask if specific behavioural diversity within this dynamic world could be linked to cooperators emergence .
To answer that they adapted PD to take into account the adaptive social dynamics of human populations , while also introducing behavioural diversity to test if this last parameter affected the viability ( and consequently the emergence ) of cooperators .
As an example of behaviour variability they analysed partner fidelity .
In fact , when a social connection is established , it is rapidly evaluated and , if disadvantageous – like when one of the partners is a defector – it is broken but while some discontented individuals try to break contact ( defect ) very rapidly , others take much longer and it is this “ time taken to defect unwanted links ” that Pacheco and colleagues used as an example of behaviour variability to look for cooperation emergence
The group started by considering a situation where only two break - up velocities existed - fast and slow - with the population , as a result , being constituted by fast and slow defectors - respectively FD and SD - and fast and slow cooperators ( FC and SC ) all depending how long the individuals took to break unwanted ties ( although the time of a connection depends on both partners ) .
In this situation they found that most of the population turns into SD because these would be the ones with higher gains / higher fitness , as their interactions with cooperators would last longer
In the same way , most of the few cooperators surviving will be FC since they are the ones , among cooperators , losing less , as they spend less time interacting with defectors .
So in this example , again , the model predicts that defectors will be the ones predominant in the population .
Next , the researchers increased the number of possible defecting speeds to an almost continuum of values between fast and slow , and , to their surprise , many Cs are now capable of surviving and even thrive in the population .
The reason for that resides in the fact that many more types of defectors , and not only SD , are able to survive , and those faster Ds will provide an escape hatch for cooperators , which , by interacting mostly with cooperators and preferentially with the faster defectors , now manage , not only to survive , but also to dominate in the population .
So in this case cooperators thrive and “ invade ” the population .
Van Segbroeck , Pacheco and colleagues ’ model reveals that populations in which individuals exhibit higher diversity when handling their social contacts end up being much more cooperative , than those where no such diversity exists .
This is particularly interesting if we consider that individuals always behave according to their own narrow - minded preferences and still , despite of this , cooperation blooms
There are several interesting aspects to this work , and not the least because it helps to understand better the emergence of cooperation , a crucial force for better human societies .
But like Pacheco says : " The results are even more exciting , if we take into account that diversity in individual behavior is on the basis of this result .
Hence , we expect that societies in which individuals are free to express their inherent differences will be more cooperative than those in which individuals are constrained to exhibit very similar behavior .
Of course , to extrapolate from such a simple model into complex Human Societies is both unreasonable and inescapable .
In this respect , we may contrast democracies with dictatorships , religious freedom with religious indoctrination , and so on . ”
Another important aspect of the research is the flexibility of the model developed by the team of researchers that can now be used to answer other questions like Pacheco explains : " A great example is epidemics .
There the dynamical process between individuals is the contagion due to a biological virus , and the model allows now to determine how the evolution of the number of infected individuals in the community affects and is affected by the dynamical network that supports the individuals . "

A British woman on death row in Texas made a final bid this week to avoid execution and have her case re-tried .
Her family and campaigners claim that she was not properly represented at her original trial and that she is innocent of the murder for which she was convicted .
Linda Carty , 50 , a former primary schoolteacher , was sentenced to death in 2002 after being convicted of taking part in the murder of 25 - year - old Joana Rodriguez .
Her legal team this week filed grounds for an appeal in a bid to overturn her conviction and death sentence in the state with the highest rate of executions in the US .
Carty was born in St Kitts and has British citizenship as a result of the Caribbean island 's status at that time .
She worked as a teacher there before moving with her family to Houston , Texas , when she was 23 .
In Houston , she was approached by the police because the man she was dating at that time was , unknown to her , a drug dealer .
She became a confidential informant ( CI ) , passing on information about dealers and occasionally making test purchases of drugs on behalf of the Drugs Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) .
As a result of this work , she claims , she inevitably made a number of enemies .
In 2001 , three men broke into the apartment where the murder victim , Rodriguez , lived with her partner , Raymundo Cabrera .
The men demanded drugs and stole a small quantity of cash .
They also beat and bound Cabrera and his cousin , Rigoberto Cardernas , and abducted Rodriguez and her four - day - old son , Ray .
The baby was later found unharmed in a car , but Rodriguez was suffocated to death after being bound , her mouth duct - taped , and a plastic bag placed over her head .
The prosecution 's case was that Carty was afraid of losing her common - law husband , Jose Corona , and thought that , if she had another baby , he would stay with her .
It was alleged that , because she was unable to conceive , she hired the men to kidnap a pregnant Rodriguez and remove the baby , using a pair of " surgical scissors " .
Initially , Carty was represented by a local lawyer , Jerry Guerinot , some of whose other previous clients are also now on death row .
According to the organisation Reprieve , which has taken up Carty 's case , and her current lawyers , no proper defence was mounted and she was not aware of her rights to consular access as a British citizen .
Many of the discrepancies in the case against her were not challenged in her trial .
Most glaringly , Rodriguez had already given birth so Carty , who lived in the same apartment complex as her , could hardly be accused of trying to remove the baby from the womb .
Vitally , two key witnesses , her common - law husband and her DEA contact , both of whom could have helped her case , were never contacted by the defence team .
Her DEA contact , Charlie Mathis , might have been able to testify to the extent of Linda 's DEA work but was not asked to do so by the defence .
In October 2005 , Mathis swore in an affidavit that he could have given evidence that would have significantly aided her defence .
" I found it odd that Linda 's attorneys never even attempted to contact me , let alone talk with me about my testimony at Linda 's trial , " he said .
In his affidavit , Mathis stated : " I would have been willing to testify that Linda should not have gotten the death penalty and also would have been willing to testify that I do not believe her to be a future danger .
I would have testified that she is not a violent person , let alone a cold - blooded murderer . "
" When I began this case , I was pro-death penalty , " said Mike Goldberg of the law firm , Baker Botts , which is now representing Carty .
" But the facts are so outrageous that my firm is sparing no expense to get Linda Carty a new trial . "
Goldberg claims that key witnesses were never contacted .
Clive Stafford Smith of Reprieve said : " It is time for the British to get seriously worried about Linda .
She has not come close to a fair hearing so far - her lawyer presented virtually no defence , and no court has since taken her case seriously . "
Karl Rove , one - time deputy chief of staff to former President George W. Bush , spoke to a jam - packed Storer Auditorium at the University of Miami Thursday afternoon .
After a brief opening speech , Rove transformed the event into an open forum during which audience members could ask him a question or engage him in a debate .
The “ campaign architect , ” as he is commonly called , built a case against President Barack Obama ’s order to close Guantanamo , an overseas CIA detention center where terrorists and other “ enemy combatants ” are held .
Obama ’s order could enable terrorists to be tried in U.S. courts , to be given undeserved rights afforded American citizens and could cause damaging long - term effects , Rove said .
“ One year from now , Gitmo wo n’t be closed , ” Rove said .
“ If it is , there will be an uproar in the U.S. about where to put these people . ”
Interrogation tactics used by the CIA during Bush ’s term in office were not torturous , Rove said , but he did not deny that the CIA strongly pressed terrorists for vital information .
“ You bet we squeeze them for information , ” Rove said .
“ If we had n’t , those same terrorists could have executed their plans to kill , and [ people ] would be asking why Bush did n’t protect American soldiers ’ lives . ”
A heated exchange erupted between Rove and senior Corey Ciorciari , a longtime intern for the Obama campaign .
Cioriciari asked about the ethics of using “ fear and deception ” as governing tactics .
Rove called Ciorciari ’s accusation “ cynical and callous . ”
“ Was it creating fear when we got reports that Saddam Hussein stores secret supplies for chemical weapons , that he had a willingness to use destruction , that he was developing and seeking weapons – that he was an imminent threat to the U.S. ? ”
Rove asked .
“ These are not quotes by Bush .
They ’re quotes by Bill Clinton , Hillary Clinton , Kerry . ”
A loud applause erupted from the audience , but Ciorciari was not convinced .
“ I think it ’s nice he came [ to speak ] after Obama ’s inauguration …
It ’s a testament to how much this country rejected the last eight years , ” Ciorciari later told The Miami Hurricane .
“ What really struck me is his lack of acknowledgment and disappointment .
He never owned up to [ the administration ’s ] mistakes .
I wish , in retrospect , that I could have said a lot more . ”
Other students said they appreciated Rove ’s honesty .
“ I loved it ; he was very informative and very honest about his opinions , ” said Sgt. Agbeyegbe Jolomi , a junior who served in Iraq for one year .
“ I ’m happy I came to this event . ”
Bush was deeply changed by the Sept. 11 attacks , Rove said , and keeps the badge of a firefighter killed during the rescue effort in his pocket at all times as a constant reminder of his “ guiding responsibility to keep the country safe . ”
“ I know that 9/11 has receded from some people ’s minds , but I will tell you it has n’t left George W. Bush ’s mind , ” Rove said .
A heartfelt story about Bush ’s compassion for the American people and his devastated reaction upon first visiting Ground Zero left many in tears .
“ It gave us a new perspective on the Bush administration and the decisions they made , ” senior Andrea Whalen said .
“ If you look at the facts , Bush got an unfair rap .
He made a lot of really tough decisions for the best interest of the nation .
It was really great when [ Rove ] finally set the record straight . ”
Rove still encouraged attendees to support the new president , stating that he “ wishes Obama success . ”
“ It was fantastic , more than what I expected , ” said Remy Flor , a junior and fan of Rove’s .
“ To see him in the flesh was great , and the presentation reinforced my views . ”

Franchise Smart – 10 Tips Before you Start a Franchise
For many budding entrepreneurs , franchising a business is an attractive option .
It allows them to become a business owner using processes and systems which have been shown to work in the field , reducing risk and cost .
However , before you start a franchise business , you need to be aware of the pitfalls and find way to select , evaluate and ultimately sign up with a franchise in a more intelligent manner .
We Tried Once and we Failed ( or so we thought ? )
The tips outlined below come from the personal experience my wife and I had when we decided to open a franchised fast - casual style restaurant about 7 years ago .
The whole process of selecting a franchise to negotiating an agreement , site selection and eventually deciding to terminate the agreement took a little more than a year .
It was a very stressful time for both of us .
Like many would be franchisees , we were going through this process while we were both holding a job .
Eventually we decided to terminate the agreement after we decided that the franchiser support during the process was lacking .
It did not bode well for the kind of support we could expect to receive after the restaurant was up and running .
We did lose our franchise fee in the process .
But frankly , now when we look back at that time and the decision we made , we are quite happy that we terminated the franchise agreement and took the loss .
Similar fast - casual restaurants in that cuisine are now closing down at an alarming rate in our area .
Of course , franchisers vary in what they offer in terms of support and stability .
But even if you are going with a recognized brand , you still need to be careful .
Cosi is a very popular chain of sandwich shops which is in financial trouble .
Chi-chi’s , long a fixture in our community , has shut down .
Many auto - repair and transmission franchises are in trouble as well .
It is wise to do your research before you sign on the dotted line , even if you see these franchises all over the country .
Tips You Need to Consider Before You Decide
1. Do a Thorough Due Diligence
This should include reviewing the historical financial statements , doing a Google search to find the legal history of the franchiser , looking at the resumes of the management team , etc .
Financial statements are very important and a careful review along with the franchise historical growth rates should give a good indication of whether the product is popular with the consumers .
A franchiser who loses money is likely to increase royalties and other fees in the future .
In our case we had a franchiser who broke even for the past 3 years and underwent several management changes not properly explained to us .
This was a red flag for us .
Non-audited historical financial statements was another .
A franchiser will not reveal a typical annual sales figure for a franchise .
Sometimes this can be deduced by looking at the royalty numbers on the Franchiser P&L , dividing it by the number of open franchises that year and multiplying the result by the royalty factor ( if the royalties are 5 % of the sales , than you need to multiply by 20 ) .
Keep in mind that these numbers may not be accurate due to franchises that may have opened in the mid year or franchises that may have closed down during the year .
You may need to make appropriate adjustments .
2. Review the UFOC Multiple Times and Use a Lawyer
An UFOC document ( Uniform Franchise Offering Circular ) should be presented to the potential franchisee early in the process .
Make sure that you read the document word by word a few times .
Than hire a lawyer and have him go through it .
Even though UFOCs are now written in plain english , a lawyer should still be a part of your team .
Many times there are clauses that appear harmless but can cause a conflict in a manner that you may not be aware .
You can not negotiate a change in the UFOC .
The final Franchise Agreement will be based on the UFOC but you can still negotiate amendments to the Franchise Agreement that will need to be attached to the document .
We requested amendments to allow us to operate the restaurant under a different name if the franchiser goes bankrupt .
We also negotiated a narrower scope on the non-compete clause .
Do not skimp on the lawyer .
A few thousand dollars extra spent at this stage can mean avoiding tens of thousands of dollars in expenses later on .
3. Interview Current and ex- Franchisees on Phone and in Person
This is very important as a franchiser will not tell you if you are going to be profitable .
By law , they are not allowed to give out numbers or make claims .
The only way you can gauge if this can be a profitable business is by talking to existing franchisees .
I recommend to go and visit a few franchisees in person at their place of business so you can also see if the place is busy .
Talk to the ex-franchises to understand why they left the franchise .
If they had support or other issues or if the business was not profitable , you need to understand and know this early in the process .
Although it did not dawn on us at that time , the franchiser accompanied us to the franchises we visited ( under the guise of showing us around ) .
This put the current franchisee on guard so they would not reveal information that they should not ( but that you really want them to talk about candidly )
4. Define Your Exclusive Territory
You want to ensure that the franchiser does not offer a franchise to someone else in the close proximity to you .
At the same time you want to make sure that if the franchiser limits the number of stores in a certain radius and if this radius includes an airport or a hospital than the airport and hospital are exempted from the limits .
You may want to open another store in the airport within your exclusive territory .
This will not cannibalize your sales as the airport traffic is very different from your local neighborhood traffic .
5. Evaluate Franchiser Support and Help
Franchiser support and help will make or break your business so it is vitally important that you observe the process for clues on how this is working .
Interviewing current and ex-franchisees helps .
This was the straw that broke the camel ’s back for us .
The franchiser only allowed us to work with his appointed real - estate broker to find a location and negotiate a lease but the real - estate broker assigned to us was very unresponsive to our questions .
So much so that some of the best locations we had our eyes on were scooped up by competitors within months while our agent procrastinated .
6. Protect Your Franchise Fee
We lost our franchise fee due to what we felt were legitimate issues in the franchiser performing his duties but we did not have a legal ground to ask for a refund .
It may be possible to put in a contingency clause in the franchise agreement that allows for the fee to be returned .
If that is not possible , try to delay paying the fee as long as possible or negotiate an installment based structure for the franchise fee based on achievement of certain milestones .
7. Understand Your Start Up Costs Early
A Franchiser will give you a range of what the typical costs are , but you need to understand the costs in your local market .
Go ahead and start making calls to the contractors if a store front needs to be built .
This way you will also get a head start on a contractor selection process .
8. Understand Your Time Commitments
If you are looking at a restaurant franchise , forget about the possibility of running it part time while holding a full time job .
It may be possible later if you can find a trustworthy manager but in the beginning you will have to devote time until you are able to build trust AND your business gains profitability .
There may be certain franchises that can be run absentee but not many .
Also remember that for most franchises , you will need to commit some time and money before the start up for training for yourself and your employees .
9. Form Complete Picture of a Typical P&L
This is important and you will need to pick up clues as you go along in the franchising process by talking to different people and preparing financial models .
It would be helpful to build a business plan for the business as you go through the process .
You will need to consider sales volume , traffic , employee counts , payroll , rent , utilities , inventory , franchise fees ( royalties , advertisements , etc ) , as well as any regulatory compliance expenses .
10 . Choose Location Carefully
This is a very important factor in determining if your business will be profitable or not .
You need good traffic from the demographics that your business is targeting .
Opening a Kinko’s in a mall is not advisable , regardless of amount of traffic in the mall as this is not a traffic well targeted to your business .
Also if you are looking to open a store or a restaurant in a busy office building , you will have very little night traffic or traffic from young people .
Some of this is common sense , but a large part of this is doing careful research on demographics , traffic patterns and future development plans for the area .
Deciding to start a franchise can be life changing and you want to make the process as stress free as possible .
Do not make the same mistakes we made .
The real work begins when you start your franchise and become a business owner .
Hopefully these tips would help you get there easier and safer .
Are you a franchise owner or have you thought about owning one ?
What has been your experience .
Please let us know and join in the discussion .

A federal appeals court on Friday revived two lawsuits brought against Pfizer by Nigerian families who claim the giant drugmaker used their children in an illegal test of an experimental antibiotic .
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled that the suits , dismissed earlier by a lower court judge who said they should have been brought in Nigeria , can now go forward in the U.S. courts .
Lawyers said the ruling could set a precedent affecting other American companies accused of wrongdoing overseas .
The lawsuits seek unspecified damages on behalf of the families , who claim Pfizer violated international law by testing the drug , known as Trovan , on gravely ill children without their knowledge .
Eleven children died during the 1996 clinical trial , carried out during a record meningitis epidemic .
Other children developed brain damage and crippling arthritis .
" This is a homerun for us , " said Richard P. Altschuler , an attorney for the families .
" The judges are making a statement .
They are telling companies , if you go overseas , justice will come back to the United States . "
Pfizer also is the target of criminal and civil legal actions in Nigeria , where authorities are seeking damages of more than $ 8 billion .
While the ruling in New York has no direct effect on the Nigerian actions , attorneys in the case said it could complicate long - running settlement negotiations there .
Pfizer issued a statement dismissing the court action as " only a procedural ruling . "
" It is not a determination on their merits , " the statement said .
" Indeed , the strong dissent by one of the judges may be grounds for further appellate proceedings .
Pfizer remains confident that it will prevail in these cases , and is weighing its options on how to best respond to this decision . "
Pfizer said the clinical study was conducted with the approval of the Nigerian government and the consent of the participants ' parents or guardians .
The trial violated no international or Nigerian laws , the company said .
The experiment came to light in December 2000 , when The Washington Post published a lengthy examination of the trial .
It found Pfizer carried out the experiment on 200 children at a makeshift epidemic camp in the northern Nigerian town of Kano .
The articles reported that Pfizer had no signed consent forms for the children and relied on a falsified ethics approval letter to defend the design of the experiment .
Trovan was never approved for use by American children .
The Food and Drug Administration approved it for adults in 1998 but later severely restricted its use after reports of liver failure .
The European Union banned the drug in 1999 .
In the majority opinion in the 2 - to - 1 ruling , Circuit Judge Barrington D. Parker wrote that " the administration of drug trials without informed consent on the scale alleged in the complaints poses a real threat to international peace and security . "
Such unethical experimentation , Parker wrote , " fosters distrust and resistance to international drug trials , cutting - edge medical innovation , and critical international public health initiatives in which pharmaceutical companies play a key role .
...
As this case illustrates , the failure to secure consent for human experimentation has the potential to generate substantial anti-American animus and hostility . "
Babatunde Irukera , a lawyer representing the Nigerian government , said settlement negotiations in Nigeria have been productive .
But discussions there have centered on Pfizer paying a sum to settle all outstanding claims , including those of the families .
Now , the families may decide to pursue a separate remedy in the United States , setting back the talks in Nigeria , he said .
Pfizer 's attorneys have already offered more than $ 50 million to settle the Nigerian cases , Irukera said , but authorities there rejected the figure .
Chris Loder , a Pfizer spokesman in New York , declined to discuss specific figures but confirmed the negotiations .
" We continue to be interested in an amicable settlement that would help improve and expand healthcare for the people of Nigeria , " Loder said .
" The settlement process is ongoing and we are prepared to stay at the negotiating table until we reach such an agreement . "
In its statement , Pfizer said that the company " has great sympathy for everyone who suffered during the devastating meningitis epidemic in 1996 .
The company has said all along that all clinical evidence points to the fact that any deaths or injuries were the direct result of the illness , and not the treatment provided to patients in the Pfizer study .
With a survival rate of 94.4 percent , Trovan helped save lives and was at least as effective as the best treatment available at Kano 's Infectious Disease Hospital . "

I. Separation Perfected
But certainly for the present age , which prefers the sign to the thing signified , the copy to the original , representation to reality , the appearance to the essence ... illusion only is sacred , truth profane .
Nay , sacredness is held to be enhanced in proportion as truth decreases and illusion increases , so that the highest degree of illusion comes to be the highest degree of sacredness .
 Feuerbach , Preface to the second edition of The Essence of Christianity 1 THE WHOLE LIFE of those societies in which modern conditions of production prevail presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles .
All that once was directly lived has become mere representation .
2 IMAGES DETACHED FROM every aspect of life merge into a common stream , and the former unity of life is lost forever .
Apprehended in a partial way , reality unfolds in a new generality as a pseudo - world apart , solely as an object of contemplation .
The tendency toward the specialization of images - of - the - world finds its highest expression in the world of the autonomous image , where deceit deceives itself .
The spectacle in its generality is a concrete inversion of life , and , as such , the autonomous movement of non-life .
3 THE SPECTACLE APPEARS at once as society itself , as a part of society and as a means of unification .
As a part of society , it is that sector where all attention , all consciousness , converges .
Being isolated  and precisely for that reason  this sector is the locus of illusion and false consciousness ; the unity it imposes is merely the official language of generalized separation .
4 THE SPECTACLE IS NOT a collection of images ; rather , it is a social relationship between people that is mediated by images .
5 THE SPECTACLE CANNOT be understood either as a deliberate distortion of the visual world or as a product of the technology of the mass dissemination of images .
It is far better viewed as a weltanschauung that has been actualized , translated into the material realm  a world view transformed into an objective force .
6 UNDERSTOOD IN ITS TOTALITY , the spectacle is both the outcome and the goal of the dominant mode of production .
It is not something added to the real world  not a decorative element , so to speak .
On the contrary , it is the very heart of society 's real unreality .
In all its specific manifestations  news or propaganda , advertising or the actual consumption of entertainment  the spectacle epitomizes the prevailing model of social life .
It is the omnipresent celebration of a choice already made in the sphere of production , and the consummate result of that choice .
In form as in content the spectacle serves as total justification for the conditions and aims of the existing system .
It further ensures the permanent presence of that justification , for it governs almost all time spent outside the production process itself .
7 THE PHENOMENON OF SEPARATION is part and parcel of the unity of the world , of a global social praxis that has split up into reality on the one hand and image on the other .
Social practice , which the spectacle 's autonomy challenges , is also the real totality to which the spectacle is subordinate .
So deep is the rift in this totality , however , that the spectacle is able to emerge as its apparent goal .
The language of the spectacle is composed of signs of the dominant organization of production  signs which are at the same time the ultimate end - products of that organization .
8 THE SPECTACLE CANNOT be set in abstract opposition to concrete social activity , for the dichotomy between reality and image will survive on either side of any such distinction .
Thus the spectacle , though it turns reality on its head , is itself a product of real activity .
Likewise , lived reality suffers the material assaults of the spectacle 's mechanisms of contemplation , incorporating the spectacular order and lending that order positive support .
Each side therefore has its share of objective reality .
And every concept , as it takes its place on one side or the other , has no foundation apart from its transformation into its opposite : reality erupts within the spectacle , and the spectacle is real .
This reciprocal alienation is the essence and underpinning of society as it exists .
9 IN A WORLD THAT really has been turned on its head , truth is a moment of falsehood .
10 THE CONCEPT OF the spectacle brings together and explains a wide range of apparently disparate phenomena .
Diversities and contrasts among such phenomena are the appearances of the spectacle  the appearances of a social organization of appearances that needs to be grasped in its general truth .
Understood on its own terms , the spectacle proclaims the predominance of appearances and asserts that all human life , which is to say all social life , is mere appearance .
But any critique capable of apprehending the spectacle 's essential character must expose it as a visible negation of life  and as a negation of life that has invented a visual form for itself .
11 IN ORDER TO DESCRIBE the spectacle , its formation , its functions and whatever forces may hasten its demise , a few artificial distinctions are called for .
To analyze the spectacle means talking its language to some degree  to the degree , in fact , that we are obliged to engage the methodology of the society to which the spectacle gives expression .
For what the spectacle expresses is the total practice of one particular economic and social formation ; it is , so to speak , that formation 's agenda .
It is also the historical moment by which we happen to be governed .
12 THE SPECTACLE MANIFESTS itself as an enormous positivity , out of reach and beyond dispute .
All it says is : " Everything that appears is good ; whatever is good will appear . "
The attitude that it demands in principle is the same passive acceptance that it has already secured by means of its seeming incontrovertibility , and indeed by its monopolization of the realm of appearances .
13 THE SPECTACLE IS essentially tautological , for the simple reason that its means and its ends are identical .
It is the sun that never sets on the empire of modern passivity .
It covers the entire globe , basking in the perpetual warmth of its own glory .
14 THE SPECTACULAR CHARACTER of modern industrial society has nothing fortuitous or superficial about it ; on the contrary , this society is based on the spectacle in the most fundamental way .
For the spectacle , as the perfect image of the ruling economic order , ends are nothing and development is all  although the only thing into which the spectacle plans to develop is itself .
15 AS THE INDISPENSABLE PACKAGING for things produced as they are now produced , as a general gloss on the rationality of the system , and as the advanced economic sector directly responsible for the manufacture of an ever - growing mass of image - objects , the spectacle is the chief product of present - day society .
16 THE SPECTACLE SUBJECTS living human beings to its will to the extent that the economy has brought them under its sway .
For the spectacle is simply the economic realm developing for itself  at once a faithful mirror held up to the production of things and a distorting objectification of the producers .
17 AN EARLIER STAGE in the economy 's domination of social life entailed an obvious downgrading of being into having that left its stamp on all human endeavor .
The present stage , in which social life is completely taken over by the accumulated products of the economy , entails a generalized shift from having to appearing : all effective " having " must now derive both its immediate prestige and its ultimate raison d'etre from appearances .
At the same time all individual reality , being directly dependent on social power and completely shaped by that power , has assumed a social character .
Indeed , it is only inasmuch as individual reality is not that it is allowed to appear .
18 FOR ONE TO WHOM the real world becomes real images , mere images are transformed into real beings  tangible figments which are the efficient motor of trancelike behavior .
Since the spectacle 's job is to cause a world that is no longer directly perceptible to be seen via different specialized mediations , it is inevitable that it should elevate the human sense of sight to the special place once occupied by touch ; the most abstract of the senses , and the most easily deceived , sight is naturally the most readily adaptable to present - day society 's generalized abstraction .
This is not to say , however , that the spectacle itself is perceptible to the naked eye  even if that eye is assisted by the ear .
The spectacle is by definition immune from human activity , inaccessible to any projected review or correction .
It is the opposite of dialogue .
Wherever representation takes on an independent existence , the spectacle reestablishes its rule .
19 THE SPECTACLE IS HEIR to all the weakness of the project of Western philosophy , which was an attempt to understand activity by means of the categories of vision .
Indeed the spectacle reposes on an incessant deployment of the very technical rationality to which that philosophical tradition gave rise .
So far from realizing philosophy , the spectacle philosophizes reality , and turns the material life of everyone into a universe of speculation .
20 PHILOSOPHY IS AT ONCE the power of alienated thought and the thought of alienated power , and as such it has never been able to emancipate itself from theology .
The spectacle is the material reconstruction of the religious illusion .
Not that its techniques have dispelled those religious mists in which human beings once located their own powers , the very powers that had been wrenched from them  but those cloud - enshrouded entities have now been brought down to earth .
It is thus the most earthbound aspects of life that have become the most impenetrable and rarefied .
The absolute denial of life , in the shape of a fallacious paradise , is no longer projected onto the heavens , but finds its place instead within material life itself .
The spectacle is hence a technological version of the exiling of human powers in a " world beyond "  and the perfection of separation within human beings .
21 SO LONG AS THE REALM of necessity remains a social dream , dreaming will remain a social necessity .
The spectacle is the bad dream of modern society in chains , expressing nothing more than its wish for sleep .
The spectacle is the guardian of that sleep .
22 THE FACT THAT the practical power of modern society has detached itself from itself and established itself in the spectacle as an independent realm can only be explained by the self - cleavage and self - contradictoriness already present in that powerful practice .
23 AT THE ROOT OF the spectacle lies that oldest of all social divisions of labor , the specialization of power .
The specialized role played by the spectacle is that of spokesman for all other activities , a sort of diplomatic representative of hierarchical society at its own court , and the source of the only discourse which that society allows itself to hear .
Thus the most modern aspect of the spectacle is also at bottom the most archaic .
24 BY MEANS OF THE SPECTACLE the ruling order discourses endlessly upon itself in an uninterrupted monologue of self - praise .
The spectacle is the self - portrait of power in the age of power 's totalitarian rule over the conditions of existence .
The fetishistic appearance of pure objectivity in spectacular relationships conceals their true character as relationships between human beings and between classes ; a second Nature thus seems to impose inescapable laws upon our environment .
But the spectacle is by no means the inevitable outcome of a technical development perceived as natural ; on the contrary , the society of the spectacle is a form that chooses its own technical content .
If the spectacle  understood in the limited sense of those " mass media " that are its most stultifying superficial manifestation  seems at times to be invading society in the shape of a mere apparatus , it should be remembered that this apparatus has nothing neutral about it , and that it answers precisely to the needs of the spectacle 's internal dynamics .
If the social requirements of the age which develops such techniques can be met only through their mediation , if the administration of society and all contact between people now depends on the intervention of such " instant " communication , it is because this " communication " is essentially one - way ; the concentration of the media thus amounts to the monopolization by the administrators of the existing system of the means to pursue their particular form of administration .
The social cleavage that the spectacle expresses is inseparable from the modern State , which , as the product of the social division of labor and the organ of class rule , is the general form of all social division .
25 SEPARATION IS THE alpha and omega of the spectacle .
Religious contemplation in its earliest form was the outcome of the establishment of the social division of labor and the formation of classes .
Power draped itself in the outward garb of a mythical order from the beginning .
In former times the category of the sacred justified the cosmic and ontological ordering of things that best served the interests of the masters , expounding upon and embellishing what society could not deliver .
Thus power as a separate realm has always had a spectacular aspect , but mass allegiance to frozen religious imagery was originally a shared acknowledgment of loss , an imaginary compensation for a poverty of real social activity that was still widely felt to be a universal fact of life .
The modern spectacle , by contrast , depicts what society can deliver , but within this depiction what is permitted is rigidly distinguished from what is possible .
The spectacle preserves unconsciousness as practical changes in the conditions of existence proceed .
The spectacle is self - generated , and it makes up its own rules : it is a specious form of the sacred .
And it makes no secret of what it is , namely , hierarchical power evolving on its own , in its separateness , thanks to an increasing productivity based on an ever more refined division of labor , an ever greater comminution of machine - governed gestures , and an ever - widening market .
In the course of this development all community and critical awareness have ceased to be ; nor have those forces , which were able  by separating  to grow enormously in strength , yet found a way to reunite .
26 THE GENERALIZED SEPARATION of worker and product has spelled the end of any comprehensive view of the job done , as well as the end of direct personal communication between producers .
As the accumulation of alienated products proceeds , and as the productive process gets more concentrated , consistency and communication become the exclusive assets of the system 's managers .
The triumph of an economic system founded on separation leads to the proletarianization of the world .
27 OWING TO THE VERY success of this separated system of production , whose product is separation itself , that fundamental area of experience which was associated in earlier societies with an individual 's principal work is being transformed  at least at the leading edge of the system 's evolution  into a realm of non-work , of inactivity .
Such inactivity , however , is by no means emancipated from productive activity : it remains in thrall to that activity , in an uneasy and worshipful subjection to production 's needs and results ; indeed it is itself a product of the rationality of production .
There can be no freedom apart from activity , and within the spectacle all activity is banned  a corollary of the fact that all real activity has been forcibly channeled into the global construction of the spectacle .
So what is referred to as " liberation from work , " that is , increased leisure time , is a liberation neither within labor itself nor from the world labor has brought into being .
28 THE REIGNING ECONOMIC system is founded on isolation ; at the same time it is a circular process designed to produce isolation .
Isolation underpins technology , and technology isolates in its turn ; all goods proposed by the spectacular system , from cars to televisions , also serve as weapons for that system as it strives to reinforce the isolation of " the lonely crowd . "
The spectacle is continually rediscovering its own basic assumptions  and each time in a more concrete manner .
29 THE ORIGIN OF THE spectacle lies in the world 's loss of unity , and its massive expansion in the modern period demonstrates how total this loss has been : the abstract nature of all individual work , as of production in general , finds perfect expression in the spectacle , whose very manner of being concrete is , precisely , abstraction .
The spectacle divides the world into two parts , one of which is held up as a self - representation to the world , and is superior to the world .
The spectacle is simply the common language that bridges this division .
Spectators are linked only by a one - way relationship to the very center that maintains their isolation from one another .
The spectacle thus unites what is separate , but it unites it only in its separateness .
30 THE SPECTATOR'S ALIENATION from and submission to the contemplated object ( which is the outcome of his unthinking activity ) works like this : the more he contemplates , the less he lives ; the more readily he recognizes his own needs in the images of need proposed by the dominant system , the less he understands his own existence and his own desires .
The spectacle 's externality with respect to the acting subject is demonstrated by the fact that the individual 's own gestures are no longer his own , but rather those of someone else who represents them to him .
The spectator feels at home nowhere , for the spectacle is everywhere .
31 WORKERS DO NOT produce themselves : they produce a force independent of themselves .
The success of this production , that is , the abundance it generates , is experienced by its producers only as an abundance of dispossession .
All time , all space , becomes foreign to them as their own alienated products accumulate .
The spectacle is a map of this new world  a map drawn to the scale of the territory itself .
In this way the very powers that have been snatched from us reveal themselves to us in their full force .
32 THE SPECTACLE'S FUNCTION in society is the concrete manufacture of alienation .
Economic growth corresponds almost entirely to the growth of this particular sector of industrial production .
If something grows along with the self - movement of the economy , it can only be the alienation that has inhabited the core of the economic sphere from its inception .
33 THOUGH SEPARATED FROM his product , man is more and more , and ever more powerfully , the producer of every detail of his world .
The closer his life comes to being his own creation , the more drastically is he cut off from that life .
34 THE SPECTACLE IS capital accumulated to the point where it becomes image .

The Commodity As Spectacle
« Espérons que les députés se poseront les bonnes questions au moment de voter un texte de loi inapplicable » , écrit aujourd ' hui , Lionel Tardy , député UMP de Haute - Savoie dans un communiqué .
Il réagit à un jugement du tribunal de Guingamp , en date du 23 février , qui établit que l'adresse IP ne suffit pas pour établir la culpabilité d'un internaute .
En mars 2008 , l'auteur d'un blog consacré aux élections municipales de la commune de Penvénan constate que son site a été piraté , et affiche des propos diffamatoires .
Il décide alors de porter plainte pour « modifications à caractère diffamatoire » .
Les enquêteurs récupèrent alors l'adresse IP , puis remontent au propriétaire de l'abonnement .
Il s'agit d'un homme de 53 ans , et l'adresse identifiée correspond à la ligne de sa Livebox , installée dans sa résidence secondaire .
Mais cet abonné
Orange a toujours nié être l'auteur du piratage du blog .
Devant le tribunal , ce dernier a expliqué que , selon lui , il avait lui -même été piraté .
« Il semblerait qu'il soit assez facile de pirater une Livebox à distance » , a t- il déclaré , selon Le Télégramme .
« Allez juste faire un tour sur internet et vous verrez qu'il existe des forums où on vous explique comment pirater une Livebox .
Et ce n'est pas bien compliqué » .
Et son avocat d'ajouter :
« Vous ne pouvez pas vous contenter de la seule adresse IP pour pouvoir décider de la culpabilité de mon client » .
Résultat , après délibération , la justice a décidé de relaxer le prévenu au bénéfice du doute .
« Alors que va débuter aujourd ' hui l'examen du projet de loi Création et Internet à l'Assemblée Nationale , c'est un terrible coup dur pour l'Hadopi » , commente Tardy .
« Le principe de riposte graduée s'appuie en effet entièrement sur l'identification des adresses IP afin de repérer les internautes qui s'adonneraient au téléchargement illégal .
Déjà que les réseaux sans fil posent de sérieux problèmes , si les adresses IP ne sont pas jugées des preuves suffisantes pour établir la responsabilité d'un internaute , quelle sera la légitimité des décisions rendues par l'Hadopi ? »
Pour rappel , les difficultés d'identification d'un abonné derrière une adresse IP ont été soulevé depuis longtemps .
L'année dernière , deux professeurs et un étudiant de l’université de Washington démontraient ainsi que n’importe quel internaute peut être accusé de piratage et faire accuser n’importe qui de piratage .
Et parvenaient à faire accuser une imprimante .
Pourtant depuis , les ratés et les accusations à tort continuent .
Récemment encore on rapportait le cas pour un film .
Sur le même sujet :
_ - Téléchargement : Accusé à tort pour son adresse IP ( encore un )
_ - Téléchargement : Atari renonce à sa chasse à l’IP
_ - Téléchargement : Adresses IP accusées , levez - vous !
_ - Piratage : le chasseur chassé
_ - Le pirate était une imprimante
_ - La Sacem autorisée à traquer les pirates
_ - L’adresse IP , une affaire personnelle ?

Banning Organic Farming & Regulating Home Gardening , HR 875 & S 425 ( Mar. 13 , 2009 )
These bills need to be examined closely and scrutinized by the public .
The public must act quickly , as they are attempting to ram these bills through without debate or discussion .
The wording in too many provisions of these bills are simply too VAGUE and open the door WIDE for some government bureaucrat on the state of federal level to decide what farmers can or cannot use to grow food , and how that food will be handled -- all under the benign guise of " protecting " the public .
Where have we heard that before ?
The government has NO BUSINESS interfering or attempting to control farming methodologies , or what choices farmers make for seed or fertilizer or any other aspect of farming or distribution .
Period .
This bill was introduced in the House last year by Connecticut democrat Rosa L. DeLauro , but it was stalled in committee and went no further .
This year , her pals in Big Agriculture got her to front the bill again , but this time they got an additional 29 NWO sell - outs to join her in sponsorship ( curiously , the House sponsorship adds up to exactly 30 sell - outs , the same number of silver coins collected by Judas Iscariot when he betrayed Christ to the Romans )
Rosa is big on the government taking control of everything in your life .
She worked tirelessly to stump for illegal alien Barry Soetoro to be fraudulently elected president and then jumped right in with both feet to vote for the " stimulus " taxpayer rip - off " package " .
She now hopes to get universal health care passed this time around as well , since Rockefeller 's Chosen Son is now there to front the socialist / communist propaganda party line for him , right along with Billary .
Rosa has a long history of " helping " people .
She has worked for and with Illuminated sell - out Christopher Dodd for many years and essentially learned that to snooker the pulbic into accepting communism dressed up as government sponsored legislation , you have to repeatedly drive home the Tavistock - selling buzz words of the " need " for " protection " and " caring " and " concern " for the " disadvantaged " and the " underprivledged " who have been " disenfranchised " from the American Dream and similar stock sound - byte propaganda phrases .
She learned well from Dodd , who you may remember was very passionate on television in selling the 850 billion Wall Street Bailout " package " to the American public with his ardent " concern " that AIG or Fannie May or Freddie MAC , etc. etc. , are TOO BIG and TOO IMPORTANT to the ' credit markets ' and the " health " of the American economy to be allowed to go under , blah , blah , blah .
Having lived in Connecticut for a time , I know how much of a haven it is for special money interests like the insurance or banking industires , but also for communist ideology which thrive in Illuminated watering holes like Yale University , the home of Skull & Bones , located in Rosa 's hometown of New Haven , Connecticut .
Rosa , like her colleagues who sponsored this outrage and affront to the liberty of the American people , sorely needs to face a new challenge in her life ; a Recall .
Perhaps some interested patriots reading this missive might want to see what 's involved in getting one off the ground .

* section 103 , 206 and 207 - read in its entirety .
What it Does :
* Legally binds state agriculture departments to enforce federal guidelines effectively taking away the states power to do anything other than being food police for the federal government .
* Effectively criminalizes organic farming , but does n’t actually use the word ' organic . '
* Affects anyone growing food , even if they are not selling it but consuming it .
* Affects anyone producing meat of any kind including wild game .
* Legislation is so broad based that every aspect of growing or producing food can be made illegal .
There are no specifics , which is bizarre considering how long the legislation is .
* Section 103 is almost entirely about the administrative aspect of the legislation .
It will allow the appointing of officials from the factory farming corporations and lobbyists and classify them as experts and allow them to determine and interpret the legislation .
Who do you think they are going to side with ?
* Section 206 defines what will be considered a ' food production facility ' and what will be enforced upon all food production facilities .
The wording is so broad based that a backyard gardener could be fined and more .
* Section 207 requires that the state ’s Agriculture department act as the food police and enforce the federal requirements .
This takes away the states power and is in violation of the 10th amendment .

Bills Could Reorganize Farming and Criminalize Organic Farming

http://planetsave.com/blog/2009/03/10/bills-could-reorganizing-farming-and-criminalize-gardening-organic-farming/
In two vague bills introduced both in the House and Senate of the US Congress , a vast reorganization of America ’s agriculture system aimed at tracking and regulating foods for public safety could endanger organic farms and gardens .
The bills , S.425 and H.R.875 , attempt to modernize food safety and regulate and standardize agriculture by creating an agency called the Food Safety Administration , but in the process they could threaten organic farming .
Provisions include mandatory registration and inspection for “ any food establishment or foreign food establishment engaged in manufacturing , processing , packing , or holding food for consumption in the United States , ” and sets standard practices such as minimums for fertilizer use .
Any food that the agency deems “ unsafe , adulterated or misbranded ” can be seized and the food establishment or farm fined .
It ’s not clear how these foods will be deemed unsafe .
The bills aim to industrialize farms , standardize farming practices , require registration and inspection for any one producing food , and make practices key to organic farming illegal .
While we certainly need to improve our food safety , the problem with these bills is that they are so vague and open - ended , they could be used to justify banning organic practices such as composting and seed saving , or to put into law standard practices such as the required use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides .
The bills are speculated to have been funded by agri-business giants including Monsanto .
The threat of the new standards is that only approveed seeds , fertilizers , and farming methods could be used , and if Monsanto gets their way , all farms and gardens be growing their plants and using their products .
That is definitely a scary thought .
Organic farming is certainly already revolutionary , but it could be an illegal act if these bills are passed without reworking to protect organic farmers and backyard gardeners .
Please contact your senators and representatives today and urge them to protect public health and safety without criminalizing organic farming .
There is n’t much time to comment on this bill , so act now !

Comments
[ Note from Ken Adachi : Most of the reader comments posted at this article attempt to pour water on the alarm this woman is attempting to raise , but I find those disparaging comments largely flacid and unconvincing .
You can read the comments yourself at the originating link , but I find the author , Megan , to offer the most cogent response herself in this comment : ]

The quote in the article from one of the bills does n’t seem to exclude places where food is manufactured , i.e. grown : “ any food establishment or foreign food establishment engaged in manufacturing , processing , packing , or holding food for consumption in the United States . ”
Farmer ’s markets would definitely be affected .
There is mention of standardized practices that would be required of every registered food producer ( and that ’s everyone , from what I understand anyone producing food for public consumption would have to be registered and inspected ) , and fertilizers are mentioned there - I do n’t know about you , but I highly doubt that these required fertilzers would be organic .
Monsanto is the company that has been tied to this bill - they would definitely benefit directly because if everything having to do with food production is controlled and regulated , Monsanto ’s seeds , fertilizers , and pesticides would provide an easy solution to standardizing farm practices .
The fear that I have heard about this bill is that the regulations put in place will require all food producers to be standardized by using only “ approved ” ( Monsanto ) fertilizers and other products .
So that is why there ’s a bit of a scare about this .
The language of these bills is very difficult to read and very vague - so while it does not come right out and say “ this bill bans organic gardening ” - the danger is in how the law will be applied .
There ’s certainly a lot of room in the language to force certain practices and products on food producers since they ’ll be required to be registered and regulated by the agency the law creates .
I just see a lot of room for abuse in this bill , though you do have to read between the lines to see this .
My main concern is that with such vague language , these bills could potentially spell doom for organic food producers and sellers since they ’re using “ non-industry standard ” practices already .
While the intention is good on the surface , these bills need a lot of work before they go into law - and the window of time for debate and public comment on this bill is very narrow , so our representatives need to know that these bills are not ready to be laws until all the details are hammered out and organic farming is protected and addressed in them .
Thanks for the discussion , everyone .

Subject : Urgent : Stop Corporate Fascists From Taking Over Our Food Supply
Please note :
We told you about this issue last week and many of you responded .
But we still need your comments with the USDA by the end of the day , Monday , March 16 , to stop the incredibly destructive corporate scheme described below .
Congress is already trying to stack the deck so only lobbyists have a meaningful voice in this debate .
We can stop them if you speak out now .
Radio Chip Animal Identification Would Do ALL Harm To Our Real Food Safety , And No Good
It would be too easy to blame the recent peanut panic on one criminal corporation owner , who KNOWINGLY shipped Salmonella contaminated product .
But before that it was millions of pounds of ground beef , and before that tomatoes all over the country , and on and on .
And when you ask where is all this horrible filth coming from , with a over a million cases of Salmonella in the U.S. alone every year , the answer is self - evident .
It 's the huge factory farms that overflow with seas of untreated animal waste , that then spill into our food supply , including through our agricultural plant crop fields .
We have a lot of work to do to clean up this giant mess , but the first thing we have to do is STOP a lunatic boondoggle being pushed by these same corporate interests , to force radio computer chip implanting of literally every farm animal in the country , EXCEPT on their own factory farms .
It is absolutely nothing but a further attempt to drive small family farms out of business , who in fact are our safest source of reliably clean food now .
The proposed National Animal Identification System ( NAIS ) would force even the smallest healthy farms to buy expensive new computer tracking equipment , and potentially would subject them to gestapo - like tactics by the USDA if they are in even slight technical non-compliance .
And all this just to fatten the pockets of the RFID chip manufacturers , and to make it LOOK like something is being done to make our food safer .
The special one click action page below will send your personal message to all your members Congress and also directly to the U.S. Department of Agriculture who is trying to rush this thing through without adequate scrutiny .
Stop NAIS Action Page : http://www.peaceteam.net/action/pnum942.php
This action is especially urgent because the U.S. House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock , Dairy and Poultry is holding a hearing on NAIS implementation on March 11 , and many farm activists fear the plan is to push it out for a full vote in Congress faster than a greased pig , before we the people have a meaningful chance to speak out .
You may not have a House member on that particular subcommittee , but you can pressure your own House member to tell they colleagues on it that there is massive constituent pressure against NAIS .
For the especially mobilized on the action page above there is a link to the phone numbers for those on the subcommittee , because they are in fact your representative as an American citizen if they sit on it .
Below are some more extensive truth points you can select from in drafting your comments or on the phone , again linked to from the action page above .
NAIS was designed by NIAA ( the National Institute of Animal Agriculture ) , a corporate consortium consisting of Monsanto , industrial meat producers such as Cargill and Tyson , and surveillance companies such Viatrace , AgInfoLink , and Digital Angel .
The NAIS scheme fits agribusiness , biotech , and surveillance companies to a T :
1 ) They are already computerized , and they engineered a corporate loophole :
If an entity owns a vertically integrated , birth - to - death factory system with thousands of animals ( as the Cargills and Tysons do ) , it does not have to tag and track each one but instead a herd is given a single lot number .
2 ) . NAIS will only be burdensome and costly ( fees , tags , computer equipment , time ) to small farmers which helps push them out of business , thus leaving more market to giant agribusiness .
3 ) Agribusiness wants to reassure export customers that the US meat industry is finally cleaning up its widespread contamination .
NAIS would give that appearance ... without incurring the cost of a real cleanup .
4 ) NAIS will allow total control over the competition : Owners of even a single chicken would be required to register private information , the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) coordinates of their ' premise ' and if any animal leaves its ' premise ' , the owner will be required to obtain an ID number for it and have the animal microchipped .
All information , including 24 hour GPS surveillance would be fed into a vast corporate data bank , allowing for ease of false slaughter to hide true problems or to substitute biotech 's genetically engineered animals .
5 ) NAIS may allow plundering of farmers through required DNA samples : DNA samples would be invaluable to Monsanto and biotech corporations genetically engineering animals .
Farmers who raise heritage breeds would have no say in how their distinct DNA would be used and to the sole profit of biotech companies .
6 ) The advantage for the surveillance companies is obvious : Compulsory tagging of 6 million sheep , 7 million horses , 63 million hogs , 97 million cows , 260 million turkeys , 300 million laying hens , 9 billion chickens , and untold numbers of bison , alpaca , quail , and other animals -- and new animals being born , means a massive self - perpetuating market .
Please take action now to stop this insanity .
Our health and our lives depend on it .
Stop NAIS Action Page : http://www.peaceteam.net/action/pnum942.php
The health claims for NAIS are a sham though fear of disease is used - to advance it .
NAIS does not touch the contaminated source of E.coli , salmonella , listeria , mad cow , and common meat - borne diseases - the inherently unhealthy practices ( mass crowding , growth stimulants , feeding regimens , rushed assembly lines , poor sanitation , etc. ) of industrial - scale meat operations .
Upton Sinclair's " Jungle " all over again .
NAIS will do nothing to stop these practices .
Moreover , tracking ends at the time of slaughter , yet it 's from slaughter onward that most spoilage occurs .
But NAIS does not trace any contamination after slaughter .
The self - serving Agribusiness NAIS plan distracts from their contaminatory practices , while targeting hundreds of thousands of small farms , homesteaders , organic producers , hobbyists ... and maybe even you .
NAIS 's purpose is to advance corporate monopoly over all food in the US .
And with it , they have laid the ground work .
Kissinger said if you control food , you can control people .
This immense corporate plan to control of our food supply and eliminate our independent farmers is , at it heart , the most severe threat possible to our democracy itself .
Please take action NOW , so we can win all victories that are supposed to be ours , and forward this alert as widely as possible .

Hi Ken -
The woman in the video is from International News Net World Report .

I have watched their program many times .
It 's not a fake .
