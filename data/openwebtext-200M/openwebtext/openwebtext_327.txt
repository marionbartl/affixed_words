Interview from Elchinero Concepts :
Joe Kittinger ’s 100,000 - foot 1960 balloon jump
Joe Kittinger is not a household aviation name like Neil Armstrong or Chuck Yeager , but what he did for the U.S. space program is comparable .
On August 16 , 1960 , as research for the then - fledgling U.S. space program , Air Force Captain Joseph Kittinger rode a helium balloon to the edge of space , 102,800 feet above the earth , a feat in itself .
Then , wearing just a thin pressure suit and breathing supplemental oxygen , he leaned over the cramped confines of his gondola and jumped — into the 110 - degree - below - zero , near vacuum of space .
Within ( 22 ) seconds his body accelerated to 714 mph in the thin air , breaking the sound barrier .
1. a , ft/sec/sec = g ( 32.17 ft/sec/sec )
2. v , ft/sec = g*t + C1
3. s , ft = ( � ) * g*t^2 + C1*t + C2
4. t = 714 ft/sec/g = 22 seconds ( C1 & C1 = 0.0 )
5. s = 16.1*22*22 = 7,931 feet = 1.5 - mile free - fall
After free - falling for more than four and a half minutes , slowed finally by friction from the heavier air below , he felt his parachute open at 14,000 feet , and he coasted gently down to the New Mexico desert floor .
Relative density of air @ 100,000 ft = 0.01365
Relative density of air @ 14,000 ft = 0.650 � 50 times
Kittinger ’s feat showed scientists that astronauts could survive the harshness of space with just a pressure suit and that man could eject from aircraft at extreme altitudes and survive .
Upon Kittinger ’s return to base , a congratulatory telegram was waiting from the Mercury Seven astronauts — including Alan Shepard and John Glenn .
More than four decades later Kittinger ’s two world records — the highest parachute jump , and the only man to break the sound barrier without a craft and live — still stand .
We decided to visit the retired colonel and Aviation Hall of Famer , now 75 , at his home in Altamonte Springs , Florida , to recall his historic jump .
Take us back to New Mexico and August 16 , 1960 .
Joe Kittinger :
We got up at 2 a.m. to start filling the helium balloon .
At sea level , it was 35 to 40 feet wide and 200 feet high ; at altitude , due to the low air pressure , it expanded to twenty - five stories in width , and still was twenty stories high !
At 4 a.m. , I began breathing pure oxygen for two hours .
That ’s how long it takes to remove all the nitrogen from your blood so you do n’t get the bends going so high so fast .
Then it was a lengthy dress procedure layering warm clothing under my pressure suit .
They kept me in air - conditioning until it was time to launch because we were in the desert and I was n’t supposed to sweat .
If I did , my clothes would freeze on the way up .
How was your ascent ?
It took an hour and a half to get to altitude .
It was cold .
At 40,000 feet , the glove on my right hand had n’t inflated .
I knew that if I radioed my doctor , he would abort the flight .
If that happened , I knew I might never get another chance because there were lots of people who did n’t want this test to happen .
I took a calculated risk that I might lose use of my right hand .
It quickly swelled up , and I did lose use for the duration of the flight .
But the rest of the pressure suit worked .
When I reached 102,800 feet , maximum altitude , I was n’t quite over the target .
So I drifted for eleven minutes .
The winds were out of the east .
What ’s it look like from so high up ?
You can see about 400 miles in every direction .
The most fascinating thing is that it ’s just black overhead - the transition from normal blue to black is very stark .
You ca n’t see stars because there ’s a lot of glare from the sun , so your pupils are too small .
I was struck with the beauty of it .
But I was also struck by how hostile it is : more than 100 degrees below zero , no air .
If my protection suit failed , I would be dead in a few seconds .
Blood actually boils above 62,000 feet .
I went through my 46 - step checklist , disconnected from the balloon ’s power supply , and lost all communication with the ground .
I was totally under power from the kit on my back .
When everything was done , I stood up , turned around to the door , took one final look out and said a silent prayer : “ Lord , take care of me now . ”
Then I just jumped over the side .
What were you thinking as you took that step ?
It ’s the beginning of a test .
I had gone through simulations many times - more than a 100 .
I rolled over and looked up , and there was the balloon just roaring into space .
I realized that the balloon was n’t roaring into space ; I was going down at a fantastic rate !
At about 90,000 feet , I reached 714 mph .
The altimeter on my wrist was unwinding very rapidly .
But there was no sense of speed .
Where you determine speed is visual — if you see something go flashing by .
But nothing flashes by 20 miles up — there are no signposts there , and you are way above any clouds .
When the chute opened , the rest of the jump was anticlimactic because everything had worked perfectly .
I landed 12 or 13 minutes later , and there was my crew waiting .
We were elated .
How about your right hand ?
It hurt — there was quite a bit of swelling and the blood pressure in my arm was high .
But that went away in a few days , and I regained full use of my hand .
What about attempts to break your record ?
We did it for aircrews and astronauts –for the learning , not to set a record .
They will be going up as skydivers .
Somebody will beat it someday .
Records are made to be busted .
And I ’ll be elated .
But I ’ll also be concerned that they ’re properly trained .
If they ’re not , they ’re taking a hell of a risk .

According to sex experts the best sex lasts for between seven and thirteen minutes and even a three minute quickie can be satisfying .
A major survey by Canadian and American sex therapists has concluded that the ideal length of time to have penetrative sex is under fifteen minutes .
The research was prompted by the confusion in the public domain about how long intercourse should last , an issue which sometimes causes distress to both men and women even though it is often for quite different reasons .
In order to quantify the problem the expert sex therapists came up with what was " adequate , " " desirable , " " too short , " and " too long " intercourse .
The research revealed that the average sex therapist believes an " adequate " length for intercourse was from 3 to 7 minutes ; " desirable " from 7 to 13 minutes ; " too short " from 1 to 2 minutes and " too long " from 10 to 30 minutes .
The study is the first to review what the experts believe is the ideal length of time to have intercourse .
Lead researcher Dr. Eric Corty , from the Behrend College in Erie , Pennsylvania , says research has shown that the expectation by many people is that sex should last much longer and this expectation he says leads to disappointment and dissatisfaction .
Dr. Corty says the research should help eliminate unrealistic beliefs that healthy sex should last a long time .
Dr. Corty says the fantasy model of male sexuality harboured by both men and women , has men with large penises , rock - hard erections , who can sustain sexual activity all night long .
He says the study provides a realistic model of sexuality , which is useful both in treating people with sexual concerns and dysfunctions , and on a broader level will help prevent the onset of sexual dysfunctions .
Australian experts say there is a dearth of data on Australians ' expectation of sex but anecdotal evidence suggests most Australian women would be happy with the therapists ' " adequate " time of three to seven minutes , while men would not .
The study concludes that intercourse which lasts from 3 to 13 minutes is normal and says the dissemination of this information to the public may change what are often unrealistic expectations which cause distress .
Last week a pair of rulings further muddied the waters around the RIAA 's argument that making a file available over a P2P network constitutes distribution as defined by the Copyright Act .
This week , the hot issue is the role that MediaSentry plays in the RIAA 's legal campaign and whether the company should be licensed as a private investigator .
A pair of defendants in separate cases are arguing that the company does need a license and that all evidence gathered by it should be excluded .
The RIAA , in turn , is arguing that no license is necessary — and that even if MediaSentry 's evidence was obtained illegally , it should still be admissible .
Defendants : MediaSentry needs a license and the evidence it collected is worthless
A college student at Northern Michigan University representing him or herself recently submitted a motion seeking to quash a subpoena directed at the school , arguing that the data collected by MediaSentry was " obtained through felonious conduct . "
The motion refers to a ruling made last month by the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Growth that MediaSentry needs to be licensed in order to " perform regulated activities . "
Regulators at the department have reportedly sent the company a letter informing them of the decision , although MediaSentry refused to confirm receipt to Ars .
The company has also received a cease - and - desist order from the Massachusetts State Police saying that its investigative activities violate state law .
Doe number 5 in LaFace Records v. Does 1 - 5 believes that 's enough to exclude MediaSentry 's data .
" [ E] quity demands that Plaintiffs not be permitted to benefit in any way from the felonious conduct of their agent , " argues the student .
" It shocks the conscience to think any subpoena would be sustained when based solely on such outrageous conduct . "
A newly - reported contested case in Florida raises many of the same issues .
In Atlantic v. Boyer , Eva Boyer has filed her answer , affirmative defenses , and counterclaims in response to a lawsuit filed against her by the RIAA earlier this year .
Boyer accuses the RIAA of " abusing " the federal judiciary and hiring " unlicensed private investigators " who " receive a bounty to invade private computers and ... networks . "
Under Florida law , private investigators are required to obtain a license .
Boyer points out to the court that MediaSentry lacks such a license , saying that the labels have " conspired among themselves and others " to illegally investigate Florida residents .
RIAA : no license necessary
A copy of the cease - and - desist
order sent to MediaSentry
For its part , the RIAA has consistently argued that MediaSentry does n't need PI licenses , telling Ars that the information the company collects is available for " anyone to see . "
A new filing by the RIAA in Lava v. Amurao seeks to thwart the defendant 's motion to exclude the evidence collected by MediaSentry .
The labels argue that MediaSentry is a " copyright investigator , " not a private investigator , and therefore the New York law requiring PIs to be licensed does n't apply .
The RIAA appears to overstep by arguing that licensing is also impractical because MediaSentry " can have no way of knowing ... the location from where [ the files ] are being distributed . "
Yes , an IP address is obviously insufficient to pinpoint the name or address of someone who might be using that address .
But a simple nslookup can often be enough to determine that a KaZaA user is a Comcast subscriber in the Los Angeles metropolitan area or is using the Harvard University network .
In short , MediaSentry should be able to quickly figure out roughly where a user is located .
The RIAA also argues that the cost of obtaining licenses in all 50 states would be " prohibitive . "
The labels cite the $ 10,000 bond required in New York and say that multiplying that by 50 states would " seriously interfere with a copyright owner 's legitimate right to investigate and protect its copyrights from infringement . "
This , coming from an organization that has shown zero hesitation to spend millions of dollars pursuing well over 20,000 individual copyright infringement lawsuits , seems implausible .
Even if it turns out that the evidence was obtained illegally , the RIAA argues , the evidence collected by MediaSentry should still be admissible .
" Ultimately , the law is clear that even illegally obtained evidence , which Defendant cannot show here , is still admissible in a civil case , " reads the RIAA 's filing .
" Contrary to Defendant 's contentions , there is simply no policy justification whatsoever that would support the exclusion of relevant evidence of copyright infringement . "
Copyright attorney Ray Beckerman reports on Recording Industry vs The People that the motions in Lava v. Amurao will be argued this Friday in White Plains , NY , so it 's possible that the judge will issue a ruling on the PI licensing issue in the weeks or months ahead .
The RIAA is seeking to dismiss the case against Rolando Amurao after determining that his adult daughter is the alleged copyright infringer .
As was the case with the making available rulings , we could see different judges coming down on different sides of the issue .
There 's a lot at stake here , especially if it turns out that some of MediaSentry 's evidence was collected illegally .
The uncertainty around MediaSentry 's status may be behind the company 's recent decision to remove all references to its " investigative services " from its website .
Further reading
George Bush has signed into law S. 2488 , a bill that strengthens the Freedom of Information Act .
There are a lot of signs that Bush did not much like this Open Government Act , so it 's significant that he did n't veto it .
What are the signs of Bush 's displeasure ?
For one thing , the WH published a description of the new law that is terse and , rather glaringly , excludes most of its more important provisions .
You 'll find these spelled out in some detail in the CRS summary of the bill .
As a point of comparison , let 's look at which elements the Associated Press chose to include in its summary of the legislation .
According to AP , the new law :
requires the release of requested documents unless their disclosure would do actual harm
brings government contractors under FOIA
compels the government to respond to FOIA requests within 20 days of their receipt
creates a system by which citizens may track the progress of their requests
establishes a hot - line service for all federal agencies to cope with problems
establishes an ombudsman to help resolve disputes about non-disclosure
By contrast , the published WH summary mentions only that the law " amends ( FOIA ) by ... " :
(1 ) establishing a definition of " a representative of the news media ; " ( 2 ) directing that required attorney fees be paid from an agency 's own appropriation rather than from the Judgment Fund ; ( 3 ) prohibiting an agency from assessing certain fees if it fails to comply with FOIA deadlines ; and ( 4 ) establishing an Office of Government Information Services in the National Archives and Records Administration to review agency compliance with FOIA .
You 'll note that there 's barely any overlap between the elements that the AP and the White House highlight .
Furthermore the four elements listed by the WH say virtually nothing about the need or the mechanisms for greater openness – the very goal of the legislation .
The " Open Government Act " will " help to reverse the troubling trends of excessive delays and lax FOIA compliance in our government and help to restore the public 's trust in their government , " said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy
As the AP describes it :
The new law ... amounts to a congressional pushback against the Bush administration 's movement to greater secrecy since the terrorist attacks of 2001 .
Bush signed the bill without comment in one of his final decisions of the year ...
The legislation is aimed at reversing an order by former Attorney General John Ashcroft after the 9/11 attacks in which he instructed agencies to lean against releasing information when there was uncertainty about how doing so would affect national security .
Even if the Open Government
Act is not a cure for all of FOIA 's ills , it is a highly symbolic piece of legislation .
And it's hard to ignore the symbolism of the manner in which Bush signed it into law – on New Year 's Eve , without comment .
It was almost as if Bush wanted to avoid drawing attention to a victory for government transparency .
You see the ads everywhere .
" Buy Now , 90 days , Same As Cash " or " No Interest for a Year " or some other eye - catching but truly ludicrous statement designed to draw in the unwary consumer .
Like a fly into the spider ’s web , these kinds of advertisements bring in buyers with the lure of getting something and not having to pay on it for a long , long time .
Businesses use this type of ad to get the swing buyer ( the ones that are looking at high - ticket items , but are not buying because of the ’ sticker shock ’ ) to come in and buy .
The only problem with this scenario is that it ’s not really Same As Cash .
What ’s actually happening is that you ’re buying something on deferred interest .
What that means is when you go in and get that washer / dryer on 12 months no interest , you ’re actually accruing interest from day one .
The trick is that if you pay off the whole amount within the year , they deduct all that interest back off .
Businesses like this for a couple of reasons ;
They make the sale – No matter if they get interest or not , they ’ve made a sale that they probably would n’t have made otherwise because the item is relatively expensive .
They HOPE you default on the loan – A year is a long time , and a lot can happen .
Remember ,
You ’re accruing interest from day one , it ’s just not applied if you pay everything off .
If you DON’T , you get whammied with an extra few hundred / thousand dollars in interest fees .
Remember the story of the Thief and the Pig
A Thief was apprehended for stealing a pig and was brought before the king for sentencing .
The King Says " I sentence you to death , for pig theft ! "
But the Thief says " O wise king , if you give me a year , I will make this pig sing .
That would surely make up for my crime .
No one in the kingdom has a singing pig . "
The King thought for awhile and then said , " Very well , you have one year to teach this pig to sing . " and released the Thief .
The Thief takes the pig and whistling , leaves the castle where he meets his friend .
The friend says , " Why are you so happy ?!??
You know that pigs do n’t sing , and that means that you ’re going to be executed ! "
But the Thief replied , " A year is a long time , and the King is old .
In that year , the King may die , or I might die , ..
Or , you never know , the pig might sing . "
There ’s a lot that can happen in the intervening time between when you BUY the item and the time you PAY OFF the item .
They ’re hoping that something will cause you to mess up at the end and then they get a lot more money from the accrued interest that ’s been lurking in the background , just waiting to pounce .
Does n’t SEEM Like
It ’s the Same
Same as cash ?
I do n’t seem to remember an instance where I continued to pay on something after I paid cash for it .
Nor do I remember anyone tacking on interest for something I paid cash for .
I think it ’s fair to say it ’s VERY DIFFERENT than cash .
It ’s not a bad offer to get to pay over time w/o having to pay interest , but you just have to have enough self - control to follow through and make sure it gets paid off .
Otherwise you fall into the spider ’s ( interest ) trap !

A GROUP of cannibals have been locked up after they ate a friend who offered to cook them dinner .
Alexander Stepaniuk , 41 , had invited four pals to his house for a meal .
But the teacher ended up on the menu after the two men and two women beat him to death with a hammer .
The cannibals , who had been drinking vodka , cut Mr Stepaniuk 's body up before barbecuing the parts .
They were arrested after worried neighbours in Chernovtsi , Ukraine , called police .
Alexander Woytseshko , 34 , Dmitri Chuba , 45 , Lilia Kisilitsa , 23 , and Svetlana Lupan , 26 , admitted murder .
The monsters told cops : " We had nothing against him personally - we just wanted to see what human meat tasted like . "
They were sentenced to between three years and life in prison .
The online social networking site Facebook says it has fixed a security loophole discovered by a Vancouver computer technician that allowed people to look at the private photos of users .
The news follows Facebook Inc.'s announcement last week that it was implementing tougher measures to allow members to restrict access to their personal profiles .
But Byron Ng , a Vancouver computer technician looking for flaws , was able to use computer coding to pull up private pictures of Facebook members and their friends .
The private photos included those of Paris Hilton at the Emmy awards and of her brother Nicholas drinking a beer with friends .
A reporter from the Associated Press was also able to use Ng 's template to access the personal and private photos of random Facebook users , including a personal photo album of Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg posted in November 2005 .
After being alerted Monday afternoon , a Facebook spokeswoman said the company would look into the problem .
By late Monday , Facebook appeared to have closed the security hole .
Around 67 million people are members of the site .
Two men face attempted murder in motel manager stomping
Two Sacramento men brutally beat a 65 - year - old San Bruno motel manager who had asked them to quiet down last weekend and now face attempted murder and aggravated mayhem charges , prosecutors said .
Vutoro Mualevu , 28 , and Isei Tikoisuva , 21 , are being held without bail in San Mateo County jail after being arraigned Tuesday .
The two were part of a rowdy , drunken party at the Regency Inn on Saturday when other guests complained about the noise , authorities said .
When the night manager , who prosecutors described as a " balding , grandfatherly looking man , " asked the partygoers to quiet down , he was brutally attacked , authorities said .
Either Mualevu or Tikoisuva smashed a beer bottle in the manager 's face and then the two men proceeded to stomp him as he lay on the ground , prosecutors said .
The manager , whose name was not released , is in critical condition and on a ventilator with numerous bone fractures , possible skull fractures and other injuries .
Authorities feared he might die from his injuries , prosecutors said .
" They basically crushed his face , " Chief Deputy District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said .
" If he does survive , he 's going to need multiple surgeries . "

Last nights debate between the Democrats was by all accounts vicious , and fun to watch .
Hillary Clinton continued to distort Obama 's record , despite being countered with the facts , and John Edwards shone with some serious policy proposals and rejection of the two way bickering between his opponents .
It was incredible to watch Clinton mis-characterise Obama 's statements , then see Obama correct her with his actual statements , then have Clinton continue to insist he meant something else .
It goes to show that it does n't seem to matter what you are saying , as long as you say it enough .

All the candidates used the fact that it was Dr Martin Luther King Day to appeal to Black voters , priming themselves for the South Carolina primary next week ( where over 50 % of the voters are African American ) .
It was Obama that scored the heaviest blows though , ridiculing Clinton for her hypocrisy , and attacking Bill Clinton for his continued distortion of his record .
" I can't tell which Clinton I 'm running against , " Obama quipped , much to the delight of the audience .
It was great political theatre with a decent amount of substantive discussion as well .

Brace yourselves , and definitely make sure no kids are around .
In case you have n't already heard , Lindsay Lohan has done something very dangerous and immoral .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
Mike Galanos from CNN explains : " Lindsay Lohan is baring all , I mean holding nothing back from New York magazine . . . .
Here are the pictures -- might want to get the kids out of the room .
She 's supposed to be in a 12 - step program -- exactly which step is posing naked for a magazine ? . . .
And let 's talk about the kids -- there 's no cellophane or anything around this .
They all could be gathering around the playground getting an eyeful . . .
She used to do Disney movies .
I mean you 're not going to get parental approvement [ sic ] on this . . .
I guess Hollywood 's morals are probably a little different from the rest of us . "
Yep , Lindsay Lohan -- aka LiLo -- has posed " nekkid " ( as many bloggers have put it ) for a 15 - page spread ( pardon the pun ) that recreates Marilyn Monroe 's " Last Sitting " of 1962 by photographer Bert Stern .
Monroe , of course , died shortly after that from an overdose of barbiturates .
So why do we need to protect the children ?
I wondered if LiLo shoots lasers , fembot - style ( from the magazine or computer screen ) at any man , woman or child who so much as looks at the photos .
Or if she reinvents Medusa and turns anyone who looks at her into stone .
But apparently that 's not it .
Apparently the problem can be summed up in one word .
Nipples .
LiLo is actually completely covered by a scarf for most of the shots .
It 's clear she 's nude -- but the kind like we 're all naked under our clothes , if you know what I mean .
But in some shots , bloggers and CNN have used ribbons , black squares and air brushing to cover certain anatomical parts when they are visible , and have even put warnings on their sites .
Nipples , it seems , are a moral issue .
Site for sore eyes
Of course , overwhelmingly , this shoot has been greeted with excitement .
There were so many visitors that the New York Magazine site crashed .
The mag made a fortune .
According to Forbes the site usually gets around a million page views a day , but got 40 million on Monday and Tuesday , and likely made at least half a million dollars from ad views in that time alone .
Because they used the Monroe angle , Gawker pointed out that NY Magazine got to exploit pop culture for massive clicks while still maintaining its " smart " cred .
And Defamer , for one , views it as a good career move for LiLo too .
" As far as career rejuvenation stunts are concerned , we are predicting that this tastefully titillating homage to Marilyn Monroe 's ' Last Sitting ' is poised to sit alongside Drew Barrymore 's role in Poison Ivy in the pantheon of greatest breast - baring comebacks of all - time . "
They do have their uses
But there have been many criticisms .
And to be fair , not all have been on " moral " grounds .
The Box Office Psychics blog titles its post : " What do you get when you cross an AIDS - hooker with a Dalmatian ? " ( her scarf has polka - dots on it ) .
And another blog , I Don't Like You In That Way , says the shoot is an effort by Stern and Lohan to " piss on Marilyn 's grave . "
But both of these are issues of taste -- these critics do n't like the style of the shoot .
So why the moral criticism ?
That implies that nipples , or the viewing of them , cause harm of some sort .
Last time I checked , breastfeeding was considered a good thing , and as I understand it , breast milk comes from breasts and nipples .
Last time I checked , most women have nipples ; it 's not an optional , frivolous upgrade .
Last time I checked , breasts do n't tend to injure people ( though with growing environmental pollution , breast milk is n't as toxin - free and therefore harmless as it once was -- but I do n't get the sense that 's the problem ) .
Dangerously sexy ?
One signal to contemplate is that most people are n't even referring to them as nipples but " nips " or " nip nips . "
Just like in last year 's war of words over Grey 's Anatomy use of the word " vajayjay " instead of " vagina " to avoid censorship of the show , some people view the word nipples as one that needs to be avoided .
And people tend to censor and infantilize concepts that are powerful or threatening .
Amy Walker , publisher of Momentum Magazine , who works across the hall from me , theorizes that the problem is that nakedness can arouse people , and those who are uncomfortable with their sexuality do n't like to be aroused .
So they tend to blame the stimulus or object of arousal -- in this case , LiLo and her breasts .
And that 's possibly why CNN's Galanos despairs that the magazine is n't wrapped in cellophane .
Wrap on the nipples
So let 's weigh the moral concerns here : cellophane versus naked breasts .
We only have to look to the recent campaign to ban plastic bags to see how much those harm the planet and its inhabitants .
But it 's yet to be established , other than making some people uncomfortable , how nipples cause harm .
In fact , it 's the lack of respect and appreciation for things that sustain life -- the planet and its animals ' mammary glands to name two -- that is life - threatening and harm - inducing .
For that reason , I 'm going to suggest we save the moral outrage for the cellophane that covers up shots of naked nipples .
And suggest that we embrace nipples ( with permission ) and things that promote life , and direct our efforts instead at the greed , laziness , inefficiency and corruption that cause its destruction .

Seymour Hersh says the US government has videotapes of boys being sodomized at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .
" The worst is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking , " the reporter told an ACLU convention last week .
Hersh says there was " a massive amount of criminal wrongdoing that was covered up at the highest command out there , and higher . "
This is a summary of Hersh speaking at the ACLU 2004 America At A Crossroads conference according to EdCone.com ( via Oliver Willis ) .
I verified by watching the video myself ( it starts at 1:07 , the " worse stuff " part starts at 1:30 ) .
There 's more bad stuff in here , read Ed Cone 's summary .
I 'll try transcribing some of the more important bits .
[ my transcription from 1:31 - 1:32 ]
Some of the worse that happened that you do n't know about , ok .
Videos , there are women there .
Some of you may have read they were passing letters , communications out to their men .
This is at Abu Ghraib which is 30 miles from Baghdad [...]
The women were passing messages saying " Please come and kill me , because of what 's happened " .
Basically what happened is that those women who were arrested with young boys / children in cases that have been recorded .
The boys were sodomized with the cameras rolling .
The worst about all of them is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking that your government has .
They are in total terror it 's going to come out .
It 's impossible to say to yourself how do we get there ?
who are we ?
Who are these people that sent us there ?

In the spirit of Little Brother I ’ll post about a password stealing idea I ’ve worried about for a while now : using email addresses as login names .
It ’s now a very widespread practice among webapps and the reason is they ’re a convenient way to eliminate having to come up with and remember a unique identifier and in the process they make you give your email address away , which is a boon for marketing and for easily authenticating you .
In itself there ’s of course nothing insecure about the practice but the problem is that they make registrations so simple and straightforward that suddenly they ’re everywhere and you do n’t think twice about them .
And the true problem is that a lot of people use one password everywhere and the chances are high many will choose the same password for the webapp du jour as for their lifelong email account .
So imagine an unscrupulous webapp maker who creates a popular webapp requiring registration and does n’t hide from himself user passwords ( there ’s absolutely nothing but his own conscience preventing him ) .
It is now a simple matter of running a script to test each email address password pair for him to coolly break a good bunch of email accounts .
Sources : Top Bush Advisors Approved ' Enhanced Interrogation '
Detailed Discussions Were Held About Techniques to Use on al Qaeda Suspects
In dozens of top - secret talks and meetings in the White House , the most senior Bush administration officials discussed and approved specific details of how high - value al Qaeda suspects would be interrogated by the Central Intelligence Agency , sources tell ABC News .
The so - called Principals who participated in the meetings also approved the use of " combined " interrogation techniques -- using different techniques during interrogations , instead of using one method at a time -- on terrorist suspects who proved difficult to break , sources said .
Highly placed sources said a handful of top advisers signed off on how the CIA would interrogate top al Qaeda suspects -- whether they would be slapped , pushed , deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning , called waterboarding .
The high - level discussions about these " enhanced interrogation techniques " were so detailed , these sources said , some of the interrogation sessions were almost choreographed -- down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic .
The advisers were members of the National Security Council 's Principals Committee , a select group of senior officials who met frequently to advise President Bush on issues of national security policy .
At the time , the Principals Committee included Vice President Cheney , former National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell , as well as CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General John Ashcroft .
As the national security adviser , Rice chaired the meetings , which took place in the White House Situation Room and were typically attended by most of the principals or their deputies .
Contacted by ABC News today , spokesmen for Tenet , Rumsfeld and Powell declined to comment about the interrogation program or their private discussions in Principals Meetings .
Powell said through an assistant there were " hundreds of [ Principals ] meetings " on a wide variety of topics and that he was " not at liberty to discuss private meetings . "
The White House also declined comment on behalf of Rice and Cheney .
Ashcroft could not be reached for comment today .
Critics at home and abroad have harshly criticized the interrogation program , which pushed the limits of international law and , they say , condoned torture .
Bush and his top aides have consistently defended the program .
They say it is legal and did not constitute torture .
" I can say that questioning the detainees in this program has given us the information that has saved innocent lives by helping us stop new attacks here in the United States and across the world , " Bush said in a speech in September 2006 .
In interview with ABC's Charles Gibson last year , Tenet said : " It was authorized .
It was legal , according to the Attorney General of the United States . "
But this is the first time sources have disclosed that a handful of the most senior advisers in the White House explicitly approved the details of the program .
According to multiple sources , it was members of the Principals Committee that not only discussed specific plans and specific interrogation methods , but approved them .
The discussions and meetings occurred in an atmosphere of great concern that another terror attack on the nation was imminent .
Sources said the extraordinary involvement of the senior advisers in the grim details of exactly how individual interrogations would be conducted showed how seriously officials took the al Qaeda threat .
It started after the CIA captured top al Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah in spring 2002 in Faisalabad , Pakistan .
When his safe house was raided by Pakistani security forces along with FBI and CIA agents , Zubaydah was shot three times during the gun battle .
At a time when virtually all counterterrorist professionals viewed another attack as imminent -- and with information on al Qaeda scarce -- the detention of Zubaydah was seen as a potentially critical breakthrough .
Zubaydah was taken to the local hospital , where CIA agent John Kiriakou , who helped coordinate Zubaydah 's capture , was ordered to remain at the wounded captive 's side at all times .
" I ripped up a sheet and tied him to the bed , " Kiriakou said .
But after Zubaydah recovered from his wounds at a secret CIA prison in Thailand , he was uncooperative .
" I told him I had heard he was being a jerk , " Kiriakou recalled .
" I said , ' These guys can make it easy on you or they can make it hard . '
It was after that he became defiant . "
The CIA wanted to use more aggressive -- and physical -- methods to get information .
The agency briefed high - level officials in the National Security Council 's Principals Committee , led by then - National Security Advisor Rice and including then - Attorney General Ashcroft , which then signed off on the plan , sources said .
It is unclear whether anyone on the committee objected to the CIA 's plans for Zubaydah .
The CIA has confirmed Zubaydah was one of three al Qaeda suspects subjected to waterboarding .
After he was waterboarded , officials say Zubaydah gave up valuable information that led to the capture of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammad and fellow 9/11 plotter Ramzi bin al - Shibh .
Mohammad was also subjected to waterboarding by the CIA .
At a hearing before a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay on March 10 , 2007 , KSM , as he is known , said he broke under the harsh interrogation .
COURT : Were any statements you made as the result of any of the treatment that you received during that time frame from 2003 to 2006 ?
Did you make those statements because of the treatment you receive from these people ?
KSM : Statement for whom ?
COURT : To any of these interrogators .
KSM : CIA peoples .
Yes .
At the beginning , when they transferred me ...
Lawyers in the Justice Department had written a classified memo , which was extensively reviewed , that gave formal legal authority to government interrogators to use the " enhanced " questioning tactics on suspected terrorist prisoners .
The August 2002 memo , signed by then head of the Office of Legal Counsel Jay Bybee , was referred to as the so - called " Golden Shield " for CIA agents , who worried they would be held liable if the harsh interrogations became public .
Old hands in the intelligence community remembered vividly how past covert operations , from the Vietnam War-era " Phoenix Program " of assassinations of Viet Cong to the Iran - Contra arms sales of the 1980s were painted as the work of a " rogue agency " out of control .
But even after the " Golden Shield " was in place , briefings and meetings in the White House to discuss individual interrogations continued , sources said .
Tenet , seeking to protect his agents , regularly sought confirmation from the NSC principals that specific interrogation plans were legal .
According to a former CIA official involved in the process , CIA headquarters would receive cables from operatives in the field asking for authorization for specific techniques .
Agents , worried about overstepping their boundaries , would await guidance in particularly complicated cases dealing with high - value detainees , two CIA sources said .
Highly placed sources said CIA directors Tenet and later Porter Goss along with agency lawyers briefed senior advisers , including Cheney , Rice , Rumsfeld and Powell , about detainees in CIA custody overseas .
" It kept coming up .
CIA wanted us to sign off on each one every time , " said one high - ranking official who asked not to be identified .
" They 'd say , ' We 've got so and so .
This is the plan . ' "
Sources said that at each discussion , all the Principals present approved .
" These discussions were n't adding value , " a source said .
" Once you make a policy decision to go beyond what you used to do and conclude it 's legal , ( you should ) just tell them to implement it . "
Then - Attorney General Ashcroft was troubled by the discussions .
He agreed with the general policy decision to allow aggressive tactics and had repeatedly advised that they were legal .
But he argued that senior White House advisers should not be involved in the grim details of interrogations , sources said .
According to a top official , Ashcroft asked aloud after one meeting : " Why are we talking about this in the White House ?
History will not judge this kindly . "
The Principals also approved interrogations that combined different methods , pushing the limits of international law and even the Justice Department 's own legal approval in the 2002 memo , sources told ABC News .
At one meeting in the summer of 2003 -- attended by Vice President Cheney , among others --
Tenet made an elaborate presentation for approval to combine several different techniques during interrogations , instead of using one method at a time , according to a highly placed administration source .
A year later , amidst the outcry over unrelated abuses of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib , the controversial 2002 legal memo , which gave formal legal authorization for the CIA interrogation program of the top al Qaeda suspects , leaked to the press .
A new senior official in the Justice Department , Jack Goldsmith , withdrew the legal memo -- the Golden Shield -- that authorized the program .
But the CIA had captured a new al Qaeda suspect in Asia .
Sources said CIA officials that summer returned to the Principals Committee for approval to continue using certain " enhanced interrogation techniques . "
Then - National Security Advisor Rice , sources said , was decisive .
Despite growing policy concerns -- shared by Powell -- that the program was harming the image of the United States abroad , sources say she did not back down , telling the CIA : " This is your baby .
Go do it . "
LA POINTE , Wis. 
From a distance , the large red aluminum contraption parked on the frozen shore of Lake Superior here looks like a small houseboat perched on skis .
Up closer , as schoolchildren pile in with their backpacks and iPods , it becomes clear that the mystery vehicle , with two large fans on the back , is something else entirely .
For residents of this remote village on an ice - locked island off the tip of mainland Wisconsin , the gliding boatmobile , known here as a windsled , is a kind of school bus .
That ’s right : in one of the more unorthodox modes of student travel anywhere in the country , the children of La Pointe , on Madeline Island ( full - time population 250 , triple that in the summer ) , actually windsled to class several weeks out of every year .
It is the transportation a school district needs when students are separated from class by more than two miles of jigsaw ice blocks coming together to form something that approximates a floating road of shallow depth across a bay .
Everyone here knows the windsled as a homegrown solution to a tricky set of circumstances : Sometimes Lake Superior  the largest , coldest and deepest of the Great Lakes  is too chunky with ice for a ferry but not quite solid enough to make an ice bridge between La Pointe and the mainland town of Bayfield , the location of the upper school .
On March 17 , New York Senator and Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton gave a speech at George Washington University outlining her plans to de-escalate U.S. military involvement in Iraq .
Though she called for the gradual withdrawal of U.S. combat brigades over the next several years , she continued to refuse to apologize for her 2002 vote authorizing the invasion , to acknowledge the illegality of the war , or to fully explain her false claims made at that time regarding Iraq ’s military capabilities and alleged ties to al - Qaeda .
Nor was she able to offer an explanation as to what led to her dramatic shift from a supporter of the ongoing war and occupation as recently as a year and a half ago to her current more critical perspective .
Below are excerpts from her speech , followed by annotated comments :
" It has been five years this week since our president took us to war in Iraq . "
President George W. Bush was not solely responsible for taking the United States to war .
He had accomplices , such as Hillary Clinton .
Bush was only able launch the invasion as a result of being provided with the authorization to do so by a Congressional resolution .
Clinton was among a minority of congressional Democrats who  combined with a Republican majority  provided sufficient votes to give the go - ahead for this illegal and disastrous war .
" Bringing lasting stability to the region will take a president with the strength and determination , the knowledge and confidence …to rebuild our military readiness , to care for our veterans , and to redouble our efforts against al - Qaeda .
If you give me the chance , I will be that president . "
As predicted prior to the invasion , the over - extension of the U.S. armed forces , the enormous costs , and the high casualty rates resulting from the war has greatly harmed U.S. military readiness , the ability to care for veterans , and the struggle against al - Qaeda .
It ’s hard to imagine how someone who supported the invasion can be trusted to be the kind of president who will be able to address those needs .
" Nearly 4,000 of [ our troops ] have , by now , made that ultimate sacrifice .
Tens of thousands more have suffered wounds both visible and invisible to their bodies , their minds , and their hearts .
Their families have sacrificed , too , in empty places at the dinner table , in the struggle to raise children alone , in the wrenching reversal of parents burying children …
Our armed forces are stretched to near the breaking point with many of our troops on their second , third , or fourth tours of duty .
…
Taking into consideration the long - term costs of replacing equipment and providing medical care for troops and survivors ’ benefits for their families , the war in Iraq could ultimately cost well over $ 1 trillion . "
In scholarly journals , in newspaper columns , in congressional testimony , on this web site , and elsewhere , there were ample warnings of just such disastrous consequences resulting from a U.S. invasion of Iraq .
Regardless , Clinton apparently believed at the time that seizing control of that oil - rich country was worth the sacrifice .
Only since public opinion polls indicated that she had no hope of winning the Democratic presidential nomination if she continued to support the war , did she start talking about the war ’s negative consequences .
" I have met with our soldiers and military leaders [ in Iraq ] .
I have met with Iraqi local , regional , and national elected and other influential officials . "
During her one trip to Iraq , in February 2005 , she insisted that the U.S. occupation was " functioning quite well , " although the security situation had deteriorated so badly that the four - lane divided highway on flat open terrain connecting the airport with the capital could not be secured at the time of her arrival , requiring a helicopter to transport her to the Green Zone .
Though 55 Iraqis and one American soldier were killed during her brief visit , she insisted  in a manner remarkably similar to statements by Vice President Dick Cheney  that the rise in suicide bombings was evidence that the insurgency was failing .
" The American people do n’t have to guess whether I ’m ready to lead or whether I understand the realities on the ground in Iraq or whether I ’d be too dependent on advisers to help me determine the right way forward .
I ’ve been working day - in and day - out in the Senate to provide leadership to end this war . "
In reality , until very recently , Clinton was one of the leading senators supporting the war .
Even after the U.S. forces invaded and occupied Iraq and confirmed that  contrary to Clinton ’s initial justification for the U.S. conquest 
Iraq did not have " weapons of mass destruction , " active WMD programs , offensive delivery systems , or ties to al - Qaeda as she and other supporters of the war had claimed , she defended her vote to authorize the invasion anyway .
When Representative John Murtha ( D - PA ) made his first call for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq in November 2005 , she denounced his effort , calling a withdrawal of U.S. forces " a big mistake . "
In 2006 , when Senator John Kerry sponsored an amendment that would have required the redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq in order to advance a political solution to the growing sectarian strife , she voted against it .
" Now , my Democratic opponent talks a great deal about a speech he gave in 2002 .
He is asking us to judge him by his words , and words can be powerful , but only if the speaker translates them into action and solutions .
Senator Obama holds up his original opposition to the war on the campaign trail , but he did n’t start working aggressively to end the war until he started running for president .
So when he had a chance to act on his speech , he chose silence instead . "
It ’s ironic that Clinton , in a desperate effort to cover up for her support for the war and her lies to justify it , would belittle Obama ’s accurate and prescient understanding that invading Iraq was wrong .
Back in October 2002 , Obama publicly acknowledged that " Saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States , or to his neighbors " and that " even a successful war against Iraq will require a U.S. occupation of undetermined length , at undetermined cost , with undetermined consequences . "
He also recognized that " an invasion of Iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the Middle East , and encourage the worst , rather than best , impulses of the Arab world , and strengthen the recruitment arm of al - Qaeda . "
That same month in Washington , however , Clinton was insisting incorrectly that Iraq was such a dire threat to U.S. national security that it required her , " in the best interests of our nation , " to vote to authorize the invasion .
Furthermore , Obama did a lot more than give a speech : he gave interviews , lobbied members of Congress , and made a series of other statements in which he warned of the violent sectarian and ethnic divisions which could emerge following a U.S. invasion and occupation , the risks of a long - term U.S. military commitment , and the dangerous precedent of giving a carte blanche for a pre-emptive war .
It was true that , much to the disappointment of many of his supporters , Obama did not initially take leadership in opposition to the war once he was elected to the U.S. Senate , though it is customary for freshman senators to take a back seat on foreign policy issues during the early part of their first term .
Yet , by November of his first year in office , while Clinton was still backing Bush administration policy , Obama was calling for a reduction in U.S. forces .
Within a year , Obama introduced legislation setting a date for the withdrawal of U.S. troops , well prior to Clinton supporting such legislation .
" As we bring our troops and contractors home , we cannot lose sight of our strategic interests in this region .
The reality is that this war has made the terrorists stronger .
Well , they may not have been in Iraq before the war , they are there now , and we cannot allow Iraq to become a breeding ground and safe haven for terrorists who seek to attack us and our friends and allies .
So let me be clear – under my plan , withdrawing from Iraq will not mean retreating from fighting terrorism in Iraq .
That ’s why I will order small , elite strike forces to engage in targeted operations against al - Qaeda in Iraq .
This will protect Iraqi citizens , our allies , and our families right here at home . "
Clinton did not always acknowledge the absence of terrorist operations in Iraq prior to the U.S. invasion and occupation .
Indeed , in order to justify her vote to authorize the invasion , she insisted that Saddam had " given aid , comfort , and sanctuary to terrorists , including al - Qaeda members . "
This came despite top strategic analysts correctly informing her that there were no apparent links between Saddam Hussein ’s secular nationalist regime and the radical Islamist al - Qaeda , despite doubts of such claims appearing in the National Intelligence Estimates made available to her , and despite a subsequent definitive report by the Department of Defense which noted that not only did no such link exist , but that no such link could have even been reasonably suggested based upon the evidence available at that time .
Now , as a direct consequence of the invasion and occupation she helped make possible , Clinton uses the very real presence of terrorist groups , including at least one major faction which identifies with al - Qaeda , as an excuse to continue prosecuting the war .

最近ニュースで報道されたように、韓国でトラッキングクッキーをウイルスと認識するようにした偽の対策ソフトを2005年から622万台のパソコンに配布し、ウイルス検出を名目に約126万人から約92億5000万ウォンを騙し取った韓国のセキュリティベンダーの前代表らを検挙した（関連ニュース：「偽ソフト」で10億円を稼いだ人物、韓国で起訴される）。
実は、この126万人に及ぶ被害者のうちの一人が筆者である。
このソフトの名前 は 「 ドクターウィルス」。筆者がこのソフトを使うようになったきっかけは、2007年1月に情報通信部が選定した優秀ソフトウエアに選ばれたからである。つまり国がお墨付きを与えた対策ソフトだったわけだ。自国の恥をさらすようでまことに恥ずかしいことだが、韓国のIT政策を指揮する省庁が偽ソフトを優秀な製品と選定するなんて、一体どういう審議をしていたのだろうか。2008年に情報通信部は解体されたので二度とこのようなことは起こらないとは思うが、情報通信部が見破けないほど高度な技術を使った偽ソフトでもなかったので、疑問は大きくなるばかりだ。
情報通信部はウイルスやスパイウエアを最もよく検出・駆除するソフトとして「 ADスパイダー 」 「 PCクリアー 」 「 スパイドクター 」 、「 スパイゼロ 」 「ドクターウィルス」――の5種類が優秀であるという内容の報道資料を配り、それを省庁のWebサイトにも掲示していた。
国がお墨付きを与えたソフトなので、筆者も何の疑いもなしにその中の一つだった「ドクターウィルス」をダウンロードしてウイルスをチェックしてみたところ、出るわ出るわ。筆者のパソコンはウイルスとスパイウエアだらけだという結果が表示された上に、「今すぐウイルスを駆除するためには、1回800ウォン、もしくは月額3850ウォンの有料サービスを利用しろ」という案内が出た。
800ウォンというと日本円で100円。今まで何の問題もなく利用できたのにおかしいな～と思いつつも、大事な商売道具であるパソコンのためなら100円ぐらい使ってやろうじゃないかと、携帯電話の料金に合算請求される小額決済で支払った。
しかし、1回800ウォンのタイプを選んで決済したはずが、なぜか4000ウォン近い料金が毎月勝手に引き落されていく。携帯電話料金と合算請求なので払わないわけにもいかない。キャリアに連絡をしても、決済代行をしているだけなので請求を止めることはできないという。ドクターウィルスの顧客センターと書いてある電話番号に電話をしても、いつも通話中なのか誰も電話に出ない。
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Comcast Corp. the largest U.S. cable television operator , said on Wednesday it has started offering a super - fast Internet service that allows customers to download a high - definition movie in 10 minutes .
Comcast CEO Brian Roberts speaks at his keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , Nevada January 8 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Rick Wilking
The new premium service was launched in the Twin Cities area of Minneapolis - St. Paul , and marks a leap in connection speeds for Comcast .
The new service offers speeds starting at 50 megabits per second , compared with the previous fastest connection speeds of 16 mb per second .
Comcast said the new service is aimed at residential and business customers .
But at $ 149.95 a month , compared with about $ 50 a month for its usual service , it is likely to attract businesses or very heavy residential users , such as video game players or movie download fans .
It shares the Twin Cities market with regional phone company Qwest Communications International Inc .
Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts unveiled plans for the new super - fast service at the Consumer Electronics Show in January , describing it as “ wideband , ” and the company said it plans to reach around 20 percent of its subscriber base with the service by the end of the year .
The company plans to increase speeds on the service , eventually offering speeds of 100 mb to 160 mb per second .
The technology that enables Comcast to increase download speeds is called ‘ channel bonding ’ and uses cable pipes more efficiently to deliver video , Internet and voice .
Comcast ’s plans came less than a week after the company said it would change the way it manages its network and cooperate to resolve critics ’ claims it interferes with Internet file - sharing services .
File - sharing services are normally used to distribute content more efficiently by people trying to move large files such as music and movies .
Cable operators are increasingly concerned with improving the efficiency of their cable plants to be able to push more content through their pipes at faster speeds to rival growing competition from telephone companies like Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc .
Verizon is rolling out a new high - tech fiber - optic service ( FiOS ) both for digital video and super - fast Internet connections up to 30 mb a second .

Everything old is new again : Quoted Domain Specific Languages
We describe a new approach to domain specific languages ( DSLs ) , called Quoted DSLs ( QDSLs ) , that resurrects two old ideas : quotation , from McCarthy 's Lisp of 1960 , and the subformula property , from Gentzen 's natural deduction of 1935 .
Quoted terms allow the DSL to share the syntax and type system of the host language .
Normalising quoted terms ensures the subformula property , which guarantees that one can use higher - order types in the source while guaranteeing first - order types in the target , and enables using types to guide fusion .
We test our ideas by re-implementing Feldspar , which was originally implemented as an Embedded DSL ( EDSL ) , as a QDSL ; and we compare the QDSL and EDSL variants .
A practical theory of language - integrated query
Language - integrated query is receiving renewed attention , in part because of its support through Microsoft 's LINQ framework .
We present a theory of language - integrated query based on quotation and normalisation of quoted terms .
Our technique supports abstraction over values and predicates , composition of queries , dynamic generation of queries , and queries with nested intermediate data .
Higher - order features prove useful even for constructing first - order queries .
We prove that normalisation always succeeds in translating any query of flat relation type to SQL .
We present experimental results confirming our technique works , even in situations where Microsoft 's LINQ framework either fails to produce an SQL query or , in one case , produces an avalanche of SQL queries .
Earlier versions of this paper were named " The essence of language - integrated query "
The arrow calculus
We introduce the arrow calculus , a metalanguage for manipulating Hughes ’s arrows with close relations both to Moggi ’s metalanguage for monads and to Paterson ’s arrow notation .
Arrows are classically defined by extending lambda calculus with three constructs satisfying nine ( somewhat idiosyncratic ) laws ; in contrast , the arrow calculus adds four constructs satisfying five laws ( which fit two well - known patterns ) .
The five laws were previously known to be sound ; we show that they are also complete , and hence that the five laws may replace the nine .
The RPC Calculus
Several recent language designs have offered a unified language for programming a distributed system , with explicit notation of locations ; we call these " location - aware " languages .
These languages provide constructs allowing the programmer to control the location ( the choice of host , for example ) where a piece of code should run , which can be useful for security or performance reasons .
On the other hand , a central mantra of WWW system engineering prescribes that web servers should be " stateless " : that no " session state " should be maintained on behalf of individual clients — that is , no state that pertains to the particular point of the interaction at which a client program resides .
Many implementations of locationaware languages are not at home on the web : they hold some kind of client - specific state on the server .
We show how to implement a symmetrical location - aware language on top of a stateless server .

The Essence of Form Abstraction
Abstraction is the cornerstone of high - level programming ; HTML forms are the principal medium of web interaction .
However , most web programming environments do not support abstraction of form components , leading to a lack of compositionality .
Using a semantics based on idioms , we show how to support compositional form construction and give a convenient syntax .
Idioms are oblivious , arrows are meticulous , monads are promiscuous
We revisit the connection between three notions of computation : Moggi 's monads , Hughes 's arrows and McBride and Paterson 's idioms ( also called applicative functors ) .
We show that idioms are equivalent to arrows that satisfy the type isomorphism A ~> B = 1 ~> ( A -> B ) and that monads are equivalent to arrows that satisfy the type isomorphism A ~> B = A -> ( 1 ~> B ) .
Further , idioms embed into arrows and arrows embed into monads .
The arrow calculus ( Functional pearl )
We introduce the arrow calculus , a metalanguage for manipulating Hughes 's arrows with close relations both to Moggi 's metalanguage for monads and to Paterson 's arrow notation .
An idiom 's guide to formlets
Formlets in Links decouple user interface from data , a vital form of abstraction supported by very few web frameworks .
Formlets are best defined in terms of idioms , not monads or arrows as one might suppose from the existing literature .
Signed and sealed
Language constructs for defining abstract types commonly come in two varieties : those that add and remove seals dynamically as values cross the abstraction boundary , and those that define the boundary statically using a type signature .
Abstract types in dynamically - typed languages are generally defined using seals whereas statically - typed languages more typically use a signature ; two prominent exceptions are Haskell , which uses seals , and Standard ML , which provides for both styles .
We show that the two styles are interconvertible , and give a proof based on Pitts ' formulation of relational parametricity .
In the light of this equivalence we revisit the decision to use seals for abstract types in Haskell and describe a library which extends Haskell with a construct for defining abstract types using signatures by a translation which inserts seals as necessary .
A located lambda calculus
Several recent language designs have offered a unified language for programming a distributed system ; we call these " location - aware " languages .
These languages provide constructs that allow the programmer to control the location ( the choice of host , for example ) where a piece of code should run , which can be useful for security or performance reasons .
On the other hand , a central mantra of web engineering insists that web servers should be " stateless " : that no " session state " should be maintained on behalf of individual clients --- that is , no state that pertains to the particular point of the interaction at which a client program resides .
Thus far , most implementations of unified location - aware languages have ignored this precept , usually keeping a process for each client running on the server , or otherwise storing state information in memory .
We show how to implement a location - aware language on top of the stateless - server model .
Comprehensive comprehensions
We propose an extension to list comprehensions that makes it easy to express the kind of queries one would write in SQL using ORDER BY , GROUP BY , and LIMIT .
Our extension adds expressive power to comprehensions , and generalises the SQL constructs that inspired it .
It is easy to implement , using simple desugaring rules .
Links is a programming language for web applications that generates code for all three tiers of a web application from a single source , compiling into JavaScript to run on the client and into SQL to run on the database .
Links supports rich clients running in what has been dubbed Ajax style , and supports concurrent processes with statically - typed message passing .
Links is scalable in the sense that session state is preserved in the client rather than the server , in contrast to other approaches such as Java Servlets or PLT Scheme .
Client - side concurrency in JavaScript and transfer of computation between client and server are both supported by translation into continuation - passing style .
A typical web system is organized in three tiers , each running on a separate computer .
Middle - tier logic on the server generates forms to send to a front - end browser and queries to send to a back - end database .
The programmer must master a myriad of languages : the logic is written in a mixture of Java , Python , and Perl ; the forms in HTML , XML , and Javascript ; and the queries are written in SQL or XQuery .
There is no easy way to link these --- to be sure that a form in HTML or a query in SQL produces data of a type that the logic in Java expects --- this is called the impedance mismatch problem .
Links collapses this Tower of Babel by providing a single source that compiles into Javascript , Java , SQL , and XQuery , among others .
Links builds on previous successes with functional languages , incorporating support for database programming from Kleisli , for XML programming from Xduce , for web interaction from Scheme and Haskell , and for distributed programming from Erlang .
The latest target for the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's Patent Busting Project comes courtesy of Patent 6,264,560 , a patent for a " method and system for playing games on a network . "
The patent in question is held by Sheldon F. Goldberg and was granted on July 24 , 2001 , about two years after it was filed .
Like many of the patents we cover on Ars , this one make some very broad claims .
Goldberg 's patent claims to cover any and all online , multiplayer games that offer real - time updates of player rankings and use tournament - style play .
Patent ' 560 also covers serving up targeted advertising using player demographics .
The EFF accuses Goldberg of extracting hefty licensing fees from online gaming companies anxious to avoid what could be costly litigation , a scenario that has become all too familiar .
According to the EFF , there 's a significant amount of prior art on the ' 560 patent , the existence of which should lead the US Patent and Trademark Office to overturn it upon reexamination .
In particular , Netrek , an online multiplayer game with origins in the mid 1980s , makes use of much of the same technology described in Goldberg 's patent .
Much of the code for Netrek is open source , and its development is archived online ; the source code was first posted to Usenet in late 1989 .
The EFF has also documented other instances of prior art with the assistance of students at the Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School .
So far , the EFF has seen some success with its patent - busting project .
Of the patents on its top ten list , one has been overturned while three others have had requests for reexamination granted by the USPTO .
The overturned patent was held by Clear Channel and covered burning CDs of a performance right after a concert ends .
That patent was revoked by the USPTO in March 2007 .

Obama plans major race speech tomorrow
Barack Obama will give a major speech on " the larger issue of race in this campaign , " he told reporters in Monaca , PA just now .
He was pressed there , as he has been at recent appearances , on statements by his former pastor , Jeremiah Wright .
" I am going to be talking about not just Reverend Wright , but the larger issue of race in this campaign , " he said .
He added that he would " talk about how some of these issues are perceived from within the black church issue for example , " he said .
He also briefly defended Wright from the image that has come through in a handful of repeatedly televised clips from recent Wright sermons .

" The caricature that ’s being painted of him is not accurate , " he said .
The speech could offer Obama an opportunity to move past the controversy over his pastor , and to turn the conversation to a topic he'd rather focus on : his Christian faith .
But the speech also guarantees that the Wright story will continue to dominate political headlines .
Mitt Romney 's attempt directly to address his Mormonism last year never decisively put the issue to rest for some voters .
Obama 's schedule puts him in Philadelphia tomorrow .

A John McCain presidency would take to a more forceful approach to Russia and China , according to senior foreign policy advisers to the Republican candidate .
The Arizona senator has already signalled that he intends to confront Russian president Vladimir Putin more directly than George W Bush if he wins the White House in November .
In a recent foreign policy speech , Mr McCain advocated removing Russia from the G8 group of major industrialised powers , while this week he announced he would not attend the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics if he were in office because of China ’s suppression of Tibetan protest .
His experience of foreign affairs is one reason why the 71 - year - old Vietnam war veteran has drawn level with both his potential Democratic rivals , Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , in opinion polls , suggesting the public may accept his more muscular approach to the world .
Robert Kagan , who wrote much of the speech delivered in Los Angeles , told the Daily Telegraph : “ Russia will loom large for both Europe and the US , and John McCain has been ahead of the curve and has seen this coming down the road .

That 's the conclusion of a poll released on Monday by the National Sleep Foundation .
It was dutifully described by dozens of news outlets – but only one of them reported that the foundation is funded by pharmaceutical companies who stand to profit from sleeping drugs .
Among the sponsors of the foundation 's National Sleep Awareness
Week – going on right now , and which I celebrated this morning by sleeping through my alarm – are pharmaceutical giants Boehringer - Ingelheim ,
GlaxoSmithKline , Merck , Organon International , Sepracor , Somaxon and
Takeda .
( Mattress makers TempurPedic and Wamsutta chipped in , too . )
The Associated Press , US News & World Report , Reuters , Agence France - Presse , St. Louis Post - Dispatch , NBC , CTV , UPI , WebMD , Chattanooga Times Free Press , National Post : none mentioned the potential conflict of interest .
Only Angela Stewart of the Newark Star - Ledger noted that foundation is " funded in part by pharmaceutical companies . "
Should this piece of information change our interpretation of the poll 's findings – that the average American gets less than seven hours sleep on weeknights , only a little more on weekends , and that our personal relationships and professional capacities suffer as a result ?
Speaking strictly for myself , based on extensive anecdotal evidence , I think these numbers are probably accurate ; if not , it 's because of problems intrinsic to polling .
The National Sleep Foundation 's funders stand to gain from insomnia aids and deep - sleep drugs , but the underlying problem is real .
( My own solution to this problem is less pharmaceutical and more political – but that 's a rant for another day . )
That 's my own take .
Other people will have different interpretations , and rightfully so .
What 's important is that we judge the findings with all relevant information at hand .
Funding sources are definitely relevant .
And in the interests of full disclosure : I once wrote a story for my journalism school 's wire service about a commercial nap provider .
I cited the National Sleep Foundation and did n't even think to see where its money came from .
Note : The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released their own
sleep poll last week .
Their findings : one in ten Americans are chronically sleep - deprived . *
This would have been a less - conflicted hook on which to hang the
National Sleep Foundation story , or at least to corroborate it , but only a few reporters even mentioned it .

Amy Winehouse is cleaning up her act in more ways than one .
The singer used her trademark black eyeliner to cover up a topless tattoo on her arm when she performed via satellite at the Grammys , it has been revealed .
Producers at the music ceremony , where Amy won five awards last week , were concerned by the graphic nature of one tattoo on her left arm which features a topless woman .
Scroll down for more ...
So Amy , 24 , filled in the offending area before she appeared on air .
A source told the Daily Telegraph : " Amy drew a little black bikini top on the large topless femle tattoo on her arm , so as not to offend any of America 's puritanical viewers . "
After the show , the tattoo is said to have been removed .
Amy , 24 , is receiving treatment for substance abuse after being caught on camera apparently using crack cocaine last month .
In the backstage rider by which all others are still judged , the band not only outlawed brown M&Ms , they demanded “ herring in sour cream ” and a tube of personal lubricant .
I worked at the Magic Kingdom for 7 years , and was able to take with me a ton of secrets that ruin the â€œMagicâ€ of Disney .
Since Iâ€™m now burdened with these secrets , I figured Iâ€™d share 6 of them that most people have no clue about .
If youâ€ ™re a die - hard Disney fan that still believes in fairy tales and pixie dust , this list isnâ€™t for you .
There are tunnels under the Magic Kingdom – the tunnels are large enough to drive vehicles through , and serve as a way for cast members to access areas of the park specific to their costume .
I did a much larger post about the Disney tunnels on another site that goes into details , and provides a list of park access points from the tunnels .
These access points are scattered throughout the park , but most people never notice them .

Imran Rehman now helps men who have suffered forced marriage
When Imran Rehman was 10 , he was taken to Pakistan and found himself in the middle of an enormous family party .
He remembers being told to sit next to a little girl in a fine dress .
He did not understand why , but he and the little girl were , jointly , the centre of attention .
They were showered with money and presents and they had garlands cast around their necks .
Imran said : " I was just paying attention to the food and the money .
I did n't know what was happening .
I just thought it was a party . "
It was not until five years later - the year he sat his O - levels - that he was shown a photograph of that celebration - and he finally understood its significance .
It had been his own engagement party .
The little girl was his five - year - old first cousin .
She was also to be his wife - whether he liked it or not .
Locked up
" It made me feel sick , knowing that was my engagement .
I went off the rails .
I got into the wrong crowd , I got into fights , I got expelled from two schools , " he said .
To get him to behave , his parents took measures that many people might see as extreme .
They sent him to Pakistan , telling him it was so he could see the area where they had been born .
For a while , he says , " it was nice to be on holiday " .
Then , one morning , he says , he was drugged , taken to a mosque in a deserted village , and imprisoned .
Once there , he had shackles locked around his feet .
" I was kept in a room , locked up .
I had to sleep like that .
I even had to eat , go to the bath , toilet , shackled like that , for 15 days . "
Emotional blackmail
With the help of friends , he was eventually able to find his way back to the UK .
When he got home , the only explanation he got from his family was it was his " rehabilitation " .
You 're a man , you do n't cry - if you cry , you 're not supposed to show your tears
Imran Rehman
The pressure continued , perhaps to a lesser degree , for years , until something happened that finally made up his mind up that he had to get married .
He said : " I was 24 .
I was working at Birmingham airport .
I got a phone call to say one of my close relatives was extremely ill .
I was the first person there , by their bedside .
I said : ' What can I do to help ? ' "
His poorly relative told him that if anything was to happen to her , it would be his fault , for not going to Pakistan to get married .
He says he was emotionally blackmailed , and he felt that he had no choice .
" So I went to Pakistan .
I did n't want that on my head , you know , " he said .
Family disowned
He married his cousin .
But the marriage only lasted a month before Imran told his family it was over .
He was told he had just two choices : " Stay with your wife , buy a house , have kids , live your life .
Or get disowned . "
" So I left home , " he said .
It was the beginning of a seven - year severance from his family .
He says he drifted from job to job , drank too much and struggled to deal with his trauma .
" My family had disowned me .
I just thought : ' I 've got to stand on my own two feet and try and battle it out ' .
Which I could n't understand how to do . "
' Stressed out '
He eventually found a support organisation called Karma Nirvana .
At the time , this Derby - based self - help group was only for women .
But they realised , through their dealings with Imran , that men were also vulnerable to becoming victims of honour - based violence .
Now , Imran works with Karma Nirvana as a support worker for men who suffer in the same way he did .
He says it is harder for men to seek help than women because men are not allowed to be open about their feelings .
Before , when I was alone , I used to feel like I was the only man who was going through it
Imran Rehman
He said : " You 're a man , you do n't cry .
If you cry , you 're not supposed to show your tears .
It really stressed me out .
" I knew there was no support for me to go anywhere .
Now , there is support out there for men .
I encourage men to come forward .
" What I tend to do is I tell my personal experiences to the men I work with , male victims .
And believe me , they do open up . "
Imran now supports 36 men who have been victims of forced marriage or honour - based violence .
He says helping them get over their problems is a way to help himself to stay positive .
" It makes me feel good , you know ?
I know I 'm not alone any more .
Before , when I was alone , I used to feel like I was the only man who was going through it , " he said .
Now he knows there are others who have gone through what he has been through .
And he hopes they will all get the kind of support that will help keep them safe from their families .
It kills me that I can't take credit for today 's black bean brownies .
As strange as it sounds ( we 're talking about brownies packed with pureed black beans ) , this recipe from a new book by Ania Catalano delivers deliciously dense , bite - sized squares of melt - in - your - mouth fudge - textured brownies .
Keep in mind I 'm someone who comes across hundreds of brownie recipes a year , it was n't high on my to - do list to feature yet another brownie recipe .
But the quirky ingredient list piqued my curiosity , and in the end the proof was in the pan .
Ania mentions that this flourless brownie was the most sought - after recipe at her restaurant and bakery .
Ania 's new book is called Baking with Agave Nectar .
I was lucky enough to spend some time with a preview copy of it , and even wrote a blurb for the back cover .
There are many reasons people are looking to alternative sweeteners .
I wrote ( and used ) agave nectar in Super Natural Cooking for a number of recipes , but you might also try date syrup , coconut nectar , or maple syrup .
People looking for sweeteners lower on the glycemic index explore agave nectar , as do many hypoglycemics , diabetics , and people with certain allergies .
That being said , do n't make the mistake of dismissing it as some sort of " health " or " diet " ingredient .
The real reason for chef and home cooks alike to try it ( if you have n't already ) is because it tastes amazing - it really has its own thing going on .
I wo n't get into all the specifics here , but I encourage you to give it a try .
Ania 's book is a great starting point for those of you who want to learn to bake with agave nectar in place of the typical white refined sugar called for in so many baking recipes .
I also get into many of the specific characteristics of it in the " Use Natural Sweeteners " chapter of SNC with a few recipes that highlight it .
So , like I said - there are some quirky facets to this particular brownie recipe .
Black bean brownies , really ?
Yes !
And now I 'm totally enamored with the use of the black bean batter , it really worked , not even a hint of beany flavor .
Consequently , my head is now spinning with all sorts of thoughts about how I might use other pulses in future baking adventures .
( CNN ) --
Some 220 square miles of ice has collapsed in Antarctica and an ice shelf about seven times the size of Manhattan is " hanging by a thread , " the British Antarctic Survey said Tuesday , blaming global warming .
Scientists say the size of the threatened shelf is about 5,282 square miles .
" We are in for a lot more events like this , " said professor Ted Scambos , a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder .
Scambos alerted the British Antarctic Survey after he noticed part of the Wilkins ice shelf disintegrating on February 28 , when he was looking at NASA satellite images .
Late February marks the end of summer at the South Pole and is the time when such events are most likely , he said .
Watch aerial footage of the area »
" The amazing thing was , we saw it within hours of it beginning , in between the morning and the afternoon pictures of that day , " Scambos said of the large chunk that broke away on February 28 .
The Wilkins ice shelf lost about 6 percent of its surface a decade ago , the British Antarctic Survey said in a statement on its Web site
Another 220 square miles -- including the chunk that Scambos spotted -- had splintered from the ice shelf as of March 8 , the group said .
" As of mid-March , only a narrow strip of shelf ice was protecting several thousand kilometers of potential further breakup , " the group said .
Scambos ' center put the size of the threatened shelf at about 5,282 square miles , comparable to the state of Connecticut , or about half the area of Scotland .
See a map and photos as the collapse progressed »
Once Scambos called the British Antarctic Survey , the group sent an aircraft on a reconnaissance mission to examine the extent of the breakout .
" We flew along the main crack and observed the sheer scale of movement from the breakage , " said Jim Elliott , according to the group 's Web site .
" Big hefty chunks of ice , the size of small houses , look as though they 've been thrown around like rubble -- it 's like an explosion , " he said .
" Wilkins is the largest ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula yet to be threatened , " David Vaughan of the British Antarctic Survey said , according to the Web site .
" I did n't expect to see things happen this quickly .
The ice shelf is hanging by a thread -- we 'll know in the next few days or weeks what its fate will be . "
But with Antarctica 's summer ending , Scambos said the " unusual show is over for this season . "
Ice shelves are floating ice sheets attached to the coast .
Because they are already floating , their collapse does not have any effect on sea levels , according to the Cambridge - based British Antarctic Survey .
Scambos said the ice shelf is not currently on the path of the increasingly popular tourist ships that travel from South America to Antarctica .
But some plants and animals may have to adapt to the collapse .
" Wildlife will be impacted , but they are pretty adept at dealing with a topsy - turvy world , " he said .
" The ecosystem is pretty resilient . "
Several ice shelves -- Prince Gustav Channel , Larsen Inlet , Larsen A , Larsen B , Wordie , Muller and Jones -- have collapsed in the past three decades , the British Antarctic Survey said .
Larsen B , a 1,254 - square - mile ice shelf , comparable in size to the U.S. state of Rhode Island , collapsed in 2002 , the group said .
Scientists say the western Antarctic peninsula -- the piece of the continent that stretches toward South America -- has warmed more than any other place on Earth over the past 50 years , rising by 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit each decade .
Scambos said the poles will be the leading edge of what 's happening in the rest of the world as global warming continues .
" Even though they seem far away , changes in the polar regions could have an impact on both hemispheres , with sea level rise and changes in climate patterns , " he said .
News of the Wilkins ice shelf 's impending breakup came less than two weeks after the United Nations Environment Program reported that the world 's glaciers are melting away and that they show " record " losses .
" Data from close to 30 reference glaciers in nine mountain ranges indicate that between the years 2004 - 2005 and 2005 - 2006 the average rate of melting and thinning more than doubled , " the UNEP said March 16 .
The most severe glacial shrinking occurred in Europe , with Norway 's Breidalblikkbrea glacier , UNEP said .
That glacier thinned by about 10 feet in 2006 , compared with less than a foot the year before , it said .

Here ’s something a bit more computer - sciencey than usual .
For something at work , I have had to implement a function parser , so you can type ‘ 1+2*b ‘ and it ’ll work it all out , with correct operator precedence and so forth .
To do this , I use a three - step process :
Tokenise the input , and at the same time convert any variables found to their numeric values Convert the input tokens to RPN using the Shunting Yard algorithm Evaluate the RPN form of the equation using an RPN parser , which is really easy to write
This did the job nicely , however the time came when it had to be extended , and able to accept functions , such as ‘ max ( 1,2,3 ) ‘.
The standard shunting yard algorithm can handle functions , but with the restriction that the number of arguments to them is known ( really , this is a limitation of the RPN algorithm , but it ’s at this point in the process that we need to deal with the problem ) .
In this case , I wanted to handle functions with a variable number of arguments , so ‘ max ( 1,2 ) ‘ would work , and so would ‘ max ( 1,2,3,4,5 ) ‘.
To do this , I extended the standard algorithm .
Below is the algorithm from Wikipedia .
My additions are in bold .
This requires two more stacks , a ‘ were values ‘ stack , and an ‘ arg count ‘ stack .
It also requires that you can attach the number of arguments to an instance of a function .
In my case , I did it with a small class that took the function and an argument count , with one of these created during tokenisation for each function encountered .
While there are tokens to be read :
Read a token .
If the token is a number , then add it to the output queue .
If the were values stack has a value on it , pop it and push true .
If the token is a function token , then push it onto the stack .
Push 0 onto the arg count stack .
If the were values stack has a value on it , pop it and push true .
Push false onto were values .
If the token is a function argument separator ( e.g. , a comma ) :
Until the topmost element of the stack is a left parenthesis , pop the element onto the output queue .
If no left parentheses are encountered , either the separator was misplaced or parentheses were mismatched .
Pop were values into w .
If w is true , pop arg count into a , increment a and push back into arg count .
Push false into were values .
If the token is an operator , o 1 , then : while there is an operator , o 2 , at the top of the stack , and either o 1 is associative or left - associative and its precedence is less than ( lower precedence ) or equal to that of o 2 , or o 1 is right - associative and its precedence is less than ( lower precedence ) that of o 2 , pop o 2 off the stack , onto the output queue ; push o 1 onto the operator stack .
If the token is a left parenthesis , then push it onto the stack .
If the token is a right parenthesis :
Until the token at the top of the stack is a left parenthesis , pop operators off the stack onto the output queue .
Pop the left parenthesis from the stack , but not onto the output queue .
If the token at the top of the stack is a function token Pop stack into f Pop arg count into a Pop were values into w
If w is true , increment a Set the argument count of f to a Push f onto output queue
If the stack runs out without finding a left parenthesis , then there are mismatched parentheses .
When there are no more tokens to read :
While there are still operator tokens in the stack :
If the operator token on the top of the stack is a parenthesis , then there are mismatched parenthesis .
Pop the operator onto the output queue .
Exit .
Note that because I did n’t feel like correctly listifying most of it , consider an if to apply to the end of that sentence only .
Operation order is usually important .
With this done , the part of the RPN algorithm that says :
It is known that the function takes n arguments .
can now be satisfied .

Spamming can pay big bucks , but it has n't paid off for a Seattle man who was once considered the eighth - largest spammer in the world by Spamhaus .
Robert Soloway , 28 , pleaded guilty to electronic mail fraud , " snail " mail fraud , and not filing a tax return in 2005 — when he reportedly made over $ 300,000 from his spamming activities .
Soloway was originally hit with a 35 - count indictment in May 2007 charging him with fraud , wire fraud , aggravated identity theft , and money laundering .
He was accused of using Chinese ISPs to send out spam e-mail using a database of 157.8 million e-mail addresses , as well as operating a botnet used for spamming .
He faced significant jail time and the prospect of having to forfeit all of his spam - related assets to the federal government .
Soloway is no stranger to legal actions related to his illicit e-mail activities .
He was sued by Microsoft in December 2003 , but argued that his subcontractors were actually responsible for the spam that used forged hotmail.com reply - to addresses .
In April 2005 , a judge handed down a default judgment in Microsoft 's favor , much to Soloway 's chagrin .
A month later , Soloway formed SPAMIS : Strategic Partnership Against Microsoft Illegal Spam .
A press release archived in a USENET group announced the organization 's formation to alert everyone of " Microsoft 's illegal , unsolicited , unethical , and fraudulent unsolicited e-mail spamming , e-mail address harvesting and e-mail list purchasing for use in spamming and various other reckless spamming related practices that everyone from the Microsoft CEO to Microsoft employees have engaged in for over 10 years now . "
SPAMIS threatened to bombard over 1.9 billion e-mail accounts with data the group reportedly obtained on " Microsoft 's spamming practices . "
The legal problems continued to mount for Soloway , who was sued by an Oklahoma ISP in 2005 for violating federal CAN - SPAM laws .
Soloway fired his lawyer and eventually stopped showing up in court .
As a result , the federal judge overseeing the case handed the ISP a $ 10 million default judgment .
Soloway has been jailed since being arrested , and it does n't look as though he 'll be seeing anything besides the inside of a prison cell for the foreseeable future .
He 's looking at a maximum of 26 years in prison as well as $ 625,000 fine .
In addition , the government will move to seize his ill - gotten gains .
His attorney told The Seattle Times that there 's not much left to seize , saying that he 's essentially broke .
Further reading
Joshua Bloch , Chief Java Architect at Google , gave a talk entitled “ The Closures Controversy ” ( PowerPoint slides ) at Javapolis in December 2007 .
I found it online through reddit , and it intrigued me , because I think it illustrates a disconnect between what we as an industry are doing and the goals we have .
Bloch also makes what I think is a reasonable argument for limiting Java .
Those of you who ’ve read what I ’ve written for a while might be surprised by that statement .
I have been critical of the IT industry for not thinking in more powerful terms about programming / computing .
I am not endorsing Java .
After watching his talk I was prepared to lay into Bloch for not having higher ambitions for the language , but as I thought about it I realized that it ’s unreasonable to expect a computing environment to be more than what it was designed for .
It helps me see that Java has a shelf life .
To expect more would mean trying to change it into something it ’s not .
The appeal of Java
Bloch began his talk using Gosling ’s ideas from his article The Feel of Java , published in IEEE Computer in 1997 , as a touchstone for what Java ought to be like in the future :
It is a language for a job .
Doing language research was an anti-goal [ in the development of Java ] . . .
It is practical , not theoretical .
It ’s driven by what people need .
Theory provides rigour , cleanliness , and cohesiveness .
[ Java had ] no new ideas .
It took ideas from existing languages and put them together .
It maybe added a few new things , but that was n’t the goal .
And this is perhaps the most important slide in the whole talk .
He said , ‘ Do n’t fix it until it chafes ’ , to keep it simple .
Do n’t put anything in the language just because it ’s nice .
Require several real instances before including any feature .
In other words , ‘ Just Say No , until threatened with bodily harm . ’
He said Java feels hyped , playful , flexible , deterministic , non-threatening , and rich , and like I can just code .
Bloch continued from the article :
Java is a blue collar language .
It ’s not a PhD thesis .
It ’s a language for a job .
Java feels familiar to many different programmers , because we preferred tried and tested things .
When Gosling said Java is “ not theoretical ” , he was comparing it to languages / VMs that are based on computer science theory , like Lisp , which is based on lambda calculus .
By “ practical ” he meant the instrumentalist approach to design , which is that the feature set and the architecture the language / VM supports should handle current problems .
Nothing more , nothing less .
In my view this is short - sighted .
It means that after acquiring and using the language to solve current problems you will run into problems the language was n’t designed to handle , because new challenges arise .
You will have to improvize within a structure that is ill - suited to the task , until whoever is in charge of the language adds new structures that handle the problem effectively .
Wash , rinse , repeat .
I have a feeling that this approach is a defense against languages whose designers add features willy - nilly without consideration for how it fits into the overall goal of the platform .
Bloch points out that “ theoretical ” languages do n’t have this problem , but he passes by it quickly .
Java was a swing in the other direction from languages like C/C++ that were said to “ give you more than enough rope to hang yourself with ” .
I guess programmers “ hung themselves ” more often than not .
C and C++ are powerful in the sense of allowing you to access the hardware directly inside of a language that gives you high - level structures .
If you ’re interested in doing anything more than building kernels , device drivers , or VMs / compilers , they ’re pretty weak .
Java rode a wave that was happening at the time it was introduced .
C and C++ were the dominant languages .
All sorts of projects were done in them , including applications .
Java provided a productivity boost to project groups with this orientation by getting rid of many of the pitfalls of using C/C++ ( buffer overruns , memory leaks , null or uninitialized pointer references , etc. ) , but in terms of building more abstract software like applications / environments with the power the language and the VM gave you , it was n’t that different from C / C ++.
So in essence it played to the tastes of programmers of the time .
It went for familiarity , but without having a particularly good technical reason for it .
Java does n’t allow direct access to the hardware .
So why did the language designers feel it necessary to play “ follow the leader ” with C/ C++ in terms of conventions and power ?
It was an easier sell to programmers .
They like familiarity .
Java meets the programming culture where it is .
As long as the culture is ignorant of the fact that the architecture it ’s using is ill - suited to the task at hand , then technologists can convince themselves and others that problems which arise from using a limited architecture for large projects just go with the territory , and there ’s nothing anyone can do about it .
It ’s about time we became more enlightened , but it ’s going to take us admitting that despite our masterful technical skills we do n’t know very much about why it is we do the things we do with computers , beyond the joy of solving puzzles .
According to Alan Kay , and I think he ’s right about this , it will take learning about and exposing ourselves to other things besides computers .
Quoting Kay , from The Early History of Smalltalk :
Should we even try to teach programming ?
I have met hundreds of programmers in the last 30 years and can see no discernible influence of programming on their general ability to think well or to take an enlightened stance on human knowledge .
If anything , the opposite is true .
Expert knowledge often remains rooted in the environments in which it was first learned–and most metaphorical extensions result in misleading analogies .
A remarkable number of artists , scientists , philosophers are quite dull outside of their specialty ( and one suspects within it as well ) .
The first siren ’s song we need to be wary of is the one that promises a connection between an interesting pursuit and interesting thoughts .
The music is not in the piano , and it is possible to graduate Julliard without finding or feeling it .
I have also met a few people for whom computing provides an important new mataphor for thinking about human knowledge and reach .
But something else was needed besides computing for enlightenment to happen .
Tools provide a path , a context , and almost an excuse for developing enlightenment , but no tool ever contained it or can dispense it .
The state of Java today
Bloch ’s introduction felt like cheerleading for Gosling ’s vision for Java , but then he got into what ’s painful about it now .
He talked about the Java community ’s involvement in the design of Java , and the wisdom of its actions .
“ How are we doing today ? ” , Bloch asked the audience .
He showed several examples of messy Java generics .
It did n’t look that different from C ++.
The audience laughed .
He said , “ Not so well , unfortunately .
This is how Java looks now . ”
The way he described things made it sound like Sun “ jumped the shark ” with generics .
He was more polite than to say this .
He said generics per se were not a bad addition to the language , but their implementation allowed so much freedom that Java code is becoming incomprehensible even to people who have been working with the language for years .
Generics :
An escape hatch
In my view generics are just an attempt to get out from under the limitations of Java ’s strict type system .
The same goes for generics in .
Net .
Generics are the “ managed code ” world ’s version of C++ templates .
They are also called “ parameterized types ” .
They give you some of the programming flexibility of a dynamic language .
Statically typed versions of generic code get generated depending on what types are called for in statically typed code .
What they do n’t give you is the “ get to the point ” feel of programming in a powerful dynamic language , because you have to tell the compiler about how many types the generic code will accept , and in what form it will accept them , where type information needs to go in the generic code , and what form type information will take when data is returned from the routines you write .
In other words , you have to give some metadata for your code so that the static type system can deal with it .
I call it “ overhead ” , but that ’s just me .
What static type systems force you to do is talk about the data flow of your code .
This is n’t so that humans can understand it ( though with some discipline it ’s possible to create readable code this way ) , but so that the compiler and runtime do n’t have to figure out what the data flow will be when your code is executed .
It ’s really a form of optimization .
Bloch explored where the complexity that now bedevils Java comes from .
He got into talking about feature creep .
It ’s not the number of features , it ’s the permutations of feature interactions .
“ When you add a feature to an already rich language , you vastly increase its complexity , ” he said .
The “ quagmire ” of closures
First , let me get a definition out of the way .
A closure can be thought of as an anonymous function .
It is not officially a method in any class .
You can spontaneously create closures inline in your code and use them , in dynamic languages .
You can pass them around from method to method , and they never lose their integrity .
In the context of OOP it ’s more aptly defined as an anonymous class that contains a single anonymous function , because in OOP languages closures are objects with methods of their own .
Bloch gave a brief explanation , which I think is correct : closures “ enclose their environment ” .
They create references to whatever variables are used within them that are in scope range , at the time they are created .
This is called “ lexical scoping ” .
They also automatically return the value of whatever is the last expression evaluated within them .
Bloch gives two reasons why closures are being considered for Java :
They facilitate fine - grained concurrency in fork - join frameworks .
You can use anonymous classes with these frameworks , but they ’re a pain right now .
He said it ’s important that programmers use fork - join frameworks because , “ we have these multi- core machines , and in order to actually make use of these cores , we ’re going to have to start using these parallel programming frameworks . ”
Resource management – Always using try - finally blocks for resource management is painful and causes resource leaks , because programmers misapply the construct .
Closures would help with this .
Even though he conceded these points , he clearly has disdain for closures .
He used BGGA closures as his example .
With the way they ’ve been implemented , I ’d have disdain for them , too .
The hoops you have to jump through to make them work makes me glad I ’m not using this implementation .
He said closures encourage an “ exotic form of programming ” , which is the use of higher - order functions : functions that take functions as parameters , and / or return functions .
He jabs , “ If you give someone a new toy , then they ’ll play with it . ”
Ah , so higher - order functions are a “ toy ” .
Mm-hmm …
I ’m tempted to say something impolite , but I wo n’t .
Bloch talked about closure semantics next , and how they ’re different from normal Java semantics .
He expressed concern throughout the rest of his talk that this would confuse Java programmers , and thereby create bugs .
He has a point .
Still , I do n’t mind the idea of mixing computing models in a single environment ( VM ) .
I think there are advantages to this approach .
Some history :
Where modern computing comes from
Code blocks ( closures ) in Squeak / Smalltalk work differently than normal Smalltalk code as well .
I ’d venture to say that the reason closures have been put in Ruby , and are now being considered for Java , is that Smalltalk was the first OO language to use them .
Even though I ’m sure it ’s largely forgotten now , there are some significant artifacts of computing that have come into common use because of the Smalltalk - 80 system .
The GUI you ’re using now , “ hibernation ” on your PC , bit - blitting , and the MVC design pattern are a few other examples .
Language and system designers have been mining Smalltalk features for years , and incorporating them into modern , though less powerful technologies .
In retrospect people within the Smalltalk community have pointed to some design flaws in it .
They did n’t ruin it by any means , but it ’s recognized that there ’s room for improvement .
In a conversation I was in on between Alan Kay and Bill Kerr , a blogger I ’ve mentioned previously , Kay expressed muted regret about the inclusion of closures in Smalltalk , saying they broke the semantic simplicity of the language .
I can see where he ’s coming from .
Closures introduce an element of functional programming into OOP .
He desired a system that was purely OO , mainly for consistency so the language would be easier for beginners to learn .
I have n’t gotten far enough along in my research to see what Kay would ’ve suggested instead of closures .
My understanding is he was heavily involved with the development of Smalltalk up until Smalltalk - 76 .
Due to a schism that developed in the Smalltalk team , he gave up most of his involvement in it by the time Smalltalk - 80 was in development .
This is the version that ultimately was released to the public .
“ The professionals ” , as Kay put it , took over and so some of the vision was lost .
They turned the Smalltalk language into something that was friendly to them , not beginners .
Closures are something that anyone new to a dynamic OO language has had to learn about .
They ’re pretty painless to use in Smalltalk , in my opinion .
They ’re easy to create .
Contrast this with closures in Java .
Bloch referenced a post written by blogger Mark Mahieu , where he got some of the examples .
Here are a couple of them , with equivalents in Smalltalk for clarity .
Java example # 1 : static < A1 , A2 , R > { A1 => { A2 => R}} curry ( { A1 , A2 => R} fn ) { return { A1 a 1 => { A2 a 2 => fn.invoke ( a1 , a2 ) }} ; } Smalltalk equivalent : curry := [ : fn | [ : a1 | [ : a2 | fn value : a 1 value : a 2 ] ] ]
Java example # 2 : static < A1 , A2 , A3 , R > { A2 , A3 => R} partial ( {A1 , A2 , A3 => R} fn , A1 a 1 ) { return { A2 a2 , A3 a 3 => fn.invoke ( a1 , a2 , a3 ) } ; } Smalltalk equivalent : partial := [ : fn :a1 | [ : a2 :a3 | fn value : a 1 value : a 2 value : a 3 ] ]
This is what I meant about “ hoops ” .
The type information you have to supply for the Java closures detracts from the clarity of the code .
It ’s clunky .
That ’s for sure .
I ’m not going to say anything about these structures ( “ curry ” and “ partial ” ) right now .
If readers would like , I can write a post just on them , explaining how they work , and how they can be useful .
Bloch ’s proposal
Bloch put forward a proposal , that rather than adding closures to the language , at least in the near future , that Java designers instead focus on creating concise structures ( ie. add features ) that implicitly create anonymous classes , to eliminate the verbosity ( I guess this was his answer to the challenge of concurrency ) , handle resource allocation , and critical sections for threading .
Basically it sounded like he favored the stylistic approaches that Microsoft has taken with .
Net , with some differences .
He rejected out of hand the idea of adding library - defined control structures to the language , something made possible by closures , because it will encourage dialects .
Squeak has a lot of library - defined control structures .
I think they work quite well .
They do n’t change the fundamental rules of the language .
Instead they expand its “ vocabulary ” .
That is , they expand upon what you can do using the language ’s existing structures .
I understand this is hard to imagine in the context of Java , because most programmers are used to the idea that control structures are invariants in the language .
Bloch would probably feel uncomfortable with this concept , but ask yourself which language is getting more cumbersome and complicated as time passes ?
I think there is a fundamental contradiction in goals between what Bloch says he prefers about Java , and the growing problems of computing .
He says that adding features to a language increases its complexity , and he makes a good case for that .
Yet , how is Java going to solve new problems in the future ?
His answer is to add more features to the language .
Granted they ’re focused , and not open - ended to allow further expansion , but they ’re still feature additions all the same .
As is illustrated by Squeak , library - defined structures would actually help reduce the number of features in the language .
Even though Squeak can do more things concisely than Java can , the feature set of the language is very small .
As a point of comparison , Lisp ’s language feature set is even smaller , yet it ’s more capable of handling complex problems than Java .
They accomplish this by taking what Java does as a built - in feature , and use message - passing ( Squeak ) , closures ( Squeak , Lisp , others ) , an extensive meta system ( Squeak , Lisp , others ) , named functions ( Lisp , Scheme ) , and macros ( Lisp ) instead .
Where Java sits
I agree with Bloch that if the intention of Java was to be a language that is “ practical ” ( ie. is designed from the standpoint of instrumental reasoning ) , easy enough to use so “ you can just code ” , and does n’t strain the ability of Java programmers to understand their code , then generics should ’ve been scaled back , closures should n’t be added , and his suggestions for expansion should be considered .
Unfortunately this also means that it ’s going to get harder and harder to work with Java as time passes , because the demands placed on it will exceed its ability to deal with them .
Maybe at that point people will pursue another “ escape hatch ” .
Struggling to transcend Java
I compliment the Java community on its efforts to build something better out of a limited platform .
What some are trying out is the idea of a VM of VMs .
That is , building a VM on top of the JVM .
This creates a common computing environment that enables some interoperability between different computing models , while at the same time transcending some of the limitations of the JVM .
From what I hear , it sounds like it ’s been a struggle .
Personally I think it would be wiser for the industry to start with something better–a “ theoretical ” language / VM–and then try to build on top of that .
Our computing culture has a lot of resistance to this idea .
Even the efforts of groups to build better language / VM architectures on top of the JVM seem to be regarded as curiosities by most practitioners .
They get talked about , and get used by a relative few who recognize their power for real projects , but they ’re ultimately dismissed by most developers as “ impractical ” for one reason or another .
It ’s funny .
Several years ago I talked with a friend about how slow Java was .
His solution was to “ throw more hardware at it ” then .
Some months back I told him about Groovy .
He read up on it and dismissed it as too slow .
Why not just “ throw more hardware at it ” ?
I did n’t hear that recommendation from him .
I did n’t press the case for it , because I did n’t have a dog in the fight .
I ’m not part of the Java community .
I figured if he did n’t want to pursue it , he either had a good reason for it , or it was just his loss .
My inclination is to believe the latter .
I guess by and large there ’s not enough pain yet to motivate people to reach for something better .

As if you did n't have enough to worry about , now there 's the superbug to contend with .
No , it 's not a giant mantis bent on world conquest .
The superbug is a bacterium with a familiar name -- staph .
And although this tiny invader does n't possess 8 - foot - long pincers like a giant mantis , it 's just as deadly .
What 's worse , although we could probably take down a giant mantis with bullets -- or possibly rockets -- the superbug becomes harder to kill with each passing day .
It 's also getting easier for the bug to kill us .
In 2005 , 19,000 people died from MRSA infections in the United States , and an average of 6.3 out of every 100,000 infections resulted in death [ source : JAMA ] .
That 's more than the number of people who died of AIDS complications in the same year .
In the United Kingdom , cases of MRSA increased from 210 cases in 1993 to 5,300 in 2002 [ source : University of Warwick ] .

Methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or MRSA ( the superbug ) , was first noticed by physicians in the 1970s .
The medical establishment kept an eye on the bug but found it could be killed by a round or two of traditional antibiotics .
However , things have changed .
Because of improperly taken prescriptions , as well as the presence of antibiotics in our food and water , this staph bug mutated and evolved into the superbug .
Due to survival of the fittest , those strains that had lived through an assault of antibiotics went on to breed replicas of themselves .
This natural selection eventually led to staph strains that are resistant to these antibodies .
Natural selection is a process of evolution by which those members of a species who live through catastrophe are thought to possess traits that help them survive .
Through the survival of those members , these traits -- such as resistance to a disease -- pass from generation to generation .
It 's the reason you have an opposable thumb :
As apes diverged genetically from Old World monkeys 6 to 8 million years ago , one of the results was the opposable thumb .
As the thumb showed itself as a " handy " trait , it developed along with the primate family , which includes humans .
The results are the human - dominated world we live in today -- thanks , in part , to our opposable thumbs .
The process of natural selection can takes tens ( and in some cases , hundreds ) of thousands of years to take place in humans .
But this is n't the case for MRSA and some other bugs .
As the Mayo Clinic put it , MRSA and other bacteria " live on an evolutionary fast track " [ source : Mayo Clinic ] .
Rather than taking thousands of years to develop into their current lethal strain , MRSA has evolved -- and spread -- in mere decades .
In 1974 , MRSA infections made up two percent of all staph infections .
By 2004 , MRSA accounted for 63 percent [ source : CDC ] .
What 's worse is that this bug has been shown to be fatal in some cases , especially when it remains untreated .
One of the reasons for this is the bacteria 's rapidly developing resistance to antibiotics .
As its name implies , it 's been resistant to Methicillin -- a penicillin - based antibiotic -- for some time now .
But it 's also showing resistance to other antibiotics , as well , and that has some physicians worried .
MRSA can also be easily transferred from person to person , and two types of the bug have developed based on the setting where infection takes place .
So what exactly is this superbug , and just how do we fight it ?
In this article , we 'll look at MRSA , and what -- if anything -- we can do to defeat it .
One pretty well - know idiom in Ruby , and Facets , is Symbol.to_proc .
It lets you turn these :
[ 1 , 2 , 3 ] .map { |num| num.next } # = > [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] %w [ alpha beta gamma ].map { | word| word.upcase } # => [ " ALPHA " , " BETA " , " GAMMA " ]
… into these :
[ 1 , 2 , 3 ] .map ( &: next ) %w[ alpha beta gamma ] .map(&: upcase )
It ’s a nice little trick , though it ’s not to everyone ’s taste .
If you ’re already comfortable with Symbol. to_proc , you can skip down to the Class . to_proc section .
But if you ’re not , it ’s worth a minute of your attention to learn it .
Read on …
How it ’s done
When a method takes a block , you can call yield , to run the block .
def with_a_block ( a_param ) yield end with_a_block ( ' param ' ) { puts ' in the block ' }
Or , you can name the block as the last parameter to the method , and put an ampersand in front of it .
The ampersand makes ruby convert the block to a procedure , by calling to_proc on it .
( So any object with a to_proc method can work this way , if you want . )
This example works just like the last one :
def named_block ( a_param , &blk ) blk.call end named_block ( ' my_param ') { puts ' in the named block ' }
Symbol ’s to_proc method creates a procedure that takes one argument , and sends the symbol to it .
Sending a symbol to an object is the same as calling a method on it : object. send ( : method ) works the same as object .
method .
In the earlier upcase example , each word is passed to a procedure that calls upcase on it , giving us a list of uppercased strings .
&:upcase # becomes ... lambda { |obj| obj.send( : upcase ) } # or ... lambda { |obj| obj.upcase }
Class.to_proc
So Symbol.to_proc creates a function that takes an argument , and calls that method on it .
Class.
to_proc creates a function that passes its argument to its constructor , yielding an instance of itself .
This is a welcome addition to the to_proc family .
require ' facets ' class Person def initialize ( name ) @name = name end end names = % w [ mickey minney goofy ] characters = names.map( & Person ) puts characters.inspect & Person # becomes ... lambda { |obj| Person.new ( obj ) }
Why it ’s nice
It ’s fewer characters — it semantically compresses your code .
It lets you think , makes you think , on a higher level .
You think about operations on your data , rather than handling one item at a time .
It raises your level of thinking .
you think , on a higher level .
You think about operations on your data , rather than handling one item at a time .
It raises your level of thinking .
It works with first - class functions , which are worth understanding .
They give you new ways to elegantly solve some problems ( well , new to some audiences ) .
They ’re not fringe anymore — they ’ve been in C# since v2.0 .
( Mental Floss ) -- 1 . How the Slinky got stuck between a cult and a mid-life crisis
Hasbros held a 50th birthday party for Mr. Potato Head in 2002 .
In 1943 , Richard James , a naval engineer , invented the Slinky .
A spring fell off of his workbench and began to " walk " across the floor .
He figured he could make a toy out of it ; his wife Betty agreed and she came up with the name Slinky .
Introduced in 1945 , Slinky sales soared ( say that three times fast ) , but Richard James grew bored .
Despite his success , by 1960 Richard James was suffering from a serious mid-life crisis .
But instead of falling for fast cars , dyed hair and liposuction , Richard James went a different route , and became involved with a Bolivian religious cult .
He gave generously to the religious order and left his wife , six children and the company to move to Bolivia .
Stuck with the debts left by her husband and a company that desperately needed her leadership , Betty James took over as the head of James Industries .
A marketing savant , Betty James was responsible for additions to the Slinky line including Slinky Jr. , Plastic Slinky , Slinky Dog , Slinky Pets , Crazy Slinky Eyes and Neon Slinky .
It was great for boys and girls around the world that Betty James did n't suffer a midlife crisis .
In 2001 , she was inducted into the Toy Industry Hall of Fame , and perhaps even more laudably , her Slinky dog was forever immortalized in Disney 's Toy Story movies .
2 . Why the guy behind the Erector Set Saved Christmas
Because of the market pressures of World War I , the United States Council of National Defense was considering a ban on toy manufacturing .
Amazingly , one man 's impassioned speech successfully stopped that from happening .
Alfred Carlton Gilbert was known as " Man Who Saved Christmas . "
( There 's even a movie starring Jason Alexander in the title role . )
But Gilbert was more than just a gifted orator , he was truly a renaissance man .
He was an amateur magician , a trained doctor , an Olympic Gold Medallist ( in the pole vault ) , a famous toy inventor and Co-Founder of the Toy Manufacturers of America .
Most famously , however , he was the man behind the Erector Set .
Introduced in 1913 with the catchy name The Mysto Erector Structural Steel Builder , the toy was based on Gilbert 's observation of how power line towers were constructed .
The quickly retitled Erector Sets sold well and were limited only by a child 's imagination as to what could be built .
But " The Man Who Saved Christmas " ( who also held over 150 patents ) was n't a one - trick pony .
His other inventions included model trains , glass blowing kits ( think about the liability today ! ) , chemistry sets ( one chemistry set was even designed specifically for girls ) and in 1951 ( during the cold war ) he even introduced a miniature Atomic Energy Lab with three very low - level radioactive sources and a real working Geiger counter .
Now there 's a toy even a real patriot could love .
3 . Why Lincoln Logs are the most deceptively named toys in the business
Standing beside his father , Frank Lloyd Wright and watching the construction of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo , John Lloyd Wright was inspired .
Interlocking beams in the hotel 's basement were designed to handle the little " earthquake problem " that the hotel could encounter .
John Lloyd thought , " what if children had a toy version of those beams , shaped like notched tree trunks to build little log homes " ?
The architect 's son followed through on his inspiration and the John Lloyd Wright Company manufactured and sold Lincoln Logs from the Merchandise Mart in Chicago .
The sets even came with instructions on how to build Uncle Tom 's Cabin as well as Abe Lincoln 's log cabin .
Introduced in 1916 , the Lincoln Log construction and figure sets came in two sizes available for $ 2 or $ 3 dollars .
But here 's the strangest part : the naming of the toy was n't a tribute to Honest Abe .
It 's a homage to his father .
Here 's the scoop : Frank Lloyd Wright was born Frank Lincoln
Wright , but he legally changed his name when his parents split .
So , Lloyd Jones was his mother 's maiden name and Frank 's name change was to honor her .
In any case , whichever Lincoln the toy was honoring , we 're pretty sure Honest Abe would have gotten a kick out of the little logs .
4. Captain Kangaroo saved Play - Doh
Back before it was Play - Doh , everyone 's favorite squishy clay was actually a wallpaper cleaner used to clean soot off of walls .
But when people switched from using coal burning furnaces to oil fueled ones in the ' 40s and ' 50s , demand for the product evaporated .
Kutol , a manufacturing company in Cincinnati , was watching their sales dwindle when the son of the company 's founder , Joe McVicker , started looking for ways to turn the business round .
His sister - in - law Kay Zufall suggested using the wallpaper cleaner as a child 's craft item , and McVicker was willing to try anything .
He formed a new division , Rainbow Crafts , and began selling the re-branded product as Play - Doh .
Sales were okay , but then McVicker came up with a way to sell a whole lot more .
He contacted Captain Kangaroo ( A.K.A. Bob Keeshan ) and offered him 2 % of sales if the good Captain would feature Play - Doh on his show .
He did .
Ding Dong School and Romper Room soon followed suit , hawking the crafty compound to kiddies everywhere and Kutol made plenty of Doh ( er , Dough ) in the process .
While the company has changed hands a few times since ( Rainbow Crafts was purchased by Kenner Toys and Kenner was purchased by Hasbro ) that 's hardly impeded sales .
More than two billion cans of Play - Doh have been sold since 1955 .
5. Etch -a-Sketch used to be played like an Atari
Believe it or not , the original Etch - A - Sketch was operated with a joystick .
It 's true .
The invention was the brainchild of Andre Cassagnes , a French electrician tinkering in his garage .
Conceived in 1950 , the drawing toy made use of a joystick , glass and aluminum powder .
Dubbed the Telecran , the toy was renamed L'Ecran Magique , and made its debut at a European Toy Fair in 1959 .
Fascinated by the invention , American Henry Winzeler , founder and president of the Ohio Art Toy Company , licensed L'Ecran Magique and introduced it to America in 1960 .
Amongst Winzeler 's innovations were replacing the joystick with two white knobs in the left and right corners of the screen .
The idea was to make the toy look like the hot new adult toy ... television .
As for how the knobs work , the two Etch - A - Sketch handles control a stylus that 's attached to strings .
The stylus is designed to move up and down and left and right " etching " an image in the Aluminum powder that clings to the glass with static electricity .
Amazingly , clever Etch - A - Sketch artists can maneuver the stylus to make what looks like curves and angles creating some spectacular pictures .
In fact , the Ohio Art Etch - A - Sketch Gallery actually contains a " Hall of Fame . "
6. Why Trivial Pursuit Almost Never Happened
In 1979 , Canadians Chris Haney and Scott Abbott ( along with business partners Ed Werner and John Haney ) decided to create a game that combined their love of all things trivia and their basic competitive nature .
Their company , Horn - Abbott , funded the initial production run of 1,000 pieces and sold them to retailers for $ 15.00 in 1981 .
At the time , $ 15.00 was by far the most expensive wholesale price for a board game .
But a downright bargain when you consider the first pieces cost $ 75.00 each to manufacture .
To the retailer 's surprise the game was a hit even at the heady price of $ 30.00 at retail .
Realizing that they lacked the funding to bring the game to its full potential , Horn - Abbott licensed Trivial Pursuit to Canadian game manufacturer Chieftain Products .
Chieftain had a major hit in Canada in 1981 and contacted their American partner Selchow and Righter .
Amazingly , Selchow and Righter analyzed the game and found that it was : a ) too expensive to manufacture , b ) it took over an hour to play , c ) the best players had to have impressive knowledge of trivial subjects and d ) they assumed adults did n't play board games .
Selchow and Righter passed , but Chieftain was persistent and in 1982 the game was introduced to America at the New York Toy Fair .
Initial sales were worrisome .
However , through a solid PR campaign and great word of mouth , sales skyrocketed .
Sales peaked in 1984 at 20,000,000 games in North America alone .
It was the best of times and the worst of times for Selchow and Righter because in 1986 , facing huge debt brought on by an abundance of inventory , Selchow and Righter was sold to Coleco .
In 1989 , Coleco filed for bankruptcy and the rights to Trivial Pursuit were acquired by Parker Brothers .
Today Chris Haney and Scott Abbott 's little game has been made into over 30 " Editions . "
It 's available in 26 countries , been translated into 17 different languages and has sold approximately 100,000,000 copies since its inception .
Not bad for a game that almost was n't .
7. How Mr. Potato Head became a political activist
Two very special things about Mr. Potato Head : 1 ) he was the first toy to be advertised on television , and 2 ) he was the first toy that featured real produce .
That 's right the original toy came as a collection of eyes , ears , noses , a body and accessories that you'd " force " into a real potato .
To be fair to Hasbro , Mr. Potato Head 's creator , did include a styrofoam " potato " but it was n't much fun .
In 1964 a molded plastic potato body became part of the toy .
But back then , Mr. Potato Head also had friends including Carrots , Cucumbers , Oranges , Peppers and a love interest , Mrs. Potato Head .
With Brother Spud and Sister Yam there was an entire Potato Head family , and all of the packaging carried the slogan " Lifelike Fruits Or Vegetables To Change Into Funny , Lovable Friends . "
What 's most amazing , however , is that Mr. Potato Head 's appeal has garnered him many " spokespud " gigs .
In the American Cancer Society 's annual " Great American Smokeout " campaign he handed his pipe to then Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and swore off the tobacco , he got up off the couch for the President 's Council on Physical Fitness , and he even pitched in with the League of Women Voters for their " Get Out the Vote " initiative .
Of course , he 's been involved in plenty of straight marketing campaigns , too : in 1997 , he shilled for Burger King 's " Try the Fry " introduction of their new French fries .
That said , our favorite thing about the spud is the sort of celebrity pull he has .
After all , what other toy can claim they were voiced by Don Rickles ?

Military prosecutors are in the final phases of preparing the first sweeping case against suspected conspirators in the plot that led to the deaths of nearly 3,000 Americans on Sept. 11 , 2001 , and drew the United States into war , people who have been briefed on the case said .
The charges , to be filed in the military commission system at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , would involve as many as six detainees held at the detention camp , including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , the former senior aide to Osama bin Laden , who has said he was the principal planner of the plot .
The case could begin to fulfill a longtime goal of the Bush administration : establishing culpability for the terrorist attacks of 2001 .
It could also help the administration make its case that some detainees at Guantánamo , where 275 men remain , would pose a threat if they are not held at Guantánamo or elsewhere .
Officials have long said that a half - dozen men held at Guantánamo played essential roles in the plot directed by Mr. Mohammed , from would - be hijackers to financiers .
But the case would also bring new scrutiny to the military commission system , which has a troubled history and has been criticized as a system designed to win convictions but that does not provide the legal protections of American civilian courts .
I 've been accused of refusing to review Ben Stein 's documentary " Expelled , " a defense of Creationism , because of my belief in the theory of evolution .
Here is my response .
Ben Stein , you hosted a TV show on which you gave away money .
Imagine that I have created a special edition of " Who Wants to be a Millionaire " just for you .
Ben , you 've answered all the earlier questions correctly , and now you 're up for the $ 1 million prize .
It involves an explanation for the evolution of life on this planet .
You have already exercised your option to throw away two of the wrong answers .
Now you are faced with two choices : ( A ) Darwin's Theory of Evolution , or ( B ) Intelligent Design .
Because this is a special edition of the program , you can use a Hotline to telephone every scientist on Earth who has an opinion on this question .
You discover that 99.975 of them agree on the answer ( A ) .
A million bucks hangs in the balance .
The clock is ticking .
You could use the money .
Which do you choose ?
You , a firm believer in the Constitution , are not intimidated and exercise your freedom of speech .
You choose ( B ) .
Squaaawk !!!
The klaxon horn sounds .
You have lost .
Outraged , you file suit against the program , charging it is biased and has denied a hearing for your belief .
Your suit argues that the " correct " answer was chosen because of a prejudice against the theory of Intelligent Design , despite the fact that .025 of all scientists support it .
You call for ( B ) to be discussed in schools as an alternative theory to ( A ) .
Your rights have been violated .
You 're at wit 's end .
You think perhaps the field of Indie Documentaries offers you hope .
You accept a position at the Institute of Undocumented Documentaries in Dallas , Texas .
This Institute teaches that the rules of the " $ 64,000 Question " are the only valid game show rules .
All later game shows must follow them literally .
The " $ 64,000 Question " came into existence in 1955 .
False evidence for earlier game shows has been refuted by scientists at the Institute .
You look for a documentary subject .
You know you cannot hope to find backing from the Main Stream Media , because they all fear reprisals from the powerful Game Show Establishment .
You seek a cause that parallels your own dilemma , and also illustrates an offense against the Freedom of Speech .
Your attention falls on the persecution of Intelligent Design advocates like you , who have been banished from Main Stream Academia .
This looks like your ideal subject .
But where can you find financing for such a documentary ?
You discover a small , promising production company named Premise Media .
You like the sound of that word premise .
It sounds like a plausible alternative to the word theory .
To confirm this , you look both up in your dictionary :
premise noun .
A previous statement or proposition from which another is inferred or follows as a conclusion : if the premise is true , then the conclusion must be true .
e.g. , if God exists , then he created everything .
theory noun .
A system of ideas intended to explain something , esp. one based on general principles independent of the thing to be explained .
e.g. , Darwin 's theory of evolution .
Your point exactly !
You do a web search for Premise Media .
Its co-founder , Walt Ruloff , has observed , " the scientific and academic communities were deeply resistant to innovation , in this case innovation that might revise Darwin 's theory that random mutation and natural selection drive all variation in life forms . "
You could not agree more .
Darwin's theory has been around for 150 years , and is stubbornly entrenched .
This is a time for innovation , for drawing on fresh theories that life and the universe were intelligently created in recent times , perhaps within the last 10,000 years .
How to account for dinosaur fossils ?
Obviously , dinosaurs walked the earth at the same time as human beings .
Ben Stein , you are growing more excited .
You continue your research into Premise Media .
Its CEO , A. Logan Craft , once observed that questions about the origin of Earth and its life forms " are answered very differently by secularists and people who hold religious beliefs . "
Can you believe your eyes ?
Craft has depended upon one of your own favorite logical practices , the principle of the excluded middle !
This is too good to be true .
By his premise no secularists believe in Intelligent Design , and no people with religious beliefs subscribe to Darwin 's theory .
If there are people with religious beliefs who agree with Darwin ( Catholics , Jews , Protestants , Mormons , Hindus , Muslims and Buddhists , for example ) they are mistaken because they do not subscribe to A. Logan Craft 's religious beliefs .
He is certainly right about secularists .
You think it 's a shame he 's right , because then the 1968 Supreme Court decision was correct , and Tennessee 's anti-evolution law was " an attempt to blot out a particular theory because of its supposed conflict with the Biblical account , taken literally . "
Therefore , according to the Court , ID was a religious belief and did not belong in a science classroom but in a theology classroom .
This clearly would be wrong , because the new approach to teaching ID in schools omits any reference whatsoever to religion .
It depends entirely on the findings of scientists who are well - respected within A. Logan Craft 's religious tradition .
These scientists of course are perfectly free to be secularists , although almost every single one seems to be a fundamentalist Christian .
This is America .
You meet with the people at Premise Media .
It is a meeting of the minds .
At a pitch meeting , they are receptive to your ideas , although with the proviso that you should change the proposed title of your film , " From Darwin to Hitler , " because that might limit the market to those who had heard of neither , or only one .
You and Premise Media agreed that the case for ID had not always been argued very well in the past .
For example , a photograph of a human footprint overlapping a dinosaur track ( proof that Man walked the Earth side by side with dinosaurs ) has been questioned by secularists , who say the footprint looks more like the print of a running shoe .
If you studied it carefully , it could be argued that they had a point , although skewed by their secularist bias .
What was needed was better use of photographic evidence .
For example , in your film , " eXpelled : no intelligence allowed , " you document the story of Guillermo Gonzales , who was denied tenure at Iowa State because of his personal premises , after 400 professors signed a petition opposing " all attempts to represent Intelligent Design as a scientific endeavor . "
Gonzales was forced to accept employment at Grove City College , an evangelical Christian school in Grove City , Pennsylvania .
In documenting the secularist hysteria and outrage against Gonzales , you use more convincing photographic evidence than the footprint .
For example , you use footage showing a newsstand selling copies of the New York Post with this front page headline :
CRISIS : 1 . Creationist on the loose 2 . Support the Petition 3 . Stop Gonzales
The typographical design of the New York Post logo , the cars and store signs in the background , and the clothing of the people in the street establish without question that this footage was filmed in the late 1940s .
Gonzales was born in 1963 .
So your film would prove beyond doubt that his enemies walked the Earth with his parents .
Gonzales , trained as an astronomer , cited as proof of Intelligent Design that " Earth is in a prime location for observing the universe . "
Thus he refutes the theory of elitist secularist academia that the universe " does not have an edge nor center , just as the Earth 's surface does not have an edge or center . "
Since all you have to do is look up at the sky to realize that the whole universe is right up there to be seen , the secularists fly in the face of common sense .
Yet for stating such an obvious premise , Gonzales was opposed for tenure at Iowa State .
That hit home , Ben Stein .
He was a victim like you .
You release your film " eXpelled .
" As you fully expect from all your experience , it is rejected almost unanimously by the MSM .
It receives an 8 % rating on the TomatoMeter , earning it a place on the list of the worst - reviewed films of all time .
In a review not catalogued by Tomatoes , ChristianAnwers.net writes that your film " has made Ben Stein the new hero of believers in God everywhere , and has landed a smart right cross to the protruding jaw of evolution 's elite . "
Again , the useful excluded middle .
Those for whom Ben Stein is not a hero are not believers in God .
It also follows that the phrase " believers in God everywhere " does not extend to believers in God who agree with Darwin .
So ChristanAnswers has excluded two middles at one fell stroke .
Let 's hope that word does n't get back to the bosses of the critic named " Yo " at hollywoodjesus.com .
Yo takes a chance by saying :
This creator could have been anything of intelligence , including aliens .
Intelligent Design is a scientific movement , not a religious one , a fact stated more than once in interviews in this film .
Unfortunately , those statements are constantly ignored as ' Expelled ' continually brings up the question of God 's existence and thereby equates the movement with a belief in God .
And right there , Ben Stein , we can clearly see Yo's error .
He has included the middle .
Here is Stein 's most urgent question : " How does something that is not life turn into something that is ? "
Stein poses this stumper to a jolly British professor who seems direct from Monty Python .
He thinks there 's a " very good chance " that life might have started with molecules on crystals , which have a tendency to mutate .
Cut to a shot of a turbaned crystal - ball gazer .
Stein dubs them " joy riding crystals . "
He wonders what the odds would be of life starting that way .
" You would have to have a minimum of 250 proteins to provide minimal life functions , " an ID defender explains .
We see an animated cartoon of the Darwinian scientist Richard Dawkins pulling at a slot machine and lining up -- three in a row !
Not so fast there , " Lucky " Dawkins !
The camera pulls back to show one - armed bandits stretching into infinity .
To win , he'd have to hit the jackpot about a gazillion times in a row .
An Intelligent Design advocate estimates a streak like that would take a trillion , trillion , trillion tries .
( That number is a fair piece larger than 3 trillion . )
Quite a joy ride .
ID 's argument against the crystal theory seems like a new version of its classic argument , " How could an eye evolve without knowing there was anything to see ? "
Very easily , apparently , because various forms of eyes have evolved 26 different times that scientists know about , and they can explain how it happened .
So can I .
So can you if you understand Darwinian principles .
Anyway , the slot machine conundrum is based on an ignorance of both math and gambling .
From math we know that the odds of winning a coin toss are exactly the same every time .
The coin does n't remember the last try .
Hey , sometimes you get lucky .
That 's why casinos stay in business .
The odds of winning on a single number at roulette are 37 to 1 .
The odds of winning a second time in a row are also 37 to 1 , because the table does n't know who you are .
Every single winning roll beats the odds of 37 - to - 1 .
And on and on .
The more times in a row you win , the more times you face 37 - 1 against you .
If Russian Roulette were played with a gun containing 37 bullets and one empty chamber , it would quickly lose most of its allure -- by a process explained , oddly enough , by Darwin .
Still , in July 1891 at Monte Carlo , the same man broke the 100,000 franc bank at a roulette table three times .
Wikipedia reports , " A man named Charles Wells won 23 times out of 30 successive spins of the wheel ... Despite hiring private detectives the Casino never discovered Wells 's system .
Wells later admitted it was just a lucky streak .
His system was the high - risk martingale , doubling the stake to make up losses . "
The odds against Wells doing that are pretty high .
But as every gambler knows , sometimes you do actually hit a number .
You do n't have to do it a trillion trillion trillion times to be a winner .
You only have to do it once .
This is explained by Darwin .
If you are playing at a table with other gamblers and you win $ 100 and none of them do , you are just that much better able to outlast them as competitors .
When the casino closes , one person at that table must have won more than any of the others .
That 's why casinos never close .
Of course if you gamble long enough , you will eventually lose back more than the others .
Your poor spouse tells you this .
You know it is true .
But tonight you feel lucky .
If you leave the table still holding your pot , you could become as rich as Warren Buffet .
Somebody has to .
Look at Warren Buffet .
Evolution involves holding onto your winnings and investing them wisely .
You do n't even have to know to how to hold onto your winnings .
Evolution does it for you ; it is the bank in which useful genetic mutations deposit themselves .
There is a very slow rate of return , but it 's compounded .
At the end of one eon , you get your bank statement and find your pittance has grown into an orang utan .
At the end of the next eon , it has grown into Charles Darwin .
Scientists , at least 99.875 percent of them , believe that in the long run only useful mutations deposit in this bank .
Those mutations with no use , or a negative effect , squander their savings in a long - running bunko game , and die forgotten in the gutter .
The assumption of " Expelled " is that no one could possibly explain how Prof.
Monty Python 's molecules and their joy - riding crystals could possibly produce life .
As luck would have it , at about the same time as the film was being made , teams of scientists at the universities of Oregon and North Carolina explained it .
They " determined for the first time the atomic structure of an ancient protein , revealing in unprecedented detail how genes evolved their functions . "
" This is the ultimate level of detail , " said the evolutionary biologist Joe Thornton .
" We were able to see exactly how evolution tinkered with the ancient structure to produce a new function that is crucial to our own bodies today .
Nobody 's ever done that before . "
Unfortunately , this momentous discovery was announced almost too late to be mentioned in Ben Stein 's film .
It was n't totally too late , but it would have been a great inconvenience for the editor .
What tools did the scientists use ?
Supercomputer programs and , I quote , " ultra - high energy X - rays from a stadium - sized Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago to chart the precise position of each of the 2,000 atoms in the ancient proteins . "
What did you expect ?
They put a molecule under a microscope and picked off bits with their tweezers ?
Intelligent Design " scientists " in " Expelled " are offended by being called ignorant .
When Stein points out that " Catholics and mainstream Protestant groups " have no problem with the theory of Evolution , he is informed by an ID advocate , " liberal Christians side with anybody against Creationists . "
Now we have the smoking gun .
It is the word liberal .
What is the word liberal doing here ?
The Theory of Evolution is neither liberal nor conservative .
It is simply provable or not .
Besides , I would not describe the Vatican as liberal .
Look how cautiously it approached Galileo .
He only claimed the earth revolved around the sun .
No big deal like the earth being ideally placed in the universe .
There are millions of conservative scientists , and only a tiny handful disagree with evolution , because rejecting scientific proof is not permissive conservative behavior .
In that one use of the word " liberal " the Creationist religious agenda is peeking through .
I would translate it as " evolutionists side with anybody against a cherished Evangelical belief . "
Why are they always trying to push evolutionists over the edge , when they 're the ones clinging by their fingernails ?
Scientists deserving of the name would share the delight of 99.975 percent of his or her colleagues after learning of the Oregon - North Carolina findings .
Then , if they found a plausible reason to doubt them , they would go right to work hoping to win fame by disproving them .
A theory , like a molecule , a sea slug and a polar bear , has to fight it out in the survival of the fittest .
" Expelled " is not a bad film from the technical point of view .
It is well photographed and edited , sometimes amusing , has well - chosen talking heads , gives an airing to evolutionists however truncated and interrupted with belittling images , and incorporates entertainingly unfair historical footage , as when it compares academia 's rejection of Creationism to the erection of the Berlin Wall .
Hilariously , the film argues that evolutionists cannot tolerate dissent .
If you were to stand up at a " Catholic and mainstream Protestant " debate and express your support of Creationism , you would in most cases be politely listened to .
There are few places as liberal as Boulder , Colo. , where I twice debated a Creationist at the Conference on World Affairs , and yet his views were heard politely there .
If you were to stand up at an evangelical meeting to defend evolution , I doubt if you would be made to feel as welcome , or that your dissent would be quite as cheerfully tolerated .
In the film , Ben Stein asks predictable questions , and exploits an unending capacity for counterfeit astonishment .
Example :
Scientist : " But Darwin did not title his book On the Origin of Life .
He titled it , On the Origin of Species . "
Ben Stein ( nods , grateful to learn this ) : " I see ! "
The more you know about evolution , or simple logic , the more you are likely to be appalled by the film .
No one with an ability for critical thinking could watch more than three minutes without becoming aware of its tactics .
It is n't even subtle .
Take its treatment of Dawkins , who throughout his interviews with Stein is honest , plain - spoken , and courteous .
As Stein goes to interview him for the last time , we see a makeup artist carefully patting on rouge and dusting Dawkins ' face .
After he is prepared and composed , after the shine has been taken off his nose , here comes plain , down - to - earth , workaday Ben Stein .
So we get the vain Dawkins with his effete makeup , talking to the ordinary Joe .
I have done television interviews for more than 40 years .
I have been on both ends of the questions .
I have news for you .
Everyone is made up before going on television .
If they are not , they will look like death warmed over .
There is not a person reading this right now who should go on camera without some kind of makeup .
Even the obligatory " shocked neighbors " standing in their front yards after a murder usually have some powder brushed on by the camera person .
Was Ben Stein wearing makeup ?
Of course he was .
Did he whisper to his camera crew to roll while Dawkins was being made up ?
Of course he did .
Otherwise , no camera operator on earth would have taped that .
That incident dramatizes his approach throughout the film .
If you want to study Gotcha !
moments , start here .
That is simply one revealing fragment .
This film is cheerfully ignorant , manipulative , slanted , cherry - picks quotations , draws unwarranted conclusions , makes outrageous juxtapositions ( Soviet marching troops representing opponents of ID ) , pussy - foots around religion ( not a single identified believer among the ID people ) , segues between quotes that are not about the same thing , tells bald - faced lies , and makes a completely baseless association between freedom of speech and freedom to teach religion in a university class that is not about religion .
And there is worse , much worse .
Toward the end of the film , we find that Stein actually did want to title it " From Darwin to Hitler . "
He finds a Creationist who informs him , " Darwinism inspired and advanced Nazism . "
He refers to advocates of eugenics as liberal .
I would not call Hitler liberal .
Arbitrary forced sterilization in our country has been promoted mostly by racists , who curiously found many times more blacks than whites suitable for such treatment .
SANTA CRUZ , Bolivia —
The appearance of a Star of David on new national identity cards has alarmed opponents of President Evo Morales , who recall how the symbol was used to brand Jews in Nazi Germany .
Tiny six - pointed stars within a tight circle are printed on the back side of some , but not all , recently issued picture IDs in the Santa Cruz region .
The mark was present on three cards seen by The Washington Times .
“ It raises suspicions that the government is identifying individuals or segments of the population along racial , religious or ideological lines ” said Carlos Klinsky , a member of Bolivia ’s parliament from Santa Cruz , where the new ID cards have recently appeared .
What puzzles Mr. Klinsky and others is that the marked ID cards do not appear to target people who are Jewish or have Jewish ancestry .
Mr. Klinsky , a member of the political opposition to Mr. Morales ’ leftist government , suspects — but is unable to prove — that the motive is political .
Mr. Klinsky has sent letters to national authorities , requesting explanations for the symbol , which began appearing last year on identity cards issued in the Santa Cruz area as part of a newly computerized national identification system .
He has yet to receive a reply .
Santa Cruz is the center of Bolivia ’s eastern lowlands , the economic heart of Bolivia and the base of widespread opposition to moves by Mr. Morales to nationalize key industries and redistribute wealth to his supporters in the western Andean highlands .
Mr. Klinsky attempted to hold public hearings on the new identity cards , but the police refused to testify .
Col .
Ruben Camacho , the director in Santa Cruz for the national identification system , told The Times that the symbol means “ nothing bad . ”
He said that it was stamped as a “ security feature ” on some cards by a subordinate to safeguard against duplication and counterfeiting .
Another official , Lt. Col. Lily Cortez , has said that she fashioned the logo from a Star of David necklace inherited from her grandmother and that the name Katerine inscribed above the star is that of her 14 - year - old daughter .
A leader of the Santa Cruz Youth Union , who shows the name Chio by the star on his card , says that the police explanation is “ inconsistent ” because different words appear above the star on other cards .
The Times has seen other variations including the word “ Chiquita ” above the star .
The term in Spanish usually refers to a small girl .
The president of the Jewish community and Israel ’s honorary consul in Santa Cruz , Francisco Hubsch , has been conducting his own investigation .
He thinks that the starred card is circulating too widely for it to involve an anti-Semitic persecution .
But Mr. Klinsky , the opposition lawmaker , did n’t rule out an ethnic connection .
He said he fears the “ fundamentalist influence ” of Iran on Bolivia ’s government , a reference to an influx of Iranian officials connected to numerous joint ventures to develop Bolivia ’s energy reserves .
Moreover , growing tensions between the Santa Cruz region and the central government have taken on an ethnic dimension , pitting a poor and mostly Indian majority in Bolivia ’s Andean highlands against European descendents in the energy - rich eastern lowlands .
Mr. Morales is of Indian background .
Lawyer Hugo Acha said it would be highly irregular for police officials to place personal markings on identity documents .
He thinks that the symbols correspond to a “ code ” for classifying the population , devised by Cuban and Venezuelan advisers , who he thinks are running the new registration system .
“ It ’s a way of marginalizing us ” said opposition newspaper editor Centa Reck when she saw the star on her recently renewed identity document .
The altered IDs have appeared at a time of growing tensions in the run-up to a May 4 vote on whether the Santa Cruz region should declare itself an autonomous zone — effectively breaking most ties with the capital , La Paz .
Officials in Mr. Morales ’ government have called the referendum treasonous .
The Catholic Church and neighboring nations have urged both sides to open negotiations , fearing the showdown could lead to violence .

NEW DELHI , Dec. 3  Toxic chemicals in the water in Punjab , India ’s grain belt , could be causing genetic mutations in the population , a recent study suggests .
Preliminary results say a two - year study commissioned by the Punjab Pollution Control Board found mutated DNA in blood samples of 65 percent of the people tested .
The study also found high levels of arsenic and mercury in the tap water .
Some villages in the landlocked state of Punjab are experiencing high rates of cancer and other diseases .
Scientists and government officials are investigating links between those incidence levels and chemicals used in farming and industry .
The most recent study , conducted by the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research , a school in Punjab , looked at the chemical composition of five drains , the open sewers that handle much of India ’s waste , as well as the chemical pollution of the groundwater in the area and the health of people living near those drains .
Every fall and winter , the number of visitors to the famed Sierra Nevada park drops off , so the reservation system is no longer needed , said Jamie Richards , a Yosemite spokeswoman .
Dems Fear Clinton's ' Tonya Harding ' Option Democratic Party official says Clinton can win but it would be ugly .
March 26 , 2008  --
It is improbable but , yes , still mathematically possible that New York Sen. Hillary Clinton could win the Democratic presidential nomination .
What Democratic officials across the country fear is what Clinton will have to do to party rival Illinois Sen. Barack Obama -- who leads in pledged delegates and the popular vote -- to make that happen .
" I do n't think she has no chance , but the route for her to victory is so bad for the Democratic Party -- it's to damage Obama so much that people feel he's not electable , " said ABC News political contributor Matthew Dowd , a former adviser to President Bush , repeating the sentiments of many in the other party .
One Democratic Party official called Clinton 's strategy " The Tonya Harding Option " -- the idea that Clinton 's only path to the gold medal is to destroy her leading competitor .
After staying away from the controversy involving Obama 's former pastor the Rev. Jeremiah Wright for almost two weeks , Clinton for the first time personally injected him into the race .
" He would not have been my pastor , " Clinton said of Wright during a news conference Tuesday in Greensburg , Pa .
" You do n't choose your family , but you choose what church you want to attend . "
With Obama on vacation and still worried about the Wright controversy , Clinton should be upbeat .
But she has been on the ropes for exaggerating the danger she faced during her 1996 trip to Bosnia -- a story that delighted the Obama campaign , which brazenly pushed it to the media .
It is getting edgy out there ; even Chelsea Clinton is feeling the heat .
After visiting 84 colleges , she was finally asked about the Monica Lewinsky scandal Tuesday at Butler University .
A student asked the former first daughter whether her mother had lost credibility after initially blaming the scandal on a vast right - wing conspiracy .
" Wow , you 're the first person actually that 's ever asked that question in the , I do n't know , maybe , 70 college campuses I 've been to , and I do n't think that is any of your business , " Clinton said to resounding applause .
Without question the attacks are not one - sided .
Obama 's campaign manager came pretty close to calling Clinton a liar the other day on a conference call .
A good lesson for both Democrats , regardless of which one is Harding and which is Nancy Kerrigan -- it was another skater who won the gold .
In this metaphor , presumably , Oksana Baiul would be Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz .

Comuni in Provincia di Milano
La Settimana del Design Pubblico
Agire sulla città , nei suoi spazi , nelle piazze e nelle strade , lavorare nei cosiddetti non luoghi : questo è uno degli obiettivi primari di esterni .
E , sotto il progetto di design pubblico , riunisce attività , progetti , iniziative e idee realizzate negli spazi pubblici , per la città di Milano e d'Italia .
La settimana del design pubblico , a Milano dal 14 al 21 aprile propone idee e progetti concreti scegliendo quest ' anno il tema del cantiere come simbolo della città che cresce , che si espande e che si modifica .
Design pubblico allestisce cantieri per costruire un ' idea nuova di città , per rendere una piazza inospitale un luogo d'incontro , per cambiare abitudini e consuetudini accettate passivamente da tutti .
Cantieri che diventano punti di partenza per una riflessione e riprogettazione degli spazi , suggerendo di fermarsi e di iniziare a costruire rispondendo veramente alle necessità e ai bisogni di tutti .
Un Cantiere che sorgerà in via Mario Pagano , un ostello temporaneo come la Casa dei designer che prenderà vita all ' interno dell ' Aula Magna Carlo De Carli presso il Politecnico di Milano - Campus Bovisa , un esempio di un'ospitalità allargata e alternativa come il bed sharing , un calendario ricco di appuntamenti sono gli elementi , i tasselli che vanno a comporre la settimana del design pubblico , a Milano , dal 14 al 21 aprile .
Il Cantiere
Design pubblico riflette e agisce sulle modalità e le motivazioni con cui si costruisce , e dal 15 al 20 aprile apre un Cantiere per la città .
Il momento dei lavori , da fattore critico e di disagio diventa un'occasione per la città , delineando e offrendo uno spazio fisico e ideale di cui tutti possono servirsi , da cui i cittadini , le istituzioni e le aziende possono prendere spunto ed esempio per costruire , a livello mentale ma anche , metaforicamente , in modo concreto , una città nuova e possibile , fondata sulla partecipazione , sulla collettività , sulla condivisione , sull ' interazione e lo scambio .
nell 'area del parcheggio di via Mario Pagano , angolo via Brulichetti , viene allestito un Cantiere reale nella forma e nell ' aspetto ma ideale nei contenuti .
Un Cantiere che non costruisce edifici o palazzi , ma spazi di relazione e interazione , che trasforma , attraverso semplici ed efficaci interventi , i disagi che spesso accompagnano i lavori , che costruisce un luogo di incontro e confronto sui temi del vivere cittadino .
Oltre alla grande festa di inaugurazione marted ì 15 aprile , ogni giorno appuntamenti speciali con artisti e musicisti , designer e architetti , performer e dj intratterranno il pubblico ; laboratori creativi e incontri per costruire idealmente una nuova idea di città .
E ogni sera , dalle ore 19 in poi , il Cantiere diventa punto di ritrovo per tutti i visitatori del Salone del Mobile e la cittadinanza , fra un aperitivo e un saluto nelle sere d'aprile .
La Casa dei designer
Dal 14 al 21 aprile , con la collaborazione del Politecnico di Milano , all ' interno di Fuorisalone in Bovisa , design pubblico organizza la quarta edizione della Casa dei designer : il progetto di una casa - ostello temporanea con pernottamenti a prezzi contenuti prende forma negli spazi del Campus Bovisa , all ' interno dell ' Aula Magna Carlo De Carli .
Oltre 130 posti letto , una zona comune con cucina , connessione wi-fi , postazioni internet e un'edicola internazionale costituiscono la " parte coperta " della Casa , progettata dal berlinese Tobias Lehmann del gruppo NOHOTEL .
La novità di quest ' anno è la presenza di uno spazio esterno , polifunzionale , che si offre come luogo in cui sviluppare diverse attività durante la settimana .
L'intera area è stata sviluppata e progettata da esterni con Lago Studio e con il collettivo francese EXYZT , che ha allestito il French Pavillon alla scorsa Biennale di Venezia e che durante i giorni di apertura della Casa trasformerà la piazza dell '
Ovale , sviluppando il concetto dell ' interazione in uno spazio in continua evoluzione e cambiamento .
Come una specie di villaggio composto da una serie di postazioni modulari e una torretta di " regia " , lo spazio esterno diverrà una piazza da vivere per gli ospiti della Casa dei designer , per gli studenti del Politecnico e per il popolo del Salone del Mobile .
A partire dal 14 aprile questo spazio ospiterà laboratori , incontri , esposizioni ed esperimenti sociali : famosi designer provenienti da tutto il mondo condurranno laboratori creativi , docenti delle più rinomate università italiane e straniere affronteranno il tema " design pubblico " , illustrando le loro differenti attività , professionisti della creatività incontreranno il pubblico in colazioni mattutine , " Wake up design !
Breakfast get together " , aperte alla partecipazione e al contributo di tutti ( fra gli altri , gli organizzatori dell ' Utrecht Manifest , il gruppo spagnolo Recetas Urbana di Santiago Cirugeda , gli americani Public Architecture e l'olandese Jeanne van Heeswijk ) .
Lo spazio esterno inoltre , darà agli studenti e agli ospiti della Casa dei designer la possibilità di esporre i propri progetti , di barattarli , di presentarli al pubblico e di discuterne con tutti , per un'esperienza formativa e personale senza paragoni .
Il bed sharing
Quando un progetto come la Casa dei designer non riesce più a soddisfare le richieste di ospitalità , quando la città non offre soluzioni alla necessità di una sistemazione abitativa temporanea , design pubblico organizza bed sharing .
Il progetto di ospitalità alternativa , lanciato in occasione dell ' edizione 2007 di design pubblico , vede coinvolte sempre più persone , mettendo in contatto chi cerca e chi offre ospitalità attraverso il portale www.bedsharing.org.
Chiunque abbia un posto letto , un divano comodo , o almeno 2 mq liberi e confortevoli , si iscriva nel Catalogo delle case ospitali , un designer disperato potrebbe esservi grato per tutta la vita .
Per mostrare il lato ospitale di Milano e offrire nuove opportunità di incontro , di socializzazione , di scambio culturale reciproco .
Momenti di festa
Marted ì 15 aprile 2008 , dalle ore 19 - inaugurazione della settimana del design pubblico con l'apertura del Cantiere .
Acrobati , giocolieri , luci , allestimenti spettacolari , musica e danze dei Babbutzi Orkestar faranno da corollario ad una serata di festa , tra visite guidate agli spazi del cantiere , laboratori creativi , performance di designer internazionali ( fra cui i newyorkesi Graffiti Research Lab ) e una cena per tutti .
Gioved ì 17 aprile 2008 , dalle ore 19 - cena di tutti alla Casa dei designer
La Casa dei designer e i suoi abitanti accolgono tutta la cittadinanza , per conoscere gli ospiti internazionali della casa , per rilassarsi nella zona living o curiosare nella zona notte .
Durante la serata visite guidate , piazze per scambi internazionali , dj set di mAX e Bodz ( DjPerSignora ) e una grande cena per tutti .
Sabato 19 aprile 2008 dalle ore 21 - Grande Festa di chiusura della settimana del design pubblico con dj set , live performance e installazioni nel Padiglione del Mercato dei Fiori , all 'interno dei Mercati Generali di Milano , in via Lombroso 95 .

I recently posted about my excitement of seeing this blog reach the one thousand comments mark , and I wanted to go back and highlight a few things which I think could help bloggers figure out what seems to work , and what does n’t .
World Problogger List – 60 Comments
15 Amazing Women in Blogging – 57 Comments
46 Things to Do Before Launching a Blog Network – 36 Comments
Cons of Being a Problogger – 24 Comments
Free WordPress
Theme : Crystal – 24 Comments
My Problogging Setup – 23 Comments
Best Blogs Period – 19 Comments
From the list above you can see that list posts have done well for me , and that creating something new has done the best .
WordPress themes are still a great way to gain attention , as well as pointing out your favourite sites .
I also recommend mini-contests with a very low barrier for entry , as they seem to inspire people to both comment , and to link to your blog .
The lower the barrier for entry , the more entries you will get .
My recent domain giveaway does n’t follow this rule , but I think the prizes are worth a bit of extra effort .
Another interesting statistic that I have found on this blog is that around 50 % of all my comments come from the same handful of people .
This means that they interact with this site on a fairly regular basis or did at one time .
It also shows that , at least on this blog , if they come back and comment more than once , they seem to come back fairly often , or give their opinions on a variety of posts .
I am unsure if some are just hoping for traffic benefits as many of the repeat comments come from people authoring blogs in a similar niche , but I enjoy the regulars that come back more than once , despite knowing they are most likely ad blind or not clicking on ads .
I do n’t have a plugin installed right now to tell me how many comments the “ most commented ” user has , but I would hazard a guess that it is Tom , a friend of mine from Ottawa who currently has 42 comments on this blog .
A side note for those that are interested , comments appear to have dropped considerably since I have stopped pushing my posts on social media sites .
So that means my Alexa and Technorati Ranks as well as comments per month are all down since I stopped heavy promotion of this blog .
DIGG THIS
“ I do n’t want to alarm anybody , but maybe it ’s time for Americans to start stockpiling food , ” begins The Wall Street Journal ’s Brett Arends in an article earlier this week , Load Up the Pantry .
( Yes , The Wall Street Journal ! ) Mr. Arends blames “ the surge in demand from China and India ” and “ the growing demand for ethanol as a fuel additive . ”
Both statements are correct , but miss the underlying source of the crisis .
“ There is more than enough grain to feed every hungry human on the planet , but the poor cannot compete with wealthier buyers of meat and biofuels , ” says truthout ’s Kelpie Wilson , also this week , in Why More Food Is Not the Answer .
Her statement is accurate , as are the facts that “ it takes about seven pounds of grain to produce one pound of beef ” and that “ [t ] he grain used to fill an SUV tank with ethanol could feed one person for a year . ”
However , in approvingly citing a report that “ indicts markets with failing to eradicate hunger and poverty , ” Ms. Wilson misses the root cause of the problem .
Before we identify that root problem , let ’s look at the crisis we face .
Food riots have occurred across the globe and are threatening governments in poor countries .
Last year there were tortilla demonstrations in Mexico and pasta demonstrations in Italy .
More recently , in sub-Saharan Africa , Egypt , and Haiti , people have taken to the streets demanding rice .
Argentina , Russia , Ukraine , and Kazakhstan have banned the export of wheat .
Indonesia , Vietnam , Egypt , China , Cambodia , and India have done the same with rice .
South Korea has issued price controls on basic foodstuffs .
Japan has run out of butter , and with wheat and barley prices skyrocketing , is resorting to government reserves to buy grains from overseas .
In the United States , Sam ’s Club is rationing rice and citizens are heeding Mr. Amends ’ advice and stockpiling food .
It has been reported that global grain reserves stand at eight to twelve weeks .
The root of this crisis lies in the fact that grains are being used not to feed people , but to feed cattle and cars .
And , not surprisingly , both ideas came from the State and have been financed with State funds , confiscated , it goes without saying , from the citizenry .
How the Nixon administration dealt with a similar rise in grain costs not only informs us what approach not to take in the current crisis , but was also the fundamental cause of the current crisis .
In 1972 , it was Americans who took to the streets demanding government action on rising grain costs , after a grain deal with the Soviet Union fell through .
Nixon ’s agriculture secretary , Earl Butz , was charged with the task of reducing the cost of grains by any means necessary .
( This same Earl Butz is the main villain of The Unsettling of America by Wendell Berry , the 1977 classic detailing the profound cultural consequences of Mr. Butz ’ imperative for farmers to “ get big or get out , ” which led to the death of the family farm ; State intervention , not the free market , led to the birth of agribusiness . )
Mr. Butz engineered a system in which massive subsidies replaced loans to American farmers , causing grain prices to artificially plummet , giving rise to the state - subsidized corn industrial complex .
Corn cost less to buy than it did to grow , inconceivable in a free economy .
New products , impossible if corn had been sold at its market value , were developed to make use of the artificially low cost commodity .
The ubiquitous high fructose corn syrup replaced sugar and became the sine qua non of the modern American diet , leading to today ’s “ obesity epidemic , ” detailed by Michael Pollan in his October 2003 article for The New York Times , The ( Agri ) Cultural Contradictions Of Obesity .
Importantly to today ’s crisis , corn feed became the staple for cattle , grass - eating animals whose stomachs are not designed to eat grains .
Thus , they require massive injections of enzymes and antibiotics to be able to digest what we force - feed them , a process whose consequences are described in graphic detail by Corby Kummer in his May 2003 article for The Atlantic , Back To Grass .
Hence , we now have a global agricultural system in which an artificial demand for cheap corn led to an artificial dependency on it .
Thus , the “ the surge in demand from China and India ” mentioned by Mr. Arends only exacerbates the problem as more folks enter the middle class in those countries and want to eat meat on something more than an irregular basis .
If using corn to force - feed grazers like cattle flies in the face of reason and sound market principles , using it to fuel cars is absurd .
In essence , ethanol is nothing more than the continuation ad absurdum of the same policies begun in the Nixon administration as part of its corporate welfare package to agribusiness .
At least with the above examples , corn was converted into food , or , more accurately , “ edible foodlike substances , ” to use Michael Pollan ’s phrase from his book In Defense of Food : An Eater ’s Manifesto .
With ethanol as a biofuel , corn is being converted into something entirely unfeasible .
“ Ethanol is so costly that it would n’t make it in a free market , ” said Walter E. Williams in an article last month for Human Events , Ethanol Hoax Spreads Economic Havoc .
The economic absurdity of ethanol is made clear by the fact that “ it takes more than one gallon of fossil fuel — oil and natural gas — to produce one gallon of ethanol . ”
The only reason it is produced in the first place is that it is subsidized , and subsidized heavily , with money confiscated from citizens , while cheaper and more efficient Brazilian ethanol made from sugar is targeted with stiff tariffs .
Ethanol , like corn feed , creates an artificial , State - subsidized demand , which has caused the prices of other grains to skyrocket .
The United States , once the breadbasket of the world , is still the world ’s major producer and exporter of grains , and its irresponsible State corporatist policies have thrown the world grain market out of whack .
To use an agricultural proverb , “ The chickens have come to roost . ”
Tragically , it is the poorest of the poor in other countries , not those who put these policies into place , who are paying the heaviest price .
The Austrian School teaches us that State intervention in markets leads to often unforeseen and disastrous consequences .
The global food crisis is a result of State intervention in that most vital of markets , the grain market .
We may well be headed for an unprecedented global catastrophe .
Is the legacy of Nixon ’s corporatism leading to similar results as those of Stalin ’s collectivism , and bringing about an unintentional global Holodomor ?
Will Bush ’s insistence on making the great leap forward to biofuels lead to a similar catastrophe as that caused by Mao ’s Great Leap Forward ?
We pray not , but like those 20th Century disasters , the growing 21st Century Global Food Crisis has as its cause reckless State intervention in the economy .

Kinda hard to be anti-lobbyist when all the top people in positions of power on the campaign are , in fact , lobbyists :
Presumptive Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain has engaged a leading GOP lobbyist to coordinate his message and travel schedule with congressional Republicans — the most concrete sign yet that the biggest battleground in the 2008 presidential race may not be Pennsylvania or Ohio or Florida ’s I - 4 corridor but rather the floor of the United States Senate .
John Green , a founding partner of what is now Ogilvy Government Relations , will soon take a leave of absence from that firm to work as a full - time liaison between McCain ’s presidential campaign and Republicans in the House and the Senate , according to GOP aides on Capitol Hill and McCain surrogates downtown .
Green , a Mississippi native , has strong ties in the Senate after his years of work for former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott ( R - Miss . ) , a vocal McCain supporter who left Congress late last year to set up his own lobbying shop .
Green is part of a small cadre of lobbyists who have met regularly to help build support for McCain on Capitol Hill .
The group , which includes fellow Ogilvy partner Wayne Berman , has been helping the senator secure congressional endorsements in recent weeks to ensure he solidifies his status as the GOP front - runner .

It started life as the emblem of the British anti-nuclear movement but it has become an international sign for peace , and arguably the most widely used protest symbol in the world .
It has also been adapted , attacked and commercialised .
It had its first public outing 50 years ago on a chilly Good Friday as thousands of British anti-nuclear campaigners set off from London 's Trafalgar Square on a 50 - mile march to the weapons factory at Aldermaston .
The demonstration had been organised by the Direct Action Committee Against Nuclear War ( DAC ) and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ( CND ) joined in .
I drew myself : the representative of an individual in despair , with hands palm outstretched outwards and downwards in the manner of Goya 's peasant before the firing squad
Gerald Holtom Gerald Holtom , a designer and former World War II conscientious objector from West London , persuaded DAC that their aims would have greater impact if they were conveyed in a visual image .
The " Ban the Bomb " symbol was born .
He considered using a Christian cross motif but , instead , settled on using letters from the semaphore - or flag - signalling - alphabet , super - imposing N ( uclear ) on D ( isarmament ) and placing them within a circle symbolising Earth .
The sign was quickly adopted by CND .
Holtom later explained that the design was " to mean a human being in despair " with arms outstretched downwards .
US peace symbol American pacifist Ken Kolsbun , who corresponded with Mr Holtom until his death in 1985 , says the designer came to regret the connotation of despair and had wanted the sign inverted .
Anti-Vietnam protesters at a rally in New York " He thought peace was something that should be celebrated , " says Mr Kolsbun , who has spent decades documenting the use of the sign .
" In fact , the semaphore sign for U in ' unilateral ' depicts flags pointing upwards .
Mr Holtom was all for unilateral disarmament . "
In a book to commemorate the symbol 's 50th birthday , Mr Kolsbun charts how it was transported across the Atlantic and took on additional meanings for the Civil Rights movement , the counter - culture of the 1960s and 70s including the anti-Vietnam protests , and the environmental , women 's and gay rights movements .
He also argues that groups opposed to those tendencies tried to use the symbol against them by distorting its message .
How the sign migrated to the US is explained in various ways .
Some say it was brought back from the Aldermaston protest by civil rights activist Bayard Rustin , a black pacifist who had studied Gandhi 's techniques of non-violence .
Vietnam In Peace :
The biography of a symbol , Mr Kolsbun describes how in just over a decade , the sign had been carried by civil rights " freedom " marchers , painted on psychedelic Volkswagens in San Francisco , and on the helmets of US soldiers on the ground in Vietnam .
The peace sign was adopted by the counter - culture movement " The sign really got going over here during the 1960s and 70s , when it became associated with anti-Vietnam protests , " he told the BBC News website .
As the combat escalated , he says , so did the anti-war protests and the presence of the symbol .
" This , of course , led some people to condemn it as a communist sign , " says Mr Kolsbun .
" There has always been a lot of misconception and disinformation about it . "
As the sign became a badge of the burgeoning hippie movement of the late 1960s , the hippies ' critics scornfully compared it to a chicken footprint , and drew parallels with the runic letter indicating death .
In 1970 , the conservative John Birch Society published pamphlets likening the sign to a Satanic symbol of an upside - down , " broken " cross .
While it remained a key symbol of the counter - culture movement throughout the 1970s , it returned to its origins in the 1980s , when it became the banner of the international grassroots anti-nuclear movement .
Power
The real power of the sign , its supporters say , is the reaction that it provokes - both from fans and from detractors .
In the UK , the sign is still associated with the Ban the Bomb movement The South African government , for one , tried to ban its use by opponents of apartheid in 1973 .
And , in 2006 , a couple in suburban Denver found themselves embroiled in a dispute over their use of a giant peace sign as a Christmas wreath .
The homeowners ' association threatened them with a daily fine if they did n't remove it .
The association eventually backed down because of public pressure , but a member told a local newspaper it was clearly an " anti-Christ sign " with " a lot of negativity associated with it . " .
Commercial A US soldier patrols a village outside Baghdad CND has never registered the sign as a trademark , arguing that " a symbol of freedom , it is free for all " .
It has now appeared on millions of mugs , T - shirts , rings and nose - studs .
Bizarrely , it has also made an appearance on packets of Lucky Strike cigarettes .
A decade ago , the sign was chosen during a public vote to appear on a US commemorative postage stamp saluting the 1960s .
The symbol that helped define a generation of baby boomers may not be as widely used today as in the past .
It is in danger of becoming to many people a retro fashion item , although the Iraq war has seen it re-emerge with something like its original purpose .
" It is still the dominant peace sign , " argues Lawrence Wittner , an expert on peace movements at the University at Albany in New York .
" Part of that is down to its simplicity .
It can be used as a shorthand for many causes because it can be reproduced really quickly - on walls on floors , which is important , in say , repressive societies . "
And can its success be measured ?
Fifty years on , wars have continued to be waged and the list of nuclear - armed states has steadily lengthened .
But the cup is half - full as well as half empty .
" There are many ways in which nuclear war has been prevented , " says Mr Wittner .
" The hawks say that the reason nuclear weapons have not been used is because of the deterrent .
But I believe popular pressure has restrained powers from using them and helped curbed the arms race .
And the symbol of and inspiration for that popular pressure , says Mr Wittner , is Mr Holtom 's graphic .
Peace : A biography of a symbol is published by National Geographic Books in April .
Below is a selection of your comments :
It is amazing how we sometimes take an iconic symbol for granted without questioning how it came to be !
Reading this story gives a greater insight into what the symbol represents and also makes me ponder on how often we are ' blind ' to the most frequently seen objects around us !

The peace sign is actually a Hopi Indian sign for unification between tribes , derived from the footprint of a crane , the Bird of Heaven .
Here in the San Luis Valley , where I live , the cranes migrate every spring in March .
Christine Chandler , Crestone Colorado
The logo was in use long before 1958 - as an SS regimental symbol , for instance .
John , London
What a nice story .
Unfortunately the sign was in use rather earlier , notably on the graves of SS soldiers in WW2 .
Presumably Holton was not a very aware designer .
Di , Bristol , England
In 1968 , we painted a bright white in colour peace sign on a mountain in the Las Vegas valley .
With a diameter of 110 feet is was visible from miles away .
It is still visible ( barely ) when viewed on Google earth .
Glenn , Las Vegas USA
It is fascinating to know the meaning and history behind the symbol .
As a Vietnam veteran , I never wore it during the war , only afterwards , next to my badges and medals , a peace sign .
Only a soldier knows the true cost of peace .
Every citizen of the world should live in peace .
Every person in the world must play their part .
In the words of the late , great John Lennon , " Give peace a chance " !
Conrad , Atlanta , Georgia - USA

This is a collection of random things that come to mind that I like to think about .
Cuba has one of the lowest rates of mobile phone use in the region
The Cuban government has lifted a ban on its citizens staying in hotels previously reserved for foreigners , hotel staff say .
It is the latest reform announced under new President Raul Castro .
Last week , the state said Cubans would be allowed unrestricted access to mobile phones for the first time .
The new Cuban hotel guests , like the foreign tourists , will have to pay in hard currency - on an island where the average wage is about $ 17 ( £ 9 ) a month .
Correspondents say the ban on Cuban nationals using hotels - often described as " economic apartheid " - has been a source of frustration for local people since the Communist island opened up to tourism in the 1990s .
Hotel employees , at locations such as Havana 's Nacional , said unofficially that they had been told by officials that Cubans would be allowed to stay in hotels across the island from midnight on Monday ( 0400 GMT Tuesday ) .
They will also be able to hire cars from state - run agencies , say reports .
Raul 's reforms Raul Castro has introduced a number of reforms since he was selected as president in February , after the retirement of his ailing brother Fidel .
The sale of computers , microwaves and DVD players has been opened up to local people - previously they had only been sold to companies and foreigners .
On Friday , state telecom monopoly ETECSA said it would start offering mobile services to the public .
Some Cubans already own mobile phones but they have had to acquire them via a third party , often foreigners .
Cubans will be able to subscribe to pre-paid mobile services under their own names .
Again , the new service must be paid for in foreign currency , so many of the reforms will only benefit wealthier Cubans .
Most Cubans are estimated to earn between 400 non-convertible ( Cuban ) pesos ( eg a factory worker ) , to about 700 ( eg a professional ) - the equivalent of between $ 17 and $ 30 , or £ 9 and £ 15 .
Non-convertible pesos are good for buying the subsidised official rations of rice , cooking oil and other perishable goods .
Tight restrictions remain in place on internet access in homes and on foreign travel .

Activists have regularly attacked the Japanese with " stink bombs "
Paul Watson , of the Sea Shepherd group , said his colleagues had been throwing stink bombs , but the Japanese responded with " flash grenades " and gunfire .
He said he felt a thud in his chest and found a bullet in his Kevlar vest .
But Tokyo denied any bullets had been fired , saying " warning devices " were thrown after their ship was attacked .
The foreign ministry said the Japanese coastguard on board the Nisshin Maru ship had thrown a baseball - sized device , which exploded near the activists ' ship emitting a loud noise .
The device was not designed to hurt people , and the ministry said it was not aware of any injuries .
' Aimed at us '
Mr Watson told Australian radio that he found a bullet in his Kevlar vest .
" It bruised my shoulder but it would have hit my heart if I did n't have the vest , " he said .
Mr Watson is captain of the Sea Shepherd vessel , the Steve Irwin
He told Australia 's ABC News that there was no justification for the whalers opening fire .
" We were doing what we usually do , which is putting stink bombs on deck , " he said .
" We go out of our way to make sure we do n't throw them near anybody , but they were throwing the flash grenades directly at us . "
Japan had planned to kill up to 900 minke whales and 50 fin whales during the expedition .
Tokyo says it carries out whaling for scientific research , but critics say the same data can be collected without killing the animals .
ALTHOUGH MARIA and Jose Azevedo did n't know it back then - after all , they were children who lived on separate continents - their lives would be both changed and linked by the most mundane of events : a knock at the door .
As a daughter of Portuguese immigrants , Maria was raised a devout Catholic ( her step - grandmother , named Trinity , used to teach catechism ) , but her family life growing up in New Jersey was marred by an abusive father .
When Maria was 8 , her mother invited a Jehovah 's Witness proselytizing door - to - door into the home .
Soon , her mother , Maria , and her sister began studying regularly with Witnesses , who questioned the existence of the Trinity and hell .
Maria 's father was not happy about that .
" Whatever rage he had just became worse , " Maria says .
Still , Maria formally declared herself a Witness when she turned 13 .
Thousands of miles away on the Ivory Coast in West Africa , Jose grew up in a French - speaking family that later immigrated to Connecticut .
Jose 's father had converted years earlier , also after a Witness came to his door , and Jose became baptized as a Witness at 17 .
Several years later , he met Maria at a convention for Witnesses in Monroe , New York .
Soon they were writing letters back and forth and dated for two years .
At Maria 's high school graduation party in 1993 , Jose proposed .
She said yes .
They had a son , Giovanni , and later moved to Fitchburg , where Jose started a floor - sanding business .
Last winter , when the family was preparing for a trip to Italy , Maria learned she was pregnant again .
In the doctor 's office , Maria remembers the shock of seeing " two circles " on the ultrasound monitor :
She was having twins .
Later came terrifying news - one of the fetuses could have a heart problem .
By then five months pregnant , Maria and Jose rushed to the UMass Memorial Medical Center to see the pediatric cardiac specialist on call .
That 's when we met .
FOR AN HOUR that day , I glided an ultrasound probe over Maria 's abdomen and gazed at snowy images on a digital monitor .
My own heart sank .
Normally , a heart pumps blood first to the lungs , where oxygen percolates into red cells .
Then , the heart sends the oxygen - rich blood to the body .
But the connections in one twin's heart were all wrong , so none of the blood could get to the lungs ( a condition called " transposition of the great arteries " ) .
That 's not a problem in the womb , since the mother 's umbilical cord sends all the necessary oxygen to the baby 's body .
But shortly after birth , when the umbilical cord is cut , the newborn would suffocate and die .
Unless , that is , an emergency open - heart surgery was done then to repair the heart defect .
Stunned , the Azevedos listened as I drew diagrams to review the diagnosis and treatment options .
The outlook was excellent , since the corrective surgery had been developed more than 20 years earlier .
Soon after birth , the baby would need to be placed on a heart - lung bypass machine , containing donated blood , and undergo the surgery while the heart is purposely stopped .
But based in part on a literal biblical reading of Acts 15:28 - 29 , which exhorts the faithful to " abstain from meats offered to idols , and from blood , " Jehovah 's Witnesses categorically refuse all red - blood - cell transfusions .
We discussed various options - including using parental blood or even the child 's own blood salvaged from the placenta at birth for the bypass machine - but none of these was acceptable to the Azevedos .
The couple faced an impossible choice : allow their baby to die a preventable death , or save their baby and forfeit a chance at eternal life in paradise .
In a sense , their ordeal recalls one of the most troubling passages of the Old Testament .
In the Book of Genesis , God without explanation commands Abraham to sacrifice and burn the body of his only son , Isaac , at an altar atop Mount Moriah .
Abraham binds his son with ropes , lays him on the altar , and raises a knife to slay him .
At the last moment , an angel descends to stop the violence .
" Now I know that you fear God , because you have not withheld from me your son , " the angel says , and promises that " all nations on earth will be blessed , because you have obeyed . "
But what if no angel from heaven came to stop the Azevedos from letting their baby die ?
NOT INFREQUENTLY , parents and physicians disagree about the proper medical management of young children , especially those with life - threatening conditions where the therapy is highly invasive or the prognosis is uncertain .
These conflicts often do not arise from parental misconceptions - in the Azevedos ' case , they understood the medical issues quite clearly - but from fundamental ethical and moral disagreements about a child 's quality of life .
In 1990 , for example , a woman named Karla Miller went into premature labor at 23 weeks of gestation in Houston .
Because a child born that early has a 75 percent chance of death or severe disability , the husband chose not to sign a consent form that would allow resuscitation .
But the neonatologist resuscitated the girl , who grew up severely retarded , legally blind , and quadriplegic .
The parents sued the hospital for ignoring their wishes , but in 2000 the Texas Supreme Court ruled for the hospital .
George Annas , a medical ethicist at Boston University , later attacked the decision in the New England Journal of Medicine , since " the court implies that life is always preferable to death for a newborn . . . no matter how unlikely their survival is without severe disabilities . "
This tendency toward avoiding a baby 's death at all costs - without considering a family 's physical , emotional , or spiritual needs - has created some confusing and contradictory practices .
Consider how physicians approach Down syndrome , which often results in mental retardation , heart defects , a higher risk of leukemia , and other problems .
Last year , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that all pregnant women , regardless of age , be offered screening for the condition before 20 weeks of pregnancy - a time frame clearly determined by the availability of legal abortion .
Yet since 1984 , federal law forces a child born with Down syndrome to receive almost any necessary surgery to preserve life .
Therefore , aborting an otherwise normal fetus with Down syndrome for any reason is legal ; however , allowing natural death for newborns with not only Down syndrome but also severe spinal and gastrointestinal defects is forbidden .
Things are even more complicated when severe heart defects are detected prenatally .
In her moving memoir Waiting With Gabriel , Amy Kuebelbeck describes the birth of her son , who had " half a heart " ( a condition called hypoplastic left heart syndrome , or HLHS ) .
Kuebelbeck refused surgery and held her baby as he died .
" We wished for his life to be free of pain and filled with love , " she once wrote to me .
" And it was . "
Given the same scenario , only one - third of doctors would want treatment , according to a 2003 report .
That 's surprising since the survival for the condition after surgery is 85 to 90 percent , and many survivors have normal cognitive abilities .
Ultimately , the laws regarding highly invasive medical treatment for babies do n't have a coherent moral foundation .
To further complicate matters , even savvy people ( like physicians in sub-specialties ) given a standard diagnosis may choose very different paths .
If the law lacks nuance , and the doctors themselves are divided , perhaps the religious beliefs of parents , no matter how foreign to their child 's caregivers , should n't draw judgment .
Nobody , it seems , has a handle on all the right answers .
ONLY A FEW pregnancies in a thousand yield identical twins , and only one in a thousand pregnancies are complicated with potentially fatal cardiac defects - which meant that the probability of the Azevedos ' situation was about one in a million .
A few days after conception , the Azevedos ' embryo split into two parts , and each fetus grew separately while sharing a single placenta .
The developing children possessed identical genes , environments , and parents - yet the natural origami of one child 's heart failed to unfold normally .
It is entirely unknown how , so to speak , two identical seeds growing in the same soil can give rise to such different harvests .
It 's equally intriguing how the Azevedos and I differed so much in our approach to that event .
At our first meeting in April , each fetus weighed a pound and had completed 21 weeks of gestation .
In later visits , we spoke for hours .
Jehovah 's Witnesses have helped pioneer many blood - sparing procedures , and with the input of a medical liaison from the church , we researched and discussed countless real and imagined scenarios for the baby , including the use of artificial blood ( not yet available ) , open cardiac surgery without a bypass machine ( nearly always fatal in neonates ) , and even bypass with salt solutions instead of blood ( which would thin the child 's blood excessively ) .
Each time , Jose and Maria were hopeful we 'd find some way to save their baby without blood .
Yet no alternatives emerged , despite my arranging for a second opinion at Children 's Hospital in Boston .
I grew to like the Azevedos ; they were intelligent , friendly , and reasonable .
But as the weeks ticked by , we remained deadlocked .
Sometimes we were all frayed .
As a not -very religious Hindu father of two young boys , I had difficulty understanding how parents could allow a child to die , just to avoid a transfusion .
My feelings no doubt showed .
For their part , Jose later told me : " We were not going to consent , no matter what .
[ It ] was the most frustrating , difficult thing in our lives . "
Unknown to me , the family was considering plans to fly overseas for the birth to avoid transfusion .
Unlike parents choosing not to resuscitate extremely preterm infants or to withhold surgery for babies with half a heart , the Azevedos were n't worried about the risk of death or chronic disability ; their concerns were mainly religious .
In contrast to some congenital heart defects , transposition of the great arteries is eminently treatable .
Most newborns are discharged within a few weeks of the surgery and require no subsequent invasive procedures .
The Azevedos , though , had fundamentally different priorities - priorities that were rooted in their faith .
Originating in the 1800s from a Pittsburgh Bible study group that rejected the concept of the Trinity , modern Jehovah 's Witnesses adopted their name in 1931 , and today are headquartered in the offices of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in Brooklyn .
In the mid-1990s , the group 's magazine , which claims a worldwide circulation of 37 million , had a cover story featuring 26 " Youths Who Put God First " and died after refusing transfusion .
In one issue , a photo of a young girl picking yellow flowers in a meadow reads , " Saving life with Jesus ' blood " - rather than transfusion - " opens the way to endless , healthy life in an earthly paradise . "
According to James Pellechia , a senior spokesman for the Watch Tower Society , a Witness who " willfully and without regret " accepts blood has " ceased being one of Jehovah 's Witnesses . "
Official Witness sources hedge on the subject of transfusions to save newborns when all other options are exhausted .
One pamphlet reads , " Loving parents are responsible to weigh risks , benefits , and other factors and then to make a choice . "
Pellechia says : " It 's a difficult situation for any parent . "
Although transfusion " would be a violation of God 's law , " he says , " it 's up to the individual to decide whether they want to apply that law or not . "
Thus , I hoped the Azevedos might ultimately allow the surgery .
Since the closest pediatric cardiac intensive care unit was in Boston , the Azevedos arranged to deliver at Brigham and Women 's Hospital .
One summer day , Maria called me to say she was in labor .
The twin boys , Miqueias and Jacob , were born on August 15 .
Jacob was rushed to the intensive care unit , and the family met with Dr. Emile Bacha , the cardiac surgeon on call at Children 's Hospital .
After some discussion , the medical team initially came away thinking the family would proceed with the surgery .
But on the eve of the procedure , Bacha went to see Maria and Jose about the written forms to obtain official permission .
After a quiet discussion , Bacha emerged from the room .
" I do n't think they 're going to sign the consent , " he said .
THE FIRST AMENDMENT of the US Constitution guarantees , " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . "
However , in 1944 , the US Supreme Court ruled in Prince v. Massachusetts that a Jehovah 's Witness could not force her 9 - year - old niece to preach in downtown Brockton in violation of child labor laws .
With deliberate punch , the court wrote , " Parents may be free to become martyrs themselves .
But it does not follow that they are free , in identical circumstances , to make martyrs of their children . "
Currently , however , the federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act has been weakened so that medical neglect motivated by parents ' religion cannot be prosecuted under its provisions .
Rita Swan , a literature scholar in Sioux City , Iowa , has committed her life to ending any religion - based exemptions to healthcare for children , which is ironic , since those very exemptions protected her from going to jail .
Her toddler had a slow , agonizing death from a curable disease .
And she let it happen .
Raised a Christian Scientist , Swan told me she was taught to " bend over backward " to avoid any knowledge of life sciences ( to pass her college biology requirement , she made a leaf collection ) and never took her older daughter to a doctor .
( Christian Scientists avoid conventional medical care and believe prayer heals illnesses . )
Then in 1977 , her son Matthew developed a fever shortly after his first birthday .
Over a 12 - day span , the infant experienced racking sweats and convulsions and gnashed his teeth .
During prayer visits , she said , one practitioner would shout at the infant , " You ca n't be sick !
You are God 's perfect child ! "
So deep was the denial of the boy 's suffering that Swan proceeded with a T - shirt decorating party for her 7 - year - old daughter while Matthew lay upstairs convulsing .
" It 's just so sick , " Swan says now .
It turns out the infant had bacterial meningitis , an infection whereby the brain becomes covered with pus .
Swan finally broke down and took Matthew to a hospital .
By then , the infection was too advanced , and Matthew died .
Later , the practitioners were n't empathetic ;
Swan says that one of them told her , " Life on earth is such a pinprick , what does it matter ? "
Swan and her husband left the faith and founded CHILD Inc. , a nonprofit group to educate the public about medical neglect of children for religious and cultural reasons .
In a heartbreaking 1998 report in the journal Pediatrics , she helped collect case reports of 172 children who - like her son - died from medical neglect .
( Caroline Fraser , another former Christian Scientist , profiled cases in a 1995 Atlantic Monthly article and subsequent book , including the death of 12 - year - old Elizabeth Ashley King , whose parents refused medical attention for a cancer on her leg that grew to 41 inches in circumference . )
In Massachusetts , 2 - year - old Robyn Twitchell died of intestinal obstruction at home ( vomiting " excrement and portions of his bowel before he died " ) ; his parents , Christian Scientists , were acquitted of wrongdoing in 1993 , though they watched him suffer over five days .
That year - helped by lobbying from Swan 's group - Massachusetts became one of only five states that no longer exempts medical neglect of children for religious reasons from prosecution .
Philip Davis and Kari Mashos , spokespersons for the First Church of Christ , Scientist , insist the church allows " complete choice " and " no coercion " to dissuade parents from conventional medicine .
" I think it 's terrible to have a child suffer , " Davis says .
When I asked if , in retrospect , Robyn Twitchell should have been taken to a hospital , he answered : " It just feels like a slot I do n't want to be put in , in that particular case . "
Many states still specifically allow religious refusal for pediatric vaccines , lead screening , vitamin K shots for newborns , tuberculosis testing , bicycle helmets , and routine physical exams .
And politicians are loath to criticize religious practices that doctors would deem dangerous .
In 2005 , for example , three infants in New York were infected with herpes virus after circumcision by the same rabbi , and one died .
Presumably carrying herpes in his mouth , this rabbi practiced a rare Orthodox Jewish form of circumcision called metzitzah b'peh , in which the rabbi places his mouth on the neonate 's penis to suck off blood following circumcision .
When alerted to the outbreak , Mayor Michael Bloomberg did n't condemn the ritual .
Instead , he called for more study and stated it " is not the government 's business to tell people how to practice their religion . "
Terry Craven is an associate justice in the Suffolk County Juvenile Court who 's familiar with many cases like Jacob's .
What would happen in Massachusetts if a woman carrying a baby with a known severe heart defect avoided the hospital , had a home birth , prayed for divine healing , and watched the child die ?
A district attorney , Craven says , " is less apt to take that case .
They want to be able to believe they can prosecute .
IN JACOB AZEVEDO'S situation , thankfully , no medical harm had yet occurred and no criminal charges needed to be filed .
On the contrary , Maria and Jose thus far had done everything possible for their son's health ; they just refused to sign the consent form .
What happened next was at once ordinary and profound .
When a child is suspected of being in medical danger , doctors can ask the courts to mediate disagreements and , in certain cases , make binding decisions on behalf of the child over parents ' objections .
Under this law a hospital lawyer named Ellen Majdloch on August 19 urgently requested a hearing .
Craven , who hears perhaps a half - dozen such cases yearly , was assigned to the case ( that 's how we met ) , traveled to the hospital , and convened court in a small conference room steps away from the intensive care unit .
The judge appointed lawyers for the family , a guardian to advocate for Jacob , and a Jehovah 's Witness liaison to help articulate the Azevedos ' religious views .
Just before entering the room , Craven recalls , one of Jacob 's grandparents , who is a Witness , clutched her hand , looked in her eyes , and said , " Save my grandson . "
The hearing took hours .
The judge listened patiently to everyone 's testimony and suggested a solution .
The Azevedos could honor their beliefs and refuse to sign the consent .
However , Craven herself would " authorize " - she was very careful , she said , to avoid the term " order , " even though Jose and Maria had no choice - the surgery , and her name would appear on a separate authorization form .
The Witness liaison supported this compromise , assuring the Azevedos that " if the judge orders it , then you are not going against the church teaching . "
On August 20 , Jacob was wheeled to an operating room at Children's , where Bacha 's team opened the child 's chest , cooled his body to 72 degrees , and connected him to the bypass machine , primed with donated blood .
Jacob 's heart lay still for a few hours as the surgeons performed the delicate switch of the great arteries .
Repaired , the heart sprang to life when rewarmed and his chest was sewn closed .
Hopefully , no one would lay eyes on the heart ever again .
Weeks later , Jacob , who has honey - colored hair and an easy smile , was feeding and growing like a healthy infant .
I asked Maria what she thought might happen to Jacob 's soul .
" My conscience is clear , " she said .
She felt that the doctors , not the child or the parents , would have to answer for the transfusion .
" It was n't Jacob 's decision , " she said .
" We took our stand and never compromised .
Jehovah knows that I did not compromise my faith .
What [ the doctors ] decided to do , that 's between them and God .
We do n't judge them . "
Jose agreed : " God will have to analyze the situation .
I cannot speak for him , but I know that God is a merciful God , and he does forgive . "
Tacitly , the Watch Tower Society seems to endorse this end run around the transfusion ban for children .
Its statement on blood products includes the following : " On occasion . . . medical personnel have sought court backing to give blood .
Of course , Christians agree with laws or court action to prevent child abuse or neglect . "
Pellechia , the spokesman , says , " Under pressure , if a person caved in and made a decision that others would not have made , I believe there would be an understanding [ and ] empathy shown . "
Yet Another Bush Impeachment Limerick
By Madeleine Begun Kane
It is time for another Bush speech ,
Which leaves honor and facts in the breach .
Please do not expect reason :
Just more acts of treason .
Enough with this nonsense .

Socially , I can be pretty dense .
This made it possible for me to arrive at a startling revelation at PyCon this year , one that significantly changed my perception of the Python community , and my view of my place in it .
I 've always loved going to PyCon and working with people in the community .
But it was n't until I heard David Goodger 's opening remarks on Friday that it finally dawned on me how important Python is to many of its members as a community and circle of friends .
Or for that matter , how important it is to me as well .
Here 's the back story :
In the early days of PyCon , in 2004 , I heard that David could n't come to the conference for lack of funds .
He 'ld been laid off .
I sent an email to the docutils mailing list and within hours had enough pledges to pay for his travel and accommodations .
One anonymous donor gave over $ 200 .
That was more or less the last I thought of it until I heard David speak about it this year .
What he said was that he was not just out of work but also depressed and this show of support from the community ended up meaning a lot to him .
It was clear from talking about this with others afterwards that he's not alone in his perception of the community as very personal indeed .
Even if you 're not the type to get teary eyed by such stories of unselfish giving from members of our far - flung community ( and I admit I do ) , you can't argue with the sheer brilliance of this approach .
As an investment in our collective future , this gesture turned out to pay off handsomely .
As many of you may know , David has served as Director in the Python Software Foundation , where he has done a fantastic job as Secretary , and he has worked intensively this year as the PyCon Chairman .
So now I 've figured it out , and I am all the more confident of the health and vigor of Python .
The motivations run much deeper than I thought , as do the rewards .
This is also why I 'm not much concerned about some of the criticisms of this year 's PyCon .
These things will be fixed next year , and we 'll move on .
Every community has its problems .
It 's just a question of how ( and whether ) the community comes together to solve them .
Like the small rural town where I live , one that strongly resists 21st century corporate intrusions into our 19th century village , I have a feeling that the Python community is not going to be building a Walmart any time soon .
I hope this is useful to those that share my social denseness , or that it may inspire others to practice spontaneous kindness as a way to build community .
As he emerges from a sometimes - bitter primary campaign , presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain poses a stiff challenge to either of his potential Democratic opponents in the general election , a new Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll has found .
The findings underscore the difficulties ahead for Democrats as they hope to retake the White House during a time of war , with voters giving McCain far higher marks when it comes to experience , fighting terrorism and dealing with the situation in Iraq .
Both Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton have made ending America ’s involvement in the war a centerpiece of their campaigns .
And even though a clear majority of those polled said the war was not worth waging , about half of registered voters said McCain -- a Vietnam vet who has supported the Bush administration ’s military strategy -- was better able to deal with Iraq .
In head - to - head contests , the poll found , McCain leads Clinton by 6 percentage points ( 46 % to 40 % ) and Obama by 2 points ( 44 % to 42 % ) .
Neither lead is commanding given that the survey , conducted Feb. 21 - 25 , has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
The Arizona senator is viewed favorably by 61 % of all registered voters , including a plurality of Democrats .
The survey showed that McCain ’s potential advantages extend even to domestic issues , where he is considered to be most vulnerable .
Even though McCain has joked about his lack of expertise on economic issues , voters picked him over Obama , 42 % to 34 % , as being best able to handle the economy .
However , Clinton led McCain on that issue , 43 % to 34 % .
“ I just think he ’s older , he ’s more experienced , and he ’s got the betterment of the country in mind , ” said Robert Fear , 79 , a registered Democrat from Newton , Ill. , who said he planned to support McCain in November .
In the Democratic race , the survey showed , Obama ’s support has increased across all of the party ’s key constituencies .
The Illinois senator now leads Clinton , 48 % to 42 % , among Democratic primary voters nationally -- a far cry from his double - digit deficits throughout 2007 and the first weeks of 2008 .
The poll , which surveyed 1,246 registered voters , was conducted under the direction of Times Polling Director Susan Pinkus .
Obama ’s lead over Clinton in the Times / Bloomberg poll comes in the wake of his 11 consecutive primary and caucus victories .
He is ahead in the closely contested race for delegates to the party ’s national nominating convention and in recent days has made gains in the key states of Ohio and Texas , which hold primaries Tuesday .
At least two other national surveys released this week have shown Obama taking the lead among Democratic voters -- a development that puts further pressure on Clinton to win the upcoming primaries or face calls from some party leaders to drop out .
One hopeful sign for the New York senator : Of Democratic voters whose home states have yet to hold primaries or caucuses , the former first lady maintains a 13 - point edge over Obama .
But the findings also showed that Obama has successfully broadened his coalition , which once was limited primarily to wealthier and better - educated Democrats .
While Clinton ’s support has remained steady at 42 % since the last Times / Bloomberg survey , in January , Obama ’s has surged 15 points .
That may be due to backing from voters who had supported John Edwards -- who dropped out of the race Jan. 30 -- as well as many previously undecided voters .
Obama now splits the vote with Clinton among Democratic primary voters without college degrees and among working women , two areas in which Clinton had been strong .
But the findings showed that whoever wins the nomination could face challenges in unifying the party .
Older white women remain fiercely loyal to Clinton , while the contest has revealed a sharp race gap -- with blacks overwhelmingly supporting the man who could become the country ’s first African American president .
The poll suggests that the once - muscular grip on the Democratic base held by Clinton and her husband , the former president , has loosened quickly as they have intensified their attacks on Obama and tried to paint him as ill - prepared for the presidency .
One of the most striking findings is that when Democratic voters are asked whom they support now , regardless of whom they voted for in an earlier primary or caucus , Obama leads by nearly 20 points , 55 % to 37 % .
“ I liked Bill [ Clinton ] , and I liked the combo of both of them , ” said Monica Butler , 48 , an executive assistant who lives in Orlando , Fla .
“ But then Bill just started running off his mouth again , and then you really think about things , and you think , ‘ Oh , my God , are we going backward again ?
We need to go forward . ’ ”
As for the New York senator , Butler added : “ I just do n’t relate to her anymore .
She came out with good intentions , but I think she was more true to herself in the beginning than she is now . ”
Poll respondent Valerie Grivas , a 49 - year - old graphic artist in San Antonio , said she decided in the last few days that she would vote in the Texas primary for Obama , even though she has been excited about the prospect of electing the first female president .
She said she “ could n’t bear to watch ” as Clinton attacked Obama during their debate in Austin last week .
Playing off Obama ’s campaign slogan of “ Change you can believe in , ” Clinton called his recent repetition of language spoken in 2006 by Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick , an Obama friend and supporter , “ change you can Xerox . ”
“ I ca n’t stand to hear her try to shame him or insult him , ” Grivas said .
“ It makes her look petty and small , and I do n’t want them to attack each other .
I want them to be on the same team . ”
Democratic voters are divided over what should happen if neither Clinton nor Obama attains the 2,025 delegates needed to secure the nomination by the time the national convention begins Aug. 25 in Denver .
The survey ’s participants are evenly split over whether the 796 superdelegates should vote for the candidate they personally support or for the one who won their state .
But a majority ( 52 % ) thinks the party should allow delegates from Florida and Michigan to participate , agreeing with the position taken by the Clinton campaign .
The national party stripped those two states of voting delegations for setting their primary dates ahead of the party ’s election schedule .
But whether Clinton or Obama emerges with the nomination , McCain will be a force to reckon with .
When compared to either Democrat , McCain is rated as the “ strongest leader . ”
He easily outpaces both when voters are asked who has the “ right experience to be president , ” beating Obama by 31 points and Clinton by 12 .
But the survey did expose some weaknesses for McCain .
Nearly one in four Republican primary voters said they were “ unhappy ” that he would win the GOP nomination .
And of those voters , about half said they would either vote for another candidate in November or stay home , an ominous sign for Republicans at a time when Democrats are expected to be highly motivated .
Both Clinton and Obama beat McCain when voters are asked who would best handle healthcare and “ substantially change the way things are done in Washington . ”
And on an issue dear to core conservative voters -- battling illegal immigration -- Clinton scored slightly better than McCain , a result of the Republican ’s past support for creating a path to citizenship for those here illegally .
Against Obama , McCain scored better on that issue .

Times Deputy Polling Director Jill Darling contributed to this report .
John Darwin gives it a shot :
The best answer we have is that it [ Kiangnan and China ] could not surmount the classic constraints of pre-industrial growth .
By the late eighteenth century it faced steeply rising costs for food , fuel and raw materials .
Increasing population and expanding output competed for the produce of a more or less fixed land area .
The demand for food throttled the increase in raw cotton production .
Raw cotton prices probably doubled in the Yangtze delta between 1750 and 1800 .
The demand for fuel ( in the form of wood ) brought deforestation and a degraded environment .
The escape route from this trap existed in theory .
Kiangman should have drawn its supplies from further away .
It should have cut the costs of production by mechanization , enlarging its market and thus its source of supply .
It should have turned to coal to meet the need for fuel .
In practice there was little chance for change along such lines .
It faced competition from many inland centres where food and raw materials were cheaper , and which could also exploit China ’s well - developed system of waterway transport .
The very perfection of China ’s commercial economy allowed new producers to enter the market with comparative ease at the same technological level .
Under these conditions , mechanization — even if technologically practical — might have been stymied at birth .
And , though China had coal , it was far from Kiangnan and could not be transported there cheaply .
Thus , for China as a whole , both the incentive and the means to take the industrial " high road " were meagre or absent .

Throughout history , humans have referred to exotic cars as " beasts " and " sexy machines " .
But for all the sexiness these cars possess , mating happens on very rare occasion .
When it does they put on quite a show .
Exotic cars held in captivity in museums and garages around the world have all failed to breed successfully .
Scientists have long puzzled over how these vehicles mate in the wild .
Now for the first time , they are beginning to get an idea .
Thanks to amazing images captured by amateur photographers , scientists are getting their first glimpse of how these automobiles attract and mate with other vehicles .
Here we present photos documenting the mating rituals of exotic cars in the wild .
Viewer discretion is strongly advised .
Scientists discovered exotic cars go into heat before they begin mating .
Temperatures can rise to hundreds of degree farenheit within a short period .
The heat is usually generated near the rear as seen in the photo below :
It 's unfortunate that humans did n't realize this was a natural part of exotic car mating .
In the past , it was assumed that the flames resulting from the heat was not a good thing .
In an effort to preserve these sexy machines , humans would put out the flames just as the car was starting to get all hot and bothered .
After the exotic car has been in heat for several minutes , it will stop shooting flames and proceed to mount the other vehicle .
The mount is usually a reverse mount in which the exotic car gets underneath its mate as seen in these photos :
The actual process of mounting has never been fully observed , but one photographer did manage to snap a close - up , hard - core photo :
In the photos above , readers will notice exotic cars are willing to mate with much less attractive vehicles .
Some scientists believe this occurs due to an overdose of fuel resulting in " fuel goggles " .
Although mating with much less attractive vehicles may be looked down upon , there is one thing that is taboo to pretty much all exotic cars , and that is mating with their own relative .
The following rare photo shows two Lamborghinis , presumed to be first cousins , shortly after they finished mating .
The incident attracted huge media coverage as can be seen from the photo .
The Lamborghinis were obviously embarrassed over the situation .
Some other forms of mating include mating with multiple partners .
Scientists believe this is mainly a result of ingesting illegal fuels like nitrous oxide ( or nitro as it's called on the street ) - the preferred drug of choice for most exotic cars .
Group mating can be dangerous for exotic cars and many leave with permanent damage to their crumple zones .
One last form of mating observed by scientists is sadomasochism , where the exotic car seems to get pleasure from inflicting damage to the other vehicle .
In this photo , the Ferrari ended up getting a little too rough .
The Ford pickup subsequently had to call out the safety beep , letting the Ferrari know the session was over .
This concludes our documenary on exotic car mating .
Stay tuned for the next episode when we document the birth process and the teenage years where many exotics get addicted to speed and live life in the fast lane .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice vehemently defended her integrity on Wednesday when asked about an independent report that found she made 56 false statements on the threat posed by Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice testifies before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington , February 13 , 2008 , during a hearing on the President 's Foreign Affairs Budget .
REUTERS / Yuri Gripas
At a congressional hearing , Rep. Robert Wexler , a Florida Democrat , questioned Rice about a report from the non-partisan Center for Public Integrity that accuses Bush administration officials of making 935 false statements about Iraq , which the United States invaded in March 2003 .
“ This study has found that you , Madame Secretary , made 56 false statements to the American people where you repeatedly pump up the case that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and exaggerate the so - called relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda , ” he said at the start of a testy exchange with Rice .
“ Congressman , I take my integrity very seriously and I did not at any time make a statement that I knew to be false , or that I thought to be false , in order to pump up anything , ” Rice replied .
“ Nobody wants to go to war . ”
Bush ’s statements about suspected Iraqi weapons of mass destruction were the cornerstone of his case for going to war in Iraq to topple Saddam .
No such weapons were found following the invasion .
The United States now has 157,000 troops in Iraq seeking to restore stability to the country , where a vicious insurgency and sectarian violence erupted after the U.S. - led invasion .
Rice , who was national security adviser at the time of the invasion , squarely blamed the U.S. intelligence community for its erroneous conclusions that Iraq had biological and chemical weapons and was seeking to rebuild a nuclear weapons program .
When Wexler sought to cut her off , Rice spoke over him and said : “ I am sorry congressman -- because you questioned my integrity , I ask you to let me respond .
“ Now , we have learned that many of the intelligence assessments were wrong , ” she added .
“ I will be the first to say that it was not right . ”
“ At no time did I intend to , or do I believe that I did put forward false information to the American people , ” she said .
The reputations of many Bush aides -- including former Secretary of State Colin Powell , who made the case for the war before the U.N. Security Council -- have been tarnished by the fact that no weapons of mass destruction were found .
When is it right for a government to mass - medicate the public ?
It 's hard to imagine a scenario .
If we faced the spread of a new and lethal plague , most people would probably accept draconian intervention .
But it would have to be serious .
Today , however , we 're told by the Government 's Alan Johnson that he intends to pursue a policy of mass medication of the British public .
Not to prevent smallpox or the bubonic plague , but to tackle tooth decay .
Well , tooth decay is bad news , but it 's hardly the stuff of nightmares .
However , fluoride , the medicine he 's chosen , may well be .
We do n't know if fluoride works .
In the United States , where 65 per cent of people are routinely subjected to the chemical , the worst tooth decay occurs in poor neighbourhoods of the largest cities , the vast majority of which have been fluoridated for decades .
When fluoridation was halted in parts of Finland , East Germany , Cuba and Canada , tooth decay actually decreased .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
One of the reasons for this is that fluoride is believed to work best when applied directly , for example to the tooth .
Drinking fluoride to prevent cavities is like swallowing bandages to cure a broken arm .
Another reason is that a policy of mass medication through the water supply assumes that we are all the same age , size and weight , and therefore require the same dose .
What we do know is that fluoride is toxic – so toxic , in fact , that in 1984 , the makers of Colgate , Procter & Gamble , reportedly admitted that a small tube of their toothpaste " theoretically at least contains enough fluoride to kill a small child " .
Fluoride has been linked to cot death , eczema and Alzheimer's .
It has been shown , at low doses , to cause genetic damage .
And it has been linked by doctors from the National Cancer Institute and the National Health Federation to cancer .
Because fluoride causes collagen , an essential structural component in skin , muscle , ligaments and bone , to disintegrate , big question - marks are being raised over its possible contribution to arthritis , a problem that has increased by 63 per cent since 1997 , and which now affects 70 million Americans .
Other reports are appearing that link the accumulation of fluoride in bones to an increase in hip fractures among the elderly .
The Journal of the American Medical Association reported recently that " with increasing dose of fluoride in the drinking water , the hip fracture ratio increases , " a view echoed by The Lancet , The Annals of Epidemiology and other science journals .
Further studies have linked fluoride use to hyperthyroidism ( underactive thyroid glands ) , one of the most widespread medical problems in the US , affecting more than 20 million people and leading to fatigue , weight gain , depression and heart disease .
That 's scarcely surprising , given that fluoride used to be prescribed by European doctors to depress thyroid activity .
Alan Johnson 's principal concern is for the poorest in society .
But studies as far back as the Fifties , by the American Dental Association and the Canadian National Research Council , have shown that people with poor diets are more susceptible to the health risks of long - term ingestion of fluoride .
What is extraordinary is that fluoride was ever considered for mass medication .
It has always been contentious .
Indeed , the first ever lawsuits against the US 's atomic bomb programme , the Manhattan Project , concerned fluoride , not radiation .
What 's more , the first health tests for fluoride were designed to establish how much industry could afford to release into the environment without damaging human health .
In the summer of 1943 , a group of New Jersey farmers reported that something was " burning up " their peach trees , maiming their horses and cattle and killing their chickens .
The source of these ills was a nearby DuPont corporation factory that was producing millions of pounds of fluoride for use in the Manhattan Project .
Immediately after the war , the farmers filed suit against DuPont .
At the time , the Manhattan Project 's chief of fluoride toxicology studies , Professor Harold C Hodge , asked his superiors if there " would be any use in making attempts to counteract the local fear of fluoride through lectures on fluoride toxicology and perhaps the usefulness of fluoride in tooth health ? "
The most widely cited study into the benefits of water fluoridation was conducted in New Zealand between 1954 and 1970 , and it is used by fluoridation advocates to this day .
But the study failed to meet the most basic criteria for scientific objectivity , not least because the decline in tooth decay that the community in question experienced was also seen in other non-fluoridated communities in the region .
The then Mayor of Auckland , Sir Dove - Myer Robinson , described the so - called Hastings Experiment as a " swindle " .
At best , the jury is out .
Perhaps there are reams of recent studies that lay these fears to rest .
If so , Johnson needs to share them with us .
Mass medication is a big deal , and there should be proper debate before it is applied .
Is fluoride safe ?
Does it even work ?
More importantly , is it right for a government to impose a controversial medicine on the entire population to deal with a non-life - threatening complaint ?
When the Government first mooted this idea , Hazel Blears and Elliot Morley , who were then ministers at the Health and Environment departments respectively , suggested with breathtaking arrogance that " those who remain adamantly opposed would be able to use water filters that remove fluoride or buy bottled drinking water " .
Alan Johnson , the current Health Secretary , needs to demonstrate a far greater respect for British people than that .

Last month , the journal Science reported that a Swedish company was planning on using the body heat generated by commuters in a Stockholm train station to warm a nearby office building .
If that sounds too … personal , they ’re not the only ones thinking about ways to reuse wasted energy .
A team of scientists from Ann Arbor , Pittsburgh and British Columbia have come up with a way to tap pedestrian power .
They ’ve created a device , which straps onto your knees , that can harvest energy from your stride the same way hybrid electric vehicles recycle power during braking .
Their report , which appears in the February 8 issue of Science , shows that walkers can generate about five watts of power without so much as breaking a sweat .
That ’s enough energy to run 10 cell phones or two computers at once , which could be good news for people who live in countries where access to electricity is spotty .
The bad news is : the device could enable commuters to talk on the phone , listen to music , email their friends , play video games , check their stock quotes , and photograph themselves doing it , just by pacing back and forth waiting for their morning latte .
We beseech them not to — on bended knee .

There ’s only one way to really clean a kitchen , and that ’s with corrosive , fuming , toxic chemicals .
You ’re making the place uninhabitable for bacteria and your cuticles are the withered proof .
It ’s Operation Scorched Kitchen .
Would n’t the Proctor & Gambles of the world love to have you fall in line .
Admittedly , impressively - named laboratory brews are very intriguing to look at , but why they have any place in our homes is really beyond my grasp .
There are so many natural tips for cleaning your kitchen – and your whole home – without resorting to harsh , toxic chemicals , so let ’s hop to it .
Get started on a safe , healthy home with these 10 tips :
1. Eco-Me ’s home cleaning kit features a blend of essential oils of lavender , tea tree , rosemary and lemongrass , plenty strong enough to banish even the most evil bugs .
2. Borax is an effective alternative to harsh chlorine bleach .
3 . We love killing bacteria , so manufacturers are turning to triclosan to help us do it .
But this disinfectant can prompt the growth of resistant bacteria ; what ’s more , it can turn carcinogenic .
Use vinegar instead ( and remember that not all bacteria is harmful ! ) .
4 . Inform yourself : not only can cleaning products keep their ingredients a secret , but they can label themselves organic , natural , non-toxic and biodegradable without any actual certification .
If you ’d rather not use household cleaners like vinegar , baking soda or Borax , definitely choose trustworthy green brands like Method , Seventh Generation , Dr. Bronner ’s and Begley’s .
5 . When humans use the word “ fragrance ” we are generally intending to convey scent .
When manufacturers use it they are intending to disguise the fact that they ’re using phthalates ( petroleum - based hormone disruptors ) .
For a fresh , clean smell in your home , look to citrus and herbs , and do n’t miss the post by Luanne guiding you to the safest natural scents .
6 . Skip the monoethanolamine ( MEA ) on principle .
It causes irritation and in some cases , asthma .
Plus , it ’s a petroleum product .
Instead , use water .
Yep , water .
7. Ammonia may cut grease , but it ’s also dangerous to your health .
Skip the chemical sprays and use your favorite spritzer bottle filled with 4 parts water , 1 part white vinegar instead .
8. Natural products are truly all you need .
Or , if you already have white wine , bicarbonate of soda , lemons and some cheap olive oil in your cupboard , you ’re ready to go with a DIY version .
9 . Do you have a cold pot of tea steeped past its flavorful peak ?
Tea is acidic and is therefore a natural cleanser ( of course you wo n’t want to use it on surfaces that will stain or are porous ) .
10 .
Finally , never underestimate the power of nature ’s most effective cleaner : elbow grease .
A simple cloth , a little hot water , and your own muscle are sufficient for most cleaning tasks .
We ’ve been brainwashed into thinking that germs are evil and our homes must be free of all bacteria , but the truth is that for dustiness , spills and specks , a good strong wipe with a damp towel is not only plenty effective , but safer for you and better for the planet .

At first blush , Microsoft hounds might want to pounce on Apple 's release of over 80 vulnerability fixes this week .
But before anyone bears that red M tattooed on their chest , you should take another look at Apple 's updates .
Though Apple may not be very friendly to security researchers who plan to go public with Apple - born security issues , Apple is being a good open source citizen .
Reportedly , over half the software security fixes this month are actually in or part of open source software ( OSS ) packages .
[ Correction ]
Here 's the list software updated , which includes open source software ...
AFP Client , AFP Server , Apache , AppKit , Application Firewall , CFNetwork , ClamAV , CoreFoundation , CUPS , curl , Emacs , file , Foundation , Help Viewer , Image Raw , Kerberos , libc , mDNSResponder , notifyd , OpenSSH , pax archive utility , PHP , Podcast Producer , Preview , Printing , System Configuration , UDF , Wiki Server , and X11 .
While I 'm certainly no Apple fanboy , I give kudos to Apple .
Whether or not it 's just a necessary thing to do in order to keep OS X secure , there are some significant benefits to Apple 's use of open source and Mac OS X being built on BSD .

The main function needs a little more infrastructure when state is being used .
A call to startSystemState is required for initialization .
startSystemState needs to be passed an entry point Proxy that tells what data is being stored in state .
It 's also probably a good idea to terminate more gracefully , so I 've forked a new thread for the HTTP server and and waited for termination before killing it and cleaning up .
> entryPoint :: Proxy State > entryPoint = Proxy > > main = do > control tid waitForTermination > putStrLn " Shutting down ... " > killThread tid > shutdownSystem control > putStrLn " Shutdown complete "
So , in less than 200 lines of Haskell code , we have implemented a fully functional , stateful web app in HAppS .
What has this gotten us that we would n't have in most other web frameworks ?
First , we have all our state stored in memory and persisted nicely on disk .
I 'm not going to get into a detailed comparison with the standard relational database approach , but I will highlight some of the benefits that we get from this approach .
Our state is defined with the Haskell type system giving us all the safety of its type checking and the flexibility of its type inference .
The HAppS state system gives us ACID guarantees on our state changes with very little of the complexity visible to the user .
With the upcoming development of multi-master replication and sharding , HAppS will give us excellent scalability with very little impact to our application .
The past three posts have laid the groundwork for a full HAppS web app .
We have built the infrastructure for an authentication system that can store usernames and passwords as well as the session IDs for active sessions .
Here we will tie everything together to make a functional web app .
It should all compile with HAppS 0.9.2 .
Let 's get the imports out of the way .
In the first post , we created code to serve a login / registration form and handle the form submission .
Some of the details have changed since the first post , but the main ideas are the same .
In order to verify that our state is being held properly , we will need two additional pages .
One will show which user is " logged in " ( associated with the active session ) .
We 'll make that page available at the / view URL .
The second page will show a list of all registered users .
We 'll put that page at / list .
Here is the new ServerPartT list implementing this :
The code for / view uses readCookieValue to get the session ID from the cookies in the HTTP request .
It encapsulates the result in the Maybe monad for convenient error handling and uses withDataFn to pass the results to viewPage .
Before we jump into the new code , we need more of the code developed in the first post for getting data from the form .
Since user registration is the first step in the process , we 'll start there .
newUserPage will take a NewUserInfo as a parameter , verify that the two passwords match , and add the user to our state .
If the passwords did not match , it will return a simple error .
This is very simple using Haskell 's guards .
The checkAndAdd function needs to check to make sure the user does n't already exist , and then add the user or return an error .
To do this , we 'll call upon the isUser and addUser functions created in the last post .
But we can't call them directly .
We have to use the query and update functions as well as the IsUser and AddUser types created for us by mkMethods .
The update function is used for operations that modify the state .
query is used for read - only operations .
The login form now needs to verify the user 's password and create a new session to log the user in .
Again , the functions we 've already built give us exactly this capability .
The loginPage function performs the authentication , and then calls the performLogin function to create the new session .
performLogin uses mkCookie to create a cookie with the appropriate key / value pair .
This cookie is passed to addCookie , which also takes an argument indicating the lifetime of the cookie .
A value of - 1 makes the cookie last forever .
After seeing state queries and updates used for registration and login , the viewPage and userListPage functions will be fairly straightforward .
Haskell 's piecewise function definition combined with our use of the Maybe monad makes it easy to separate the " error case " where the user is not logged in .
Second , we have developed a simple authentication framework that can be the basis for any web app that requires a user to log in .
This web app framework can be used with or without the state management mechanism .
With a little restructuring , the state could be completely separated from the web front - end and any method of persistence used in its place .
And third , you get to do all this in Haskell , a lazy , pure , functional programming language the merits of which have been elucidated by many others .

Desperate Measures Fed Under Fire after Huge Rate Cuts
In a drastic step , the Fed has lowered its key interest rate to 3.0 percent , the second large cut in two weeks .
Critics warn that the move poses its own dangers -- and may even seduce banks into taking bigger risks .
Despite that humiliation , some in Tehran came away believing that a combination of mines , missiles and the fervor of the Revolutionary Guard members manning small boats could compete with the might of the United States Navy in the confined waters of the Persian Gulf .
So , off and on for 20 years , the Iranians have been initiating small incidents , testing the limits of what America will accept .
While the events earlier this month were ambiguous , there can be little doubt that the Iranian actions were part of this continuing pattern .
Even if one believes Tehran ’s explanation that the interaction was routine and harmless , the fact is that Iranian small ships came within 500 yards of American warships .
At this range , our sailors would be well within the effective range of rocket - propelled grenades and machine guns , thus neutralizing the range advantage of our more advanced weapons .
This is why President Bush was correct in calling Iran ’s actions “ provocative ” and having the State Department place Tehran on official notice that there will be serious consequences should the small boats continue their actions .
To forestall another confrontation or prevent an escalation , which would not be in our interests , the United States needs to do more .
Washington should begin by marshaling the support of its allies that already have ships in the gulf and might find themselves in an equally dangerous confrontation .
After the 9/11 attacks , several European navies ( as well as Australia ’s and Canada ’s ) sent large forces to augment the United States effort in safeguarding the sea lanes of the Middle East from terrorism .
The Bush administration should harness this coalition by asking them to let Tehran know through their own diplomatic channels that any attempt by the Revolutionary Guards to interfere with the free navigation of international waters will be treated no differently from a terrorist attack .
Iran ’s motivations are not entirely clear .
It may be that this systematic harassment is an attempt to ascertain the American rules of engagement .
It may also reflect increased Iranian hubris .
Or it may be an initiative of local commanders acting without permission from the Tehran government , which would appear to have little to gain by blatantly threatening the United States .
While the Revolutionary Guard ’s orders originate from the central government , its commanders are given considerable autonomy .
Still , whatever the motivations , the United States and its allies must make clear that it is Tehran ’s responsibility to control all its forces and that it will be held accountable for their actions .
If Iran is determined to have a clash at sea , our military response should be forceful and precise , one that would remove the threat to the sea lanes while reducing the chance of escalation and minimizing the chances of a wider war .
History  the events of 1988  suggests that such a measured use of force is not only possible but can be effective .

Interventionism
Most people take it for granted that the world will never return to the gold standard .
The gold standard , they say , is as obsolete as the horse and buggy .
The system of government - issued fiat money provides the treasury with the funds required for an open - handed spending policy that benefits everybody ; it forces prices and wages up and the rate of interest down and thereby creates prosperity .
It is a system that is here to stay .
Now whatever virtues one may ascribe — undeservedly — to the modern variety of the greenback standard , there is one thing that it certainly cannot achieve .
It can never become a permanent , lasting system of monetary management .
It can work only as long as people are not aware of the fact that the government plans to keep it .
The Alleged Blessings of Inflation
The alleged advantages that the champions of fiat money expect from the operation of the system they advocate are temporary only .
An injection of a definite quantity of new money into the nation 's economy starts a boom as it enhances prices .
But once this new money has exhausted all its price - raising potentialities and all prices and wages are adjusted to the increased quantity of money in circulation , the stimulation it provided to business ceases .
Thus even if we neglect dealing with the undesired and undesirable consequences and social costs of such inflationary measures and , for the sake of argument , even if we accept all that the harbingers of " expansionism " advance in favor of inflation , we must realize that the alleged blessings of these policies are short - lived .
If one wants to perpetuate them , it is necessary to go on and on increasing the quantity of money in circulation and expanding credit at an ever - accelerated pace .
But even then the ideal of the expansionists and inflationists , viz. , an everlasting boom not upset by any reverse , could not materialize .
A fiat - money inflation can be carried on only as long as the masses do not become aware of the fact that the government is committed to such a policy .
Once the common man finds out that the quantity of circulating money will be increased more and more , and that consequently its purchasing power will continually drop and prices will rise to ever higher peaks , he begins to realize that the money in his pocket is melting away .
Then he adopts the conduct previously practiced only by those smeared as profiteers ; he " flees into real values . "
He buys commodities , not for the sake of enjoying them , but in order to avoid the losses involved in holding cash .
The knell of the inflated monetary system sounds .
We have only to recall the many historical precedents beginning with the Continental Currency of the War of Independence .
Why Perpetual Inflation Is Impossible
The fiat - money system , as it operates today in this country and in some others , could avoid disaster only because a keen critique on the part of a few economists alerted public opinion and forced upon the government cautious restraint in their inflationary ventures .
If it had not been for the opposition of these authors , usually labeled orthodox and reactionary , the dollar would long since have gone the way of the German mark of 1923 .
The catastrophe of the Reich 's currency was brought about precisely because no such opposition was vocal in Weimar Germany .
Champions of the continuation of the easy money scheme are mistaken when they think that the policies they advocate could prevent altogether the adversities they complain about .
It is certainly possible to go on for a while in the expansionist routine of deficit spending by borrowing from the commercial banks and supporting the government bond market .
But after some time it will be imperative to stop .
Otherwise the public will become alarmed about the future of the dollar 's purchasing power and a panic will follow .
As soon as one stops , however , all the unwelcome consequences of the aftermath of inflation will be experienced .
The longer the preceding period of expansion has lasted , the more unpleasant those consequences will be .
The attitude of a great many people with regard to inflation is ambivalent .
They are aware , on the one hand , of the dangers inherent in a continuation of the policy of pumping more and more money into the economic system .
But as soon as anything substantial is done to stop increasing the amount of money , they begin to cry out about high interest rates and bearish conditions on the stock and commodity exchanges .
They are loath to relinquish the cherished illusion which ascribes to government and central banks the magic power to make people happy by endless spending and inflation .
Full Employment and the Gold Standard
The main argument advanced today against the return to the gold standard is crystallized in the slogan " full - employment policy . "
It is said that the gold standard paralyzes efforts to make unemployment disappear .
On a free labor market the tendency prevails to fix wage rates for every kind of work at such a height that all employers ready to pay these wages find all the employees they want to hire , and all job - seekers ready to work for these wages find employment .
But if compulsion or coercion on the part of the government or the labor unions is used to keep wage rates above the height of these market rates , unemployment of a part of the potential labor force inevitably results .
Neither governments nor labor unions have the power to raise wage rates for all those eager to find jobs .
All they can achieve is to raise wage rates for the workers employed , while an increasing number of people who would like to work cannot get employment .
A rise in the market wage rate — i.e. , the rate at which all job - seekers finally find employment — can be brought about only by raising the marginal productivity of labor .
Practically , this means by raising the per-capita quota of capital invested .
Wage rates and standards of living are much higher today than they were in the past because under capitalism the increase in capital invested by far exceeds the increase in population .
Wage rates in the United States are many times higher than in India because the American percapita quota of capital invested is many times higher than the Indian per-capita quota of capital invested .
There is only one method for a successful " full - employment policy " : let the market determine the height of wage rates .
The method that Lord Keynes has baptized " full - employment policy " also aimed at re-establishment of the rate which the free labor market tends to fix .
The peculiarity of Keynes ' proposal consisted in the fact that it proposed to eradicate the discrepancy between the decreed and enforced official wage rate and the potential rate of the free labor market by lowering the purchasing power of the monetary unit .
It aimed at holding nominal wage rates , i.e. , wage rates expressed in terms of the national fiat money , at the height fixed by the government 's decree or by labor union pressure .
But as the quantity of money in circulation was increased and consequently a trend toward a drop in the monetary unit 's purchasing power developed , real wage rates , i.e. , wage rates expressed in terms of commodities , would fall .
Full employment would be reached when the difference between the official rate and the market rate of real wages disappeared .
There is no need to examine anew the question whether the Keynesian scheme could really work .
Even if , for the sake of argument , we were to admit this , there would be no reason to adopt it .
Its final effect upon the conditions of the labor market would not differ from that achieved by the operation of the market factors when left alone .
But it attains this end only at the cost of a very serious disturbance in the whole price structure and thereby the entire economic system .
The Keynesians refuse to call " inflation " any increase in the quantity of money in circulation that is designed to fight unemployment .
But this is merely playing with words .
For they themselves emphasize that the success of their plan depends on the emergence of a general rise in commodity prices .
It is , therefore , a fable that the Keynesian full - employment recipe could achieve anything for the benefit of the wage earners that could not be achieved under the gold standard .
The full - employment argument is as illusory as all the other arguments advanced in favor of increasing the quantity of money in circulation .
The Specter of an Unfavorable International Balance
A popular doctrine maintains that the gold standard cannot be preserved by a country with what is called an " unfavorable balance of payments . "
It is obvious that this argument is of no use to the American opponents of the gold standard .
The United States [ 1953 ] has a very considerable surplus of exports over imports .
This is neither an act of God nor an effect of wicked isolationism .
It is the consequence of the fact that this country , under various titles and pretexts , gives financial aid to many foreign nations .
These grants alone enable the foreign recipients to buy more in this country than they are selling in its markets .
In the absence of such subsidies it would be impossible for any country to buy anything abroad that it could not pay for , either by exporting commodities or by rendering some other service such as carrying foreign goods in its ships or entertaining foreign tourists .
No artifices of monetary policy , however sophisticated and however ruthlessly enforced by the police , can in any way alter this fact .
It is not true that the so - called have - not countries have derived any advantage from their abandonment of the gold standard .
The virtual repudiation of their foreign debts , and the virtual expropriation of foreign investments that it involved , brought them no more than a momentary respite .
The main and lasting effect of abandoning the gold standard , the disintegration of the international capital market , hit these debtor countries much harder than it hit the creditor countries .
The falling off of foreign investments is one of the main causes of the calamities they are suffering today .
The gold standard did not collapse .
Governments , anxious to spend , even if this meant spending their countries into bankruptcy , intentionally aimed at destroying it .
They are committed to an anti-gold policy , but they have lamentably failed in their endeavors to discredit gold .
Although officially banned , gold in the eyes of the people is still money , even the only genuine money .
The more prestige the legal - tender notes produced by the various government printing offices enjoy , the more stable their exchange ratio is against gold .
But people do not hoard paper ; they hoard gold .
The citizens of this country , of course , are not free to hold , to buy , or to sell gold .
If they were allowed to do so , they certainly would .
No international agreements , no diplomats , and no supernational bureaucracies are needed in order to restore sound monetary conditions .
If a country adopts a non-inflationary policy and clings to it , then the condition required for the return to gold is already present .
The return to gold does not depend on the fulfillment of some material condition .
It is an ideological problem .
It presupposes only one thing : the abandonment of the illusion that increasing the quantity of money creates prosperity .
The excellence of the gold standard is to be seen in the fact that it makes the monetary unit 's purchasing power independent of the arbitrary and vacillating policies of governments , political parties , and pressure groups .
Historical experience , especially in the last decades , has clearly shown the evils inherent in a national currency system that lacks this independence .
Reprinted from The Freeman , July 13 , 1953 .
In five to 10 years , supermarkets might have some new products in the meat counter : packs of vat - grown meat that are cheaper to produce than livestock and have less impact on the environment .
According to a new economic analysis ( .pdf ) presented at this week 's
In Vitro Meat Symposium in Ås , Norway , meat grown in giant tanks known as bioreactors would cost between $ 5,200 - $ 5,500 a ton ( 3,300 to 3,500 euros ) , which the analysis claims is cost competitive with European beef prices .
With a rising global middle class projected by the UN to double meat consumption ( .pdf ) by 2050 , and livestock already responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gases , the symposium is drawing a variety of scientists , environmentalists and food industry experts .
" We 're looking to see if there are other technologies which can produce food for all the people on the planet , " said Anthony Bennett of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization .
" Not only today but over the next 10 , 20 , 30 years . "
Rapidly evolving technology and increasing concern about the environmental impact of meat production are signs that vat - grown meat is moving from scientific curiosity to consumer option .
In vitro meat production is a specialized form of tissue engineering , a biomedical practice in which scientists try to grow animal tissues like bone , skin , kidneys and hearts .
Proponents say it will ultimately be a more efficient way to make animal meat , which would reduce the carbon footprint of meat products .
" To produce the meat we eat now , 75 to 95 percent of what we feed an animal is lost because of metabolism and inedible structures like skeleton or neurological tissue , " Jason Matheny , a researcher at Johns Hopkins and co-founder of New Harvest , a nonprofit that promotes research on in vitro meat , told Wired.com .
" With cultured meat , there 's no body to support ; you 're only building the meat that eventually gets eaten . "
Researchers can currently grow small amounts of meat in the lab , and have even been able to get heart cells to beat in Petri dishes .
Growing muscle cells on an industrial scale is the next step , scientists say .
" That 's the goal and it seems pretty clear from this conference that it 's achievable , " said Matheny on Thursday by telephone from the symposium .
Scientists are working on a variety of cell culture procedures .
The cutting edge of in vitro meat engineering is the attempt to get cells to grow as if they were inside a living animal .
Meat like steak is a complex combination of muscle , fat and other connective tissue .
Reproducing the complexity of muscle is proving difficult .
" An actual whole muscle organ is not technically impossible , " said Bob Dennis , a biomedical engineer at both North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina , who attended the conference .
" But of all the tissue engineering applications it is by far the most difficult one . "
While scientists are struggling to recreate filet mignon , they anticipate less trouble growing hamburger .
" The general consensus is that minced meat or ground meat products – sausage , chicken nuggets , hamburgers – those are within technical reach , " Matheny said .
" We have the technology to make those things at scale with existing technology . "
At scale , in this case , would be thousands of tons per year , Dennis said .
But once the meat is made , consumer acceptance is far from assured .
What cultured meat will taste like is up in the air .
Some scientists think it could be used to create novel foods that wo n't be quite meat , but wo n't quite be anything else either .
" I was once at a conference of food designers and they really liked the idea that they were not bound to a certain product that we know , " said Stig Omholt , a professor at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences and chairman of the In Vitro Meat Consortium .
" We could make novel products . "
But most of the trends in food run counter to high - tech meat production .
Heirloom tomatoes , organic produce and free - range - raised meat that pack the aisles of Whole Foods harken to previous , lower - tech eras .
None of the experts were sure if there is a large market of early adopters who want to eat test tube meat for environmental , health or ethical reasons .
For all the talk of high - tech meat production , attendees of the first In - Vitro Meat Symposium did n't put their stomachs where their mouths were .
Instead of sampling early versions of in vitro meat , they stuck to local fare .
" We had some excellent Norwegian salmon , which was very tasty , " Bennett said .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - A Palestinian gunman opened fire in a Jewish religious school in Jerusalem on Thursday , killing at least eight people and wounding about 10 in the most lethal attack in Israel in two years , emergency services said .
“ It was a slaughterhouse , ” said Yehuda Meshi - Zahav , head of the Zaka emergency service after surveying the scene at the Merkaz Harav seminary , one of the most prominent Jewish educational centers in the holy city .
Jerusalem police chief Aharon Franco said a lone gunman carried out the attack and was killed by an off - duty Israeli army officer who lives nearby and ran to the school after hearing gunfire .
Police had said earlier there were two gunmen .
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack , but it was greeted with celebrations in the Gaza Strip , where a recent Israeli offensive killed more than 120 Palestinians , about half of whom were identified as civilians .
The United Nations , Washington , France and Germany condemned the attack in the strongest terms , and diplomats said the U.N. Security Council would discuss the attack at an extraordinary session at 2400 GMT ( 7 p.m. EST ) .
Israeli media reports said the gunman was a resident of Arab East Jerusalem .
The school is in the Jewish western part of the city .
An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said “ terrorists are trying to destroy the chances of peace but we will certainly continue peace talks ” with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
The Palestinian leader condemned the Jerusalem attack .
Witnesses said the gunman entered the crowded seminary and fired an automatic weapon at students in its library .
Franco said the attacker killed eight people .
Police said it appeared most of the dead were in their 20’s .
“ He hid the weapon in a cardboard box , ” Franco said .
Emergency worker Yerach Tucker said bloodied students ran out of the seminary .
“ I went into the library and there were youngsters lying there , dead with bibles -- with holy books in their hands , ” Tucker told reporters .
It was the most lethal attack in Jerusalem since 2004 and caused the highest Israeli death toll since April 17 , 2006 , when 11 people were killed in a suicide bombing during the Passover holiday in Tel Aviv .

UN , U.S. , EUROPEAN CONDEMNATION
President George W. Bush condemned the attack “ in the strongest possible terms ” and said he had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to offer condolences .
“ I told him the United States stands firmly with Israel in the face of this terrible attack , ” he said in a statement .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon “ condemns in the strongest terms today ’s savage attack ... and the deliberate killing and injuring of civilians ... ”
Ban ’s spokeswoman Michel Montas said in a statement issued in New York .

“ ( He ) is deeply concerned at the potential for continued acts of violence and terrorism to undermine the political process , which he believes must be pursued to achieve a secure and lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians , based on a two - state solution . ”
The U.N. press office said the Security Council would hold an extraordinary session at 7 p.m. EST to discuss the Middle East , and diplomats said the attack would be discussed .
“ I condemn this criminal act in the strongest possible terms , ” said German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier .
“ We offer our sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims ... ”
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner also condemned “ the horrific attack ” and said “ ...
France calls for the continuation of negotiations with a view to creating a Palestinian state living in peace and security alongside Israel .
There is no alternative to a negotiated political solution to bring this conflict to an end . ”
Yitzhak Dadon , who told reporters that he shot the gunman , said the attacker , wearing torn jeans , fired at the students with an AK - 47 assault rifle .
Witnesses said the shooting spree went on for about five minutes .
“ I saw the gunman and he fired a long burst in the air .
But then he disappeared , ” Dadon said .
“ I saw him again when he approached the door of the library .
I shot him twice in the head .
He started to sway and then someone else with a rifle fired at him , and he died . ”
Some 50 ambulances raced to the area in scenes reminiscent of a series of suicide bombings in Jerusalem after a Palestinian uprising began in 2000 .
Students at the school were attending a study session marking the start of Adar , the most festive month of the Jewish calendar .
Outside the seminary , a crowd shouted “ Death to the Arabs ” .
In the Hamas - controlled Gaza Strip , gunmen fired in the air to celebrate the attack , three days after Israel ended a ground offensive it said was aimed at curbing cross - border rocket fire .
Sami Abu Zuhri , a Hamas official , said the group “ blesses the heroic operation in Jerusalem , which was a natural reaction to the Zionist massacre ” .
A loudspeaker in Gaza City blared the message : “ This is God ’s vengeance . ”
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Fierce fighting broke out in Baghdad ’s Sadr City slum late on Friday after a senior aide to Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr was killed in the holy city of Najaf to the south .
Heavy gunfire erupted at around 11:00 p.m. ( 2100 GMT ) in several parts of the slum , an east Baghdad stronghold of Sadr ’s followers and home to 2 million people .
A Reuters correspondent said U.S. helicopters and jets were swooping overhead and several of the aircraft fired missiles .
The number of casualties was not immediately known .
As the fighting raged , loudspeakers on mosques blared out speeches in support of Sadr ’s Mehdi Army fighters .
“ We will not allow the Americans to enter the city whatever happens , if we lose our lives and our sons , ” they said .
In Najaf , police set up road blocks and drove through the city with loudspeakers ordering shops closed and people off the streets after senior Sadr aide Riyadh al - Nuri was gunned down .
A struggle for power among Shi’ites in the south has involved frequent assassinations over recent years .
But the death of someone so close to Sadr risks inflaming those tensions at a time when his militia has been at the centre of an upsurge in violence in Baghdad and throughout the south .
Nuri ’s sister is married to the cleric ’s brother .
“ This is the hand of the occupier and his successor reaching out traitorously and aggressively against our precious martyr , ” Sadr said in a statement .
“ It is my vow that I will not forget this precious blood . ”
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Sadr would not be treated as an enemy if he played a peaceful political role .
“ Those who are prepared to work within the political process in Iraq , and peacefully , are not enemies of the United States , ” Gates told reporters in Washington .
Much of the fighting this week has centered on Sadr City , where Sadr ’s Mehdi Army gunmen have faced U.S. and Iraqi forces that have surrounded the slum and blockaded it for two weeks .
Huda Jassim , a student , said Friday night ’s fighting appeared to be the worst since last Sunday , when Iraqi and U.S. forces launched an offensive into parts of the slum that triggered a week of battles .

Iraqi police said militants had attacked a U.S. military base in Shaab , northwest of Sadr City , late on Friday with mortars , rocket - propelled grenades and rifles , triggering fighting there .
U.S. tanks were being deployed amid clashes in Sadr City and a roadside bomb had hit an American patrol in the New Baghdad , another part of east Baghdad , the police said .
President Jalal Talabani , a Kurd , reached out to the Sadrists , condemning Nuri ’s shooting and meeting two members of parliament from Sadr ’s bloc .
“ They discussed the importance of quieting the situation and solving disputes peacefully and through talk and political means , ” Talabani ’s office said in a statement .
U.S. and Iraqi forces have clashed with Sadr ’s Mehdi Army since late March , when Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki launched a crackdown on the militia in the southern city of Basra .
There have also been renewed clashes in Basra .
A U.S. aircraft launched an air strike that killed six people and wounded one after Iraqi troops were fired upon early on Friday morning , said British Major Tom Holloway , a spokesman for U.S. and British forces in the south .
U.S. forces say militants in Sadr City have been responsible for rocket and mortar strikes across the capital , including at the heavily fortified Green Zone diplomatic and government compound in the city centre .
A missile ripped a hole in the second floor of the landmark Palestine Hotel across the Tigris River from the Green Zone on Friday , killing three civilians outside the hotel , police said .
Maliki has threatened to exclude Sadr ’s movement from participating in provincial elections later this year unless he disbands his militia and turns over weapons .

Coming contests
by Muriel Fraser
One of the greatest dangers to secularism is posed by religious law .
This comes in many flavours : Sharia , Halakha , Hindu Law – and Canon Law , in both its Catholic and Anglican variants .
None of this religious law has to be officially enforced in order to seep out into society .
Its influence is often indirect , as when clerics of all kinds try to nudge secular laws in the direction of their own brand of religious law ( for instance , by reducing abortion time limits ) .

Is human evolution speeding up ?
In the past 5,000 years , genetic change has occurred at a rate roughly 100 times higher than any other period , say scientists in the US .
This is in contrast with the widely - held belief that recent human evolution has halted .
The research has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
Professor Henry Harpending , an author of the study from the University of Utah , Salt Lake City , US , said : " The dogma has been these [ differences ] are cultural fluctuations , but almost any temperament trait you look at is under strong genetic influences .
" Genes are evolving fast in Europe , Asia and Africa , but almost all of these are unique to their continent of origin , " he added .
" We are getting less alike , not merging into a single , mixed humanity . "
This is happening , he said , because " there has not been much flow " between different regions since modern humans left Africa to colonise the rest of the world .
And there is no evidence that it is slowing down , he added .
" The technology can't detect anything beyond about 2,000 years ago , but we see no sign of [ human evolution ] slowing down .
So I would suspect it is continuing , " he told BBC News .
New gene selection
Researchers found evidence of recent selection in 7 % of all human genes , including lighter skin and blue eyes in northern Europe and partial resistance to diseases , such as malaria , among some African populations .
At the moment we are in an evolutionary interval .
We are in between two storms
Professor Steve Jones , geneticist
" Five thousand years is such a small sliver of time , " said co-author Professor John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin , Madison .
" It 's 100 or 200 generations ago .
That 's how long since some of these genes originated , and today they are in 30 % or 40 % of people because they 've had such an advantage . "
The researchers propose that there are two factors causing human evolution to speed up .
" One of them is there are a lot more people - the more people you have the more opportunities there are for an advantageous mutation to show up , " said Professor Harpending .
A large population has more genetic variation and allows for more positive selection than a small one .
" The second is environmental change - our diets have changed , we are in radically new environments , " he added .
" With a large population size comes lots of new diseases . "
Happening now ?
However , geneticist Professor Steve Jones of University College London said suggesting a large population size could increase the speed of evolution was " a contentious issue " .
Seven percent of human genes are undergoing rapid evolution
" Once a population gets above a very small size it is not very clear if its ability to respond to natural selection depends on size , " he told BBC News .
" The general picture that evolution has speeded up in the last 10,000 years as we change from , to put it bluntly , being animals to being humans is clearly true , " he explained .
" To suggest it is happening at this instant , I would suggest , is probably wrong . "
He said natural selection needed difference - either in the ability to stay alive or in the number of offspring born .
" The fundamental observation is that this difference has gone , " said Professor Jones .
" At the moment we are in an evolutionary interval .
We are in between two storms .
One storm has more or less blown itself out , the storm of farming .
" The question is whether we are going to stay in the calms or whether another great storm will start .
And if there is one , I would say it is most certainly to do with epidemic disease . "
How they did it
The study looked specifically at genetic variations called " single nucleotide polymorphisms , " or SNPs .
These are single - point mutations , or changes , in the genetic sequence of DNA on chromosomes .
If the mutation is advantageous then it will spread rapidly in the population , along with DNA on either side of the mutation .
The authors argued that if the same chromosome from numerous people had a segment with an identical pattern of SNPs this would indicate that the segment of the chromosome had not been broken up ( recombined ) recently .
Therefore , a gene on that segment of chromosome must have evolved recently and fast , they believe .
If it had evolved long ago , the chromosome would have broken up and recombined .
A home health care aide who works in Harlem spent two hours on Saturday trying to get home to the South Bronx .
A woman trapped in front of her apartment on Malcolm X Boulevard was an hour late getting to work .
And a Harlem woman trying to visit a shoe - repair shop was directed by the police through a circuitous maze of blue barricades , only to find the shop closed for the day .
The people of Harlem found their neighborhood turned upside down by the war of wills between City Hall and the organizers of a rally billed as the Million Youth March .
All day Saturday , the police were posted atop apartment buildings .
Block after block was cordoned off , making it impossible for many residents to venture beyond their stoops .
And subway service was suspended in and out of the heart of Harlem .
Yesterday , even as normality returned to the neighborhood , many people remained furious .
And even those who , like Yvonne Bacott , denounced the rally 's chief organizer , Khallid Abdul Muhammad , accused Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of turning what could have been a quiet , uneventful affair into an unnecessarily tense afternoon .
As computers become more advanced , the microprocessors inside them shrink in size and use less electrical current .
These new , energy efficient chips can be crammed closer together , increasing the number of calculations that can be done per second , therefore making the computer more powerful .
But even the mighty supercomputer has its Achilles heel : an increased sensitivity to interference from charged particles originating beyond your office .
These highly energetic particles come from space and may cause critical hardware to miscalculate , possibly putting lives at risk .
Foreseeing this problem , microchip manufacturer
Intel has begun devising ways to detect when a shower of charged particles may hit their chips , so when they do , calculations can be re-run to iron out any errors …
Cosmic rays originate from our Sun , supernovae and other unknown cosmic sources .
Typically , they are very energetic protons that zip through space close to the speed of light .
They could be so powerful that on impact with the upper atmosphere of the Earth it has been postulated that they may create micro black holes .
Naturally these energetic particles can cause some damage .
In fact , they may be a huge barrier to travelling beyond the safety of Earth ’s magnetic field ( the magnetosphere deflects most cosmic radiation , even astronauts in Earth orbit are well shielded ) , the health of astronauts will be severely damaged during prolonged interplanetary flight .
But what about on Earth , where we are protected from the full force of cosmic rays ?
Although a small portion of our annual radiation dose comes from cosmic rays ( roughly 13 % ) , they can have extensive effects over large volumes of the atmosphere .
As cosmic rays collide with atmospheric molecules , a cascade of light particles is produced .
This is known as an “ air shower ” .
The billions of particles within the air shower from a single impact are often highly charged themselves ( but of lesser energy than the parent cosmic ray ) , but the physics behind the air shower is beginning to grow in importance , especially in the realms of computing .
It seems computer microprocessor manufacturer Intel has been pondering the same question .
They have just released a patent detailing their plans should a cosmic ray penetrate the atmosphere and hit one of their delicate microchips .
The problem will come when computing becomes so advanced that the tiny chips may “ misfire ” when a comic ray impact event occurs .
Should the unlucky chip be hit by a cosmic ray , a spike of electrical current may be exerted across the circuitry , causing a miscalculation .
This may sound pretty benign ; after all , what ’s one miscalculation in billions ?
Intel ’s senior scientist Eric Hannah explains :
“ All our logic is based on charge , so it gets interference . [ … ]
You could be going down the autobahn [ German freeway ] at 200 miles an hour and suddenly discover your anti-lock braking system does n’t work because it had a cosmic ray event . ” – Eric Hannah .
After all , computers are getting smaller and cheaper , they are being used everywhere including critical systems like the braking system described by Hannah above .
As they are so small , many more chips can occupy computers , increasing the risk .
Where a basic , one processor computer may only experience one cosmic ray event in several years ( producing an unnoticed calculation error ) , supercomputers with tens of thousands of processors may suffer 10 - 20 cosmic ray events per week .
What ’s more , in the near future even humble personal laptops may have the computing power of today ’s supercomputer ; 10 - 20 calculation errors per week would be unworkable , there would be too high a risk of data loss , software corruption or hardware failure .
Orbital space stations , satellites and interplanetary spacecraft also come to mind .
Space technology embraces advanced computing as you get far more processing power in a smaller package , reducing weight , size and cost .
What happens when a calculation error occurs when a cosmic ray hits a satellite ’s circuitry ?
A single miscalculation could spell the satellite ’s fate .
I ’d dread to think what could happen to future manned missions to the Moon , Mars and beyond .
It is hoped that Intel ’s plan may be the answer to this ominous problem .
They want to manufacture a cosmic ray event tracker that would detect a cosmic ray impact , and then instruct the processor to recalculate the previous calculations from the point before the cosmic ray struck .
This way the error can be purged from the system before it becomes a problem .
There will of course be many technical difficulties to overcome before a fast detector is developed ; in fact Eric Hannah admits that it will be hard to say when such a device may become a practical reality .
Regardless , the problem has been identified and scientists are working on a solution , at least it ’s a start …

T he Periodic Table is natures rosetta stone .
To the uninitiated , its just 100 - plus numbered boxes , each containing one or two letters , arranged with an odd , skewed symmetry .
To chemists , however , the periodic table reveals the organizing principles of matter , which is to say , the organizing principles of chemistry .
At a fundamental level , all of chemistry is contained in the periodic table .
That s not to say , of course , that all of chemistry is obvious from the periodic table .
Far from it .
But the structure of the table reflects the electronic structure of the elements , and hence their chemical properties and behavior .
Perhaps it would be more appropriate to say that all of chemistry starts with the periodic table .
What has always struck me as remarkable about Dmitry Mendeleyevs discovery in 1869 of a way to arrange the elements known at that time into a meaningful and predictive periodic table is that he accomplished it without any knowledge of the structure of atoms .
There are no atomic numbers on Mendeleyevs periodic table , only atomic weights and the groupings of elements based on their known properties .
More than 30 years would pass before J. J. Thomson ( who discovered the electron ) suggested that the electronic configuration of atoms might account for the periodicity of the elements , and more than 40 years would pass before atomic numbers were recognized as the basis for ordering the elements .
Indeed , as John Emsley notes in his invaluable book ,  Natures Building Blocks : An AZ Guide to the Elements ,  Mendeleyev never accepted that electrons came from atoms because he was convinced that atoms were indivisible .
No matter .
Mendeleyevs brilliant insight propelled chemistry into the 20th century .
New elements were discovered that filled in the holes Mendeleyev left in his table , and their atomic weights and chemical properties corresponded with remarkable accuracy to Mendeleyevs predictions .
And as the revolution in chemistry and physics unfolded in the early decades of the 20th century , most of the discoveries about the structure of atoms , their properties , and how they interact with each other made perfect sense in light of the periodic table .
The periodic table is so central to chemistry that it seemed natural to devote a special issue to it and the elements that compose it as we celebrate C&ENs 80th anniversary .
The 89 essays are delightfully varied .
We hope they will give you a new perspective on and appreciation of the building blocks of our science .

Last year I touched on what an Option ARM is ( also referred to as Neg - Am [ Negative Amortization ] ) and how millions may lose their homes as a result of them being pushed on those who already cannot afford a home .
If you look at the video below , you ’ll see how sneaky Option ARM ’s can be and how easy it is to be fooled by the fine print .
Now , I ’ve never been one to promote Countrywide or even pretend that they are anything but criminals based on how they prey one people looking to buy a home .
When insiders and former employees confess that “ the company ’s ( Countrywide ) commission structure rewarded sales representatives for making risky , high - cost loans ” , it ’s easy enough to let the facts speak for themselves .
Here ’s a quick video from armcrash about how Option ARMs can be devastating for the unsuspecting :
But putting that all aside for a little bit , Morgan received an interesting note from a Countrywide loan processor on one of his files recently :
Countrywide appears to be eliminating the Option ARM , at least from the wholesale channel .
Another sign of the tightening taking place at the beleaguered lender in an attempt to finalize the Bank of America purchase earlier this year .
How do I know they are eliminating the Option ARM ( known commonly as the neg am or pick - a - pay loan ) ?
I got this note from a processor on a file :
This file has been denied with countrywide because they are ending the option arms – did you want me to sub this to world – or did you want to do a 5y i/o ?
With Bank of America estimating that $ 739 billion in mortgages could be in danger over the next 5 years ( many of them surely option ARMs ) the bank understandably is being quick to eliminate any additional exposure to the exploding loan .
…
Countrywide was the king of Option ARMs ( particularly the low and no doc liar loans ) with nearly 35 % of their originations over the last 5 years comprised of the loan that lets homeowners “ pick their payment ” by offering 4 payment options , including one that accrues interest on top of their loan balance to make monthly payments deceivingly affordable .
Many borrowers took the low payment and ran , betting on rising home prices to bail them out of the negative amortization run up in their loan balance .
Loan officers were more than happy to write them .
Little documentation and huge fees made it an easy and very attractive loan to write .
California option arm loans netted commissions in yield spread premiums in the tens - of - thousands of dollars .
30 -60 k in commission was n’t unheard of on these loans .
Now many “ good credit ” borrowers are upside down in their homes with little chance of making the fully amortized payment that results when the loan balance hits 115 % of the original balance ( of 5 years passes , which ever comes first ) .
This is part of the Option ARM shockwave that will hit when these negative amortization loans start to recast .
Aside from the very small percentage which benefit from an Option ARM , especially in this market caught in a downward spiral , it makes you wonder why it took Countrywide this long ?
Then again , if you ’ve read the New York Times article on Countrywide , we all know the answer starts with “ M ” and ends with “ oney ” .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China gave Tibetan independence protesters an ultimatum to surrender on Saturday after riots in Lhasa which killed at least 10 people in the worst unrest in the region for two decades .
The tough response by the Chinese authorities came after fierce protests on Friday which contradicted China ’s claims of stability and tarnished a carefully - nurtured image of national harmony as it readies to stage the Olympic Games in August .
Official Tibetan judicial authorities gave protesters until Monday night to turn themselves in and benefit from leniency .
“ Criminals who do not surrender themselves by the deadline will be sternly punished according to the law , ” said a notice on the Tibetan government Web site ( www.tibet.gov.cn).
International pressure mounted on Beijing to show restraint .
Australia , the United States and Europe urged China to find a peaceful outcome , while Taiwan , which China claims as its own , predictably condemned Beijing for launching a crackdown .
Xinhua news agency said 10 “ innocent civilians ” had been shot or burned to death in the street clashes in the remote , mountain capital which has been sealed off .
The dead included two people killed by shotguns .
Xinhua said 12 police officers had been “ gravely injured ” and 22 buildings and dozens of vehicles were set on fire .
A source close to the Tibetan government - in - exile , however , questioned the official death toll of 10 .
He said at least five Tibetan protesters had been shot dead by troops .
Some Tibet monitoring organizations outside the country put the death toll at up to 32 .
The riots emerged from a volatile mix of pre-Olympics protests , diplomatic friction over Tibet and local discontent with the harsh ways of the region ’s Communist Party leadership .
The protests , the worst since 1989 in the disputed region , have thrust China ’s role as Olympic host and its policy towards Tibet back into the international spotlight .
A rash of angry blog posts appeared after the deaths were confirmed .
Hollywood actor Richard Gere , a Buddhist and an activist for Tibetan causes , urged an Olympics boycott .
Official statements suggested the government reaction in coming days would be tough , with Tibetan Buddhist monasteries -- traditional focal point of opposition to Beijing ’s rule -- and nunneries being brought under tighter control .
PUNISHMENT AND REWARDS
The regional communist - controlled government said those who harbored protesters would be punished and offered rewards and protection to informers .
Tibet television urged residents to denounce the “ malicious intent ” of the Dalai Lama .
Tibetan crowds in Lhasa attacked government offices , burned vehicles and shops and threw stones at police in Friday ’s confrontations .
Many people were injured .
Chinese television showed footage of rioters trashing shops and trying to break down the entrance of a bank , and plumes of smoke floating above the city .

A Reuters picture showed a protester setting on fire a Chinese national flag .
Another depicted security personnel shielding themselves against rocks hurled by protesters .
Qiangba Puncog , the top government official in Tibet , told reporters in Beijing that Tibetan authorities had not fired any shots to quell the violence .
John Ackerly , of the International Campaign for Tibet , said in an e-mailed statement he feared “ hundreds of Tibetans have been arrested and are being interrogated and tortured ” .
Hundreds of angry young Tibetans protested on Saturday in Dharamsala , home to Tibet ’s exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and the refugees ’ “ government - in - exile ” .
Slideshow ( 29 images )
Not far from where the Dalai Lama was recovering from a cold and keeping up his lifetime routine of praying for peace , the crowd of young Tibetans gathered to vent their rage .
The crowd tore apart a flaming effigy of Chinese President Hu Jintao in normally peaceful Dharamsala in the Indian Himalayas and the protesters decided to march to New Delhi .
A Western tourist said that Lhasa itself was like a ghost town on Saturday , though it was packed with Chinese soldiers .
China has accused followers of the Dalai Lama of engineering unrest in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics .
The Olympic torch relay will pass through Tibet in a few weeks time .
Although the Dalai Lama was resting after falling ill with a cold , he released a statement condemning the “ brute force ” of China on Friday and will meet with journalists on Sunday .
“ He is a monk so he follows his routine , ” explained Chhime Chhoekyapa , the Dalai Lama ’s spokesman .
That includes listening to news on the radio .
“ He said it ’s very sad , ” said Chhoekyapa .
“ As a Buddhist he prays for peace . ”
The Free Tibet Campaign organization cited eyewitnesses as saying that thousands marched on government buildings in Xiahe , an ethnic Tibetan area of China , and raised a Tibetan national flag at a school .
In Lhasa , Danish tourist Bente Walle , 58 , said : “ Today Lhasa is completely closed and there is Chinese military all over . ”

You may or may not know that I am red - green colorblind .
Money looks grey to me , pink looks white , brown looks green .
No big thing .
Since I was born colorblind , I have no frame of reference for how the world is " supposed " to look and , therefore , I 'm not constantly in a state of misery and woe over the fact that I can't differentiate maroon from purple .
If anything , colorblindness works as a great ice breaker at parties .
But what of how it relates to my favorite pastime , videogames ?
How does my lack of rods and cones affect how I do what I do for a quasi-living ?
Which games can't I play ?
Which developers have I come to respect ?
What am I missing out on , and what do you take for granted ?
Hit the jump and thank God you can read this .
Stuff I can't do
You know Rockstar Games presents Table Tennis ?
Is that game any good ?
Because I would n't know .
Table Tennis relies very heavily on the player 's ability to see the color of the ping pong ball 's trail .
If the ball leaves a green streak in the air , it 's got forward spin .
If it 's got a yellow streak , it 's got backspin .
That 's what it seems like to you , anyway : to me , there is only the blue streak and then three other ball trails of identical color which I cannot , in my wildest dreams , hope to differentiate between .
There are very subtle visual cues to differentiate forward spin from backspin , but they do n't give the player the immediate visual feedback a simple color does .
When I tried to play Table Tennis the first time , I immediately noticed the color - based spin system and , despite my best attempts ( in this context , " best attempts " means " continually hitting the downspin button and cursing violently when my shot does n't work the way I want it to " ) , I got my ass handed to me by my non-mutated friends .
I flailed about pathetically for about half an hour before abdicating completely to Rockstar 's will .
There was simply no way to play the game on higher difficulty levels , or against other people , without subliminally and instinctively reacting to the color scheme .
Thankfully , Table Tennis is the only game I can currently think of which I absolutely cannot play under any circumstances ; still , I am aware of some stuff I 'm missing in other games due to my oh - so - unimpressive affliction .
I did n't know that the Big Daddies in BioShock changed the color of their eyes based on how pissed off they are at the player .
A few days after BioShock came out , someone posted this in the cblogs and I just plain did n't get the joke .
Put yourself in my shoes : imagine how weird this comic would seem if , instead of the traffic light gag which is currently there , the Big Daddy 's eyes stayed the same color all throughout the comic .
Panel one : he stands there .
Panel two : he stands there .
Panel three : he punches a car for no reason .
Everyone in the picture 's comments is laughing their asses off at something you just do n't get .
It 's weird .
But I 'm whining , and nobody likes a whiner .
Colorblindness is n't really that bad ; I just wanted to point out some little odd things that I have slight trouble with that you might otherwise take for granted .
Let 's take a look at the positive now , shall we ?
Stuff I can do
In my Rez HD review , a few commenters expressed irritation over the fact that a colorblind guy would review a game based completely around the concept of synaesthesia .
This is a reasonable complaint , but those readers need not have worried -- even in funky graphics - centric games like Rez , I can almost always discern what is going on and what to do .
This does n't mean I can play Space Giraffe with any degree of efficiency ( though I go back and forth on whether my SG suckitude is a result of my own eyesight or the game 's too - confusing visuals , or a combination fo the two ) , but my respectability as a reviewer need not be diminished just because I do n't like this shirt .
There are plenty of other reasons you should n't respect me as a reviewer .
Oddly enough , I can play most puzzle games .
I think the people behind Lumines or Tetris Attack or whathaveyou actualy had colorblind gamers in mind : more often than not , puzzle games include individual symbols for each differently - colored block , so as to ease with immediate recognition .
See how the blue (? ) blocks have triangles in them , while the purples (? ) have diamonds ?
These are the sorts of things colorblind people need in a game .
Also -- and I 'm editing this in after the fact , due to kacie360 's comment below -- rhythm games like Guitar Hero or Rock Band present absolutely no problems for me whatsoever , for two reasons .
Firstly , the green and red notes in each game are vibrant enough so that even moderately colorblind people should be able to tell the difference between them .
Colorblindies ™ can still differentiate between certain vibrant types of green and red , which is why we have n't all been killed at traffic intersections .
Secondly , guitar / drum / whatever games structure their notes not just in terms of color , but by location .
When I play Guitar Hero and see a note coming down on the leftmost fret , I know to press the leftmost fret .
When I see one in the middle , I hit one in the middle .
Frankly , this is n't all that different from what regular gamers do ; non-Colorblindies ™ do n't actually look at the guitar neck as they play for the sake of color recognition , and I do n't either .
Developers I love
Which brings me , as most things do , to indie developers .
Upon first loading up Peggle , I noticed that it had a colorblind mode .
Turning this mode on changes this
to this .
This colorblind mode prevents the game from being literally impossible to play for people who are red - green colorblind .
The colors are made much more vibrant , as you can see , and notable blocks now have symbols on them .
Similarly , Audiosurf graciously allows the player to change up the color of the beat blocks based on personal necessity or preference ; on the left , you can see the default colors , with my color - retarded changes on the right .
Again , I do n't mean to complain -- I just wanna let you know what it 's like for the colorblind gamers out there .
It 's not terribly difficult , being colorblind , just a bit different ; I know more than a few of the Dtoiders out there are colorblind ( Ceark is like , eighty times more colorblind than I am but bitches about it way , way less ) , and I figured it might be interesting for you sight - unimpaired people to take a look at our world for a little while .
Then again , maybe it was n't interesting at all and this reads more like a gussied - up LiveJournal post than a legitimate article .
Either way , it is n't my fault .
I 'm colorblind .

So goes Florida 's anti-gays , so goes queer liberty
by Jeremy Hooper
Are you a fan of equality ?
Do you think the anti-gay sentiment that has been cultivated by the Bush administration is symbolic of all that is wrong with that flawed presidency ?
Does it make you sad to see any of our nation 's states voluntarily installing a hurdle which their good name and reputation for treating all of their citizens fairly will have to someday overcome ?
And persecution of a minority sect at the hands of religious extremism -- is that a concept that makes you weep ?
Well we 've got bad news , all you fans of those radical concepts known as peace and harmony .
Those folks in Florida who have been working to have a potential gay marriage ban placed on the November ballot have succeeded in obtaining the petition signatures they needed to bring the anti-gay ballot question to Sunshine State voters :
This means that come November , when the nation goes to the polls to hopefully work toward healing the wounds that have been caused by 7 + years of right - wing executive rule , the crucial state of Florida will have a certain ballot question that will certainly bring out millions of would - be Anita Bryants .
So not only is there now the obvious fear that grown adults are going to make the childish choice to write discrimination into their state 's most precious governing document , but there is also the possibility that the far - right rally cry will bring out , en masse , the sort of Sunshine State voter whose vision of " change " would lead to a gay man living in as sex - less marriage with a female .
It 's scary stuff .
But let 's not think about that dire possibility for now .
For now let 's remain hopeful that from Pensacola to Coral Gables , locals residents have connected the dots of bias to see how flawed and dangerous these sorts of marriage amendments truly are .
Your thoughts
Two points : 1 . Florida requires 60 % in favor to pass constitutional amendments .
2 . This is not just a marriage ban , but a " no nothing never " ban .
So they might be overreaching this time .
Just saying ...

Kip :
Why the " Just saying " part ?
No disagreement here on either of your two points .

The Olympics should not be boycotted because that strategy has never worked .
If anything , it hardens the very positions the protest was supposed to undermine .
Check .
A boycott only hurts the athletes .
Check .
Politics must be kept out of the Olympics .
A nice ideal , but rarely met .
The Olympics promote peace .
Maybe , maybe not .
But they definitely promote junk food .
Coca -Cola and McDonald 's are major Olympic sponsors .
They 've become so embedded in the Games that the connection is questioned only in extreme circumstances , such as the unveiling of the giant flaming cauldron over Atlanta 's main stadium in 1996 .
The red and gold base bore a disturbing resemblance to a certain company 's jumbo order of fries .
As the Western world debates whether to penalize this summer 's Olympic hosts for using tanks to lock down an angry Tibet , Americans would be wise to look inward .
Instead of sorting out who started the fighting in Lhasa or trying to determine whether leaning on China would prompt more violence , we can remember the enablers in our own backyards , refrigerators and drive - thru windows .
There 's not much ethnocentric arrogance in calling out Coke for its continued sponsorship of the global torch relay , despite a planned run through Tibet and up Mount Everest .
Tibetans see the path of the relay as a statement about their submission to the Chinese government .
The route is patently inflammatory , an invitation to either chaos or extreme measures to keep order .
If the insult had been directed at the United States , if the International Olympic Committee had suggested a relay leg cutting through Guantanamo Bay , does anyone think that Coke would have been on board ?
Would Mayor Newsom still be calling the relay " a unifying event " ?
The torch is scheduled to go through San Francisco on April 9 , its only stop in North America .
Newsom , winning gold in the lightweight division , said last week that people would be free to protest Beijing 's human - rights record , but he hoped that nobody chooses to disrupt the occasion .
He might as well have broken into song .
" I 'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony ... "
The Olympics play a similar tune whenever they pretend to transcend politics and nationalism .
Like history , the definition of " apolitical " belongs to the winners .
South Africa was banned during apartheid , and rightly so .
But the United States hosted and attended in the Jim Crow era , and the Soviet Union 's brutal religious repression never kept its flag out of Opening Ceremonies .
The East Germans used their Olympic athletes , pumped to the max with state - provided steroids , for propaganda .
South Korea represents one of the great triumphs of the Olympic movement .
A military dictatorship won the 1988 Games for Seoul , hoping to present its economic triumphs to the world .
But in June 1987 , the ruling party had to step aside and let democratically elected leaders enjoy the spoils of its Olympic lobbying .
Historians generally credit the impending arrival of the Games with shining bright lights on the country and forcing the transition .
Hitler 's attempts to promote Aryan supremacy through the Berlin Games are regarded as a similar failure to pump up a dictatorship , but that interpretation represents deft spin control by Olympic apologists .
Yes , Jesse Owens mocked the Reich by showing that a black athlete could dominate the " master race , " but within four years , Hitler had invaded Poland , blitzed Britain and occupied France .
Even if the Olympics rebuked rather than legitimized the Fuhrer , they did nothing to curb his capacity for imperialism and genocide
A convenient faux idealism clings to the Olympics , giving cover to the Games ' increasing commercialism .
The military presence in Tibet has led to more pressure on the sponsors , but not nearly enough .
Is it unreasonable to think the hucksters can influence global politics and enforce human rights ?
Remember , they are masters of brazen manipulation .
They 've sold fatty hamburgers and sugary drinks as the perfect partners to the greatest athletic event in the world .
Coke chose six people as its torch - bearing representatives and dubbed them " Ambassadors of Active Living . "
Eventually , the Olympics will have to be sold differently .
A younger , savvier generations is less likely to buy the " We are the World " claims alongside the obsession with national medal counts .
For now , though , they remain as sacred as the image of the Games themselves , feeding the modern Olympic flame - the TV ratings .
Nintendo's DS
Lite redesign has proved a tremendous success , regularly topping hardware sales charts around the world since it was first released in Japan in March 2006 .
Despite the system 's success , Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson believes Nintendo has already finished work on its successor .
" Our contacts indicate that a refreshed DS is complete , " Wilson said today in his holiday preview investor 's note .
" It is thinner ( it has no GBA port ) , has on - board storage , and larger screens .
However , we do not expect a revamped Wii or DS until sales begin to tail off in all three major geographies . "
As of press time , a Nintendo of America representative had not responded to GameSpot 's request for comment .
In addition to dropping hints on a redesigned handheld , Wilson addressed the challenges publishers are facing during the jam - packed holiday retail season .
Specifically , Wilson said Nintendo is placing publishers in a " difficult spot . "
With reorders for third - party DS and Wii games taking three to six weeks to fill , Wilson said publishers have a harder time adjusting if they underestimate sales and also risk having to take products back from retailers if their initial orders are too optimistic .
The holiday release torrent is also having adverse effects at retail chains .
According to Wilson , the influx of Nintendo - platform releases , as well as bulky Guitar Hero and Rock Band packaging and a resurgence of sales for summer blockbuster game tie-ins due to holiday DVD releases , are contributing most significantly to retail real estate becoming a hot commodity .
Wilson notes that not all games will be affected by insufficient retail space .
" Clearly , the end - of - year squeeze creates limited space at retail , which limits the size of initial orders of games with less publicity and reorders of games with lower quality . "
He anticipates games with high preorder rates , such as Guitar Hero III , Call of Duty 4 , Assassins ' Creed , Mass Effect , WWE , and Rock Band , to be less affected by insufficient retail space .
" Titles that could be at risk of getting squeezed , " he continues , " include Haze , Kane & Lynch , and Uncharted . "
The influx of original games is also having a negative effect on publishers ' annualized offerings , according to Wilson .
" It appears that when they are offered increased choice , consumers pass on games that they purchased the previous year or know that they can purchase the following year . "
Wilson notes that 2007 is shaping up much like 2004 , with sports franchises , such as NCAA Football , Madden NFL , and NBA Live , all shifting significantly fewer units than the year before .
" According to NPD , Madden sales are tracking down 6.4 percent in August and September versus the same period last year , with unit sales down 8.9 percent .
NCAA Football sales are down 20.7 percent this year versus last year , " Wilson said .

A scene from Go Diego Go ( left ) , a favourite of Paige Brown , pictured in a family snap opening her Christmas presents
A father described today how he tried to resuscitate his four - year - old daughter after she accidentally hanged herself with a hairband as she played in her bedroom .
At an inquest at Ashford Coroner 's Court , Phil Brown told how he discovered Paige hanging from a hammock in her bedroom on New Year 's Day .
Coroner Rachel Redman recorded a verdict of accidental death after hearing evidence from Mr Brown , the pathologist who carried out a post- mortem on Paige , and the police officer who investigated the case .
Mr Brown told the court how Paige had been playing in her bedroom at the family home in Hawkinge , near Folkestone , Kent , and had come downstairs complaining that she could not untie a hairband from a hammock used to store stuffed toys in her room as she said it was in a tight knot .
He said : " Paige came downstairs quite upset that she had tied her headband around her hammock .
She was quite frantic so we went upstairs to have a look . "
Mr Brown said that neither he nor Paige 's mother , Lorraine Ford , was able to untie it so they decided they would have lunch and then try again .
But he added that , as they prepared the meal downstairs , they realised that Paige was not with them .
He said he called her but she did not come so he went to look for her .
He said : " I went upstairs and she was hung .
She had hanged herself with her hairband around her neck .
Her feet were slightly off the floor , she was standing on her tiptoes . "
Mr Brown continued : " I took her down and tried to get her back .
At the same time I was calling Lou . "
They dialled 999 and Paige was taken to the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford , where she was pronounced dead .
Mr Brown said he believed Paige had stood on a stool to reach the hairband and had slipped off it .
He added that she had only been alone for " five minutes or so " before they realised she was missing .
Consultant pathologist Dr Charles Lawson said the post - mortem he performed on Paige showed she had died of compression of the neck due to suspension .
He told the inquest that marks on the backs of Paige 's hands and fingers suggested it was " possible " that she had struggled , but that , once her airways had been cut off , " unconsciousness would have followed quite quickly " .
Detective Sergeant Chris Benson , who investigated Paige 's death said subsequent examinations of the family 's home showed that there was " no obvious hazard to any child or persons in there " .
After recording a verdict of accidental death , Ms Redman described the events as an " unpredictable set of circumstances in what was a very ordinary little girl 's bedroom " .
She added : " This is nothing other than an entirely unpredicted , freakish accident .
I cannot see that there was anything that you could have done to have prevented what happened to Paige . "
Halliburton managers told workers carcinogen was ' mild irritant , ' workers say RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday March 25 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Hallburton subsidiary KBR told employees at a water injection plant in Iraq a sand - like substance scattered around the plant was just a " mild irritant , " workers recall .
It turns out to be sodium dichromate -- a highly toxic chemical which can lead to cancer even with limited exposure .
Now nine Americans are suing KBR , according to a report in Tuesday 's Boston Globe .
They say they spent 2 1/2 months covered in the substance as they rushed to get the plant online , a key component in Iraq 's oil infrastructure .
" Many of the 22 Americans and 100 - plus Iraqis began to complain of nosebleeds , ulcers , and shortness of breath , " the Globe 's Farah Stockman writes .
" Within weeks , nearly 60 percent exhibited symptoms of exposure , according to the minutes of a meeting of project managers from KBR , the Houston - based construction company in charge of the repairs . "
According to Oxford University , sodium dichromate is a " NTP human carcinogen and IARC human Group I carcinogen .
Inhalation , ingestion or skin absorption are harmful , and may be fatal .
Exposure may cause cancer . "
A material safety data sheet at Fisher Scientific says chronic exposure may lead to ulcers , asthma , cancer and infertiliy .
" Prolonged or repeated exposure may lead to asthma and perforation of the nasal septum , " the sheet says .
" May cause respiratory tract cancer .
May cause liver and kidney damage .
Chronic inhalation may cause nasal septum ulceration and perforation .
May cause cancer in humans .
May alter genetic material .
May impair fertility . "
KBR may be shielded by federal law
The workers , however , face a daunting task in court .
Under a World War II - era law , KBR is n't obliged to pay damages unless workers can prove the exposure was malicious .
But KBR is n't out of the woods .
Because the company hired the workers through subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands to avoid paying Social Security and Medicare taxes , the workers ' lawyers say they should n't be protected as a federal contractor .
" KBR 's lawyers argued in a legal brief that the workers should be considered employees of KBR because they were part of a corporate subsidiary that was working on a KBR team , " Stockman writes .
" The company 's spokeswoman , Heather Browne , pointed out that the company 's projects in Iraq take place in a ' dangerous , unpredictable environment , ' but said the firm maintains an ' unwavering commitment to safety . ' "
" Like domestic workers ' compensation plans , the Defense Base Act entitles employees in Iraq to medical care , disability , and death benefits , regardless of who is at fault for the injury .
In exchange , it generally prohibits employees from seeking any further compensation , even if the employer is at fault , " she continues .
" For this reason , " she adds , " fewer than 10 high - profile lawsuits have been filed against contractors in Iraq .
So far , none has been decided in favor of the employees , lawyers say , although some cases are ongoing . "
The workers say KBR 's managers discouraged them from raising safety concerns .
" What was done to us , I believe , it 's criminal , " Danny Langford , a motor specialist from Texas who worked in the most contaminated room in the facility , told the Globe .
" I think it was deliberate .
They wanted this six month job - get you in , get you out , and send you on your way , and 10 years later you start dying of cancer . "
Of course , Americans must be 18 to serve in the military , but much of the military 's recruiting work is directed at those who have not yet turned 18 .
According to Dave Meserve in Arcata , Calif. , localities can avoid the consequences of the No Child Left Behind law ( which turns students ' names and contact information over to recruiters ) not only by helping students and parents to opt out of recruitment lists or by challenging the ability of recruiters to be on school campuses , but also by prohibiting any recruiting activities that involve kids under 18 .
Meserve has drafted an ordinance and submitted it to the city clerk and the city attorney in Arcata .
They will have 15 days to review it and provide a title and ballot summary for the November 2008 ballot .
Then Meserve can begin gathering signatures to get it on the ballot .
Why not do the same thing in your town or major city ?
Here 's the draft ordinance :
ARCATA YOUTH PROTECTION ACT
AN ORDINANCE TO PROHIBIT THE MILITARY RECRUITMENT OF ANY PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN
To protect the welfare of our youth , the People of Arcata Ordain as Follows :
No person who is employed by or an agent of the United States government shall , within the City of Arcata , in the execution of his or her job duties , recruit , initiate contact with for the purpose of recruiting , or promote the future enlistment of any person under the age of eighteen into any branch of the United States Armed Forces .
Authority :
This Ordinance is adopted and enacted pursuant to the authority guaranteed to the people of Arcata by the California Constitution ( Article 2 , Section1 ) and the U.S. Constitution ( Amendments IX and X ) which guarantee political power to the people and recognize the right to exercise that power through initiative and referendum ( California Constitution Article 4 , Section I ) .
Findings
1 ) Military Recruiters Target Teens .
Military recruiters target teens through ad campaigns , mailings , telephone calls , email , and direct personal contact .
They promote enlistment by glorifying military service and exaggerating the educational and career benefits , while ignoring the dangers .
Recruiters are rewarded for meeting enlistment quotas and risk reassignment if quotas are not met .
College and business recruiters lack equivalent resources and incentives to promote non-military careers to teens .
2 ) People under the age of eighteen are not permitted to vote .
As a society , we believe that people under eighteen lack the life experience to make informed choices ; they cannot vote , sign contracts , or make medical and other legal decisions .
Although people under eighteen cannot enlist in the military without parental consent , sixteen - and seventeen - year - olds in our community are routinely urged by recruiters to commit themselves to future enlistment after their eighteenth birthdays .
Those who do enlist in the military may be ordered to participate in actions that violate Constitutional and International Law including bombings of civilian targets , invasions and occupations of sovereign nations , or illegal detention and mistreatment of suspected terrorists .
Young soldiers risk their lives and sanity without a developed ability to comprehend the consequences of their actions .
Unlike civilian employees , military enlistees may be prosecuted and imprisoned if they refuse to obey an order , or if they change their minds and want to quit their jobs in the military .
If we believe that people under the age of eighteen lack the experience and maturity necessary for voting , then they should not be subjected to the highly sophisticated and well - funded efforts of military recruiters to enlist them in the armed forces .
3 ) The First Amendment protects the free speech of people , not the government .
While some may argue that recruiting is “ speech ” protected by the First Amendment , the Bill of Rights protects the rights of people from the excesses of government .
4 ) This Ordinance does not violate provisions of No Child Left Behind .
The No Child Left Behind Act ( PL 117- 110 , Section 9528.3 ) mandates that : “ Each local educational agency receiving assistance under this Act shall provide military recruiters the same access to secondary school students as is provided generally to post secondary educational institutions or to prospective employers of those students . ”
This Ordinance is to be approved by the voters , not by any local educational agency .
Under the Ordinance , schools may still provide access to military recruiters , but recruiters are prohibited from recruiting or promoting the future enlistment of any person under the age of eighteen .
Specific Purpose :
The specific purpose of this Ordinance is to protect youth under the age of eighteen from military recruiting .
Statement of Law :
No person who is employed by or an agent of the United States government shall , within the City of Arcata , in the execution of his or her job duties , recruit , initiate contact with for the purpose of recruiting , or promote the future enlistment of any person under the age of eighteen into any branch of the United States Armed Forces .
Nothing in this Ordinance shall prevent any person from voluntarily visiting a military recruitment office or specifically initiating a request to meet with a recruiter .
Nothing in this Ordinance shall prevent individuals who are not employed by or agents of the U.S. government from encouraging people under the age of eighteen to join the military .
Enforcement
The City of Arcata shall inform all local military recruiters and their commanding officers of this Ordinance , which prohibits military recruiting of any person under the age of eighteen within the City of Arcata .
Any military recruiter who violates this Ordinance , as well as his or her commanding officer , shall be held responsible for said violation .
Both shall be deemed guilty of an infraction and shall be subject to the penalties stated in the Arcata Municipal Code .
( A.M.C. I - 3-1200 ) A citizen complaint of any unsolicited military recruiting activity involving people under the age of eighteen shall initiate investigation and possible citation by the Arcata Police Department for violation of this Ordinance .
If recruiters violate this Ordinance five or more times within one month , military recruiting of persons under the age of eighteen shall be deemed a public nuisance and shall be summarily abated .
( A.M.C. I - 3- 1201 )
Severability
The provisions of this Ordinance are severable .
If any section or provision of this Ordinance is determined to be illegal , invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction , such decision of the court shall not affect or invalidate any of the remaining sections or provisions of this Ordinance .
It is the express intent of the people of Arcata , California that this Ordinance would have been adopted if such illegal , invalid , or unconstitutional section or provision had not been included .
Effective Date
This Ordinance shall take effect thirty ( 30 ) days after adoption by the voters .
Interpretation
In the event this Ordinance requires interpretation ( by courts , county officials , or anyone else ) , it is the express intent of the people of Arcata that this Ordinance be construed in such a manner to carry out the original intent of this Initiative , which is to prohibit military recruitment of any person under the age of eighteen within the City of Arcata .
Jeb Corliss wants to fly  not the way the Wright brothers wanted to fly , but the way we do in our dreams .
He wants to jump from a helicopter and land without using a parachute .
And his dream , strange as it sounds , is not unique .
Around the globe , Mr. Corliss said , at least a half - dozen groups  in France , South Africa , New Zealand , Russia and the United States  have the same goal in mind .
Although nobody is waving a flag , the quest has evoked the spirit of nations ’ pursuits of Everest and the North and South Poles .
“ All of this is technically possible , ” said Jean Potvin , a physics professor at Saint Louis University and a skydiver who does parachute research for the Army .
But he acknowledged a problem : “ The thing I ’m not sure of is your margins in terms of safety , or likelihood to crash . ”
Loïc Jean - Albert of France , better known as Flying Dude in a popular YouTube video , put it more bluntly : “ You might do it well one time and try another time and crash and die . ”
That huge bundle of damning emails and documents Microsoft produced as part of the Vista - capable lawsuit is full of fascinating information about how the company developed , planned , and launched Vista , but the latest juicy nugget to come out if it suggests that a lot of problems faced by the troubled operating system are actually NVIDIA 's fault -- nearly 30 % of logged Vista crashes were due to NVIDIA driver problems , according to Microsoft data included in the bundle .
That 's some 479,326 hung systems , if you 're keeping score at home , and it's in first place by a large margin -- Microsoft clocks in at number two at 17.9 percent , and ATI is fourth with 9.3 percent .
Now , the chart does n't contain a ton of additional information that would help put it in context -- a specific time period in 2007 would be nice , as would and driver and OS versions -- but we 've been hearing about NVIDIA issues with Vista from the start , and this seems to confirm it .
So that 's pressure by Intel to support incompatible chipsets , outrage by Dell and Wal - Mart that the Vista Capable program was confusing customers , Microsoft executives saying they had been " personally burnt " by Vista , and now what looks like a huge NVIDIA driver problem -- who knows what else is going to come out of this lawsuit ?
At this point we 're half expecting a photo of Gates signing a Save XP petition .
In India , there is a new IT industry : the new Infant Trading .
After the adults , it is now the babies turn to be outsourced .
Reproductive Outsourcing is catching on .
The industry is valued at more than $ 450 millions , and the number of cases of surrogacy has doubled over the past three years .
Commercial surrogacy has been legal in India since 2002 .
India is emerging as a leader making it into what can be called a viable industry rather than a rare fertility treatment .
It has gained popularity for same reasons as outsourcing in other industries : a wide labor pool working for relatively low rates .
In India womb is the new Web .
It is interesting to note that people worldwide use poverty in India to validate reproductive outsourcing .
Surrogate mothers in India , where maternal death rates are very high , under commercial surrogacy programs are usually cared for with amongst the best highly advanced medical , nutritional , and overall care available in the field anywhere in the world .
The total cost including the medical procedures , payment to the clinic providing the surrogate mother , and air tickets and hotel expenses for two trips to India , is less than $ 25,000 .
This is not even one third of what it would cost say in the United States .
The fertility treatment and surrogacy that cost upwards of $ 80,000 in the United States can be done in India for about $ 12,000 or less .
The couple looking to have a baby go to India for in - vitro fertilization and then again to pick up the baby .
These clinics provide complete one - stop service to these couples which include updating them of the progress of the pregnancy by sending them reports and ultrasounds through emails and chat forums .
Other reasons why India is an attraction as compared to other developing countries is the availability of advanced health care facilities and doctors who speak English .
Surrogates , who must be younger than 45 and must have at least one living child , are required to stay in a dormitory attached to the clinic for the nine months of their pregnancy .
This is one of internet ads of a Hospital in India advertising their package deal .
Oprah Winfrey did a show ‘ Renting Wombs in India ‘ in October 2007 where she endorsed the concept .
There is a default legal assumption in most countries that the woman giving birth to a child is that child ’s legal mother .
In some jurisdictions the possibility of surrogacy has been allowed , and the intended parents may be recognized as the legal parents from birth .
Many states now issue pre-birth orders through the courts placing the names of the intended parents on the birth certificate from the start .
In others , the possibility of surrogacy is either not recognized ( all contracts specifying different legal parents are void ) , or is prohibited , and will be considered as a criminal offense .
Commercial surrogacy is illegal in France , UK , Italy , Canada , Japan , Sweden , Spain , Australia , and even some states of USA .
Other countries which do allow are South Africa , UK , and Argentina .
However , unlike India these other countries employ ethics committee to evaluate each surrogacy request on case by case basis .
Bioethicists are concerned that Indian surrogates are being badly paid for their surrogacy and that in addition they are working as surrogates in a country with a comparatively high maternal death rate .
“ The human body is not lent out , is not rented out , is not sold , ” France ’s highest court held when it outlawed commercial surrogacy in the early nineties .
The clinics in India feel that this vital service they are providing is a ‘ win - win ’ situation for both the parties , ” we are facilitating each one of them to achieve what none of them could achieve on their own . ”
I personally feel that surrogacy is a unique gift of motherhood which only a woman can give to another .
However , given the shape and form it has taken in India it is nothing else but exploitation of women based on global inequalities .
It is lack of education and lack of respect for women in our country that has risen and supported the surrogacy industry that is exposing women to the risks of pregnancy for financial gains .
In United States or other western countries , one rarely hears about poor citizens acting as surrogates for financial reasons .
More often than not , a family member or friend will volunteer to be a surrogate for a couple who are otherwise not able to conceive .
Having a child is deep emotional experience .
Would these Indian women be willing to give away their babies if it was not for money ?
However , the fertility specialists running this industry argue , “ Many surrogate mothers see this not as ‘ handing over ’ the baby , but as ‘ handing back ’ the baby , as the baby was never theirs to keep . ”
In India this business has flourished even when it is not considered a respectable thing to do .
At times a surrogate mother has to bear with the social stigma since people in her village or town think that she got impregnated by another man .
A surrogate mother argues , “ How else can an uneducated women like me earn that much money without doing anything immoral ?
” Competitions amongst clinics is going to lead to compromised medical and safety measures , and things can grow bad very soon .
Trans-ethnic surrogacy will bring countries closer .
However , it is unethical for rich from the developed countries to exploit under privileged women from developing nations .

Made in India is a feature length documentary film about the human experiences behind the phenomena of “ outsourcing ” surrogate mothers to India .

The problem began the night his wife did n't come home .
He had left his construction job , then fed their kids .
He put them to bed , watched TV and tried to sleep .
Often his wife worked past midnight at an Arlington restaurant , but it was 4 a.m. and she was still gone .
Another few hours passed .
Finally , she called .
She 'd been out with friends .
Could he pick her up ?
Antonio grew suspicious .
Had she been with another man ?
No , of course not , she told him .
But in his mind , it was the first crack in a marriage that continued to crumble .
Financial stress compounded their problems , causing terrible fights .
The conflict reached a fever pitch in 2005 .
He left and moved in with his mother .
Shortly after that , he got a phone call from a relative of his wife's .
Your youngest daughter , he told Antonio , she is n't yours .
She belongs to another man .
Antonio refused to believe it .
But after his mother heard similar rumors , even she began talking about how the little girl did n't look like their side of the family .
Over the next 18 months , Antonio tried to visit his children , but his wife would n't allow it .
There were more fights — his wife claimed he hit her and slammed her against a car , which he denied .
She moved and he could n't find her .
Then , last summer , shortly before his wife filed for divorce , Antonio received a letter from the Texas Attorney General 's Office , the state agency charged with enforcing child support obligations .
The letter instructed him to go to a Dallas County child support court where in August 2007 , he faced making monthly payments equal to 30 percent of his take - home pay , which was around $ 1,500 .
Antonio ( not his real name ) requested DNA testing .
If what his relatives said was true , he argued , why should he have to support a child who was n't biologically his ?
He would later learn that under Texas law , a man is presumed to be the legal father of any child born during his marriage to the child 's mother , and if he questions his paternity , he has only four years to challenge it .
All of Antonio 's children were older than 4 by the time he and his wife went to court .
What happened next focused attention on the growing availability of DNA testing and caused a legal uproar that ricocheted from the halls of the Dallas County family courts to the Austin headquarters of Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott .
On January 14 , family court Judge David Hanschen ordered Antonio and both of his daughters , ages 5 and 7 , to undergo paternity testing immediately .
The next day , lawyers within the attorney general 's office who represent the state on behalf of the mother and children — asked the 5th Court of Appeals in Dallas for an emergency order halting the testing .
These lawyers cited the four - year statute of limitations and argued that because Antonio was already the legal father , he had no grounds to request DNA testing and dispute that he was the biological father .
The Court of Appeals agreed and ordered that no testing be conducted .
But it was too late :
On January 16 , the lab released the results , which placed the probability of Antonio fathering either of the girls at zero percent .
On January 25 , appeals court Justice Carolyn Wright ordered that the test results be sealed and kept from the children .
This was followed in March by the court 's written opinion that slapped Hanschen for ordering the testing in the first place and ordered the DNA results destroyed .
Hanschen refuses to comment on specific cases , but says that in certain situations , a court 's denial of DNA testing may violate a father 's constitutional right to equal protection and the legal system itself may be condoning fraud .
" In my court , the truth does not have a statute of limitations , " he says .
" It 's just the truth , and if we have the means to know the truth , we should . "
DNA testing has garnered widespread attention for freeing the innocent .
Yet the growing availability of biological testing in paternity cases complicates efforts to balance the rights of fathers with the interests of children , who could be emotionally damaged by losing a father figure simply because he does n't share their DNA .
" Part of the problem , " Hanschen says , " is science has gotten so ahead of the law that the law has n't been able to catch up . "
Hanschen , a tall , bearded man with a sober demeanor and deep baritone voice , has stood out as a maverick at the courthouse since he was elected in 2006 as one of more than 40 Democrats who swept the Dallas County judicial contests in a partisan sea change .
He wears his hair in a ponytail that hangs down to his lower back and has been mocked by conservatives such as former state Republican Party chair Tom Pauken for being a " New Age " judge who chomps on " weird nuts and seeds " and has lawyers " sit under a Buddha which is prominently placed in his conference room . "
Hanschen calls the criticism " scurrilous . "
" Because I have a Buddha I bought in Thailand five years ago they think I 'm operating some kind of cult in here , " he says .
" Come on , it 's an amazing piece of art . "
Aesthetics aside , through a year 's worth of unorthodox moves regarding the way Texas enforces child support laws , the judge now finds himself in a battle against the largest law enforcement agency in the state .
In February 2007 , he complained that the attorney general 's office was deceptively asking men to sign away valuable rights when they first appeared in child support court , and last summer he declared that the office 's process for notifying presumed fathers of their court dates violated due process .
His recent authorization of paternity testing may have been the last straw for the office .
E-mails viewed by the Dallas Observer and interviews with assistant attorneys general reflect that in early February of this year , supervising attorneys within the office 's Child Support Division launched a concerted campaign to collect affidavits from nearly a dozen staff lawyers — in some cases exerting pressure on them — with the apparent goal of filing a complaint alleging judicial misconduct against Hanschen and possibly fellow family court Judge Lynn Cherry .
( She sides with Hanschen on many of these issues . )
Whatever the motivation of the attorney general 's office , its response to challenges from these Dallas judges seems heavy - handed .
" It 's very rare , " says University of Texas School of Law professor Jack Sampson , who co-wrote the Texas Family Code .
" The way you 're supposed to correct judges ' errors is by appealing , not by attacking the judge directly . "
But there is much at stake for the attorney general 's office .
A powerful state bureaucracy accustomed to getting its way , the office touts its dogged pursuit of deadbeat dads and casts itself as an advocate for children .
The office 's Child Support Division is a prized component of Attorney General Abbott 's administration .
The office has been nationally recognized for leading the country in child support collections , with a record $ 2.3 billion for its 2007 fiscal year .
Since his election in 2002 , Abbott has made child support a major focus of his office and used it as a rallying cry in his 2006 re-election campaign .
But to critics , the office 's unwillingness to acknowledge that some of its practices may railroad poor , uneducated men into financial hardship is evidence of more sinister motives .
The office receives federal funds based in part on the amount of child support that it collects and distributes , giving the Child Support Division a budgetary incentive to close as many cases as it can , no matter whose rights it might trample .
Hanschen has also drawn criticism , with some observers saying he " sets himself above the law " and legislates from the bench .
But his supporters counter that he 's merely shedding light on the problematic laws that govern the messy matters of sex , fidelity and truth in paternity matters .
In fact , lawmakers and fathers ' rights activists have been lobbying across the state and the country for changes to a body of laws that are crucial for assisting women and children but can also saddle the wrong men with onerous child support obligations , seized assets and even jail time .

It was a Tuesday morning in late February .
A dozen women sat on benches on the third floor of the George Allen Sr. Courts Building , which houses Dallas County 's IV - D courts , where assistant attorneys general champion the child support rights of low - income moms .
Some of the women held swaddled infants ; others chased after toddlers who skipped down the hallway laughing , blissfully ignorant of the proceedings that brought their mothers there .
While a few sullen men talked on their cell phones in low voices , a middle - aged black woman complained to a young mother .
" I do n't understand why they have you come here and sit so someone can mediate — we can mediate just fine , " she said , shaking her head about the errant father who was n't supporting his kids .
" It just adds up and adds up and adds up . "
Inside one of the three packed IV - D courtrooms — with its voluminous child support docket — Associate Judge Sean Finn scolded a tall blond man in a suit who had consistently missed his payments .
" You need to understand that you need to pay your child support each and every month , not just before you come to court , " the judge said loudly , his face stern .
The man nodded .
" She 's losing time off her job to come down here and get money from you that you 're not paying , and I do n't want to bring her down here again . "
These are the types of scenes most people think of when they hear the words " child support " or " deadbeat dads " — frustrated single mothers who turn to the state for help as they struggle to care for their children while thwarted by men who skip town , wo n't work or simply refuse to pay .
Hanschen , who as a judge has sent dozens of deadbeat dads to jail , is more than a little familiar with such problems .
It 's just that other problems seem to be largely ignored .
" The vast majority of the work the Attorney General does is necessary — it 's providing legal services to poor people , and we need to have child support , " he says .
" There are , however , some huge holes that have been created by these laws . "
On a March afternoon in the chambers of his 254th Court , Hanschen wears his trademark gray hair pulled back in a long braid .
His intense blue eyes and gray beard make him look a bit like a bookish Gandalf the Grey .
Speaking slowly and methodically , he lays out his concerns about the laws governing the presumption of paternity , especially the four - year statute of limitations .
" I 'm not out to destroy anything .
I just want the right dad paying child support or going to jail for not paying . "
Twelve years ago when in private practice , Hanschen represented a client who came to him after a girlfriend he had n't seen in a decade showed up with a 10 - year - old and announced it was his .
The man , a barber in Oak Cliff , took the woman at her word and signed an Acknowledgement of Paternity , the legal document that makes a man the legal father until the child reaches 18 .
The man later became suspicious and got a DNA test that showed he was n't the father .
But it was too late .
" They hit him with $ 32,000 in back child support , " Hanschen says .
" He lost his business and went underground . "
As a judge , Hanschen 's first problem with the practices of the attorney general 's Child Support Division occurred in February 2007 , shortly after he had taken the bench .
Because he knew he would be hearing many appeals from the IV - D courts , he decided to learn how things were being done there .
He noticed that when a man arrived , an assistant attorney general would ask him if he had a lawyer .
If he said no , as most did , the attorney simply told him to sign in .
Hanschen glanced at the signed papers and discovered that the forms were actually appearance sheets .
After the lines for name , address and phone number , a paragraph at the end stated , " I wish to avail myself of the jurisdiction of this court and hereby make my appearance in this case for all purposes . "
By signing it , Hanschen says , the men were giving up their right to challenge the court 's jurisdiction over them .
After discussing his concerns with several judges and lawyers , he directed the IV - D judges , as well as the assistant attorneys general in each of the child support courts , to stop using the forms or to remove the last paragraph and signature line .
The attorney general staffers in one court only stopped after a conversation that Hanschen describes as " forceful . "
Jerry Strickland , the attorney general 's communications director , confirms that these forms are no longer used in Dallas County but defends their use elsewhere in the state .
" They allowed our staff to note who appeared in court on a given day , " Strickland says .
" They had no legal effect on the outcome of parents ' cases . "
But to Hanschen , there could have been adverse effects .
If no one explained to them their rights and what the form meant , he wonders , what else was n't being explained ?
UT 's Sampson does n't take as dire a view of the appearance sheets as Hanschen , noting that the men had already received notice and could still request DNA testing .
But he agreed that the process can be inequitable .
" It 's kind of unfair to get someone to sign something they do n't understand , " he says .
" Some of them can't read , they 're poor — so their chances of understanding everything they sign is the same as you understanding everything on an insurance policy ...
And the worst thing here is it 's for 18 years . "
Indeed , once unmarried men sign an Acknowledgement of Paternity — either in the hospital when the child is born or afterward in the IV - D courts , contesting paternity — with or without DNA proof — can be a daunting task .
" If a man goes out and gets DNA testing that says it 's not his child , but it 's after four years , he 's screwed , " says a local assistant attorney general who asked not to be named .
" You 've got 17 - year - old kids signing these things , and they do n't even know what they 're doing . "
When hospital staffers ask fathers to sign the form , the paperwork cites DNA testing as an option , but young , unwed fathers are unlikely to request it in front of the mother and her family .
" I had a recent case where both parents were 16 , " the attorney says .
" Both families are there — when is he supposed to say , ' I want DNA ? '
He'd be accusing her of sleeping with someone else . "
It 's important for children to have fathers , the lawyer adds , but " now you 've just allowed a mother to name whoever she wants to name , and if the guy is gullible or ignorant enough to sign it , he 's stuck . "
Hanschen 's second problem with the Child Support Division procedures arose last summer , when he heard about a case in which a man , ordered to pay child support , said he had n't gotten notice of the proceedings against him .
By law , the attorney general 's office may notify presumed fathers of these proceedings with a first - class letter instead of personal service by a constable , deputy sheriff or process server .
If the man does n't get the letter — for example , if his address has changed — and fails to show up for court , a default judgment is entered against him , and he can no longer contest paternity or the amount of child support .
These letters , Hanschen says , are not adequate notice .
" The Family Code laws are in conflict .
One says you have to be served by a process server , with instructions to let you know this is serious stuff , as opposed to a one - page letter that says , ' Come down and talk , ' " he maintains .
" To give people proper due process rights , you have to give them proper notice . "
Strickland , however , says the Child Support Division does in fact serve most presumed fathers by a constable or sheriff .
But men often dodge service .
" Obviously there are non-custodial parents who are not living up to their responsibility , " he says .
Yet Hanschen is n't the only judge who has problems with the division 's efforts to notify presumed fathers .
Family court Judge Tena Callahan , who also came to the bench in the Democratic sweep , says she 's had several child support cases with the attorney general 's office in which inadequate notice has come up .
" It 's a problem , " she says .
" The presumption is they get [ the letter ] , but sometimes they do n't .
And next thing they know they 're getting child support taken out of their paychecks . "

Whether men feel wronged by inadequate notice , misguided legal principles or dishonest mothers , those who find themselves paying for children who are n't theirs can turn to advocacy organizations that fight what they call paternity fraud .
Carnell Smith , founder and executive director of Georgia - based U.S. Citizens Against Paternity Fraud , organized the group after discovering that a child he 'd supposedly fathered with a former girlfriend and supported to the tune of $ 40,000 over 11 years was n't actually his .
The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear his case , but Smith finally was relieved of the financial burden by legislation , which he has successfully spearheaded in several states — including Georgia — that allows men to use DNA tests to disprove previously acknowledged paternity .
Smith says thousands of men across the country have contacted him since he started the group in 2001 , but he also hears from women , mostly the wives of men wrongly paying child support .
Dallas resident Belinda Odum - Gaston founded Texas Families Against Paternity
Fraud after a lengthy legal battle to free her husband of financial responsibility for a child he did n't father .
He had signed an Acknowledgement of Paternity after a woman with whom he'd had an affair claimed he fathered her son .
Odum - Gaston received a statement showing that the attorney general 's office was seizing their joint tax refund to pay child support — her first indication that her husband had engaged in an affair and fathered a child .
She confronted her husband , who had little contact with the child , and convinced him to get DNA testing .
After test results revealed her husband was not the biological father , Odum - Gaston hired a private investigator to track down the real father and confirm his paternity .
" I was devastated [ by the affair ] , but I was more devastated by how my husband was played , " Odum - Gaston says .
" I can't do anything about what two consenting adults did , but I damn sure can do something to protect the estate I 've worked to accumulate . "
Though the attorney general 's office fought review of the case , the couple hired an attorney .
They were relieved of the child support obligation , winning a $ 4,000 judgment against the mother .
To avoid such entanglements , Smith proposes that paternity testing be required before presumed fathers sign anything .
Opponents say it would reduce fatherhood to biology alone and ruin family stability by allowing men who have already established fatherly relationships with children to disappear from their lives .
But to Hanschen and fellow family court judges Cherry and Callahan , the so - called family integrity protected by current law is often nonexistent .
" What kind of integrity does this family have when someone is perpetrating a fraud against someone else ? "
Callahan says .
" The law does n't seem to care . "
Cherry agrees , saying more access to paternity testing would cut down on fraud and give judges more discretion to determine what 's best for families on a case - by - case basis .
" You may have a father who says , ' I do n't care if he 's not mine , he 's my baby , ' " she says .
" But if there 's a question , especially when there 's misrepresentation and fraud , to slam the door shut [ on paternity testing ] is an injustice . "
" I think the child has an innate right to know who his biological parents are , " Hanschen adds , pointing out the importance of genetic testing for health reasons such as identifying hereditary diseases .
" Part of the Family Code is that the child 's interest overrides everything — I can't figure out how it's in the child 's interest to lie to him about who his parents are . "
Jack W. Marr , president of the Family Law Foundation , which lobbies lawmakers on family law issues , says presumptive fatherhood bears re-examination by the Texas Legislature .
In a one - year period between 2005 and 2006 , he says , at least eight cases in which presumed fathers turned out not to be biological fathers were sent to appeals courts statewide ( Hanschen points out that since most of the division 's cases involve indigent men who can't afford a lawyer much less an appeal , the number of contested cases is likely much higher ) .
" That tells me that in Texas there 's a serious problem that needs to be addressed , " Marr says .
" We 're trying to solve it . "
Recent legislative attempts have been unsuccessful , but the House Committee on Juvenile Justice and Family Issues is slated to address the problem in the next legislative session .
In the 2007 session , Houston state Representative Harold Dutton Jr. wrote a bill that would have made DNA testing available to men in divorce cases , ordered non-biological fathers to pay no more than $ 100 per month and allowed them to maintain relationships with children without necessarily being financially responsible for them .
The bill died in the State Senate .
For now , Marr says , his group has agreed to wait on the " sticky wicket " of married men and focus its efforts in the next session on resolving the notice issue by requiring personal service of process .
" The whole thing is based on expediency for the attorney general 's office .
They do n't want to serve people personally , " Marr says .
" We 're going to address situations where there are defaults and allow these people to come in and get DNA testing . "

The way Antonio found out about his wife 's child support claim was fairly haphazard .
He was digging through a pile of mail at his mother 's house last August when he found a letter from the Office of the Attorney General 's Child Support Division .
It instructed him to appear in court the following week .
He was surprised and angry .
Because his wife had n't let him see the children in nearly two years , he says , he tried visiting them in school .
But they were in class , so he left $ 2,000 with administrators to give to them .
" After all this time not knowing about the kids , she files for child support ? " he says .
" I was upset . "
On August 30 , he appeared in IV - D court , and after Antonio raised the question of paternity , Judge Finn ordered DNA testing .
The attorney general 's office appealed the order , which would become relevant again when Antonio 's wife filed for divorce in September .
Her attorney declined to comment because the case is ongoing .
Antonio hired his own attorney , Kathy Ehmann - Clardy , and on January 14 , they appeared before Hanschen on the issue of DNA testing .
Ehmann - Clardy figured that they had a decent chance of winning :
She 'd been involved in a similar case where Hanschen ordered DNA testing for a divorcing father who had a relationship with his presumed children .
Hanschen did n't disappoint .
" It is clearly in the children 's best interest to know who their father is , " he announced from the bench .
" It is clearly in the state 's best interest to know who the father is so the correct person can be paying child support ... Testing ordered immediately . "
In an interview , Hanschen would argue that current law does n't give fathers equal protection and requires that a court enforce " a lie " when the truth is just a lab test away .
" I 'm bound to uphold the laws of Texas , unless I find them to be unconstitutional , " he says .
" People get all upset about the term ' activist judges ' — we 're not making up laws here , we 're saying there 's a problem ... and we need the appellate system to sort it out for us . "
UT 's Sampson says the appellate courts have spoken to the issue and have consistently upheld the four - year limitation .
And that is precisely what the 5th Court of Appeals did on January 16 , when not two days after Hanschen ruled , Justice Wright stayed his order for testing .
And then 10 days later , after the appeals court learned the DNA test already had been conducted , the appeals court ordered the results sealed .
On March 12 , a panel of justices agreed with the attorney general 's position that Hanschen had gone too far by ordering the testing .
" [ A ] lthough the judge 's position is that there should be no statute of limitations on the truth and it's in the best interests of the children to know who their father is , " wrote Justice Douglas S. Lang , " such determinations are a matter for the Legislature , not the trial court . "
Hanschen counters that if a trial court fails to make a declaration about a law 's shortcomings , there 's no way for a higher court to review it .
Hanschen might find himself in a position to review the issue if it comes up in a subsequent case ; he is running for a seat on the all - Republican 5th Court of Appeals in the November election .
One Dallas family lawyer finds Hanschen 's actions " regal " and " ego - driven , " while maintaining that most lawyers who have considered the subject feel the four - year statute of limitations is bad law .
" But it is the law — and Hanschen is saying , ' I do n't like it , so I 'm just not going to follow it , ' " the lawyer says .
" He 's set himself up as above the law . "
Whether Hanschen is a principled jurist or a rogue judge , he is drawing attention to a controversial area of law that impacts millions nationwide .
" You 've got a judge sitting up there saying , ' Hey , there 's something wrong here , ' " says Marr , of the Family Law Foundation .
" It highlights the seriousness of the issue , and the problem is n't going to go away just because there 's presently a gotcha clause in the law . "

In mid-February , rumors began spreading in the courthouse that the attorney general 's office had it out for a couple of the district judges .
Hanschen heard that higher - ups within the Child Support Division had begun collecting affidavits about him .
So did Judge Cherry , who also had clashed with the attorney general 's office over child support issues .
" Several AG employees told me they felt uncomfortable because the people at the regional office were asking them for negative information about me and some of the other district judges , " Cherry recalls .
" I thought it was bizarre behavior from a government agency . "
On February 1 , supervisors within the division had begun asking staff attorneys if they 'd ever heard the two judges make derogatory comments about the office .
One assistant attorney general , who requested anonymity , recalls telling supervisors about an occasion when Hanschen had derided the office .
( The judge has referred to supervising attorneys within the division as " black - booted government thugs " and " shits . "
Hanschen admits that he can be " quite blunt at times . " )
Most of the attorneys who were asked to submit complaints against Hanschen and Cherry assumed their bosses were planning to hold a meeting with the judges .
But later e-mails from James Jones , a senior regional attorney supervising the Dallas Child Support Division , suggested the attorney general 's office might be planning to file a complaint against these judges with the State Commission on Judicial Conduct .
In a February 4 e-mail , Jones wrote , " I want to thank everyone who responded to my request concerning Judge Hanschen and Judge Cherry .
I will respond individually to everyone who submitted an incident ... [ A certain assistant attorney general ] will then prepare an affidavit for you to sign ... We want to expedite this in an effort to get all the affidavits to Austin by Thursday .
We need your responses to my individual e-mails ASAP . "
To some staffers , this was a red flag .
" When I hear affidavit and Austin , I think you 're trying to file a judicial misconduct complaint on someone , " says one assistant attorney general .
" Filing a judicial misconduct charge against a judge if they have n't done anything — you'd be blackballed .
If you get fired , where you gonna go ? "
Many of the division attorneys in Dallas who were contacted agreed to sign affidavits , but several refused .
On February 7 , Jones sent this e-mail : " Some of you have indicated your concern as to what will happen if a complaint is filed with the SCJC , and that it will be uncomfortable and unpleasant appearing in the 254th Family District Court after Judge Hanschen is aware of our complaint ... We must protect our AAGs and a motion to recuse is an absolute necessity . "
A recusal would mean an attempt to have Hanschen and Cherry removed from thousands of cases .
" Again , I appreciate very much the courage it took for each of you to step forward , " Jones concluded .
On February 8 , an assistant attorney general ( who declined to speak with the Observer ) refused to complain about the judges .
" At this time , " he wrote in a group e-mail , " I do not want to participate in any activity regarding Judge Hanschen except regular court matters . "
Jones replied : " Detail for me why you feel you have the right to disregard Article 8.03 b of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct . "
( The ethics rule requires lawyers to report instances of judicial misconduct . )
But the assistant countered : " I took your initial request of us to mean that you were interested in things that Judge Hanschen and Judge Cherry have done which we felt were inappropriate .
This has now escalated to the point where you wish me to claim professional misconduct against a district judge .
If I am to risk myself , and my reputation , I certainly want to make sure I have the grounds to do so . "
Although the attorney wrote that he did not agree with some of Hanschen 's " methods or motives , " he felt they " did not raise a substantial question as to the judge 's fitness for office . "
Jones declined to comment for this story , referring all questions to the attorney general 's press office .
Strickland , the communications director , summarized the office 's position in a written statement .
" Attorneys in our Dallas - area offices expressed serious concerns about certain judges ' courtroom conduct and perceived bias against the Child Support Division and the child support collection process , " he wrote .
" Because that conduct posed a potential threat to the children who depend upon this office for child support , more information was sought about certain judges ' alleged misconduct .
The objective was an informal gathering of voluntary factual statements from concerned staff attorneys . "
But the relentless manner in which superiors went about gathering these affidavits raises questions about how voluntary they truly are .
Strickland even acknowledges that staff attorneys have raised concerns about the statement collection process and said the division is conducting a review .
As for potential complaints against the judges , he says the jury 's still out .
" No final decision has yet been made as to whether the underlying complaints warrant filing a complaint with the Commission on Judicial Conduct . "

To Antonio , who is now 30 , the legal and political clashes between two governmental bodies are meaningless .
The important thing for him is to somehow sort out what to do about his broken family and get on with his life .
He wants the lawsuits to be over , but with the recent Court of Appeals decision and the fact that settling his divorce would mean accepting legal paternity for all three children , there 's no end in sight .
On a recent afternoon , he sits in his lawyer 's office and talks about the three children he once thought were his .
He says he misses taking them to the park and hearing them call him Dad .
The girls were just toddlers when he left , and even though he was n't much of a " girly " guy , he misses playing dolls with the older one .
When he was granted rights to see them early this year , his lawyer advised him against visiting the girls if he was going to contest paternity .
It might re-establish their bond and hurt his case .
It was a tough decision , but his bitterness at his wife 's betrayal and the financial hardship of supporting two non-biological children swayed him .
He would see only his son .
In January , father and son were reunited at a Chuck E. Cheese .
It was awkward at first , but after a few rounds of skeeball , the 8 - year - old loosened up and seemed to have fun .
They see each other every weekend now , visiting Antonio 's mother and going to the movies .
The boy 's 7 - year - old sister , meanwhile , is heartbroken .
She does n't understand why the man she still remembers as her father visits her brother but not her .
During a recent visit with his son , Antonio called his estranged wife to say he would be late dropping the boy off , and she told him the girl had been crying all day .
Her mother put her on the phone .
" She wanted me to buy her a toy , pick her up , " Antonio says , his face somber and resigned .
" I told her , ' Not right now . ' "
For now , Antonio hopes that one day , the hearings and the waiting and the legal fees will come to an end .
And as he strives to return to some semblance of normal life , he tries to remember the truth , and not to think about the little girl 's tears or wonder how things might have been different .

It ’s also on Google sat map :
Computers are commonly used as tools to design and manipulate three - dimensional objects but soon they may provide people with a way to sense the texture of those objects or feel how they fit together , says the creator of a haptic , or touch - based , interface at Carnegie Mellon University .
Most haptic interfaces rely on motors and mechanical linkages to provide some sense of touch or force feedback but the device developed by Ralph Hollis , research professor in Carnegie Mellon ’s Robotics Institute , uses magnetic levitation and a single moving part to give users a highly realistic experience .
Users can perceive textures , feel hard contacts and notice even slight changes in position while using an interface that responds rapidly to movements .
“ We believe this device provides the most realistic sense of touch of any haptic interface in the world today , ” said Hollis , whose research group built a working version of the device in 1997 .
With the help of a $ 300,000 National Science Foundation grant , however , he and his colleagues have improved its performance , enhanced its ergonomics and lowered its cost .
The grant also enabled them to build 10 copies , six of which are being distributed to haptic researchers across the U.S. and Canada .
“ We have gone from the prototype to a much more advanced system that other researchers can use , ” Hollis said .
Putting the instrument in the hands of other researchers is critical in a young , developing field such as haptic technology , he emphasized .
Though haptic interfaces have uses in engineering design , entertainment , assembly , remote operation of robots , and in medical and dental training , their full potential has yet to be explored .
That ’s particularly the case for magnetic levitation haptic interfaces because so few have been available for use by researchers , he added .
“ This is an affordable device that ’s also practical , ” said Hollis , who has started a spinoff company to build additional devices .
“ Now other people can have this technology , and this represents technology transfer in the very real sense . ”
Six devices will be delivered to researchers at Harvard , Stanford , Purdue and Cornell , as well as to the universities of Utah and British Columbia .
All are members of the Magnetic Levitation Haptic Consortium , an international group dedicated to fostering increased use of this technology .
Hong Tan , associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue University and a consortium member , studies human perception of fine surface textures — work that requires simulation resolution at the micron level .
“ This is beyond the capability of most commercially available haptic devices , but the maglev device developed by Dr. Hollis will make it possible for us to continue this research , ” she said .
“ The field of haptic research and development is expanding rapidly , ” said Rob Conway , project manager in Carnegie Mellon ’s Center for Technology Transfer .
“ Carnegie Mellon ’s research opens new possibilities by joining the world of haptic feedback with a comfortable magnetic levitation interface .
The magnetic levitation decouples the interface device from the mechanical world , eliminating friction , backlash , jump , sticking and other interfering effects , so that the user feels only the artificial environment in complete accuracy down to the micro scale . ”
The system eliminates the bulky links , cables and general mechanical complexity of other haptic devices on the market today in favor of a single lightweight moving part that floats on magnetic fields .
At the heart of the maglev haptic interface is a bowl - shaped device called a flotor that is embedded with six coils of wire .
Electric current flowing through the coils interacts with powerful permanent magnets underneath , causing the flotor to levitate .
A control handle is attached to the flotor .
A user moves the handle much like a computer mouse , but in three dimensions with six degrees of freedom — up / down , side to side , back / forth , yaw , pitch and roll .
Optical sensors measure the position and orientation of the flotor , and this information is used to control the position and orientation of a virtual object on the computer display .
As this virtual object encounters other virtual surfaces and objects , corresponding signals are transmitted to the flotor ’s electrical coils , resulting in haptic feedback to the user .
Hollis and his colleagues will demonstrate the new maglev haptic interfaces at the IEEE 16th Symposium on Haptic Interfaces for Virtual Environments and Teleoperator Systems , March 13 - 14 in Reno , Nevada .

Excerpt from a Cybercast News Service article :
[…]
Conyers admitted , however , that he was “ struggling ” with a decision on whether to try impeaching Bush before the election .
The Judiciary Committee , which Conyers chairs , would ordinarily conduct an impeachment inquiry , if there is one , and approve any Articles of Impeachment for consideration by the full House .
( In 1998 , the Republican - controlled Judiciary Committee conducted impeachment proceedings against then - President Bill Clinton .
Rep.
Conyers says that he introduced the first resolution to impeach Richard Nixon , and he also wanted to impeach President Ronald Reagan over the invasion of Grenada , introducing a resolution to that effect in Nov. 1983 . )
Swanson ( After Downing Street Organizer ) is n’t the only one who doubts Conyers will actually attempt to impeach Bush .
A former Conyers aide , who asked not to be named , told Cybercast News Service he agreed with Swanson ’s analysis .
“ He will never do it , ” said the former aide .
“ This is just rhetoric , and it is not part of the agenda .
It ’s mostly just a red herring to the Republicans . ”

The Helix Nebula does not naturally appear with the colors shown above ; however , the tinting of the image is artificial .
The picture ’s “ Eye of God ” appellation is a title coined by an admirer of the photograph due to the nebula ’s resemblance to a human eye , not something designated by NASA , and the nebula is also visible all the time , not merely “ once in 3000 years . ”
I 'm not about to call this a trend yet , but I 've seen a few meetings at work in recent months that advertised and enforced a " no laptop " rule .
Part of me thinks that it 's a great idea .
There are meetings I 've almost skipped or found fairly useless because a significant proportion of the people in the room were suffering from continuous partial attention and often seemed lost or constantly behind the curve .
Another part of me thinks that it 's absolutely ridiculous that we have to mandate common courtesy and force people off their laptops long enough to have a useful meeting .
I wonder what , if anything , schools ( mostly college ) are doing to help ensure that this is n't a problem in the workplace as more and more students start working full - time .
Do they know how to put away the laptop or cell phone when the time comes ?
Maybe the problem is that the people " at the top " of many companies set a bad example , walking down the hallway with their eyes glued to a Blackberry screen or constantly plugged into a Borg - like bluetooth headset .
Have you seen " no laptop " meetings starting to emerge in your organization yet ?

State poll shows huge gains by Obama , McCain CALIFORNIA RACE : Democratic contest tightens while McCain stretches his lead

A startling surge of support for Barack Obama has catapulted the Illinois senator into a virtual tie with Hillary Rodham Clinton in California 's Democratic presidential primary , a Field Poll released Saturday shows .
Arizona Sen .
John McCain lengthened his lead in the state Republican primary , grabbing a 32 to 24 percent edge among likely voters over former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney .
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was at 13 percent and Texas Rep. Ron Paul at 10 percent .
But the Democratic numbers are the shocker .
Clinton , a longtime California favorite , saw her once - commanding lead slip to two percentage points , 36 to 34 percent , in the new survey .
That 's down from the New York senator 's 12 percentage point lead in mid-January and a 25 percentage point margin over Obama in October .
But with 18 percent of Democratic voters still undecided just days before Tuesday 's primary , the election is still up for grabs , said Mark DiCamillo , the poll 's director .
" It 's an unusually volatile election , with a very high number of undecided voters and so many moving parts , " he said .
" It could be a very , very close election . "
The head - to - head matchups between the Republican and Democratic candidates highlight both Clinton 's loosening hold on California voters and McCain 's growing strength in the state .
Clinton now clings to a bare 45 to 43 percent lead over McCain in a projected California presidential vote , down dramatically from her 17 percentage point margin just two weeks ago .
Obama now holds a stronger 47 to 40 percent margin over the Arizona senator , but that 's only half the 14 percentage point advantage he had in mid-January .
Both Democrats still run well ahead of Romney , collecting more than 50 percent of the vote in those matchups .
Obama 's California campaign team said the latest polls reflect a hard - charging effort to track down potential voters in every precinct - undeterred by polls that showed the Illinois senator behind by double digits here for most of the race .
" If we had n't laid the groundwork for the last year , we could n't be delivering now , " Debbie Mesloh , spokeswoman for the Obama campaign , said Saturday .
Averell " Ace " Smith , Clinton 's California campaign manager , said the last - minute dead heat is to be expected in the nation 's most populous state , which is " critical " to Clinton 's effort to win the nomination .
" We always knew it would tighten , " he said .
" But we 're incredibly confident in the organization we have to get out the vote . "
The new poll shows why Obama 's campaign has been targeting decline - to - state voters , who can cast ballots in the Democratic primary .
While Clinton has a 37 to 31 percent lead over Obama among Democrats , Obama leads by an overwhelming 54 to 32 percent among nonpartisans , who will make up an estimated 13 percent of the primary voters .
The poll also highlights the dramatic split the Clinton - Obama battle has caused in the state 's Democratic Party .
Rich versus poor , young versus old , liberal versus conservative , men versus women : Each of those groups has lined up on different sides of the primary divide .
While people aged 18 to 29 back Obama by a margin of 11 percentage points , voters 65 and older support Clinton , 40 to 18 percent .
Voters with household incomes of $ 40,000 or less back Clinton by an advantage of 11 percentage points , while those making $ 80,000 or more are strong Obama supporters .
Obama attracts voters who call themselves liberal , who have gone to graduate school and who are from the Bay Area , which backs him 41 to 31 percent .
Clinton 's strength is among conservatives and moderates , those with a high school education and residents of sprawling Los Angeles County , where she holds a 42 to 34 percent lead .
There 's also a broad ethnic and gender gap between the campaigns .
While white voters are split evenly between Clinton and Obama , the Illinois senator , whose late father was a black African , has a 55 to 19 percent lead among black voters , while Latinos back Clinton 52 to 19 percent .
Among men , Obama holds a 13 percentage point lead , the same advantage Clinton holds among women .
But for Clinton , even her good numbers show some ominous changes .
In mid-January , the Field Poll showed her with a 19 percentage point lead among women and a huge 59 to 19 percent advantage with Latino voters .
In two weeks , much of that backing has melted away .
While part of the reason for the huge number of undecided voters is last week 's departure of John Edwards from the race , most of it seems to be honest angst among Democrats pressed to make a choice between two favored candidates , DiCamillo said .
" This is the Democratic rank and file having a hard time making a choice , because they like them both , " he said .
On the Republican side , McCain continues to make an astounding comeback in a state where he was virtually given up for dead just months ago .
He 's moved from 12 percent in December to 22 percent in mid-January to 32 percent and the lead in the most recent poll .
" McCain 's had a very good month , " DiCamillo said .
" He also benefits from Huckabee , who peels off some votes from Romney . "
McCain 's lead comes courtesy of a strong showing among moderate and moderately conservative Republicans , where he holds a 39 to 16 percent advantage over Romney .
Steve Schmidt , a senior strategist for McCain , said the new poll numbers reflect a national surge for the Arizona senator .
" From California to Massachusetts , Sen. McCain is on the move and getting ready for a big night on Tuesday , " said Schmidt .
But Romney spokeswoman Sarah Pompeii said the latest figures will not stop them from pushing hard in California .
So much of the election still depends on who turns out to vote on Tuesday , which DiCamillo admitted is the hardest thing to project .
" There are cautionary notes , " he said .
" With those big differences among ( Democratic ) subgroups , an unexpectedly large turnout by any one of them can shift the final result .
We do n't know if Obama 's surge will continue or if something will arrest it in the days before the election . "
Both Democratic campaigns were working hard in the Bay Area on Saturday .
Chelsea Clinton , the 27 - year - old daughter of Sen. Clinton , spoke Saturday to hundreds of students at Oakland 's Mills College , while Massachusetts Sen .
John Kerry was in San Francisco to boost Obama 's campaign .
Kerry was pleased Obama was closing the gap in California , but warned that " we 've got to try even harder over the next few days because there are all of these absentee ballots out there - people who voted a few weeks ago when they thought the race was a foregone conclusion ( for Clinton ) .
It 's proven not to be . "
The poll was based on a telephone survey of 511 likely voters in the Democratic primary and 481 likely voters in the Republican primary and was conducted between Jan. 25 and Feb .
1 . The margin of error is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points among Democrats , plus or minus 4.6 percentage points among Republicans and plus or minus 4.2 percentage points among general election voters .
“ If you made public all the information that the FBI have on this case , you will see very high - level people going through criminal trials , ” she said .
Her story shows just how much the West was infiltrated by foreign states seeking nuclear secrets .
It illustrates how western government officials turned a blind eye to , or were even helping , countries such as Pakistan acquire bomb technology .
The wider nuclear network has been monitored for many years by a joint Anglo - American intelligence effort .
But rather than shut it down , investigations by law enforcement bodies such as the FBI and Britain ’s Revenue & Customs have been aborted to preserve diplomatic relations .
The Turks and Israelis had planted “ moles ” in military and academic institutions which handled nuclear technology .
Edmonds says there were several transactions of nuclear material every month , with the Pakistanis being among the eventual buyers .
“ The network appeared to be obtaining information from every nuclear agency in the United States , ” she said .
They were helped , she says , by the high - ranking State Department official who provided some of their moles – mainly PhD students – with security clearance to work in sensitive nuclear research facilities .
In one conversation Edmonds heard the official arranging to pick up a $ 15,000 cash bribe .
The package was to be dropped off at an agreed location by someone in the Turkish diplomatic community who was working for the network .
The Turks , she says , often acted as a conduit for the Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , Pakistan ’s spy agency , because they were less likely to attract suspicion .
Venues such as the American Turkish Council in Washington were used to drop off the cash , which was picked up by the official .
The Pakistani operation was led by General Mahmoud Ahmad , then the ISI chief .
Intercepted communications showed Ahmad and his colleagues stationed in Washington were in constant contact with attachés in the Turkish embassy .
Intelligence analysts say that members of the ISI were close to Al - Qaeda before and after 9/11 .
real
How the hell could Ahmed get away with all of this ?
The ISI Director worked closely with the CIA for many years , and it is known that he met with Richard Armitage , a key player in the Reagan , Bush I and Bush II administrations .
( Armitage helped stop Valerie Plame 's efforts against nuke proliferation , and signed the infamous PNAC letter which laid the groundwork for the Iraq debacle . )
The results of the espionage were almost certainly passed to Abdul Qadeer Khan , the Pakistani nuclear scientist .
Khan was close to Ahmad and the ISI .
While running Pakistan ’s nuclear programme , he became a millionaire by selling atomic secrets to Libya , Iran and North Korea .
He also used a network of companies in America and Britain to obtain components for a nuclear programme .
her
Edmonds was later to see the scope of the Pakistani connections when it was revealed that one of her fellow translators at the FBI was the daughter of a Pakistani embassy official who worked for Ahmad .
The translator was given top secret clearance despite protests from FBI investigators .
One of the CIA sources confirmed that the Turks had acquired nuclear secrets from the United States and shared the information with Pakistan and Israel .
“ We have no indication that Turkey has its own nuclear ambitions .
But the Turks are traders .
To my knowledge they became big players in the late 1990s , ” the source said .
She approached The Sunday Times last month after reading about an Al - Qaeda terrorist who had revealed his role in training some of the 9/11 hijackers while he was in Turkey .
within
However , Edmonds said : “ He was aiding foreign operatives against US interests by passing them highly classified information , not only from the State Department but also from the Pentagon , in exchange for money , position and political objectives . ”
She claims that the FBI was also gathering evidence against senior Pentagon officials – including household names – who were aiding foreign agents .

Furthermore , the language specialist has repeatedly stated in past interviews that investigations into pre-9/11 terrorist financing activities were blocked “ per State Department request ” , leaving open the question whether it was Mr. Grossman , then Undersecretary of State for European Affairs , who actively hindered investigations into the Turkey - Bin Laden link .
Terrorists had a lot of drug money .
They used that money to buy officials in the U.S. , who allowed moles to enter our most sensitive installations .

According to the Turkish newspaper Zaman , 2000 was the year when the Americans " turned " Sakka , who received an unspecified ( but large ) amount of money from the CIA .
More than that :
He received protection during his time in Turkey -- while he ran those Al Qaeda training camps .
Then came his mysterious sojourn in Germany in 2000 - 2001 .
During this period , he appears to have met Atta -- and then he went " underground .
Germany 's BND -- their version of the CIA -- aided Sakka while he was on the run .
This , despite the fact that Sakka was considered a wanted man in Germany , due to his role in earlier terror plots .
In late 2005 , after Sakra ’s arrest in Turkey ( see July 30 , 2005 ) , the German television news show Panorama will report that the German BKA ( Federal Office of Criminal Investigation ) suspects the German BND ( Federal Intelligence Service ) to have helped Sakra escape from Germany in late 2001 .
Supposedly , German police had learned where he was staying in Germany , but the BND enabled him to escape via France to Syria in order to prevent further investigations about him .
Panorama will report that Sakra was secretly still working for Syrian intelligence and was giving them information about al - Qaeda ’s leadership .
Sakra will go on to mastermind a series of suicide bombings in Istanbul , Turkey , in 2003 ...
We cannot know what Sakka was up to in Syria , but one thing seems clear : Western intelligence placed greater value on his services than on bringing a 9/11 plotter to justice .
His protection continued in the face of the 1999 plots , the 9/11 tragedy , and the 2003 bombings .
It ended only when he decided to go after Israeli ships .
At his 2005 trial , his lawyer offered an intriguing observation :
Sakra ’s lawyer will claim that if Sakra revealed all that he knew , “ a few states would collapse . ”
And now for some previously - published words about General Mehmood Ahmed : According to various accounts :
1 . He wired money to Mohammed Atta shortly before the World Trade Center attacks .
2 . He employed R.G. Abbas , a Pakistani agent who -- while pointing toward the WTC complex -- told an undercover FBI informant that " those towers are coming down . "
3 . He arranged the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan .
4 . He sent fighters against India to be trained in Al Qaeda camps -- essentially using Osama Bin Laden 's jihadist movement as a cut-out .
5 . He helped arrange the escape of thousands of Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters into Pakistan .
6 . He is said to have have arranged -- or so runs a widely - held belief -- the fake arrest of WTC attack mastermind Khaled Sheihk Mohammed .
Here is what Sibel said about Ahmed last year , in a phone call with lukery ( when she still felt bound by the gag order ) : " You seem to know how to connect some of these dots ; do so pretty well .
Yet , even some of the savvy media here do n't get it ( or do n't want to ! ) .
You picked the Zogby report , even though it was written a while ago ( good research ) ; cleverly put it together with Mahmud , Grossman , and even Brewster Jennings ....
Joe Wilson met his wife , Plame , at ATC ( American Turkish Council ) in 1997 .
Look up his book , it is there .
Brewster Jennings ,
Plame , dealt with ATC , ATA , and Turkey a lot .
Her UC job took him* to Turkey more than 4 - 5 times to Turkey between 1997 & 2001 .
This info has been printed on the front - page of main Turkish papers .
IAI , International Advisors Inc , owned & operated by Perle & Feith , was set up & registered as ' Agents for Turkey . ' "
Also see lukery 's piece here :
The letter noted that Under Secretary Feith was a registered foreign agent for Turkey from 1989 - 1994 while serving as a principal for International Advisors Inc. , and that he was a special assistant to Richard Perle at the Defense Department , while Perle was a paid consultant for IAI for Turkey .
Feith negotiated an $ 800,000 contract for IAI with Turkey in 1989 and a $ 600,000 annual contract through 1994 .
They proposed that this should require Mr. Feith and Mr. Perle to remove themselves from matters concerning US - Turkey relations .
The letter also urges the President not to give Turkey any of the $ 228 million authorized by Congress for Turkey at the initiative of the Defense Department , until an investigation is made into the circumstances of its initiation .
" When Richard Perle was the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security from 1981 - 1987 during the Reagan Administration , he led the successful effort to give massive grant military aid to Turkey , " they wrote , adding that Feith was on his staff at the time .
" Wolfowitz and Grossman actively supported sending high levels of arms to Turkey .
Weapons supplied by the US were used by the Turkish army against the Kurds since 1984 and are being used at the present time . "
[ snip ]
The World Policy Institute and the Federation of American Scientists have documented the US arms trade with Turkey and its harmful effects on US interests in a comprehensive joint report , " Arming Repression : US Arms Sales to Turkey During the Clinton Administration . " "
A reader named Tom sent in this interesting response : While Mahmood undoubtedly is a " most taboo suspect " re : 9/11 financing and the Pak military role in cultivating Taliban / al - Qaeda elements in Afghanistan , Kashmir , Iran , etc . there are many other top ISI / Army officers -- including Musharraf himself -- playing similar roles .
Despite his cultivated image as a " pro-Western , anti-extremist " leader , Musharraf initiated the provocative " Kargil " fiasco that nearly led to nuclear war between India and Pakistan in the 1990s .
A protege of former ISI director Hamid Gul , Musharraf himself ( like Gul , Mahmood Ahmad ) has always sought to destabilize Afghanistan as a wedge against India ( the so - called policy of " strategic depth " ) .
It was Musharraf who facilitated the rise of various Kashmiri jihadi groups ( Lashkar - e - Taiba [ LeT ] , Jaish - e - Mohammed [ JeM ] ) -- al - Qaeda associates still in existence !
Additionally , Musharraf was instrumental in continuing General Zia and Gul 's nuclear proliferation policies as Pak military cash cow ( known and covered - up by successive US administration 's from Carter to Bush II ) .
In my opinion , it is a mistake to view these events , up to and including Bhutto 's assassination , as the actions of " rogue " elements within the Pakistani military establishment .
Indeed , these elements are the establishment , Musharraf included .
Having said this , we should also not forget that Pakistan 's ISI continues to be instrumental in the explosive growth of Afghanistan 's drug trade .
These too , are hardly the actions of " rogue " operatives , but rather constitute a formidable reservoir of funds for various ISI " black operations . "
Just like the CIA !
My final question is :
What is the role of Israel in all of this ?
Remember , the moles were Israeli as well as Turkish and Pakistani .
Sakka and the spooks : I 'm still not sure why news reports about this man triggered Edmonds to go into action .
But the following may be of interest .

I am honored that you chose my ad for a mini fridge out of all the ads you could have chosen .
It makes me feel good that my mini fridge will be supplying you with the ice cold beverages you 've obviously become accustomed to .
Next time you answer one of my ads , please note the following : 1. I am not Home Depot .
If you travel thirty minutes to pick up a bulky 40 - pound object , please come prepared with the necessary items you 'll need to secure it to your vehicle .
Yes , I have rope .
I have a lot of rope .
I have many different colors and sizes of rope .
No , you can not have my rope .
The ad said I was giving away a fridge , not a fridge with rope .
Nor was I offering a fridge with padding so that the pleather seats on your piece of crap 89 ford pinto with no hub caps car do n't get marked up .
2 .
What part of ' must pick up ' in the ad was confusing to you ?
Yes , I have a vehicle .
No , I do n't want to haul your fridge all the way to East Bumble Fuck on the coldest day of the year .
No , I 'm really really sure I do n't want to do that .
No , really .
I 'm sure .
3 . Please call me only once with ALL your questions .
I left for the day , and had 5 messages on my answering machine , the last one was at 11:30 pm .
Frankly lady , you were sounding a bit too crazy by the end of the day .
It 's a fridge .
A small metal box that keeps shit cold .
I do n't have the fridge 's family tree .
For all I know the fridge 's was conceived by a slutty young Maytag that graced some hillbilly 's side porch .
I do n't know the exact age of the fridge .
I bought it a few years ago , I used it for a couple of months , ok , I lied , I used it a whole year .
The fact is , you 're not buying a race horse , you 're buying a used fridge .
4 .
No , I will not throw in a couple bucks of gas money to pick it up because your anal retentive eyes picked up the ittiest , bittiest hairline scratch with a microscope so it wasnt completly described .
I 'm not making judgements on you , but I 'm pretty damn sure Donald Trump did n't send you across the state to pick up a used fridge for Trump Towers .
Though I 'd wager the whole concept of the mini - fridge bar is a familar one to you .
5 .
Yes , you can unplug a fridge without any harm to the fridge .
Believe me , the fridge is fine .
The manufacturers have figured out a way to extend the life of a fridge that has been unplugged .
Yes , I 'm absolutely sure of that .
No , you did not have to leave 2 messages about your concerns with the fridge being unplugged , and frankly it was a little embarrassing having the same conversation with you in my driveway where my neighbors could hear .
6 .
No , I do n't have the operating instructions .
I can write them down for you though : Plug fridge in .
Open door .
Put crap inside .
Take crap out when it 's cold .
Eat or drink crap .
7 .
I am not a fridge pimp .
I do n't have any more fridges at that price .
No i dont have one in a diffrent color to match your other appliances , No , I do n't know where you can get another fridge just like this one for your friend .
Yes , I know it 's in great condition , and I 'm sure you 'd like your other crazy - as - bat - shit - mini - fridge - finding - friends to have one just like it , but this is all I have .
Here 's a thought , there 's this online classified ads website .
Yeah , you may have heard of it , it 's called CRAIGSLIST .
I dunno , maybe , just maybe , in this great land of ours , there 's another mini- fridge being advertised there .
8 .
Please remove my phone number from your address book .
I think our relationship is over .

Advertisement A 18 - year - old whose sight was failing has had his vision improved in a pioneering operation carried out by doctors at Moorfields Eye Hospital .
The London researchers used gene therapy to regenerate the dying cells in Steven Howarth 's right eye .
As a result he can now confidently walk alone in darkened rooms and streets for the first time .
Steven , from Bolton , is the third person to have the operation - doctors expect better results in future cases .
Before the procedure , he could hardly see at all at night and in time he would have lost his sight completely .
Confidence
His condition - Leber 's congenital amaurosis - was due to a faulty gene that meant that the light - detecting cells at the back of his eye were damaged and slowly degenerating further .
RETINAL GENE THERAPY -
STEP BY STEP
The operation involves injecting fluid with missing gene within a modified virus into the eye .
A fine needle ( cannula ) is passed through the front of the eye and across the vitreous gel .
The cannula is pushed through the retina , light sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye .
The fluid is injected beneath the retina , causing it to detach from the underlying pigment layer .
Cells in the pigment layer absorb the fluid and the retina returns to its normal position .
The virus infects cells of pigment layer , supplying the gene required for normal sight .
BACK NEXT 1 of 6 But , in a delicate operation , surgeons at Moorfields injected working copies of the gene into the back of Steven 's eye .
After a few months , doctors detected some improvements .
But Steven did not notice these changes until he confidently strode through a dimly - lit maze designed to test his vision .
Until then he had kept walking into walls - and it would take him nearly a minute to walk a few feet .
His doctors were shocked at the improvement .
Professor Robin Ali , of the Institute for Ophthalmology , who led the trial , said : " To get this indication after only three patients is hugely exciting .
" I find it difficult to remember being as excited as I am today about our science and what it might achieve . "
' Cracks in the pavement '
The operation gave Steven the confidence to try out his improved night - time vision on the streets near his home in Bolton .
Before he had only been able to see the bright lights of passing cars , street lamps and brightly - lit buildings but , to his amazement , he found he could see beyond the bright lights .
For the first time he could see the cracks on the pavement , the edge of the kerb and markings on the street .
He recently began walking home late at night from the railway station .
James Bainbridge , the consultant surgeon who carried out the operation , said : " It 's hugely rewarding and exciting to see that this new treatment can have this impact on a person 's quality of life . "

Steven also says that it has really helped his confidence .
He is now able to socialise more late at night with his friends .
And , as an aspiring musician , he says he can see the frets on his guitar better - and can move around more on a darkened stage .
There may well be further improvements .
But without the operation it was likely that Steven would have lost his sight altogether .
The prospect made him depressed .
Now he says he can get on with his life .
" When I used to think about it , it would get me really down and depressed .
But now I do n't have to think about it .
It 's a big burden lifted . "
Child sight hope
The gene therapy has not improved the vision of the other two patients who have received it so far - but it may well stop their vision from declining further .
Robert Johnson was the first person to undergo the operation , as reported by BBC News in May 2007 .
He welcomed the results so far : " For the team , I am thrilled that their hard work has come off .
This is only the beginning
James Bainbridge
Surgeon
" For me - I am simply pleased that I left what I entered with - a level of sight that gives me my freedom .
What more could I ask for ? "
Professor
Ali said that the team now hoped to treat children : " The next stage is to increase the dose of the gene which we anticipate will improve the outcome - and it's also to treat younger patients , who have better residual vision and in whom we expect to see a much greater benefit . "
Although the genetic condition that is being treated is rare , the researchers believe that their technique could be used to treat a wide variety of sight disorders , possibly even age - related sight loss .
Mr Bainbridge added : " This is only the beginning .
" What we 've demonstrated so far is proof of principle that gene therapy can be used to treat a particular gene disorder . "
The research , which has been funded by the Department of Health , has been published online in the New England Journal of Medicine .
Health Minister Dawn Primarolo said : " This is absolutely brilliant .
" It 's been done here in the UK with the expertise of the NHS and the science and research of the Department of Health all coming together to offer such hope for gene therapy for the correction of sight - but also for gene therapy generally . "
David Head , of the British Retinitis Pigmentosa Society , thanked Professor Ali and his team for their " outstanding " work .
He said : " Of course , we must temper our excitement and enthusiasm with an acknowledgement that these are very early days , and the trial is working on one flawed gene . "

What are these ?
Flicking through a day 's newspapers often feels like tackling a numerical assault course .
" Young people who use sunbeds increase their risk of skin cancer by 75 per cent " .
" Ninety - six per cent of children in European orphanages are not orphans " .
" In the UK we throw away 4.4 million apples a year " .
These are just three examples among dozens culled from yesterday 's nationals .
Number - crunching has always had the potential to bamboozle , and today , more than ever , is the age of the fraction , the percentage and the average ( but is that a mean or a median ? ) .
It 's not just the newspapers either .
Numbers crop up in adverts , health warnings and speeches made by politicians too .
But do the figures add up ?
And do we trust them ?
Not really , according to , yes , another set of stats that dropped into the Independent 's inbox last month .
In a survey by the Office for National Statistics , only 36 per cent of people asked thought that official figures were " generally accurate " .
Meanwhile , a 2007 poll of trust in government statistics by the European Commission ranked Britain 27th out of 27 countries .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Last week , a statistics watchdog was launched to tackle this apparent crisis in confidence .
The UK Statistics Authority is tasked with ensuring statistics are correct and free from government spin .
Every day , its website will provide links to the raw data backing up government statistics , and the Authority will , warns its chair , Sir Michael Scholar , " name and shame " ministers who spin them beyond recognition .
" It 's vital that statistics are n't altered to tell the story somebody wants to tell , " Scholar says .
Kevin McConway , a senior statistics lecturer at the Open University , says statistical abuse damages his profession .
" Statistics in the UK are actually pretty reliable but more and more often you see surveys that mean nothing , data that looks important but is n't , or statistics that are just made up .
It destroys public trust in all statistics . "
To name and shame some of the worst offenders , The Independent has trawled the archives for classic examples of " junk statistics " , from the poorly worded reports to deliberate massaging of official figures , and asked McConway to read between the lines .
" Over 40 per cent of families spend eight hours or more a week together "
Commissioning a scholarly survey or study is a popular choice for companies who want to get their names in the papers .
And disappointing results need n't get in the way of a bit of PR .
Last month , the family holiday firm Center Parcs sent out a release designed to counter the image of the British family in terminal decline .
The headline read : " The Family – It 's Not Toxic , It 's Thriving " .
And the best stat Center Parcs could muster to back up its claim ?
" With over 40 per cent of families spending eight hours or more a week together ... a new study suggests that , actually , families like each other and want to spend time together . "
Is that really what it suggests ?
If 40 per cent of families spend eight hours or more together , that must mean that 60 per cent ( or , to put it another way , the majority ) spend fewer than eight hours a week together .
And eight hours a week is equivalent to 68.6 minutes a day .
Put it that way and the figures hardly endorse Center Parcs ' vision of the " thriving " family .

McConway 's verdict : " There 's often this thought that ' oh it 's numbers so it must be right ' , but often it 's nonsense , especially when a company cherry - picks results and plays down the rest .
It 's OK , as long as we are aware of it and get enough information to work out the real statistics . "
" Toothless post - menopausal women are three times as prone to hypertension as those with teeth "
This news , reported in the respected journal Hypertension , might have lead to queues of denture - wearing women of a certain age at GPs ' surgeries .
A study by Japanese researchers from Hiroshima University , published in 2004 , suggested that tooth loss in post - menopausal women was directly linked to high blood pressure , which can increase the risk of heart disease or strokes .
But a look past the headlines revealed a problem : the scientists based the conclusion on a study of just 98 post - menopausal women – 67 with missing teeth , and 31 with their gnashers intact .
In statistical terms , that is an almost insignificant sample size .
The problem is that the apparent cause of a link can sometimes be pure chance .
The smaller the sample , the more likely this becomes .
One statistician famously managed to find a statistically significant correlation ( in a small enough sample ) between birth rates in various European countries and the stork population , suggesting the birds therefore really do deliver babies .
McConway 's verdict : " There 's no standard minimum group size for statistical studies – it depends what you 're measuring .
If it 's something that does n't vary much – say , blood pressure in elite athletes – you could get away with a smaller group .
But for something like this , you need a much larger sample . "
" A sausage a day increases the risk of bowel cancer by a fifth "
Last month , research circulated by the World Cancer Research Fund ( WCRF ) suggested that eating 50g of processed meat a day – equivalent to one sausage – increases the likelihood of bowel cancer by a fifth , or 20 per cent .
It sounds worrying .
After all , a 100 per cent risk would mean you are guaranteed to catch cancer , and that figure of 20 per cent does n't seem far off .
But the reality is neither as simple , nor as scary , as that .
Research shows that , out of every 100 people , around five will develop bowel cancer within their lifetime .
So what impact does eating sausages really have ?
If you take 100 people who eat 50g of processed meat a day , the amount of cancer will rise by a fifth – from five in 100 to six in 100 .
So , to 99 of the 100 porkers , eating all those sausages will cause no difference at all .
But , of course , that seems far less shocking than the headline figure of a 20 per cent rise .
And how many people eat seven sausages a week anyway ?
McConway 's verdict : " You barely go a week without seeing examples in the papers of stats appearing to indicate a significant increase .
Twenty per cent sounds big , but it 's only an increase on a small percentage – 20 per cent on next to nothing is still next to nothing . "
" Speed cameras cause a 35 per cent decrease in deaths and serious injuries "
In 2003 , the then Transport Secretary , Alistair Darling , issued a press release that read : " Deaths and serious injuries fell by 35 per cent on roads where speed cameras have been in operation . "
Darling went on to say : " The report clearly shows speed cameras are working ...
This means that more lives can be saved and more injuries avoided . "
The suggestion that cameras caused the drop in accidents got Darling in trouble .
Figures go up and down all the time .
Contentious issues get more coverage when numbers ( crime figures , say ) are high .
So the government does something about it .
The numbers , having peaked , then go down .
Naturally , the government takes credit for the fall .
Challenged to prove the link in the speed - camera case , transport ministers revised their claim .
McConway 's verdict : " This happens all the time .
The statistical jargon is ' regression to the mean ' : over time , figures that peak or trough will , on average , head towards the middle , or mean .
There are ways to take this effect into account when producing stats like these , but it does not always happen . "
" The number of American children gunned down has doubled every year since 1950 "
Sometimes junk statistics are caused simply by lazy wording .
Perhaps the best ( worst ) example came in a prospective PhD student 's dissertation , published in 1995 .
It appeared in the first chapter of Damned Lies and Satistics by Joel Best , who called it " the worst social statistic ever " .
It read : " Every year since 1950 , the number of American children gunned down has doubled . "
Really ?
Let 's do the maths .
Say only one child was gunned down in 1950 .
According to our student , that number would have doubled every year , so two dead in 1951 , four in 1952 , eight in 1953 ... that makes 1,024 in 1960 , and so on .
By 1995 , the year of the report , more than – wait for it – 35 trillion children were gunned down .
That 's really quite a lot .
It turns out that the student had taken the figure from a government report , which stated : " The number of American children killed each year by guns has doubled since 1950 . "
So the figure had doubled over 45 years , not every year .
By garbling his words , the student came up with a wildly inaccurate statistic .
McConway 's verdict : " It 's so important to be precise when writing about statistics .
There are two conflicting pressures – to keep it simple and to tell the story properly .
This case is terrible , but sometimes even statisticians get it wrong . "
" Falling coconuts kill 150 people a year "
In 2002 , in an article about the uprooting of coconut trees by lawsuit - wary Australian officials , the Daily Telegraph reported : " Coconuts ... kill about 150 people worldwide each year , making them more dangerous than sharks . "
The figure appeared again in a press release issued by a travel insurance firm keen to assure holidaymakers they would be covered should they be struck by a coconut .
The reports suggested the figure of 150 came from a Canadian professor , but his paper on coconut injuries did not posit a death toll .
Various attempts to trace the origin of the figure have failed .
The case echoes a similar statistical legend – the belief that to be healthy we should drink eight glasses of water a day .
Last week , researchers at the University of Pennsylvania decided to search for the source of this statistic .
Their conclusion : " It is unclear where this recommendation came from . "
In other words , they could not find any study to support the " eight glasses " claim .
McConway 's verdict : " The water statistic has , in fact , been doubted for years .
The truth is simply that we like cold hard figures , especially when they make for a great story . "
“ People say there are a lot of problems in the world , so why single out Darfur and why target China ? ” Ruth Messinger , the former Manhattan borough president who is now head of the American Jewish World Service , told me recently in her Manhattan office .
“ But this is the first genocide , since the word was coined , where it was defined as genocide by the American government while it has been happening , ” she added , referring to Colin Powell ’s statement in 2004 that the Darfur killings were indeed a genocide and a Congressional resolution making the same designation .
Messinger is one among perhaps three dozen professional political operatives and freelance agitators who have collaborated closely behind the scenes with the Dream for Darfur team , participating in strategy sessions and connecting Savitt with larger political networks .
“ Darfur is singular , ” Messinger told me .
“ China is the reason Darfur is happening .
And it is happening now .
There is nothing fast about the killing in Darfur . ”
For those on board with Dream for Darfur , connecting the dots between the Summer Games and hundreds of thousands of African corpses is not much more complicated than that .
The brief against China is by and large uncontested ( except by China ) : the Sudan government buys its weapons from China with the foreign currency it makes from selling China its oil .
China , meanwhile , protects Sudan from excessive attention in the United Nations Security Council .
“ The Olympics is a unique lever with the Chinese , and we ’re not going to get another one  it ai n’t happening again , ” Savitt said one morning in January .
( She has met five times with Chinese diplomats , who each time , Savitt says , use the opportunity to explain just how much the Chinese people like the Olympics and dislike street demonstrations . )
Now every form of opposition to the Beijing government seems to have its Olympic angle ; the repression of Tibetan protests earlier this month , for example , immediately led to calls for a boycott of the Games
But Savitt is keenly aware that her approach has to be nuanced , and in her speeches she is careful to say that she is a fan of the Games and that her organization is against a boycott .
In a recent conference call with other activist groups , she quickly shot down a suggestion to publish a newspaper op - ed essay asking President Bush to skip the opening ceremonies .
“ He ’s not going to do that , and I ’m not in the business of asking for things I know I ’m not going to get , ” she snapped .
The message to Olympic athletes has been so nuanced that it verges on abstruse : they should speak out on human rights issues but steer clear of politics ; opposing genocide demands the ultimate in moral outrage from everyone , yet athletes should n’t jeopardize their medals .
Speaking at a Dream for Darfur rally on Feb. 12 outside the Chinese Mission to the U.N. , the Canadian Olympic swimmer Nikki Dryden ( 1992 and ’ 96 ) put it like this : “ China sullies everything the Olympics stands for because of what it allows to happen in Darfur , but I would never ask athletes to go outside their comfort zone . ”
Savitt ’s message to corporate sponsors is less ambivalent but in some ways trickier .
“ No company wants to be the first whale to spout ” is how she put it to me .
Dream for Darfur asks that the major sponsors like McDonald ’s , Anheuser - Busch , Microsoft and Volkswagen take very small but potentially significant actions : to meet privately with Chinese officials to express concern over Darfur , for example , or to take a symbolic stand by calling publicly for officials from Sudan who have been accused of crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court to be banned from attending the Games .
“ These companies are n’t pushing guns in anyone ’s faces ” in Darfur , says Ellen Freudenheim , a consultant working on corporate outreach for Dream for Darfur .
“ We have to be careful in how we frame this .
They are not directly responsible .
Yet the morality is ,
You are complicit when you do nothing to try to stop genocide when you can . ”
Savitt says that the sponsors are starting to take notice .
Even executives at Coca - Cola have privately expressed anxiety about their association with the Games , according to Minky Worden , a veteran China specialist at Human Rights Watch .
( On Tibet , Lenovo , the Chinese computer giant , recently said it was following the conflict there “ with concern and regret . ” )
“ Everything all these groups are doing has massive popular support from inside China , which is n’t understood here , ” says Worden , who speaks fluent Cantonese and is focused on internal Chinese issues  like migrant - worker rights and press freedoms  and holding the Chinese government accountable for the promises it made to the International Olympic Committee in 2001 .
“ Here is the thing : our demands for internal human rights are not something that Chinese people do n’t want , nor are they anything the Chinese government has n’t explicitly promised to do .
We ’re pushing an open door .
These companies are making a huge mistake in thinking the Chinese respect them for saying what they think they want to hear .
Just the opposite .
The Chinese government respects foreigners who repeatedly and reliably tell them the truth .
How hard is it really for G.E. or Microsoft to push for something that the Chinese government already said it is receptive to doing ? ”
University of Maryland research that started with bacteria from the Chesapeake Bay has led to a process that may be able to convert large volumes of all kinds of plant products , from leftover brewer ’s mash to paper trash , into ethanol and other biofuel alternatives to gasoline .
That process , developed by University of Maryland professors Steve Hutcheson and Ron Weiner , is the foundation of their incubator company Zymetis , which was on view today in College Park for Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley and state and university officials .
" The new Zymetis technology is a win for the State of Maryland , for the University and for the environment , ” said University of Maryland President C.D. Mote , Jr. " It makes affordable ethanol production a reality and makes it from waste materials , which benefits everyone and supports the green - friendly goal of carbon - neutrality .
“ It also highlights the importance of transformational basic research and of technology incubators at the University .
Partnership with the State enables University of Maryland faculty and students to commercialize new discoveries quickly . ”
“ Today , Marylanders are leading the nation in scientific discovery and technology innovation , ” said Governor Martin O’Malley .
“ We must continue to invest in Marylanders like Steve Hutcheson and in their revolutionary ideas to protect our environment , create jobs , and improve lives . ”
75 Billion Gallons a Year
The Zymetis process can make ethanol and other biofuels from many different types of plants and plant waste called cellulosic sources .
Cellulosic biofuels can be made from non-grain plant sources such as waste paper , brewing byproducts , leftover agriculture products , including straw , corncobs and husks , and energy crops such as switchgrass .
When fully operational , the Zymetis process could potentially lead to the production of 75 billion gallons a year of carbon - neutral ethanol .
The secret to the Zymetis process is a Chesapeake Bay marsh grass bacterium , S. degradans .
Hutcheson found that the bacterium has an enzyme that could quickly break down plant materials into sugar , which can then be converted to biofuel .
The Zymetis researchers were unable to isolate the Bay bacterium again in nature , but they discovered how to produce the enzyme in their own laboratories .
The result was Ethazyme , which degrades the tough cell walls of cellulosic materials and breaks down the entire plant material into bio - fuel ready sugars in one step , at a significantly lower cost and with fewer caustic chemicals than current methods .
Hutcheson projects a $ 5 billion enzyme market for biofuels .
The energy bill passed by the U.S. Senate in December mandates oil companies to blend in 21 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol with their gasoline by 2022 .

Washington , DC – The American Civil Liberties Union today slammed the U.S. Senate for not only authorizing the president ’s warrantless wiretapping program but for granting immunity to his accomplices , the telecommunications companies .
By a vote of 68 to 29 , the Senate passed legislation amending and , in the end , gutting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) .
The bill now must be conferenced with the House ’s version of the bill – which contains no immunity and stricter Fourth Amendment protections – by February 16th , the recently extended expiration date of the equally disastrous Protect America Act .
" The Senate had multiple opportunities to improve this atrocious bill and failed at every turn , " said Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
" Several amendments were offered to increase privacy protections , with many of them allowing for warrantless surveillance during emergency situations .
It ’s stunning that senators would n’t put their support behind amendments so fundamentally balanced .
Protecting Americans ' communications from pervasive and ill - defined surveillance goes to the very heart of the Fourth Amendment .
Unfortunately , the Senate seemed determined to pass the least constitutional FISA bill possible . "
During debate of the FISA Amendments
Act of 2007 , Senators Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) and Christopher Dodd ( D - CT ) offered two amendments to impose stricter privacy guidelines for Americans ’ communications but both amendments were voted down .
Senator Dodd also led a movement against immunity but was ultimately overtaken .
" Senators Feingold and Dodd deserve kudos for their attempts to help make this awful Senate bill more palatable , " said Fredrickson .
" Though many questions still remain unanswered about years of domestic spying , the Senate has effectively sealed the vault by handing over immunity to the phone companies .
The over forty legitimate lawsuits currently pending against them may end before they ’ve begun .
It ’s a fact that Americans had their rights violated and now , by closing the courtroom door , they may be left with no recourse .
The Senate failed us with this vote .
It is a major step backward both for Americans ’ privacy and the Constitution . "

There 's far too much stuff in the world .
Check Wikipedia if you do n't believe me .
Hit the " random article " widget on the left three times in a row , then guff your own legs off with amazement as it coughs up a trio of things you 've never ever heard of before .
I 've just tried this myself , and it introduced me to 1 ) an Australian Aboriginal tribe called the " Gunwinggu " , 2 ) " Something Wicked " , a 1993 album by Nuclear Assault , and 3 ) former computer games designer Demis Hassabis .
Infuriatingly , I 've actually met Demis Hassabis , so that 's another theory left bleeding by the roadside .
Anyhow , the point I 'm failing to make is that there 's so much stuff out there , you can't possibly remember it all at once .
Which is n't to say you delete it .
Most of it you simply file away , somewhere at the back of your mind , by the bins .
And there it stays for weeks , months , years , until something jolts you into retrieving it , at which point : bam !
Instant recall .
I fear I 'm not making sense , so let me explain .
While watching the new David Attenborough series , Life In Cold Blood ( Mon , 9 pm , BBC1 ) , I suddenly realised I 'd completely forgotten about tortoises .
I can't have thought about a tortoise in any shape or form for at least a year .
They 've been dead to me .
Obviously , stuff like this happens all the time inside the human brain , usually zipping past unnoticed , but since I 'm currently training myself to pay attention to every thought I experience , like a ninja , I caught myself being surprised by the realisation .
I actually thought , " oh yeah , tortoises , I remember them " .
But the beauty of a programme like Life In Cold Blood is that having reintroduced me to the concept of tortoises , it then astonishes me by depicting them doing something I 've never seen them do before , namely fighting .
Yes , tortoises fight .
Did you know that ?
I bloody did n't .
They 've even got little jousting staves built into their shells , all the better for flipping one another on to their backs with .
Even the things you think you 've seen before have a new and exciting twist .
We see a python dislocating its own jaw in order to swallow a small deer .
It starts with the head and slowly engulfs the whole body until it 's coating the thing like a living condom .
Familiar territory ?
Maybe so .
But then Attenborough points out that the deer 's head is so huge the snake can't breathe , so it sicks up its own windpipe and pokes it out the side of its mouth , like a floppy pink snorkel , puckering for air .
Truly revolting .
And new .
And clever : it 's the sort of thing Jack Bauer would do , if he had several million years to evolve his way out of a crisis .
Attenborough is routinely praised to the point where future historians might mistake him for a minor god , and quite right too .
Few TV shows in any genre make you feel anything whatsoever , apart from a vague awareness that you 're wasting your life , whereas his programmes , with their signature blend of understated commentary and magnificent footage , induce awe every five minutes .
And not a sentimental , dewy - eyed kind of awe either , but a sobering one .
In their own way , these are among the most nihilistic programmes on television .
If your mind wanders at all during the tortoise fight , for example , it 's likely to contemplate war , or terrorism , specifically dwelling on the extent to which conflict is an inbuilt human trait , just as it's an inbuilt trait in tortoises , which you 'd previously thought of as a race of comically benign Cornish pasties , good for sleeping in boxes or appearing in the One Foot In The Grave title sequence , and not much else .
This is likely to be Attenborough 's last major series : the final chapter in an extraordinary legacy .
To change the way millions of people see the world is no mean feat , and he 's done it with quiet assurance , humour , and respect .
TV can be many things .
Nowt wrong with a bit of mindless entertainment now and then .
But when someone with purpose seizes and commands it , it can also do this .
Incredible .

Understanding the Motivations for Recreational Marijuana Use Among Adult Canadians
Substance Use & Misuse , Vol. 43 , Issue 3 & 4 , February 2008 : pages 539-572
The primary purpose of this study was to develop a better understanding of what motivates a selected group of adult[s ] to use marijuana and to explore the social contexts in which it is used . ….
Using interviews to gain insight into the subjective experiences of the participants , this research corroborated the results of previous studies that found that most adult marijuana users regulate use to their recreational time and do not use compulsively .
Rather , their use is purposively intended to enhance their leisure activities and manage the challenges and demands of living in contemporary modern society .
Generally , participants reported using marijuana because it enhanced relaxation and concentration , making a broad range of leisure activities more enjoyable and pleasurable .
They were predominantly middle class , employed in a wide range of occupations , and used marijuana recreationally to enhance relaxation and concentration while engaged in leisure activities .

Loss of employment
Loss of drivers license
Loss of child custody

If you took the Drug Czar 's word for it , you 'd think all marijuana users were helpless dope fiends who just need the cops to take their pot away and throw their sorry asses in rehab .
But if you take the Drug Czar 's word on this , or anything else for that matter , you 'll be wrong .
People smoke pot because they want to , and that 's a scientific fact .
Via NORML , a new study helps clarify what we 've all been struggling so hard to explain :
It is so rare to hear the typical marijuana user described in this way ( accurately ) that I had to reread this just to be sure .
The abstract is revealing as well : Holy hookah , Batman !
These hippies have jobs and happy lives !?
Somebody better drug test them soon , otherwise they might make it their whole lives without anyone realizing what losers they are .
Seriously though , the idea that marijuana users are somehow mentally and physically handicapped is easily the most pernicious and inaccurate absurdity ever infused into the marijuana debate .
It 's just not true at all .
Yet this mindless stereotype continues to be reinforced as the counterculture tends to embrace the drug openly , while more typical users remain stigmatized by the fear of arrest , drug testing , or being mistaken for a hippie .
The point here is n't just that marijuana use is seldom more than a harmless hobby , although that is true .
Arguing that marijuana is harmless has n't advanced our cause , so we must look beyond opportunities to simply make that argument on its own .
The point here is that the typical marijuana user is n't someone who can benefit from criminal justice intervention .
Just think about how damaging these punishments for marijuana can be and imagine what happens each time they are applied to someone whose life was previously going just fine :
For many decades now , we 've been ruining the lives of healthy , happy people for using marijuana .
We 're able to do this because we tell ourselves that they need us to help them .
They are addicts .
They are lazy .
They are going to get cancer or depression .
But wait , what if they 're not ?
Oh my God , what have we done ?
The student loan corporation in Pennsylvania improperly exploited a subsidy program to collect $ 34 million from the government , said a report released yesterday by the inspector general of the federal Education Department .
The audit called on the department to recover the payments to the corporation , the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency , a state - owned company that makes and guarantees student loans .
The chief executive of the agency , James Preston , defended its conduct .
In a statement , Mr. Preston said the agency had complied with department regulations and received the payments with the approval of the department .
The report , he added , is based on “ present - day interpretation of past department regulations , ” “ and ignores 10 years of our compliance with regulations . ”
A spokeswoman for the department , Samara Yudof , said the report was under review .
The subsidy program was enacted in the 1980s , when interest rates were high , as an incentive to continue making the loans .
It guaranteed lenders a 9.5 percent rate of return .
Congress tried to rein in the program in 1993 as interest rates fell , but the loans ballooned as lenders exploited a loophole to keep receiving the subsidy .
Starting Out , by Albert Sweigart
“ When starting out , ” the sculptor said ,
“ First lay out your tools with care .
And always remember , through and through ,
The most important thing is to prepare . ”
The sculptor ’s tools were neat and ordered ,
His studio was well - lit and clean ,
He always began by sweeping eleven times ,
And sometimes twelve or thirteen .
Centered was an untouched marble block ,
His raw , undeveloped masterpiece ,
Here is where the magic was made ,
On this stone his genius would be released .
“ But not so fast , ” the sculptor warned ,
“ Great works do n’t just fall from Heaven ,
After all , it takes nine months to make a baby ,
And sometimes , ten or eleven . ”
“ Your chisels must be sharp ” , he said ,
And the sculptor ’s could split hairs .
They should be , after all , he spent ,
All last week solely on chisel repair .
The week before that , he was browsing the shops ,
Eyeing endless parades of tools right closely ,
The sculptor would buy one , then return it that day ,
But finally had the perfect set … well , mostly .
The hammer he bought was light and sturdy ,
A good replacement , he thought , had been long overdue ,
But the sculptor was left deeply discontent ,
It was fresh , but maybe a little too new ?
“ Enough with these trifles ! ” the sculptor exclaimed ,
His excitement was beginning to climb ,
He put the chisel to the rock ,
But then noticed it was close to lunchtime .
He set down his hammer and packed the chisels ,
Went down to the local cafe ,
The line for panini was very long ,
And the sculptor was annoyed at the delay .
The sculptor returned , stomach quite full ,
Greeted by the marble block as he crossed the door ,
It had waited for him , still silent and patient ,
( After all it was a quarter to four . )
The sculptor was sleepy from his meal ,
Slow him down the weary drowsiness would ,
Such sloppiness helped no one , the sculptor thought ,
So maybe a quick nap would be good .
In his dream , the sculptor finally saw ,
At last his completed full work ,
It was more dazzling than he had ever thought before ,
It made the fans and critics berserk .
“ What is your secret ? ” they all cried ,
“ How can it be that your work is so fine ? ”
The crowd was quiet in frantic suspense ,
And so the sculptor gave them this line :
“ If you have eight hours to chop down a tree ,
Spend seven sharpening your axe to a shine ,
But just in case , to assure your pace ,
Sometimes you should spend eight or nine . ”
The sculptor woke from his short dream ,
And the day was not too late for his chore ,
Yet later when he left the studio , and the marble block ,
They were just the same as they were the year before .
By Muriel Rukeyser .
Whether it is a speaker , taut on a platform , who battles a crowd with the hammers of his words , whether it is the crash of lips on lips after absence and wanting : we must close the circuits of ideas , now generate , that leap in the body 's action or the mind 's repose .
Over us is a striking on the walls of the sky , here are the dynamos , steel - black , harboring flame , here is the man night - walking who derives tomorrow 's manifestoes from this midnight 's meeting ; here we require the proof in solidarity , iron on iron , body on body , and the large single beating .
And behind us in time are the men who second us as we continue .
And near us is our love : no forced contempt , no refusal in dogma , the close of the circuit in a fierce dazzle of purity .
And over us is night a field of pansies unfolding , charging with heat its softness in a symbol to weld and prepare for action our minds ' intensity .
So I was poking around Amazon.com looking at biographies of some of the founding names of thermodynamics and kinetic theory -- Boltzmann of course was an interesting character , but there are a lot of good stories out there .
The American physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs obviously was a major player -- among other things , he introduced the concept of the statistical ensemble , the primary tool by which we nowadays think of thermodynamic systems .
One of the notable biographies of Gibbs , it turns out , is by none other than Muriel Rukeyser .
That 's a name that should be familiar to long - time blog readers , as she was the author of the delightful poem The Conjugation of the Paramecium .
Any poet who spends her free time writing biographies of the titans of statistical mechanics is my kind of poet .
Turns out that Rukeyser led a pretty interesting life in her own right .
She was a political activist , drawing on her own experiences as a feminist Jewish bisexual , but agitating for social justice in a number of different areas .
She wrote for the Daily Worker , covered the Scottsboro case , and investigated an outbreak of silicosis among miners in Gauley Bridge , West Virginia .
You can have a look at her FBI file , if you have a morbid fascination concerning what the government might do with information about what friends you have and what organizations you belong to .
Happily , these days we have restored the balance of civil liberties , and the government would never spy on anyone except terrorists , leaving the rest of us free to write poetry and follow the evolution of distribution functions on phase space unperturbed by political considerations .

ABU DHABI — Saudi Arabia has agreed to ensure global supplies of crude oil .
The kingdom 's statement was issued in wake of the visit by U.S. Vice President Richard Cheney to Saudi Arabia , Middle East Newsline reported .
The Supreme Council of Petroleum and Mineral Affairs , chaired by King Abdullah , said Riyad would help ensure oil market stability .
In a statement on March 24 , the council said it would work with OPEC and non-OPEC members to " prevent the effects of harmful speculation . "
Some foods that are edible for humans , can pose hazards for animals because animals and humans have different metabolisms .
Certain foods may cause only mild digestive upsets , whereas , others can cause severe illness , even death if ingested by animals .
The following common food items should not be fed ( intentionally or unintentionally ) to either cats or dogs .
This list is , of course , incomplete because I cannot possibly list everything your animal should not eat .
Alcoholic beverages can cause intoxication , coma , and death .
Baby food can contain onion powder , which can be toxic to cats .
( Please see onion below . )
It can also result in nutritional deficiencies , if fed in large amounts .
Bones from fish , poultry , or other meat sources can cause obstruction or laceration of the digestive system .
Canned tuna ( for human consumption ) can cause malnutrition if fed in large quantities since it lacks proper levels of vitamins and minerals .
Chocolate , coffee and tea contain caffeine and perhaps theobromine , or theophylline , which can be toxic and affect the heart and nervous system .
Citrus oil extracts can cause vomiting .
Dog food if ingested accidentally by a cat will not cause a problem , but if fed repeatedly , may result in malnutrition and diseases affecting the heart .
Fat trimmings can cause pancreatitis .
Grapes and raisins contain an unknown toxin , which can damage the kidneys .
Human vitamin supplements containing iron can damage the lining of the digestive system and be toxic to the other organs including the liver and kidneys .
Large amounts of liver can cause Vitamin A toxicity , which affects muscles and bones .
Macadamia nuts contain an unknown toxin , which can affect the digestive and nervous systems and muscles .
Marijuana can depress the nervous system and cause vomiting and changes in the heart rate .
Milk and other dairy products should never be fed to animals .
Some adult cats and dogs do not have sufficient amounts of the enzyme lactase , which breaks down the lactose in milk .
This can result in diarrhea .
Lactose - free milk products are available for cats .
Moldy and spoiled food can contain multiple toxins causing vomiting and diarrhea and can also affect other organs .
Mushrooms can contain toxins , which may affect multiple systems in the body , cause shock , and result in death .
Onions and garlic ( raw , cooked , or powder ) contain sulfoxides and disulfides , which can damage red blood cells and cause anemia .
Cats are more susceptible than dogs .
Garlic is less toxic than onions .
Persimmons seeds can cause intestinal obstruction and enteritis .
Potato , rhubarb , and tomato leaves and potato and tomato stems contain oxalates , which can affect the digestive , nervous , and urinary systems .
This is more of a problem in livestock .
Raw eggs contain an enzyme called avidin , which decreases the absorption of biotin ( a B vitamin ) .
This can lead to skin and hair and coat problems .
Raw eggs may also contain Salmonella .
Raw fish can result in a thiamine ( a B vitamin ) deficiency leading to loss of appetite , seizures , and in severe cases , death .
More common if raw fish is fed regularly .
Salt if eaten in large quantities may lead to electrolyte imbalances .
String can become trapped in the digestive system ; called a “ string foreign body . ”
Sugary foods can lead to obesity , dental problems , and possibly diabetes mellitus .
Table scraps are not nutritionally balanced .
They should never be more than 10 % of the diet .
Fat should be trimmed from meat ; bones should not be fed to animals at all .
Tobacco contains nicotine , which affects the digestive and nervous systems .
Can result in rapid heartbeat , collapse , coma , and death .
Yeast dough can expand and produce gas in the digestive system , causing pain and possible rupture of the stomach or intestines .

“ The test of the morality of a society is what it does for its children . ”
This MRI image shows a tumour , but there are often false alarms Lumps detected in women at a high risk of breast cancer using hi-tech MRI scans overwhelmingly turn out to be false alarms , a Dutch study suggests .
But while researchers found five out of six scans which suggested a problem were wrong , they were nonetheless very effective at spotting invasive cancers .
And while false - positives caused anxiety , the study did not find women were rashly opting for mastectomies .
The findings were published in the Annals of Oncology .
Women with certain genes have as much as an 85 % risk of breast cancer .
In the UK , NHS guidelines say that a woman with a family history of the disease may be offered yearly MRI scans if her doctors think it is appropriate , in addition to the recommended mammogram .
MRI scans - which use magnetic resonance imaging - are more sensitive than standard mammograms , and as such are seen as particularly effective in picking up early breast cancers in younger women with denser breast tissue .
Gene mutation
But this very sensitivity is what makes them more likely to spot abnormalities which may turn out to be completely benign .
Researchers at the Hereditary Cancer Clinic at Nijmegen Medical Centre followed 196 women with the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation which has been linked to breast cancer .
On their first visit , they were asked whether they had a preference for ongoing surveillance in the form of scans , or whether they would rather have their breasts removed as a precaution .
About 30 % said they wanted a protective mastectomy , three expressed no preference and the others wanted regular check - ups .
While MRIs can result in false positive findings , this is far outweighed by their ability to detect tumours earlier in their development compared to mammography in high risk groups
Breast Cancer Care
All also went on to receive a scan .
About 83 % of the MRI scans which appeared to detect a tumour were later found to be so - called " false positives " .
However , the positive scan appeared to do little to sway decisions on breast removal .
Some 90 % of the group who had wanted a mastectomy went on to have one , while fewer than a third of those who received a positive result and had originally opted for surveillance opted for breast removal .
" The final decision to actually undergo prophylactic mastectomy appeared to be determined more frequently by a woman 's prior preference than by a positive scan , " said Dr Nicoline Hoogerbrugge , who led the research .
There was little information available about how women made the choice , she added .
" Both genetic counselling and breast cancer surveillance are events in the entire decision - making process , but appear to have a limited impact . "
Effective
But the researchers did confirm that the MRI scan was more effective in picking up genuine tumours and pre-cancerous developments .
The proportion of true - positives for mammography was 41 % , while for MRI it was 60 % .
Breakthrough Breast Cancer said the findings should not curtail access to MRI scans for those women at high risk .
" MRI , together with mammography , is the most effective form of screening for this group of women although this method can result in false positives , " said head of policy Dr Sarah Rawlings .
" It is vital that all those eligible have access to this service and also receive clear and accurate information about the risks and benefits of MRI so they can make an informed decision . "
Breast Cancer Care clinical director Dr Emma Pennery said : " While MRIs can result in false positive findings , this is far outweighed by their ability to detect tumours earlier in their development compared to mammography in high risk groups . "

What are these ?
These pages intend to give a comprehensive overview of the elements of a computer program which can play two - player strategy games like tic - tac - toe , connect four , checkers and chess .
I will always assume the players to be called ' white ' and ' black ' , with ' white ' being the one to move first in the game .
Evaluations will be given from white 's point of view .
Code fragments are written in C . I have organized this tutorial in five parts : Basics
Enhancements
Endgame Databases
Opening Databases
Philisophical or scientific questions , and links I will develop a C skeleton for strategy games to which only game - specific code will have to be added , but which takes care of the rest of the strategy game playing part .
Perhaps you wonder whether you should read this stuff .
What does this guy know anyway ?
As an avid chess player , I wanted to write a chess program as soon as I got my first computer , an Atari ST back in 1987 or so .
Knowing nothing of all the things I 'm writing about now , I failed miserably .
I went back to square one and started over with simpler things .
I wrote a connect four program , and a program to solve the game of Solitaire for my grandmother , and that was about that for a long time .
In 1996 I started a checkers program which today has become the de-facto standard for checkers , since it is - at the time of writing - by far the best free checkers program around .
I generated the 8 - piece endgame database for checkers , and also wrote an automated opening book generator for checkers .
Finally , in the summer of 2002 I wrote a chess program .
It 's a decent amateur program , but nothing more .
I never found the time to work on it seriously - I 'm sure I could improve it , however I have no idea whether it would become a really good program .
Most computer programs nowadays use a brute - force approach to games - this is also called the Shannon - A strategy , named after Claude Shannon , a computer science pioneer .
He wrote the first computer chess program , at a time when the word computer had a completely different meaning : a person who computed according to fixed rules .
He even had his program play a game of chess , that must have been a lot of work !
At this time , Shannon guessed that there would be a more promising approach to game - playing , a more human way : look at promising continuations instead of looking at all possibilities .
This is the so - called Shannon - B strategy , supposed to mimic humans .
However , it seems that with the incredible computing power of modern PC 's the brute - force approach is better .
Most computer programs playing chess and similar games nowadays use the brute - force approach , where you basically look at all possibilities for both sides up to a fixed depth .
Most of these programs also use selective extensions , but this ' selective ' search is far away from what Shannon envisioned with his B - strategy - human - like look - ahead where only very few possibilities are considered .
Human chess masters might calculate about one or two positions per second , and can still compete with chess programs that are calculating millions of positions per second .
This gives you an idea of just how much more selective the search of the human is !
To sum up this in one sentence : Computers play strategy games by generating all possible continuations up to a ( more or less ) fixed depth and evaluating the resulting positions , which allows them to choose the best of these continuations .

The Australian sharemarket is bracing for more trauma today after the spectacular unravelling of Melbourne stockbroking firm Opes Prime .
Until late last week , Opes was a billion - dollar company , boasting a big name client list including banks , asset managers , stockbrokers and around 1,200 " mum and dad " retail investors .
The strategy was to use Opes to buy shares through substantial margin loans - a common strategy in a bull market but extremely dangerous in these current bearish times .
While the extent of the Opes losses and what is ultimately left in the carve - up remains unclear , the firm 's banking clients will get priority in the carving up of the spoils .
It is believed ANZ is owed $ 650 million and Merrill Lynch about $ 400 million .
Both are understood to have ordered the sale of shares to cover their exposure .
As a result , individual retail clients will most likely see their shares sold without profit so the banks can be repaid .
And the news could get worse , with a big risk that superannuation funds are potentially exposed .
The collapse of Opes Prime is expected to fuel a new level of fear and suspicion that other companies in the risky business of margin lending could already be in troubled waters .
There are also concerns that some superannuation funds that lent stock to Opes Prime for margin loan investing could be exposed .
These funds would stand behind the banks in the queue of creditors , which increases the chance of losses for some retirees .
Opes Prime 's receivers and administrators - Deloitte and Ferrier Hodgson - have been scouring computer hard drives and hardcopy archives to determine what went wrong , how deep the " financial irregularities " really are , and whether the law might have been broken .
Investigators are keen to interview Opes Prime 's chief executive Laurie Emini .
The corporate regulator ASIC obtained orders on Friday to obtain his passport and to prevent him from leaving the country .
The first creditors meeting is scheduled for April 8 and investigators are racing to provide fresh information to some very concerned creditors - not just the banks , but the last in line retail investors who stand to lose a whole lot more than their portfolios .
Meanwhile the market regulator , the Australian Securities Exchange , will be asking when Opes directors first learned of the bad news and at what point did the company become insolvent .
The Opes collapse has been driven in part by the changing economic times and the global credit crunch brought on by the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States .
The new developments make this week 's other economic news more relevant than ever , especially after last week 's Financial Stability Review from the Reserve Bank provided a clean bill of health .
The key event is the RBA 's April meeting on Tuesday where interest rates are almost certain to be kept on hold given the recent independent action by the major banks .
The statement that comes with the decision though , could provide an insight on whether inflation is moderating enough for rates to stay where they are for the medium term .
And on Friday the RBA governor Glenn Stevens will face a House of Representative economics committee , where he 's certain to be quizzed on his " that 's life " comment last week about the cost of credit and the independent rises by the big banks .
Other data to be scrutinised this week includes the latest inflation gauge from TD Securities and the Melbourne Institute and fresh retail trade data from the ABS which is expected to remain sluggish .
Despite last week 's renewed optimism , the share market is expected to remain in roller coaster mode , and the pain for banking stocks will most likely continue .
A recent visit to Houston , though , convinced me that I just had n’t been getting it .
My friend Mike and his wife had done away with their TV entirely and instead had set up their 20 - inch iMac wide - screen as the focal point of a kind of jerry - rigged home theater ; with no grievous loss in quality , they were feeding it with content from iTunes , various other Web - based media services , and DVDs .
In doing so , they had dispensed with those hefty cable bills and had asserted an icono­clastic form of control over their media lives .
It turns out , anecdotally at least , that lots of other people are doing the same .
And that was my Homer Simpson “ D’oh ! ” moment .
Video without a TV console was not only possible , it was likely .
The traditional TV - viewing experience does n’t have to die ( for reasons I ’ll get into later ) , but to save it , the media - industrial complex will have to act in nontraditional and uncomfortable ways — and will also have to rethink what “ TV ” is .
Currently , it means watching a professionally produced video program — passively — on a television console that is fed with content delivered as part of a subscription to a cable or digital service .
In the future , TV will mean a cacophony of professional and amateur short - and long - form content shipped via a variety of platforms to a variety of devices , only one of which is the Sony Bravia taking up too much space in your living room .
Then , that content will be edited , poked at , commented on , parodied , and rebroadcast by you the former viewer — now “ user ” — to whomever you choose .
Who gets paid by whom to deliver what to whom in this new dispensation is , as in every moment of grand tectonic digital shift , the $ 60 billion question .
And it ’s far from obvious that the people being paid now will be the people being paid a few years from now .
The post–World War II model of expensive video driving a massively profitable content - production industry ( that now - legendary $ 10 million pilot for Lost , those $ 200 million movies ) is in some peril — much as , for the first time , it is conceivable that one or more of the major record labels could go out of business entirely .
Among many other matters , the writers ’ strike ( still ongoing at press time , possibly to be followed by an actors ’ strike this summer ) is a final , great battle royal over content profits at what might be the last moment when such profits are worth fighting over — like steel workers ’ strikes in the ’ 80s .
The story of digital video is not necessarily going to be the same as that of digital music , though the parallels between Napster and YouTube are fairly uncanny .
It ’s not self - evident that watching long - running movies or TV shows on very small devices will become a mass behavior .
According to a recent study , the majority of Internet users watch roughly 3 hours of video on the Web each month , compared to the average person ’s 4.5 hours of TV each day .
For all the hype surrounding Web video , it was not surprising that NBC , responsible for 40 percent of iTunes ’s video sales , had earned only $ 15 million last year on those sales , a point NBC Universal ’s chief , Jeff Zucker , made ( uncontested ) in announcing he would pull NBCU shows off iTunes at the end of last year .
( This content is mostly going to Hulu.com , NBC ’s joint venture with Fox , where NBC hopes to sell advertising time much as it does on the air .
How this will work better , given the still - unproven Web- video advertising market , remains undetermined . )

How to Raise an Ideological Warrior

When I was a kid , the theory of evolution was an accepted fact .
Given my role as a parenting pundit and grumpy crank , I knew I ’d eventually begin delivering statements that start with “ when I was a kid … ”
Still , I never thought I ’d be wistful about a time when we all agreed that humans came from monkeys .
But times have changed .
Back then , evolution was as accepted as the Earth ’s rotation on its axis .
The Scopes Monkey trial was 60 years in the rear - view .
Hard Darwinian science had trumped the skeptics and the nincompoops .
I doubted evolution no more than I doubted that my heart pumped blood through my body .
My son , on the other hand , came down the birth canal into a brave new world , where school boards debate spurious intelligent design curricula , where 66 percent of Americans surveyed by USA Today believe that God created the world in seven days , and where the President of the United States thinks evolution is just one theory .
This summer saw the opening of Kentucky ’s Creation Museum , a $ 27 million high - tech “ educational ” institution determined to teach our children that there were dinosaurs on Noah ’s Ark .
Now the Scopes Monkey Trial is 90 years in the rear - view , and in some parts of America , it ’s like Clarence Darrow never existed .
There ’s little chance that Elijah , being raised by secular liberals in Southern California , will learn to believe that people walked with dinosaurs .
But such questions were n’t even possible when I was in school .
Powerful people and institutions are attempting to chip away at rational science .
A parent can no longer assume that his children wo n’t encounter anti-evolutionary propaganda .
While I ’m skeptical about religion , I ’m not opposed to faith and spirituality .
Elijah goes to a Jewish preschool , after all .
But the other side preaches a dangerous ideology .
When faith gets in the way of facts , I get angry .
Does n’t my obstinacy challenge my desire to have my son think for himself ?
Am I being as ideologically rigid as people who preach intelligent design ?
Perhaps .
But I think the question is a little bit off .
I ’m not worried about my son becoming a Wall Streeter or , worse , a Republican .
The generation gap of Family Ties no longer exists .
People who ask me about what I ’ll do when my son turns into Alex P. Keaton — a character I revered as a kid — are stuck in an old way of thinking .
This is n’t about an ideological struggle between democratic socialism and unfettered free - market economics .
And though I ’d argue that there ’s a deep sexist component to religious fundamentalism , it ’s not really about race or gender issues either .
It ’s about keeping alive the spirit of discovery , and also preserving essential notions of truth and freedom of thought .
I do n’t want Elijah to be a jerk about his beliefs , but he should be intolerant toward faith - based reasoning simply because it ’s wrong .
So I ’ve made it a point to provide him with early counter - tools : a bunch of books about dinosaurs , a comic book about the beginnings of life , and the HD - DVD collection of Planet Earth from the BBC .
These range from awe - inspiring to irritating .
For instance , our planet itself narrates the comic book , which is just a little too Whole Earth Catalog for me .
Still , it ’s useful .
I deploy these tools much as a gentle , patient creationist father would talk to his son about how God created the world in seven days .
“ You can see here in this book , ” I say , “ that there was a great rain on Earth that lasted millions of years . ”
“ And then there were bacteria , ” he says .
“ Right . ”
“ And they turned into jellyfish which turned into lizards and fish and insects and then they grew legs and went onto land and some of them became dinosaurs and some of them became mammals and then there were monkeys or primates and they became people !
Is that right ? ” Indoctrination at work .
At four years old , Elijah not only knows some basic scientific truths about the world , but he also thinks evolution is cool .
It would only be more awesome to him if it somehow involved light sabers .
New Yorker contributor George Packer , who unlike myself is n’t prone to hyperbole , wrote about a recent visit to the Creation Museum that he felt like “ a dissident surrounded by the lies of a totalitarian state . ”
This frightened me .
I ’m trying to teach my son to question authority , even if he starts with me .
He needs to recognize “ the lies of a totalitarian state ” when those lies are being widely propagated to a willing , paid public .
If he does n’t feel like a dissident in the face of such propaganda , then I have n’t done my job .

We asked David Klinghoffer of the anti-evolution Discovery Institute " What does DI want to teach Jewish - American children about Intelligent Design ? "

On Faithhacker , Tamar Fox reported on politicians in Georgia and Texas who tried to discredit evolution by claiming it was dreamed up by the Pharisees .
Laurel Snyder looked at why Orthodox Jews , unlike many equally observant Christians , have made peace with evolution .
As part of his year living according to the rules of the Bible , A.J. Jacobs visited Kentucky ’s Creation Museum .
On the Daily Shvitz , Josh Strawn reported on an NYC businessman who is suing a Seed writer for $ 15 million for calling him a “ crackpot ” in two reviews of his book challenging the theory of evolution , and Francois Blumenfeld - Kouchner panned the Darwin exhibit at Chicago ’s Field Museum .

These are pretty unique photos from the Russian Aircraft Museum .
They are unique because were made at night when the museum is closed to the public and there is usually no chance to make photos like these ones .
by Anton Dovbush
Our sexual lives are unnecessarily constrained by that old prude Euclid and his boring fifth postulate .
Our minds have been freed these last ninescore years from the limitations of flat space ; surely it is time for our bodies to follow !
The first section of the Riemann & Lobachevsky Kama Sutra ( somewhat misnamed , as it's not a religious work ) would concern sex acts possible in spaces with positive curvature : these would be the intimate and cozy acts , and masturbation .
A preface for the beginner would explore the possibilities of flat spaces with unusual connectivity , such as the 3 - space analogies to the surface of a cylider or torus ( T^3 ) .
Advanced material would investigate the potential of strongly curved space for bondage .
The second section of the book would cover negatively - curved space .
These acts would be expansive and open with typically yoga - like positions .
Advanced material would include hyperbolic orgies .
An illustrated edition also available with work by M.C. Escher .
( It 's often been argued that flat space * time * would be superior for sex , but there are convincing arguments that at least a little gravity is useful .
However , the R&LKS would concern itself with spatial curvature only .
A more general work will have to wait for Einstein 's contribution . )
Sponsored Feature : RAM , VRAM , and More RAM : 64 - Bit Gaming Is Here
By Chuck Walbourn
[ In the fourth Microsoft - sponsored article on Gamasutra 's XNA - themed microsite , XNA Developer Connection 's Walbourn discusses the rise of 64 - bit computing and gaming on Windows , explaining the technical specifics and programming advantages of 64 - bit . ]
“ 640 K is more memory than anyone will ever need ”
This famous , oft - quoted phrase -- and variations of it -- is routinely attributed to Bill Gates , founder and chairman of Microsoft Corporation .
For the record , Gates flatly denies ever having said it .
In fact , he has said the opposite .
1 Still , it persists in technical urban legend as a warning against underestimating the pace of PC evolution .
We ’ve come a long way since the days of the Intel 8088 processor with its 8 - bit data bus addressing one MB ( the upper 384 KB of addressing space was reserved for expansion cards , leaving 640 KB for physical memory ) .
The laptop I ’m using to write this article has 6,500 times more RAM than that .
In fact , my mobile phone , my digital camera , my DVR , and a dozen other electronic devices I interact with every day have far more than 640 KB of memory .
Of course , at the time of this alleged quote , in the early days of the PC industry , many home computers had 64 KB or less .
Like all engineering design efforts , PCs reflect a series of trade - offs .
Designers make compromises to make the device easier to build and cheaper to mass produce .
These compromises often provide some room for future growth , but often fall short of the true pace of innovation to minimize the impact on existing applications .
The PC ’s greatest strength is its great weakness : the relentless drive for innovation and backward compatibility .
It is a testament to the hard work of generations of engineers that we ’ve had a long chain of backward - compatible products that bridge a 16 - bit processor running at 4.77 MHz with 16 KB of RAM , CGA 4 - bit color graphics , and 16 KB of Video RAM ( VRAM ) to the modern 64 - bit processor running four or more CPUs at ~3 GHz , 4 + GB of RAM , one or more Direct3D10 class GPUs , and nearly a GB of VRAM .
We are now a few years into another major transition .
Actually , two major processor transitions are happening at the time same .
First , there is the move from single - core to multi-core processors .
Modern gaming consoles like Microsoft Xbox 360® have already pushed game developers to embrace , if reluctantly , the transition from single - threaded to multi- threaded gaming .
There is still a long way to go before we embrace the multi-core designs currently under development in the PC industry .
At the same time , there is a second transition : these new multi-core processors appearing in our PCs are also 64 - bit x64 processors .
The 4 GB Barrier : Physical Memory Limitations
The core of the memory limitation for a 32 - bit processor comes from basic binary math :
232 = 4,294,967,296 bytes or 4 GB
This means a 32 - bit processor can address only 4 GB worth of memory .
However , 4 GB is extremely optimistic .
Not every single address can be used for physical RAM .
Much like the original IBM PC could address 640 KB of RAM , while the upper 384 KB was reserved for expansion cards , modern devices also need to use some of that addressing space .
At boot time , the BIOS allocates addresses from the 0xc0000000 ( 3 GB ) to 0Xffffffff ( 4 GB ) range for installed devices .
Many of these devices are integrated into the motherboard .
The mapping system is more flexible than it once was .
Even so , everything from your audio device to your video card to the network interface needs to take away some of those address locations for its own purposes .
This leaves the balance available for physical RAM .
Because of this , the actual amount of physical memory accessible is something like 3 GB , 3.33 GB , or 3.5 GB , even when 4 GB or more physical RAM is installed .2
The amount of available physical RAM diminishes when you add more devices such as multiple video cards in a SLI ® or Crossfire™ setup .
There have been clever solutions proposed to resolve this problem , such as Intel ’s Physical Address Extensions , originally introduced in the Intel Pentium ®
Pro and also supported by AMD ’s Athalon™ processors .
3 PAE enables you to use 36 - bit physical memory addressing , while you continue to use 32 - bit addresses for the virtual memory system ’s page tables .
In theory , this allows the operating system to address the “ hidden ” memory while keeping everything intact as 32 bit .
In practice , most Windows device drivers fail when the system is put into 36 - bit PAE mode .
This aspect of PAE is therefore useful only for controlled environments like servers and supercomputing .

The 2GB Limit : Virtual Memory Limitations
So far we ’ve been talking about the limits of memory with respect to the system as a whole .
However , a 32 - bit processor also means the applications running on it are themselves 32 - bit programs .
Modern operating systems like Windows use virtual memory to enforce security and stability between running programs .
As part of this implementation , the top half of the virtual address space is reserved for use by the operating system itself .
This means standard 32 - bit programs are limited to using half of the potential virtual address space :
231 = 2,147,483,648 bytes or 2 GB
The other half of the address space is used by the operating system kernel as privileged shared memory areas to allow fast switching to kernel mode without needing to reload memory mappings .
This has some important and useful properties for programs .
For example , the difference between any two memory locations allocated by the program is guaranteed to fit into a 32 - bit signed number without under - or overflow ( i.e. , Standard C++ ptrdiff_t would not work in all cases for 32 - bit programs if they had a full 4 GB address space ) .
Virtual address space is also used for more than just accessing physical memory .
It is used for communication with hardware devices such as the graphics AGP / PCIe aperture , and for memory - mapped file I/O .
When the typical PC had 512 MB or one GB of physical RAM , there was still plenty of room in the 2 GB of virtual address space for all these uses in most cases .
As memories got larger , 2 GB of virtual address space became a limiting factor .
This was the case for data - intensive database and server applications when their files grew beyond a few MBs into multi-GBs or even Terabytes in size .
Microsoft extended the Win32 API with the Address Windowing Extensions 5 to enable applications to take advantage of the extra physical RAM made possible by 36 - bit mode PAE .
Unfortunately , this could be enabled only under special circumstances .
AWE enables a 32 - bit application to use more than 2 GB of RAM by using the classic technique of “ windowing , ” but windowing does n’t get around the fundamental limitations of the system .
Because it is complex , windowing is difficult to manage and the extra memory areas cannot be paged to disk .
A more direct proposal was to give back the 32nd bit to applications .
In principle , the concept is fairly simple : a 32 - bit application is linked with the Large Address Aware flag ( / LARGEADDRESSAWARE ) to indicate it will work correctly if it is given memory addresses larger than 2 GB .
Since all pointers in the application are already 32 bits , this is a simple condition to meet , assuming the program does not :
Use pointer arithmetic that can result in the difference failing to fit into a 32 - bit signed integer , or make other assumptions that pointers are always less than 2 GB in size .
Override the meaning of the 32nd bit for other purposes , such as indicating a “ handle ” vs. a “ pointer ” ( this technique is used by the DirectX SDK ’s D3DX9 Effects library by default with the D3DXHANDLE type ) .
The real limitation of Large Address Aware ( LAA ) is that the operating system configuration has to support it .
Standard Windows configurations assume the kernel has 2 GB of address space to work with .
Special boot modes are required to constrain the kernel to less than that in order to allow LAA applications to have more than 2 GB of user address space .
This is accomplished by the use of the /3GB switch or the /userva switch in Windows XP , or the IncreaseUserVa Boot Configuration Database element in Windows Vista.6
This will reserve up to 3 GB of address space for LAA applications , leaving the kernel with only 1 GB .
Many combinations of drivers and software loads can result in out - of - memory conditions for the kernel in this constrained memory boot mode .
It is a difficult solution to implement for your average gamer , and is better left for technically savvy IT managers to deploy in special circumstances .
Again , this helps with the virtual address space limitations of 32 - bit programs , but does n’t get around the physical RAM limitations .

The Growth of VRAM
Another factor in the PC memory equation has been growing as well : video memory size .
In the early days of Direct3D , the typical video card had 16 or 32 MB of Video RAM ( VRAM ) .
High - end video cards now have 512 MB , 640 MB , 768 MB , or more VRAM .
When video cards had 16 or 32 MB of Video RAM , this memory was mapped directly into every process that used Direct3D for efficient access by the application and video driver .
As video cards grew larger , this became unsustainable .
A 768 MB hole in the 2 - GB virtual address space of each process would leave very little space for applications .
Similarly , taking 768 MB out of the 4 GB physical address space would be too constraining .
This problem is exacerbated in dual GPU configurations ( SLI ® / Crossfire™ ) .
Therefore , video card manufacturers typically implement a 256 MB physical memory window for the video graphics memory , and modern drivers do not create direct process mappings for the entire VRAM size .
Process address space is still consumed for working with the AGP aperture ( 64 MB , 128 MB , or more typically on modern game systems 256 MB in size ) .
While PCIe uses a dynamic aperture , it too is mapped into each process that uses Direct3D .
Beyond the direct impact of growing VRAM sizes , more process memory is needed to maintain the backing - store for handling “ lost - device ” situations so for textures , geometry , and other static data , filling up such large video cards and still fitting under the 2 GB limit is extremely challenging .
The Windows Vista Display Driver Model ( WDDM ) was designed to address the lost device limitations inherent to the Windows XP Display Model ( XPDM ) , allowing more efficient sharing of the GPU by multiple applications .
WDDM does not require the entire 256 MB aperture be mapped in to the process space .
Instead , it dynamically grows the amount as the VRAM allocated by the application increases .
For Direct3D 10 applications , this eliminates the need to maintain two copies of resources like textures in memory , one for the VRAM and one in the backing - store for lost - device cases .
The system deals with migrating the one copy between memory and the video card , as needed .
Unfortunately , to maintain application compatibility with Direct3D 9 running on Windows XP , two copies of managed resources were still maintained for Direct3D 9 applications running on Windows Vista .
This also required process space for maintaining resources like render frame buffers .
Previously , render frame buffers were simply lost and recreated .
Therefore , they did not require any process space under WDM .
Since the elimination of the 256 MB aperture returned 256 MB of virtual address space to applications on WDDM that was already budgeted for under WDM , this change did not cause any problems until video cards with more than 256 MB of VRAM became available .
Small games still had plenty of that 2 GB address space available , but many modern AAA PC titles were running out of space on WDDM .7
The WDDM VA hotfix ( KB940105 for Windows Vista , included in Service Pack 1 ) 8 gives a bit of breathing room by only mapping video resources into the process that need direct CPU access .
Games that use Direct3D 10 also have decreased memory pressure without the extra copies required for “ device lost ” handling .
However , high - end games in development are routinely hitting the 2 GB wall even on Windows XP .
In fact , this incident proves that many modern AAA PC titles are already within 256 MB of the 2 GB barrier .
Otherwise , they would not have hit this problem until video cards were over 512 MB .

64 - Bit Computing
64 - bit processors have been around for many years .
They first appeared in supercomputer designs , then workstations and servers , and now are widely available .
The Xbox 360 ’s PowerPC is a 64 - bit processor , but has a 32 - bit process model .
Many well - known CPUs are 64 - bit processors , but none of them were successful enough to displace the broad adoption of the x86 PC .
The x64 64 - bit processor design directly addresses backward compatibility concerns by extending the existing x86 architecture , allowing it to run x86 32 - bit binaries without emulation and providing a new 64 - bit memory model .
First introduced by AMD and known alternatively as “ x86 - 64 “ and “ AMD64 , ” it has since been adopted by Intel as “ EM64T ” or “ Intel 64 . ”
Now it is known more generically as “ x64 . ”
The vast majority of desktop CPUs and most laptop CPUs sold in recent years are all x64 capable processors .
They fully support both pure 32 - bit and mixed 32 - bit / 64 - bit applications .
With the introduction of a new architecture , some improvements were made to the 64 - bit execution mode beyond expanding the registers and addressing from 32 bit to 64 bit .
These include eight more general purpose registers , eight more SSE registers , an NX no -execute bit ( which otherwise requires the use of PAE to access ) , new instructions , and guaranteed SSE2 or later support .
A few old system programming features of x86 were declared “ legacy . ”
While they are still available in the current hardware to support x86 32 - bit applications , they are not available in 64 - bit execution mode .9
Current implementations support 1 TB of physical memory , a limit that can easily be increased in the future .
The ample physical addressing capability completely eliminates the concerns about the “ hidden memory ” problem .
Supporting the 64 - bit execution mode requires a new version of the operating system .
Windows now comes in two flavors :
“ x86 ” which runs on legacy CPUs as well as in 32 - bit mode on x64 processors
“ x64 ” which runs on x64 processors providing 32 - bit and 64 - bit program support
Current Windows x64 versions ( Windows XP Pro X64 Edition , Windows Server 2003 , Windows Server 2008 , and Windows Vista ) support up to 44 bits of virtual memory addressing .
Each application is given a 43 - bit address space which is 8 TB , or 4,096 times larger than the process address space under 32 - bit Windows .
Future versions of Windows can easily extend this to even greater levels .
One of the benefits of being able to run 64 - bit native versions of applications is obviously a huge increase in memory capacity , but there are other added benefits .
Because the kernel itself is running in 64 - bit mode , it can easily accommodate the desires of a 32 - bit Large Address Aware ( LAA ) application .
As such , 32 - bit programs linked with the Large Address Aware flag are able to allocate a full 4 GB of user mode address space when running on Windows x64 .
There is no special boot mode required or system stability impact that would require careful configuration .
This makes LAA a highly attractive , consumer - friendly way of giving 32 - bit processes more virtual address space on Windows x64 .
Windows XP Pro x64 Edition , released in April 2005 , was an early adopter consumer OS .
The Windows - on - Windows - 64 ( WOW64 ) system works well for running 32 - bit applications on the x64 version of Windows .
The OS still required a new generation of 64 - bit native kernel - mode drivers , as kernel - mode code must use the native memory model of the system .
Existing programs ran into problems on the new OS in three ways :
Older installer packages still included 16 - bit code from the Windows 3.1 era , and this code is not supported when running in 64 - bit execution mode .
Applications that used kernel - mode drivers , such as copy protection schemes common in games , needed to provide 64 - bit native Authenticode signed versions of these components .
The new OS sometimes exposed bugs in poorly written installers that made assumptions about directory paths , invalid path characters , or ran afoul of WOW64 ’s legacy registry handling .
The release of Windows Vista brings x64 into the mainstream .
Now , all editions of Windows Vista are available in both x86 and x64 versions , and all the Windows Vista logo programs push support for Windows x64 .
These programs help drive the whole Windows ecosystem to support x64 versions of Windows .
In particular , they provide third - party , 64 - bit device drivers .
The lack of broad driver support was the main reason for the limited distribution of Windows XP Pro x64 Edition .
9 “ AMD64 Architecture Programmer ’s Manual , ” AMD .
Crawl
In the near term , vendors and software developers must support both x86 and x64 versions of Windows .
For application developers , this means making sure that their 32 - bit applications work correctly on Windows x64 under WOW64 .
Game developers can take advantage of huge increase in memory support for content creation , servers , and development stations .
As with all technology transitions , customer demand tends to drive many companies to support Windows x64 .
Having said that , it is no longer “ early adopter hell . ”
I personally run Windows XP Pro X64 and Windows Vista x64 on my development systems , Windows Vista x64 on my laptop , and Windows Vista x64 at home for my gaming machines .
Based on the download statistics for KB940105 , and driver packages from major video hardware vendors , we estimate that a quarter of the hardcore gamer market that adopted Windows Vista is running 64 - bit versions .
Market realities , however , dictate that most games need to be playable on 32 - bit systems for the coming years .
Therefore , making sure your 32 - bit game runs well on both x86 and x64 versions of Windows is a basic shipping criterion .
Just as with previous OS transitions , Windows x64 is a better development environment .
It is a safer bet that a 32 - bit program that runs well on Windows x64 will run perfectly fine on x86 versions than vice versa .
Transitioning to Windows x64 also greatly expands your options .
You can introduce 64 - bit native versions of tools into your pipeline .
Also , LAA 32 - bit tools get maximum memory benefits .
The Visual Studio linker , for example , is an LAA application .
For large monolithic executables , this can mean the difference between being able to enable Whole Program Optimization and failing to link .
A 64 - bit version of a level editor or 3D modeler can enable you to work on whole levels without having to deal with time - consuming “ chunking ” workarounds .
Running a 64 - bit operating system means that you can install 8 GB or 16 GB of physical memory , instead of being limited to less than 4 GB .
This means you can load huge data sets without paging .
Often , the disk cache will keep all of the files you are working on in RAM .
Walk
Basic compatibility with Windows x64 for your 32 - bit applications and moving your internal systems over is a good first step .
The real value for customers will come from taking advantage of Windows x64 .
Some showcase games have already provided 64 - bit native versions of their game .
However , not every studio has the option of creating , testing , and optimizing two distinct versions of their title .
One solution is to take advantage of Large Address Aware ( LAA ) in your game to allow scaling content beyond the 2 GB Limit , while keeping to a single 32 - bit executable .
The highest - detail settings would be available only when you run the game on Windows x64 , or when you use additional memory for larger resource caches to improve the overall player experience , based on a call to GlobalMemoryStatusEx .10
For networked games with a server infrastructure , Windows x64 64 - bit native server programs can take advantage of both the extra physical RAM support and the greatly expanded virtual memory space for more aggressive memory - mapped I /O usage .
Making your server 64 - bit native enhances the development team ’s expertise in 64 - bit programming .
At the same time , it reduces the impact on the content team , and running 64 - bit native executables can greatly improve the performance and stability of your servers running in the datacenter .
Run
Once games demonstrate better content running on 64 - bit versions of Windows , the business case for making a 64 - bit native version of the game becomes more realistic .
Smaller games that fit comfortably into the 2 GB limits of 32 - bit processes have no particular need for 64 - bit native versions in the short term .
On the other hand , AAA titles are already transitioning to 64 - bit native executables .
In some cases , these are purely internal builds to better handle debugging , unoptimized content , and rapid iteration .
In the long run , it will make sense to ship these to customers .
Shipping 64 - bit native applications will become the norm as 32 - bit systems are retired or upgraded .
Even many laptops are x64 capable .
In fact , today ’s gaming laptops often come with 4 GB or more RAM .
While the use of 64 - bit pointers can increase an application ’s memory footprint somewhat , structure packing and optimization can bring a 64 - bit application in line with an equivalent 32 - bit application .
Such x64 native applications gain the performance benefits of extra registers .
They can assume SSE2 to transition away from the less efficient x87 FP stack model .
They also eliminate the fairly small marshaling costs of Win32 system calls on Windows x64 bypassing WOW64 .
Future development efforts of processors , compilers , and other tools will shift from being 32 - bit focused to 64 - bit .
At that point , memory addressability is no longer the primary driving reason to move to x64 native applications .
There are two main challenges to the future of x64 native games beyond the traditional issue of market penetration and adoption : third - party “ middleware ” solutions and tools and the use of deprecated technologies .
10 “ 64 - bit programming for Game Developers , ” Specifying Large - Address - Aware When Building , DirectX SDK Documentation .
Third - Party Middleware Solutions and Tools
Most commercial games shipped include some form of third - party , open source , or shared source code .
Therefore , it is important that providers of these solutions engage early on in supporting Windows x64 .
Failing to support x64 , they risk blocking developers from starting the transition as it would otherwise make sense for their titles and technology projects .
Having 32 - bit solutions that are compatible with Windows x64 is a market necessity today to avoid alienating users of 64 - bit technology — which should eventually be anyone with 4 GB or more of RAM in their PCs .
These solutions also need to support 64 - bit native development .
This includes copy - protection schemes , rendering libraries , game engines , audio libraries , animation systems , networking libraries , compilers , profilers , debuggers , 3D modeling tools , photo editing tools , and so forth .
As customers of these products , game developers have a strong influence on how quickly these libraries and tools support 64 - bit native development .
Use of Deprecated Technologies
Game developers are extremely busy professionals .
Typically , a successful solution wo n’t be revisited until it breaks .
Engines and libraries tend to get reused , often beyond the life of a single project .
This means many modern games are still using older versions of DirectX components , Windows APIs , 16 - bit code installer bootstrappers , or other technologies that may have been deprecated for many years .
In the transition from 32 - bit to 64 - bit execution mode , many of these older technologies were not carried forward .
While such code works on Windows x64 under WOW64 as a 32 - bit application , it will fail to compile as a 64 - bit native application because the APIs it is using are not available for 64 - bit native applications .
Porting such code bases to 64 - bit native requires updating to newer versions of the deprecated API .
In some cases , developers need to rewrite the functionality using modern facilities .
Embrace the Future
The transition to 64 - bit computing is like many technology transitions before : it requires some additional work and new learning .
Nevertheless , it offers exciting new opportunities and potential .
Game developers can prepare for this not - too - distant future by learning about x64 technology , transitioning their code bases away from deprecated technologies not available to 64 - bit native programs , taking advantage of tools porting efforts to prepare their code bases for the move to 64 - bit native development , and learning about x64 optimization .
11
Internal efforts now to gain x64 experience and to push on providers of applications , tools , and third - party libraries to proactively support x64 compatibility and x64 native development will help pave a smoother road into the future that is already upon us .

Germany : Unemployed man starves himself to death
By Dietmar Henning
27 February 2008
The demise of a 58 - year - old unemployed man who deliberately starved himself to death in a remote hideout in the woods is both a personal tragedy and a devastating indictment of the current state of German society .
It says more about conditions in Germany than all the pious speeches of professional politicians and academic studies into poverty and unemployment .
The emaciated body of Hans - Peter Z was discovered two weeks ago , in a forest area near Solling in Lower Saxony .
It is estimated that Hans - Peter Z had already been dead for over two months .
According to a police report he died after not eating for 24 days and drinking only a little water , while documenting his suffering in a diary .
The circumstances of his death and his diary entries indicate that he wanted his suicide to send out a message .
According to the press reports available , his death was as calm and quiet as his previous life had been .
Even if he had “ only ” wanted to draw attention to his personal fate , it is closely interwoven with the sorry state of society , which his suicide has now graphically illuminated .
Hans -Peter Z was born in April 1949 in Schleswig - Holstein , in West Germany .
On finishing school , he served for 12 years as a soldier in the German Armed Forces .
He completed his training as an office administrator , married and had a daughter .
Like many others , after German reunification in 1990 he sought to build up his business in East Germany where there was much consumer potential .
As a self - employed person he initiated and organized trade fairs that were initially successful .
For a long time , he was able to provide a living for his family , which many newspapers described as a “ stable ordinary life . ”
But the constant travelling — only being able to see his family at weekends , if at all — seemed to take its toll .
First , his marriage broke down , and later his relationship with his daughter .
In about 2000 , he began to work as a representative for a company that manufactures hammocks , travelling to trade fairs throughout Germany .
His boss remembers Hans - Peter Z as “ extremely reliably , loyal and honest .
If there was just the slightest danger that he would arrive too late in the morning for an appointment , he would drive there the evening before . ”
In the meantime , he had moved to Badendorf , a small village near Lübeck , where he attracted little attention in the multi-occupancy building in which he lived .
Neighbours described him as reserved , neat , as someone who “ left the house early on Mondays well turned out , and came back late on Fridays . ”
But three years later , Hans - Peter Z lost his job again .
From October 2003 , the business cut back its involvement in trade fairs ; the 54 - year - old man was no longer needed .
At this age , it was difficult to find a job .
In 2003 , only about 40 percent of all those aged 50 - plus had work .
One in four unemployed people belongs to this age group .
Like many others , Hans - Peter Z again tried to make a living as a self - employed person , this time without success .
He had money problems and could no longer pay his rent .
When he could n’t settle a hotel bill , he gave a false address .
A few days later , he turned himself in to the police .
A new relationship failed .
At this point , Hans - Peter Z was suffering from depression and had suicidal thoughts for the first time .
He entered hospital to undergo psychiatric treatment .
He lost his accommodation for non-payment of rent .
In 2006 , Hans - Peter Z found accommodation with friends in Seelze near Hanover .
Here also he attracted little attention in this simple postwar multi-occupancy building .
Around the turn of the year 2006 / 2007 he then moved into a small two - room furnished apartment in Hanover .
He was now living like a recluse , reading a great deal and riding his bike , surviving on his unemployment benefits .
Again and again , he told his landlord and the advisors at the local unemployment agency about his job applications .
But the 58 - year old was only offered jobs on a commission - only basis by shady businessmen , which Hans - Peter Z rejected .
The unemployment agency was unable to help .
He was told to consider early retirement .
Hans - Peter Z was indignant : “ I am not a candidate for a pension . ”
He was still optimistic , and hoped to find a proper job .
However , in October 2007 his unemployment benefits were reduced , and this previously successful self - employed man faced having to lodge a claim for welfare payments .
His unemployment benefits now amounted to just € 347 a month , but Hans - Peter Z did not make a claim for welfare .
Whether he actually had the prospects of a job in Cologne in November last year , or whether he only mentioned it because he had already resolved to end his life , is not known .
In any case , he quit his apartment in Hanover and euphorically told his landlord about a new job in Cologne , saying that all his applications had finally resulted in success in his old field of work — trade fairs .
Hans - Peter Z paid his last rent and left a few cardboard boxes in the cellar , saying he would fetch them later .
That is the last time Hans - Peter Z was seen alive .
In mid-November , he left his small apartment and rode on his bicycle the approximately 100 kilometres to Solling in Lower Saxony .
With a backpack and a water bottle , he began his last journey .
At a certain point , he left his bike and continued on foot .
When he climbed into the hideout in the woods , he must have decided he was not going to leave it alive .
In his diary , he documents in detail each day up to his death .
He writes how his organs slowly stop working , his skin dries up , how he becomes increasingly emaciated , losing bodily sensation , and his mental faculties diminish .
At one point , a young boy tries to climb into the hideout , but his father calls him back .
At the beginning of December he loses track of time .
On December 6 , he writes that it must be Christmas .
He eats nothing , only occasionally drinking some water .
In the end , he asks that his diary be handed over to his daughter .
The last entry is dated December13 .
His final wish is to be buried at sea .
The police later establish that Hans - Peter Z must have resided in his hideout in the woods for at least 24 days before he died .
For over two months , his dead body lay untouched , until it was found two weeks ago by hunters .
Hans - Peter Z had not been missed .
The 58 - year - old seemed to have internalised all the “ virtues ” that businesses expect of their employees .
He did not work in order to live ; he lived in order to work .
When society refused him the chance to work — a man who had always worked for his living — his world collapsed .
At 58 , he considered himself neither superfluous , nor a “ candidate for a pension . ”
He was too proud to ask for welfare payments and face the degradation of cheap - wage labour .
Just as society was denying him work and a means of living , so he denied himself water and food .
He showed the same discipline in the manner of his death that had distinguished his working life .
“ One has to be very disciplined to end your life this way , ” said Professor Michael Manns from the Hanover University Medical School ( MHH ) .
First , a person ’s fat is consumed ; then the body begins to consume the muscles .
At the same time , the body lacks vitamins , protein and electrolytes , according to Manns .
The level of uric acid builds up ; kidney stones can form , unleashing colic attacks .
“ This leads to weak circulation , the blood becomes more concentrated , and the body dries out . ”
The person suffers general weakness , and has strong stomach pains .
Muscles became weaker , until the person falls unconscious .
Finally , there is heart failure .
Hans - Peter
Z suffered all these agonies , finally lying down to die , as if to sleep .
The two hunters found him lying on his back , legs bent and with his hands behind his head .
His death is a personal tragedy , but even more so , it is an indictment of the inhuman treatment meted out to the unemployed ( and in particular the long - term unemployed ) introduced by the Social Democratic - Green Party government under Gerhard Schröder ( SPD ) with its so - called “ Hartz welfare reforms . ”
Older people who have worked all their life and then become unemployed rapidly lose their benefits and become dependent on welfare .
Once a person has to claim welfare under the “ Hartz IV ” rules , the chicanery begins .
The individual has to provide comprehensive information about all their possessions and property .
All their savings must first be exhausted before they can receive welfare payments .
A car or more than a one - bedroom apartment is only deemed appropriate for the single “ long - term unemployed ” in exceptional cases .
The person has to report frequently to a job centre and must accept any work , including cheap - wage jobs for which they may be overqualified .
If they refuse to accept a job or do not attend an appointment they face cuts in their welfare payments .
In brief , since the introduction of the Hartz legislation , to be unemployed is one long humiliation .
Hans - Peter Z’s is not an isolated case .
The constantly rising physical and psychological pressures and the rapid development of technology in the workplace mean many people aged over 50 find themselves pushed aside and dependent on welfare .
In the light of personal or relationship problems that arise or are caused by this situation , it is remarkable that there are not more suicides .
In Germany , there are nearly 1 million people aged over 50 who are unemployed and dependent on welfare , most of them for longer than one year .
The parlous state of German society was also revealed by the media bidding war that ensued for the rights to publish Hans - Peter Z ’s diary .
According to press reports , his daughter has already been offered a five - figure sum for her father ’s diary .
A movie director and a writer have also shown an interest in his story .
Before they turn to the diary of Hans - Peter Z , they should read a powerful historical precedent —
Arthur Miller ’s play “ Death of a Salesman , ” in which the main character Willy Loman eventually kills himself after losing his job in the harsh conditions of 1940s America .
KILROY WAS HERE !
In 1946 the American Transit Association , through its radio program , “ Speak to America , ” sponsored a nationwide contest to find the REAL Kilroy , offering a prize of a real trolley car to the person who could prove himself to be the genuine article .
Almost 40 men stepped forward to make that claim , but only James Kilroy from Halifax , Massachusetts had evidence of his identity .
Kilroy was a 46 - year old shipyard worker during the war .
He worked as a checker at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy .
His job was to go around and check on the number of rivets completed .
Riveters were on piecework and got paid by the rivet .
Kilroy would count a block of rivets and put a check mark in semi- waxed lumber chalk , so the rivets would n’t be counted twice .
When Kilroy went off duty , the riveters would erase the mark .
Later on , an off - shift inspector would come through and count the rivets a second time , resulting in double pay for the riveters .
One day Kilroy ’s boss called him into his office .
The foreman was upset about all the wages being paid to riveters , and asked him to investigate .
It was then that he realized what had been going on .
The tight spaces he had to crawl in to check the rivets did n’t lend themselves to lugging around a paint can and brush , so Kilroy decided to stick with the waxy chalk .
He continued to put his checkmark on each job he inspected , but added KILROY WAS HERE in king - sized letters next to the check , and eventually added the sketch of the chap with the long nose peering over the fence and that became part of the Kilroy message .
Once he did that , the riveters stopped trying to wipe away his marks .
Ordinarily the rivets and chalk marks would have been covered up with paint .
With war on , however , ships were leaving the Quincy Yard so fast that there was n’t time to paint them .
As a result , Kilroy ’s inspection “ trademark ” was seen by thousands of servicemen who boarded the troopships the yard produced .
His message apparently rang a bell with the servicemen , because they picked it up and spread it all over Europe and the South Pacific .
Before the war ’s end , “ Kilroy ” had been here , there , and everywhere on the long haul to Berlin and Tokyo .
To the unfortunate troops outbound in those ships , however , he was a complete mystery ; all they knew for sure was that some jerk named Kilroy had “ been there first . ”
As a joke , U.S. servicemen began placing the graffiti wherever they landed , claiming it was already there when they arrived .
Kilroy became the U.S. super - GI who had always “ already been ” wherever GIs went .
It became a challenge to place the logo in the most unlikely places imaginable ( it is said to be atop Mt. Everest , the Statue of Liberty , the underside of the Arch De Triumphe , and even scrawled in the dust on the moon . )
And as the war went on , the legend grew .
Underwater demolition teams routinely sneaked ashore on Japanese - held islands in the Pacific to map the terrain for the coming invasions by U.S. troops ( and thus , presumably , were the first GI ’s there ) .
On one occasion , however , they reported seeing enemy troops painting over the Kilroy logo !
In 1945 , an outhouse was built for the exclusive use of Roosevelt , Stalin , and Churchill at the Potsdam conference .
The first person inside was Stalin , who emerged and asked his aide ( in Russian ) , “ Who is Kilroy ? ” ..
To help prove his authenticity in 1946 , James Kilroy brought along officials from the shipyard and some of the riveters .
He won the trolley car , which he gave it to his nine children as a Christmas gift and set it up as a playhouse in the Kilroy front yard in Halifax , Massachusetts .
Software makers have slammed reports by the government that patents posed a considerable threat to the growth of the African software sector .
According to a report published on Thursday by technology newswire Tectonic , Geraldine Fraser - Moleketi , the minister of public service and administration , told the Idlelo conference in Dakar , Senegal , that free software and open standards were intended to encourage competition , while patents were exclusive and anti-competitive by their nature .
“ Whereas there are some industries where the temporary monopoly granted by a patent may be justified … there ’s no reason to believe that society benefits from such monopolies being granted for computer programs [ and inventions ] , ” she said in a pre-recorded speech delivered at the conference .
But Paulo Ferreira , the platform strategy manager at Microsoft South Africa , said : “ There is no such thing as free software .
Nobody develops software for charity . ”
He added : “ For innovation to continue , there needs to be value – and even open - source applications have some form of market model , which incentivises them to continue innovating . ”
Some international software makers have been against open - source software , which has been promoted by local information technology ( IT ) mogul Mark Shuttleworth .
Fraser - Moleketi was quoted saying : “ Open standards are a critical factor in building interoperable systems that are important to governments …
“ In South African we have a document – the minimum interoperability standards – which includes the use of open document format . ”
Ferreira said that Microsoft was working with key industry partners , including open - source communities , to develop interoperable solutions that met customer needs .
He said : “ A country like India has built a powerhouse IT economy without engaging in largely political debates around free and proprietary software .
It is vital that South Africa moves beyond the current politically charged debate around open - source software .
“ Instead , we should focus our energies on delivering value - added services to the government , business and its citizens , using whatever existing technology and standards they have in place , thus meeting any specific needs they have to access and use information optimally . ”
Malcolm Rabson , the managing director at software company Dariel Solutions , said the open - source technology appeared to be free but did not come with a “ rich ” set of documentation for the project , which required high - end skills .
He said this resulted in more money being spent in salaries for these “ high - end technologists ” .
Rob Lith , a director at Connection Telecom , said open source was disrupting proprietary alternatives and that “ is why we see the ‘ kraal ’ mentality of the proprietary vendors who are trying to protect their revenues ” .
The industry was moving towards a collaboration phase , using open source as the foundation for applications , he said .
“ To isolate yourself from this collaboration is suicide . ”

Business Report
US : Returning veterans face mounting joblessness and low wages
By Alex Lantier
29 March 2008
On March 25 , the Wall Street Journal published a brief summary of a US Veterans Affairs Department study on discharged veterans ’ employment and wage prospects .
The report , not yet publicly released and largely blacked out in the broader US media , paints a devastating picture of surging unemployment and low wages for returning veterans .
It found that the percentage of veterans not in the labor force — due to unemployment , having returned to school for further training , or having given up looking for work — had more than doubled between 2000 and 2005 , jumping from 10 to 23 percent .
Veterans aged 20 - 24 had an unemployment rate of 12 percent , 50 percent larger than the overall US unemployment rate for adults aged 20 - 24 , which stands at 8 percent .
On March 27 , the military newspaper Stars and Stripes , writing on the same report , noted that 18 percent of veterans reported being unemployed .
Many employed veterans earn salaries leaving them at constant risk of financial hardship .
Twenty - five percent reported earning less than $ 21,840 a year .
Half of those aged 20 - 24 earned less than $ 25,000 a year .
The report also exposed one of most commonly promoted claims of military recruiters : that recruits will gain valuable gain job skills for future civilian life .
The Journal wrote : “ The report found that most of the returning veterans were unable to find civilian jobs that matched their previous military occupations .
The only exceptions were the veterans working for private security firms such as Blackwater or in the maintenance and repair fields . ”
The Journal added : “ The Veterans Affairs Department offers educational - assistance programs for young veterans , but the report said the initiatives had little impact on the employment status or salaries of the former military personnel . ”
Several other sources noted difficulties facing veterans in looking for civilian jobs .
Military.com , the veterans ’ section of the online recruitment web site Monster.com , released a survey of veteran jobseekers and civilian employers in November 2007 .
The survey found that 81 percent of discharged veterans did not “ feel fully prepared for the process of entering the job market , ” with 71 percent unsure of how to negotiate salary and benefits and 76 percent reporting “ an inability to effectively translate their military skills into civilian terms . ”
The way these facts came to public attention — through the leaking of an internal report , which then went broadly ignored in the mainstream press — speaks volumes about the state of American political life and class relations .
As US fatalities reached 4,000 this past week , the death toll in the war and occupation of Iraq received a certain amount of coverage in the print and broadcast media .
The number of wounded soldiers , however , is controversial and rarely discussed .
And the difficulties facing returning veterans — the lack of jobs , financial insecurity , denial of health care , and homelessness — also receive little press coverage .
The problems of returning veterans are closely tied to the deteriorating situation of the broader American working class .
They follow inevitably from the US military ’s thrusting often traumatized veterans into a society marked by rising unemployment , deindustrialization , the destruction of high - paying jobs , and increasingly difficult access to health care , education , and housing .
As Ricky Singh of Black Veterans for Social Justice told OneWorld news service in November 2007 , “ What typically happens to young adults who go into the military at 17 or 18 , when they return home , the same kind of economic conditions that forced them towards the military still exist or have gotten worse . ”
The career advice offered to veterans in a February 24 , 2008 , posting on VeteransToday.com provides a revealing picture of the US job market .
It notes that in “ farming , production , and transportation — you ’re looking at slow or negative growth and poor job availability . ”
Another major sector that VeteransToday.com encourages veterans to consider — construction — is entering recession due to the bursting of the mortgage and real estate bubbles and the crisis on Wall Street .
Observing that the US economy is “ becoming more technology - oriented and less dependent on agriculture and manufacturing , ” VeteransToday.com recommends the following jobs as “ the place to start ” : software engineer , veterinarian , financial analyst , dental hygienist , nurse , college professor , doctor , and lawyer .
However , the extensive training required for these jobs makes them difficult options for returning veterans , many of whom joined the armed forces upon graduating from high school .
The drying up of student loans , amid the general tightening of US credit markets , aggravates the problem .
Among service jobs , VeteransToday.com noted , “ Retail sales , wait staff , and cashier jobs are numerous , but each carries a wince - inducing median salary of between $ 14,000 and $ 20,000 per year .
Customer service offers the fourth most job openings for new workers , with a substantially better median salary of just over $ 28,000 . ”
The crisis of veterans ’ health care has surfaced several times to the media ’s attention , especially after the March 2007 revelation of gross neglect of wounded veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center .
In November 2007 , the Boston Globe reported that , according to estimates by Physicians for Social Responsibility and staff physicians at the Veterans Affairs Department , the total cost of treating veterans would top $ 650 billion .
Several factors account for this figure .
The development of body armor and rapid battlefield medical evacuation has greatly increased the number of severely wounded soldiers who survive their injuries , pushing the wounded - to - killed ratio to over 8 to 1 , from 2 to 1 during World War II .
The Globe noted that the percentage of amputees was the highest since the US Civil War .
Moreover , the percentage of veterans afflicted by post - traumatic stress disorder ( shell shock ) is currently expected to reach between 30 and 36 percent of a total population of 1.5 million veterans of the current wars — an astounding half a million patients .
Though many wounded and disabled veterans are being denied treatment , the resulting flood of patients is overwhelming the Veterans Affairs Department .
According to a January 2008 study by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America association , the number of outstanding claims by veterans for treatment rose from 254,000 to 378,000 between 2003 and 2006 , with the average waiting time before a veteran receives treatment rising to 183 days .
This situation has provoked massive resentment among veterans .
It forced the February 28 resignation of Veterans Affairs Undersecretary for Benefits Daniel Cooper , after a video surfaced in which Cooper , a member of the Christian Embassy missionary group , stated that Bible study was more important than his professional duties .
In the video , Cooper said : “ It ’s not really about carving out time , it really is a matter of saying what is important .
And since that ’s more important than doing the job — the job ’s going to be there , whether I ’m there or not . ”
CBS News reported on the epidemic of veteran suicides on March 20 .
Citing internal Veterans Affairs reports , CBS found that the number of suicide attempts by recently treated VA patients almost doubled , from 462 in 2000 to 790 in 2007 .
The total number of VA patients who succeeded in committing suicide was 1,403 in 2001 and 1,784 in 2005 .
Large numbers of veterans are homeless .
The Department of Veterans Affairs web page states , in its Overview of Homeless : “ About 154,000 veterans ( male and female ) are homeless on any given night and perhaps twice as many experience homelessness at some point during the course of a year .
Many other veterans are considered near homeless or at risk because of their poverty , lack of support from family and friends , and dismal living conditions in cheap hotels or in overcrowded or substandard housing . ”
The Alliance to End Homelessness , a nonprofit organization quoted by the Boston Globe , gave higher estimates : “ 194,254 out of 744,313 homeless people on any given night [ nationwide ] are veterans . ”
The group had based its calculations on information from the Department of Veterans Affairs and the US Census Bureau .

Homeland Security invokes nuclear bomb , as Bush quietly links cybersecurity program to NSA John Byrne
Published : Wednesday April 9 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Department of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff has dropped the bomb .
At a speech to hundreds of security professionals Wednesday , Chertoff declared that the federal government has created a cyber security " Mahattan Project , " referencing the 1941 - 1946 project led by the Army Corps of Engineers to develop American 's first atomic bomb .
According to Wired 's Ryan Singel , Chertoff gave few details of what the government actually plans to do .
He cites a little - noticed presidential order : " In January , President Bush signed a presidential order expanding the role of DHS and the NSA in government computer security , " Singel writes .
" Its contents are classified , but the U.S. Director of National Intelligence has said he wants the NSA to monitor America 's internet traffic and Google searches for signs of cyber attack . "
The National Security Agency was the key player in President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program , which was revealed by the New York Times in 2005 .
Sound familiar ?
Yesterday , documents acquired by the Electronic Frontier Foundation under the Freedom of Information act showed the FBI has engaged in a massive cyber surveillance project that targets terror suspects emails , telephone calls and instant messages -- and is able to get some information without a court order .
Last week , the ACLU revealed documents showing that the Pentagon was using the FBI to spy on Americans .
The military is using the FBI to skirt legal restrictions on domestic surveillance to obtain private records of Americans '
Internet service providers , financial institutions and telephone companies , according to Pentagon documents .
Chertoff sought to calm those who worry that Homeland Security will begin t take an invasive Internet role .
" We do n't have to sit on the internet and prevent things from coming in or going out , " Chertoff said , which Singel says refers to China and other countries that censor what web sites their citizens can see .
" That 's not what we are going to do . "
Bush wants $ 42 million more for program But Chertoff may have had another reason for hyping threats of cyber terrorism .
Money .
Congress appropriated $ 150 million in funding for the program this year , Singel notes .
The administration has sought $ 192 million for 2009 .
Speaking of threats , Chertoff remarked : " Imagine , if you will , a sophisticated attack on our financial systems that caused them to be paralyzed .
It would shake the foundation of trust on which our financial system works . "
Remarked Singel wryly , " That digital mushroom cloud scenario means the government 's role in computer security must extend beyond federal networks , and reach to shared responsibility for financial , telecommunication and transportation infrastructure , Chertoff said .
" The failure of any single system has cascading effects across our country . "
Which recalls another quote by a senior administration official .
Speaking of the alleged threat of Saddam Hussein in 2003 , then National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice remarked , " We do n't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud . "
Some types of cannabis are increasing in strength
Home Secretary Downing Street has signalled Gordon Brown remains determined to tighten the law on cannabis - against the advice of an independent panel of experts .
BBC News has been told the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs believes that cannabis should remain in the lowest category , Class C. Conservative Leader David Cameron called on Gordon Brown to tighten up the law on cannabis .
Mr Cameron said the prime minister must " stop dithering " .
A Downing Street spokesman said reports that the Advisory Council were going to recommend keeping cannabis in Class C were premature .
He said Gordon Brown stood by earlier remarks about the need to signal that cannabis use was illegal and unacceptable .
The Conservative Party has a very clear view that it should be Class B
David Cameron
Leader of the Opposition Report later
The council - the official body which advises the government on drugs policy - was asked by the government to review cannabis 's legal status amid concerns over stronger forms of it .
Its decision leaves the government in an awkward position , said BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw .
If the government went ahead and reclassified cannabis to class B , ministers would be rejecting the findings of the council 's panel of 23 drug experts - which has never happened before on a decision about drug classification .
The council 's chairman Professor Sir Michael Rawlins refused to confirm or deny a decision , and said a report would be sent to Home Secretary Jacqui Smith later this month .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said she would not comment on the review until she had received it .
The prime minister 's spokesman said : " As we understand it , this report is based on one presentation that was given to a meeting .
The advisory council themselves are still some way away from reaching final conclusions .
The advisory council is the most authoritative and independent body capable of making a judgment
Chris Huhne
Liberal Democrats , home affairs " As to what the prime minister thinks , he made that fairly clear in the press conference earlier this week . "
Opposition views
The Conservatives want the government to tighten up the law , regardless of the recommendations from advisers .
" There are all sorts of cannabis on the streets today .
Skunk and super skunk are incredibly powerful and can lead to people having all sorts of mental health problems " , the Conservative Party leader David Cameron said .
" The Conservative Party has a very clear view that it should be class B . "
But the Liberal Democrats are urging the opposite .
Their home affairs spokesman , Chris Huhne said ministers should " stop playing politics " and listen to the advice of the medical experts .
" The Advisory Council is the most authoritative and independent body capable of making a judgment , and we should not turn drugs classification into a political football or the plaything of tabloid newspaper editors " , Mr Huhne said .
University study A meeting of the Advisory Council is reported to have discussed significant new research from Keele University about links between cannabis and mental illness .
The study found nothing to support a theory that rising cannabis use in the 1970s , 1980s and early 1990s led to increases in the incidence of schizophrenia later on .
MAXIMUM DRUG PENALTIES
Class A : Seven years for possession , life for supplying Class B : Five years for possession , 14 for supplying Class C : Two years for possession , 14 for supplying Cannabis was downgraded from a class B drug to class C in January 2004 .
The move to downgrade cannabis to Class C in 2004 was intended to free up police time and allow officers to concentrate on tackling harder drugs .
Adults found carrying cannabis are unlikely to be arrested , and young people are most likely to be arrested and reprimanded .
Possession of the class C drug does carry a maximum penalty of a two - year prison sentence , but this is rarely served .
People found to be carrying a class B drug can be given up to a five - year sentence .
Young people are literally dicing with their minds and futures
Marjorie Wallace , Sane Former government drugs advisor Keith Hellawell said the government should never have reclassified cannabis to Class C .
He said the move created confusion for police , teachers , parents and young people by sending out the wrong message .
Police chiefs want cannabis to return to Class B. The Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) said it stood by its recommendation made to the Advisory Council that cannabis should be restored to the category of a Class B drug .
But Steve Rolles , of the Transform Drugs Policy Foundation , said increasing jail sentences from two years to five through reclassification was not the best way to send a strong signal to teenagers about the dangers of the drug .
" Rather than mass criminalisation of millions of young people , the best way would be to invest in effective , targeted public health education , " he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Let adults make their own minds up , I choose to smoke cannabis and will continue to do so , regardless of classification Gadge , North Tyneside Mental health charity Sane was one group which gave evidence to the advisory group .
Marjorie Wallace , the charity 's chief executive , said not enough was yet known about the direct links between cannabis and the brain .
She said she knew of hundreds of cases where people smoked cannabis heavily , in particular skunk , and went on to suffer psychotic breakdowns , hallucinations and paranoia .

What are these ?
Take it from Wayne Gretzky :
In your portfolio , as in hockey , you want to skate to where the puck is going , not to where it 's been .
So even though the U.S. dollar has moved higher over the past year , you should follow the economic clues that point in the opposite direction : down .

The hefty U.S. current - account deficit , which clocked in at $ 673 billion in 2008 , tells much of the story .
That figure represents the difference between what the U.S. pays to other countries for goods , services and income from investments , and what it receives from other countries .
As Axel Merk , chief investment officer and president of Merk Investments , explains , the gap implies that foreign investors have to purchase more than $ 2 billion of dollar - denominated assets every day just to keep the dollar from falling .
Bargains Still Abound in Bonds China : A Bright Spot Overseas
Foreigners gladly snapped up dollar - denominated assets , particularly Treasury bills and bonds , in late 2008 and early 2009 , when financial Armageddon loomed .
The dollar is , after all , still the world 's reserve currency and considered highly safe .
That flight to safety fueled a 25 % rise in the value of the greenback against a basket of developed - market currencies over the year through March 5 .
But now that Armageddon is off the table , foreign investors have reversed course .
In April , foreign governments bought a net $ 8.3 billion of U.S. Treasury securities , down from $ 50.5 billion the month before .
In total , foreign investors sold a net $ 53.2 billion of dollar - denominated securities in April .

This trend will continue even if the dollar retains its status as the world 's reserve currency .
As bond guru Bill Gross , chief investment officer of Pimco , wrote in a recent commentary on his firm 's Web site , " Holders of dollars should diversify their own [ currency ] baskets before central banks and sovereign wealth funds ultimately do the same . "
This does not mean you should move your retirement savings into the Chinese renminbi .
After all , you probably earn and spend most of your money in dollars .
But diversifying your bond or cash holdings with a fund that benefits from a falling dollar could make you some money and provide disaster insurance against the unlikely scenario of a dollar crash .
PowerShares DB U.S. Dollar Index Bearish ( symbol UDN ) is a good choice for a simple , low - cost hedge .
The exchange - traded fund is designed to go up when the U.S. Dollar index - which measures the dollar against a basket of six developed - market currencies - goes down .
The fund , which achieves its objectives by selling short currency - index futures , charges annual expenses of 0.50 % .
Advertisement - Article continues below
But there 's something to be said for letting a warm body pick currencies for you .
Axel Merk has an excellent record of doing so in Merk Hard Currency ( MERKX ) .
From the fund 's inception in May 2005 through June 17 , it gained 5.6 % annualized .
During the same period , the inverse of the U.S. Dollar index gained 1.2 % a year .
Merk crafts the fund with the specific aim of hedging the U.S. dollar .
He 'll invest in short - term money - market securities to play currencies he likes .
" We try to avoid interest - rate risk and credit risk , " he says .
Recently , he also had 14 % of the portfolio stashed in gold .
Merk likes the Norwegian krone because of the country 's healthy economy , and he favors the Canadian and Australian dollars as beneficiaries of rising oil prices .
The fund charges 1.30 % in annual expenses .

Advertisement - Article continues below
For a bit more oomph , you could invest in T. Rowe Price International Bond ( RPIBX ) , which buys longer - maturity issues than Merk 's fund does and skips the gold exposure .
Manager Ian Kelson invests predominantly in developed - market government debt ; that results in a high - quality portfolio , with an average credit rating of double - A. Advertisement - Article continues below Like Merk , Kelson is bullish on the Norwegian krone .
He 's cautious on the euro in the short run , but likes it longer term simply because " it 's a realistic alternative to the dollar " for investors and foreign governments looking to diversify their dollar holdings .
He thinks the British pound is attractive for its cheapness relative to other currencies , despite severe economic problems in the U.K .
Over the past ten years through June 17 , the fund gained 5.4 % annualized .
It charges 0.81 % in annual expenses and recently yielded 2.8 % .
Loomis Sayles Global Bond ( LSGLX ) offers the most corporate - bond exposure and the highest yield of the bunch .
Corporates recently accounted for more than half of the fund 's assets , with the rest stashed in debt guaranteed by assorted governments .
However , as a global product , the fund invests about 40 % of its assets in dollar - denominated securities , so it is n't a pure play on a weak buck .
Advertisement - Article continues below Co-manager David Rolley says he and co-managers Kenneth Buntrock and Lynda Schweitzer manage the fund relative to the Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index , which is " designed to show the performance of all investment - grade bonds , all over the world . "
The index provides managers a fallback " neutral " currency allocation they can use if they 're not sure about the direction of a currency , but they 're not wedded to the index when they feel strongly about a position .
Over the past ten years , this approach has returned 6.2 % annualized .
The fund sports a current yield of 5.1 % .
For now , the team is in wait - and - see mode .
Rolley is also bullish on the Norwegian krone and is mildly bullish on the euro .
He thinks that the rally in currencies of countries with big energy holdings , such as the Australian dollar and the Brazilian real , has gotten ahead of itself , so he 's waiting for a pullback before stashing more money in those areas .
Rolley predicts that the dollar 's journey will be bumpy .
After all , he says , at some point the Federal Reserve will have to start raising short - term interest rates - a textbook driver of currency appreciation .
When that happens " investors are going to freak out and say ' Oh my God , why are we short the dollar ? ' "
That should spark short - term rallies along the road of the dollar 's longer - term decline .
The Loomis Sayles fund charges 1.00 % in annual expenses .
A ridiculously easy - to - use PHP script for resizing images the smart way .
One of the challenges that comes with maintaining a graphic - intensive website like Shifting Pixel is finding a way to get high quality images throughout the site with as little effort as possible .
To tackle this , I developed the Smart Image Resizer and have been using it around the site for the past few months .
I could n’t be happier .
The major advantage of this script is that it allows me to resize and crop any image on my website without touching the actual image or writing any code .
I upload each image once at a high enough resolution and can then reuse it at any size I want , anywhere I want .
It does n’t matter if the images are in a post , on a page , or in a template file–it just works .
All of the magic is done through the query string part of the URL in the src attribute of the img tag .
And , if this was n’t a big enough time - saver for me right now , it ’ll be a huge time - saver the next time I decide to redesign my site .
It ’s a relief that I wo n’t have to go through to resize and re-upload a thousand photos to make sure they look right –I ’ll just have to change the links to them and I ’ll be all set .
Features
Resizes JPEG s , GIF s , and PNG s
s , s , and s Intelligently sharpens for crisp photos at any size
Can crop based on width : height ratios
Can color - fill transparent GIFs and PNGs
Built - in caching keeps image variations for optimal performance

CANBERRA ( Reuters ) -
An Australian teenage girl has become the world ’s first known transplant patient to change blood groups and take on the immune system of her organ donor , doctors said on Friday , calling her a “ one - in - six - billion miracle . ”
Demi-Lee Brennan , now 15 , received a donor liver when she was 9 years old and her own liver failed .
“ It ’s like my second chance at life , ” Brennan told local media , recounting how her body achieved what doctors said was the holy grail of transplant surgery .
“ It ’s kind of hard to believe . ”
Brennan ’s body changed blood group from O negative to O positive when she became ill while on drugs to avoid rejection of the organ by her body ’s immune system .
Her new liver ’s blood stem cells then invaded her body ’s bone marrow to take over her entire immune system , meaning the teen no longer needs anti-rejection drugs .

Hospital said they had no explanation for Brennan ’s recovery , detailed in the latest edition of The New England Journal of Medicine .
“ There was no precedent for this having happened at any other time , so we were sort of flying by the seat of our pants , ” Michael Stormon , a pediatric hepatologist , told local radio .

Stuart Dorney , the hospital ’s former transplant unit head , said Brennan ’s treatment could lead to breakthroughs in organ transplant treatment , because normally the immune system of recipients attacked the transplanted tissue .
“ We now need to go back over everything that happened to Demi - Lee and see why , and if it can be replicated , ” said Dorney .
“ We think because we used a young person ’s liver and Demi - Lee had low white blood cells , that could have been a reason , ” he told the Daily Telegraph newspaper .
Rejection is normally treated with a combination of drugs , although chronic rejection is irreversible .
Only seven - in - 10 transplant operations in Australia are successful after a five - year period due to rejection complications .
The vast majority of viruses are aimed at Windows machines
The number of viruses , worms and trojans in circulation has topped the one million mark .
The new high for malicious programs was revealed by security firm Symantec in the latest edition of its bi-annual Internet Security Threat Report .
The vast majority of these programs have been created in the last twelve months , said Symantec .
Cyber criminals pump out malware to fool anti-virus programs which look for characteristics they have already seen .
Money game
The latest edition of the Symantec report covers the second half of 2007 during which time the security firm detected 499,811 new malicious code threats .
This figure was up 136 % on the first six months of 2007 .
Throughout 2007 Symantec detected more than 711,912 novel threats which brings the total number of malicious programs that the security firm 's anti-virus programs detect to 1,122,311 .
The report notes : " almost two thirds of all malicious code threats currently detected were created during 2007 . "
The vast majority of these viruses are aimed at PCs running Microsoft Windows and are variants of already existing malicious programs that have proved useful to hi-tech criminals in the past .
Symantec said part of the rise was down to criminals increasingly using trojans as a " beachhead " to gain access to a PC and then use that route to download and install a variety of other malicious programs .
Popular malicious installations include key loggers that spring to life if particular websites are visited or programs , such as online games , are started up .
The report also put the growth in malicious code down to the increasingly professional digital criminal underground .
Typically , groups engaged in hi-tech crime employ groups of programmers to generate the novel variants .
The fact that these programmers expect to be paid drives the criminals to make as much money as possible out of the information they steal and to be constantly on the look out for new victims .
Said the report : " The combination of these factors results in a high volume of new malicious code samples that threaten users online . "

Choosing a suitable gift can be tricky if you have no idea what the other person may like , and having limited resources can make things even harder .
However , this does n’t have to be the case because regardless of the budget you may have allocated for gifts , you will always find an item to suit .
What is important for you to keep in mind in this instance is that when it comes to gift giving , it ’s not the cost of the gift , but the thought that goes into it that counts .
Therefore , even with a small budget , you can get something that will be appreciated by that valued friend , family or spouse .
Here is what you can do when you are facing the challenge of shopping for Christmas on a tight budget :
1. Make a List In Advance
Christmas is a season of giving , but this does n’t mean that you have to overspend to join in the spirit – there are always so many cheap Christmas gifts you can pick from .
Even so , before you get to the shopping part , you need to make a list of what you would like early enough so that you can look out for offers and bargains and grab them the moment they appear .
This can help you get hold of some nice items at much reduced costs .
Alternatively , you can just go traveling for Christmas and shirk from all this shopping altogether .
2. Stick to a Budget
When you go out shopping , you will obviously spot some beautiful items that you would readily buy if you had the money to spare .
However , if you want to save while shopping for Christmas , you cannot afford to make random purchases .
Once you have made your list of Christmas gift ideas for men , women and kids , and planned on how much cash to put into it , you have to work with that list no matter how enticing other things may look .
Thus you are very likely to beat Christmas financial stress .
3. Go for Home Made Gifts
Even though there are many gift items stocked in different stores , you do not necessarily have to buy something to make it meaningful to the person who receives it .
You can look for ways to create your own gifts , and these can be anything including cookies , cakes , framed poems and gift cards .
Making the gifts by yourself can help you save money and aside from that , it can also be a fun way to spend your free time .
However , if you do n’t have time to make the items but still need to keep your costs low , you can look for something in stores that provide cheap Christmas gifts .
Medellin's case pitted President Bush against his home state
Jose Ernesto Medellin was sentenced to death in 1994 for rape and murder .
In 2004 , an international court said he and 50 other Mexicans should get new hearings as they had had no access to consular officials upon their arrest .
Mr Bush ordered Texas to comply but the Supreme Court justices decided 6 - 3 that he had overstepped his authority .
Tuesday 's ruling comes in a case that had set Mr Bush against his home state .
Although the Bush administration objected to the ruling by the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) , the president wrote a memorandum ordering the state courts to comply .
He said the ICJ 's decision must be carried out because the US had agreed to abide by the court 's rulings in such cases .
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts , writing for the majority , said the ICJ 's decision could not be forced upon the states .
The president may not " establish binding rules of decision that pre-empt contrary state law " , Mr Roberts wrote .
Consular assistance
Medellin was arrested in June 1993 , a few days after the killings of Jennifer Ertman , 14 , and Elizabeth Pena , 16 .
He later made a written confession .
At the time of his arrest , police did not tell him that he could request assistance from the Mexican consulate - in violation of the 1963 Vienna Convention .
In 2003 , Mexico filed a lawsuit at the ICJ against the US , on behalf of Medellin and 50 other Mexican nationals on death row in the US who had also not received consular support .
The court ruled in Mexico 's favour , and ordered that their cases be reviewed .
It said Texas must hold a hearing to determine whether Medellin had had a fair trial .
Texas acknowledged that Medellin was not told he could ask for help from Mexican diplomats , but argued that he forfeited the right because he never raised the issue at trial or sentencing .
The state also argued that it would not have made any difference to the outcome of the case .
' Heinous murder '
Roe Wilson , an assistant district attorney in Harris County , Texas , welcomed the Supreme Court 's decision .
" This case has been in the court system a long time based on various issues , " she told the Associated Press .
" It was a heinous murder of two young girls ...
It 's certainly time the case be resolved and the sentence be carried out . "
Ms Wilson told AP her office would be seeking an execution date once the Supreme Court has resolved a separate case challenging lethal injections .
The US has since withdrawn from the part of the Vienna Convention that gives the ICJ the final say if foreign citizens say they were illegally denied access to diplomatic representation when arrested abroad .
Moustache and Beard Quarterly
From the dawn of humanity men and a few special women have been fascinated with their ability to grow facial hair .
This quarterly blog is dedicated to the endless variety of forms that those facial follicles can take .
Getting your fingerprint scanned is a familiar experience for many international travelers arriving in the US , like this passenger at JFK airport in New York .
Now travelers in Sweden can check in with just a fingerprint .

The World from Berlin ' The IOC Cannot Act Surprised by Beijing 's Aggression '
China has reacted with fury to any criticism of its human rights policies in the lead - up to the Beijing Olympics .
The attempt by IOC boss Jacques Rogge to address the issue on Thursday was met with a sharp rebuff .
One major German daily says he should step down .
The airliner leaving Caracas for Mexico City carried a seemingly conspicuous cargo : one ton of Colombian cocaine stuffed into 25 bulky , nearly identical suitcases .
But the smugglers ’ baggage went untouched by the Venezuelan National Guard and airport police that day in early February .
And it may not have been an oversight .
Drug traffickers routinely pay a “ tax ” of nearly $ 1,400 a pound to security forces to move cocaine through the terminals at the busy Maiquetia airport and on to global markets , foreign and Venezuelan investigators and experts say .
“ Maiquetia is to narcos what Memphis is for Federal Express : the hub , ” one foreign counter - narcotics official said .
Thanks to a tip from U.S. agents , Mexican customs officials seized the load when it arrived that night aboard Mexicana Flight 374 .
Officials found bricks of cocaine beneath false bottoms of suitcases weighing more than 100 pounds each , in one of the biggest busts at Mexico City ’s Benito Juarez International Airport .

U.S. and Latin American investigators allege that Venezuela has become a sieve through which a soaring amount of Colombian cocaine moves annually by air and sea .
They cite widespread corruption and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ’s decision to sever anti-drug ties with Washington .
In the State Department ’s annual report on global drug trafficking , Venezuela was singled out as a growing threat .
“ Venezuela ’s permissive and corrupt environment led to more trafficking , fewer seizures and an increase in suspected drug flights over the past 12 months , ” Anne W. Patterson , assistant secretary of State for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs , said in a briefing after the report ’s release this month .
“ There is systematic corruption .
Maiquetia is wide open , ” said one foreign counter - narcotics official .
Close behind are smaller airports and airstrips in Venezuela ’s Apure , Portuguesa and Sucre states , and sea ports such as La Guaira and Puerto Cabello , where tons of cocaine leave in containers or amid bulk cargo .
The U.S. Embassy in Caracas estimates that the amount of Colombian cocaine passing through Venezuela en route to the United States , Europe and elsewhere has quintupled to 250 tons a year since 2001 .
Depending on whose total cocaine production figures one accepts , a quarter to half of all Colombian drug exports use this country as a “ trampoline . ”

Venezuela has always been a conduit for Colombian drugs because it shares a porous 1,300 - mile border with the country where most of the world ’s cocaine is manufactured .
But a U.S. - funded crackdown in Colombia has forced traffickers to seek new routes and international alliances .
U.S. and Colombian officials also cite escalating corruption in the Venezuelan security forces and Washington ’s deteriorating relations with Chavez , a vocal foe of the United States .
In August 2005 , Chavez announced an end to a 17 - year anti-drug agreement with the United States .
He forbade Venezuelan officials from sharing any information or mounting joint operations with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , whose agents he describes as spies .
In 2006 , the amount of cocaine seized in Venezuela dropped by about 40 % after having increased every year since 1999 , according to the State Department .
Critics stop short of implicating the leftist leader directly in the emergence of the Latin nation as a corrupt haven for smugglers , and the Venezuelan president has described corruption as a “ thousand - headed monster . ”

At a Caribbean drug summit Friday in the Dominican Republic , Venezuelan officials acknowledged the drug problem and said they would use Chinese satellite technology and newly purchased Russian aircraft to combat traffickers .
“ The increased flight traffic does not have Hugo Chavez ’s signature on it .
It ’s not about him , ” said Joseph Ruddy , a U.S. attorney in Tampa , Fla. , who heads an investigative task force that has prosecuted dozens of drug traffickers in recent years .
“ It ’s about changing traffic patterns ....
Narcos go where we are n’t . ”
The most painful result of Chavez ’s decree , U.S. officials say , was the cutoff of relations with a trusted corps of 40 “ vetted ” Venezuelan counter - narcotics agents who had been trained in Quantico , Va .
The agents , who had worked in the Venezuelan National Guard and the intelligence police as liaisons to U.S. officials in the drug fight , have been transferred to other units .

Today , bribes are openly paid to police and armed forces , U.S. and Colombian officials say .
A high - level Colombian official told The Times that the Venezuelan National Guard protects one of his country ’s most powerful cartels , the Norte del Valle gang based in Cali , and one of its reputed top leaders , Wilmer Varela .
“ Venezuela has become a sanctuary for Colombian traffickers , and the National Guard facilitates it all , ” said the official , who asked not to be named because of political sensitivities .
Last month , Chavez removed Luis Correa as head of the National Anti-Narcotics Office , replacing him with a trusted military aide , Luis Reverol Torres .
In July , National Guard Brig .
Gen. Frank Morgado was sentenced to prison by a military tribunal for links to drug traffickers .
Advertisement
Morgado and Correa came under criticism in April after a DC - 7 airliner that had left Maiquetia landed in Ciudad del Carmen , Mexico , with mechanical problems .
Police found 5 1/2 tons of cocaine aboard .
Cocaine seizures by Venezuelan authorities in the last two months totaled 4.8 tons , about what was seized in the Ciudad del Carmen raid .
Critics find that number suspiciously low , given the size of single shipments seized elsewhere .
“ Twenty - two percent of announced cocaine seizures last year , which totaled 55 tons , came as a result of luck -- drugs discovered at the border or checkpoints , ” said one former high - level Venezuelan counter - narcotics official who asked not to be named .
“ As much movement as there is , the percentage should be much smaller .
It shows the lack of investigation . ”
There has been no lack of investigation or results in neighboring Colombia , where authorities have gone after the leftist guerrillas and right - wing paramilitary groups involved in the drug trade .
Advertisement
Plan Colombia , on which the U.S. has spent $ 4 billion fighting drug trafficking since its launch in 2000 , has denied traffickers the “ air bridge ” facilitating the direct flow of drugs from Colombia to Central America and Mexico that they once enjoyed .
The new air bridge appears to link airports and strips in Venezuela and neighboring Suriname and Guyana to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola , comprising the Dominican Republic and Haiti .
The aircraft of choice seem to be twin - engine Beechcraft King Air business planes .
With the passenger seats removed , the planes can ferry three - quarters of a ton of cocaine per flight .
Haitian and Dominican leaders have issued pleas for help in recent months to stem the flow of drugs from Venezuela , to little avail .
The State Department , meanwhile , worries its successes in Colombia are coming undone .
Advertisement
“ We want to work with the Venezuelans , ” said Patterson , the assistant secretary of State .
“ But we have n’t gotten very far in recent years , and their problem is increasing .
That ’s the worrisome thing about this .
Success in Colombia has basically led to a migration of some of this into Venezuela . ”

Saudi blogger posts video on violent Christian extremism
A Saudi blogger has made a short video featuring alleged Christian extremists preaching violence and a Bible passage calling for war , in response to an anti-Quran film that sparked protests across the Muslim world .
Raed al - Saeed told The Associated Press on Thursday that the purpose of his six - minute video is to show Islam should not be judged by watching Dutch filmmaker Geert Wilders ' movie " Fitna , " which links terror attacks by Muslim extremists with texts from the Quran .
" It is easy to take parts of any holy book that are out of ( context ) and make it sound like the most inhumane book ever written , " al - Saeed said in a statement posted at the end of his video .
" This is what Geert Wilders did to gather more supporters to his hateful ideology .
To create schism . "
Al - Saeed , 33 , said he lifted footage showing alleged Christian extremists and British soldiers beating up Iraqis from YouTube and used the same methods Wilders did .
The video appeared to include footage from " Jesus Camp , " an American documentary about a summer camp for evangelical Christians that was nominated for a 2007 Academy Award .
However , al - Saeed said his movie , entitled " Schism , " was not directed against Christians .
Wilders ' film has angered Muslims around the world , sparking angry street protests in several countries and triggering calls for a boycott of Dutch goods .
Within 12 hours of posting , al - Saeed said his video was removed from YouTube in Saudi Arabia with a message from the site saying the content was inappropriate .
" I sent it again with a message saying , ' Before you delete Schism , look at Fitna .
Delete both if you deem them inappropriate , ' " he said .
Late Thursday , al - Saeed 's video still could be accessed on YouTube and other Web sites , he said , adding that it had been viewed by more than 5,000 users .
Raed 's blog ( in Arabic ) is here .
The YouTube video can currently be watched here .
RAW STORY has also saved a copy ( below ) in case YouTube deletes it again .

This video is from YouTube , broadcast April 10 , 2008 .
Have you ever wondered why there are also attributes in XML and not just elements , causing many never - ending " element vs attribute " discussions ?
And why is XML so redundant - repeating the tag name in the ending tag , thus making the document much larger ?
I asked Charles Goldfarb , the author of SGML - the original format from the 1960s ( already had < tags > and attributes ) from which XML and HTML were derived .
He was very kind to reply to me .
Enjoy :
- In < elem > text < /elem > , why repeat " elem " for the second time ?
In fact , there is an option in SGML that allows you to omit the element - type name from an end - tag , but it is rarely supported .
( In XML the option does not exist at all . )
The name is there primarily for the convenience of humans debugging the markup , as there are large document types , such as aircraft maintenance manuals , where elements can nest very deeply .
Portuguese telecoms engineer Tarun Pinto was in Haiti's capital , Port - au - Prince , when protests by hungry crowds about rising food prices turned violent .
Tarun Pinto took this photograph of protesters in Haiti The protests actually started on Monday .
But Tuesday was when the protests really escalated .
I noticed no activity on the streets .
There is normally a little market , cars - there was nothing , just the occasional motorcycle .
People were protesting about massive hikes in the price of food .
There was a general atmosphere of disorganisation , I saw people running in panic all over the place .
They seemed to be running away from the main crowd .
We did n't really know what was going on .
It was only later in the day that we were told by our security people that we had to leave everything because the main protest was going to pass us .
They were coming up our street of our office building and might have guns .
' Set ablaze '
We went to the bottom floor to a windowless room and I realised that the crowd was throwing stones and bottles at our building .
They were banging on the gates and I could see that our security guards were running about everywhere .
I managed to sneak out and I saw the protesters straggling at the end of the crowds .
They started throwing projectiles at us .
I had the feeling they were throwing things at any building that represented commercialisation as opposed to just targeting foreigners .
Our security guys told us that all the cars that were parked on the streets surrounding the building were totally destroyed or set ablaze or both .
They also told us that a couple of guys had been bashed in by rocks .
I was not able to verify any of this , except for a couple of wrecked cars that we saw on the way back to the apartment .
One does see wrecked cars in Haiti so I could n't be sure .
You can see the poverty in Haiti .
It 's really obvious .
When I first arrived in Haiti during the elections of 2007 , I noticed the lack of trees here .
Every hill seems to have been stripped bare down to its surface and trees seem to have been replaced by shanty towns .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
An experimental drug helped protect mice and monkeys from the damaging effects of radiation , researchers said on Thursday , in a finding that may lead to less toxic cancer treatments or an emergency treatment for radiation exposure .

They said the drug protected animals ’ bone marrow and cells in the gut from being destroyed by radiation without interfering with radiation therapy ’s ability to fight cancer .
“ These tissues fail because these cells choose to commit suicide .
Our idea was to block these suicidal intentions , ” said Andrei Gudkov of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo , New York , whose study was published in the journal Science .
Gudkov , who also is chief scientific officer at Cleveland BioLabs
Inc which is developing the drug , said radiation triggers cells to undergo a type of programmed cell death know as apoptosis , which helps rid the body of defective cells .
Tumors have figured out how to block this suicide mode .
“ Tumors simply throw it out by causing mutations , ” Gudkov said in a telephone interview .
He and colleagues decided to study this mechanism to find a way to protect cells from radiation damage .
They developed a compound known as CBLB502 made from a salmonella protein that naturally makes cells resistant to cell suicide .
A single dose of the drug given to the animals shortly before receiving radiation therapy significantly reduced damage to sensitive bone marrow and gastrointestinal cells and prolonged their survival .
The drug also improved survival of mice when given an hour after the animals got a dose of radiation .
“ We can temporarily and reversibly convert normal cells into something which is resistant to radiation -- but only for a couple of hours , ” Gudkov said .
That is key , he said , because otherwise the cells would develop into tumors .
So far , Gudkov said the drug has proven to have few toxic side effects .
“ We are basically developing this thing for two applications .
One is for general protection from emergency situations -- dirty bombs or Chernobyl - type disasters , ” he said .
“ For that we would want people to have a loaded syringe with this compound for intramuscular injection , ” he said .
The other is for use with radiation therapy in cancer patients to make the treatments more effective with fewer side effects .
Gudkov said the company is seeking U.S. regulatory approval to start testing the drug in healthy adults , which could begin as early as this summer .
Last week , the company won a $ 9 million contract from the U.S. Department of Defense to develop the treatment for radiation exposure .
WASHINGTON 
More than three in four Americans think the country is in a recession , a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll over the weekend shows , reflecting a crisis of confidence that economists say could make the economy worse .
As the Federal Reserve expanded credit to securities dealers and President Bush said his administration had taken " strong and decisive action , " the poll revealed pessimism about the economy 's direction .
Seventy - six percent of those polled said the economy is in recession , compared to 22 % who said it 's not .
Not since September 1992 , two months before President George H.W. Bush lost re-election , have so many Americans said the economy was in such bad shape .
USA TODAY / GALLUP POLL : Americans ' thoughts on the economy MORE RATE MOVES : In Fed we trust , but can it get us out of this mess ?
" Recessions are almost always crises of confidence , and that 's what we 're having right now , " said David Wyss , chief economist at Standard & Poor's .
Asked if the nation could slip into a depression lasting several years , 59 % said it was likely , and 79 % said they were worried about it .
A recession is an economic downturn that usually lasts at least six months ; a depression is longer , deeper and more broadly dispersed .
The poll of 1,025 adults was completed Sunday , the day the Federal Reserve financially backed JPMorgan Chase 's buyout of venerable investment bank Bear Stearns .
It was one in a series of actions meant to stabilize world financial markets and give investors renewed confidence , including a cut in the interest rate on direct loans to banks and a new line of credit for securities dealers .
" When people experience higher gasoline prices , higher heating costs , fewer employment opportunities , housing prices going down … then the common sense conclusion is things are n't very good , " said Brian Bethune of economic forecaster Global Insight .
Their pessimism " creates more problems , " he said .
Jared Bernstein , senior economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute , said a recession can become a self - fulfilling prophesy : " If folks do n't feel confident enough to make that purchase , to take the vacation , even to go out to eat , that obviously reverberates negatively throughout the economy . "
To counter that cycle , President Bush briefly invited reporters into his normally private policy meeting with economic advisers Monday .
" One thing is for certain , we 're in challenging times , " Bush said .
But he said that the government " is on top of the situation , " adding , " in the long run , our economy is going to be fine . "
After meeting a second time with Bush on Monday , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told reporters that the administration is seeking to take actions " that are going to increase confidence in our economy . "
Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan sounded more downbeat .
Today 's financial problems could likely be seen as " the most wrenching since the end of the second world war , " Greenspan wrote in the Financial Times on Monday .
Democratic presidential candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton urged greater action .
Obama , campaigning in Pennsylvania , said the economy " is heading toward recession .
We probably already are in one . "
He said " we must focus on what we can do to restore the public 's confidence in the market . "
Clinton was more cautious .
Calling it a time of " stress and uncertainty , " she said there was " urgency " to continue monetary policies like those taken Sunday .
" We are in the soup , and we better get ourselves out of it before the consequences get drastic , " Clinton said in Washington .
Presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain was in Iraq Monday .
His top economic adviser , Douglas Holtz - Eakin , said McCain has confidence in the Federal Reserve 's action to shore up the nation 's financial system .
But while that action may have been necessary , he said , it 's imperative to " ensure that Main Street America does not bail out financial speculators . "

GOP hopefuls want Bush Jews Ron Kampeas Published : 10/15/2007 WASHINGTON
( JTA ) --
Each of the leading GOP presidential candidates to some degree has run away from the Bush legacy .
But this week they will be making their case before one of the president 's most loyal constituencies : Republican Jews .
The Republican Jewish Coalition on Tuesday is hosting a forum in Washington for presidential hopefuls .
Six of the party 's nine candidates were invited , and five will attend : former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani , former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , former U.S. Sen .
Fred Thompson , and current U.S. Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Sam Brownback of Kansas .
Matt Brooks , the RJC 's executive director , said he expects " defining " speeches in terms of foreign policy .
" The emphasis clearly is going to be on foreign policy , " Brooks said .
" And a number of them are planning to make their more defining foreign policy speeches .
They 'll be putting together snippets theyve said before but tying it up to one foreign policy . "
Brooks says the candidates are conscious that more than the RJC members in the room will be watching .
" They 'll be watched nationally by primary voters , and internationally leaders will be watching , considering some of the challenges that will face the next president , " he said .
" They look at these things and parse very closely the words the candidates say . "
The RJC event comes at a time when the president 's approval ratings are perpetually hovering around 30 percent and many Republican constituencies , lawmakers and candidates are walking away from the Bush White House .
Many leading Republican Jews , meanwhile , remain fiercely loyal to the president and to the most hawkish elements of his foreign policy agenda .
Brooks himself this summer joined two other RJC board members -- Ari Fleischer , Bush 's former White House spokesman , and Sheldon Adelson , a casino mogul -- in establishing FreedomsWatch , a group dedicated to preserving what likely has become the president 's most unpopular legacy , the Iraq occupation .
Most of the new group 's funders are well known as the RJC 's principal backers , including Mel Sembler , a former ambassador to Rome , and Richard Fox , an RJC founder .
On several fronts the RJC continues to stake out right - of - center positions , even as Bush and the GOP candidates have moderated their stands .
For example , in recent months the Bush administration has raised its voice on the need to deal with global warming , yet in its September - October bulletin , the Republican Jewish organization mocks Democrats who focus on the issue .
The Democratic front - runner , U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) , is criticized for asserting that " we should not hesitate to engage in the world 's most difficult conflicts on a diplomatic front , " though Giuliani has essentially made the same argument .
Republican Jews also have emerged as one of the few constituencies willing to touch what has become a third rail in congressional politics :
Bush 's determination to roll back parts of the popular State Children 's Health Insurance Program , a program that reaches children from families that earn above the Medicaid threshold but still cannot afford insurance .
SCHIP has wall - to - wall Jewish community backing , but in recent weeks Noam Neusner , Bush 's former Jewish liaison , defended the president 's position in the Forward and Michael David Epstein , a senior RJC activist , did the same on JTA .
Brooks said such loyalty is natural for a president that has proven second to none in his backing for Israel .
" Bush has earned it , " he said .
" Here 's a president who in very difficult and challenging times , especially on core issues like Israel , was there for us and was one of the only world leaders standing shoulder to shoulder with Israel . "
Among other instances , Bush gave Israel slack in putting down a flare - up in the Palestinian intifada in the spring of 2002 and in striking back against Hezbollah in Lebanon in the summer of 2006 .
Also in April 2004 for recognizing some Israeli settlements as a reality on the ground and repudiating a right of Palestinian refugees to return to Israel .
That might translate into tough questions for some of the candidates .
The major GOP hopefuls back the president 's tough approach to forcing Iran to suspend its suspected nuclear weapons program , but Giuliani argued recently that diplomacy has been neglected as an option .
McCain and Romney have backed the engagement in Iraq but been sharply critical of how it has been carried out .
Brownback last week backed a pro-settler initiative to extend Israeli sovereignty to the West Bank , directly undercutting Bush 's attempt to leave a two - state solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict as one of his legacies .
The Bush administration is convening a peace conference to that end that will take place next month in Annapolis , Md. Such transitions are natural , Brooks suggested , adding that he expected most of the candidates will emphasize differences with the Democratic front - runners , Clinton and Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) , who have emphasized diplomacy in dealing with Iran .
The RJC forum , Brooks said , is aimed at reminding " the Jewish community that it will have some important choices to make as we start to address a post - Bush environment . "
Mike Huckabee , the former Arkansas governor , was invited but could not attend .
Not invited were long - shots U.S. Reps .
Duncan Hunter of California , Tom Tancredo of Colorado and Ron Paul of Texas .
Paul was rejected because of his consistent voting record against U.S. assistance to Israel and his criticism of the pro-Israel lobby .

It gives a whole new meaning to the phrase power walking .
A gadget that converts the movement of the knees while walking into electricity has been unveiled .
On a gentle stroll , the knee - brace generates enough electricity to run a mobile phone .
Scroll down for more ...
Although the prototype is bulky - like something Robocop might have attached to his leg - smaller versions could one day be incorporated into clothing .
It could allow joggers to power up their iPods while running or commuters to charge their mobile phones while dashing for a train .
The inventors even believe it will help soldiers cut down on the number of batteries they need to carry into battle .
Inventor Dr Arthur Kuo , of the University of Michigan , said the device - called a " biomechanical energy harvester " - worked in the same way as the power - generating brakes found in hybrid cars .
These collect energy that would otherwise be lost as heat when a car slows down .
The knee brace harvests energy lost when someone bends their knee after swinging the leg forward to take a step .
Dr Kuo said knee joints were ideally suited for generating electricity .
" There is power to be harvested from various places in the body , and you can use that to generate electricity .
The knee is probably the best place , " he said .
" We believe that when you 're slowing down the knee at the end of swinging the leg , most of that energy is just wasted . "
Dr Kuo and colleagues from the Simon Fraser University in Vancouver and University of Pittsburgh tested their invention on six men walking on a treadmill at a leisurely two miles an hour .
With a device on each leg , the volunteers generated around five watts of electricity while using very little extra energy to walk .
That would be enough power to run ten mobile phones at the same time .
By running , one volunteer was able to generate 54 watts of power - enough for a conventional light bulb .
Dr Kuo , who published his test results in the journal Science , said his device needed refining .
" The prototype is bulky but the energy generation part itself has very little effect on the wearer , " he said .
" We hope to improve the device so it is easier to carry . "
Jamie Rubin , a former assistant to President Bill Clinton , and now a member of Hillary Clinton 's campaign team , has dismissed David Trimble as a " crankpot " .
Mr Rubin was responding to Trimble 's comments about Hillary Clinton 's claim that she was " instrumental " in the bringing about peace in Northern Ireland .
Lord Trimble had previously suggested that Senator Clinton 's claim was " a wee bit silly " .
Rubin , a former spokesman for the US State Department , slurs David Trimble in an interview with MSNBC ( watch here ) .
Samantha Power , one of Barack Obama 's foreign policy advisers , was forced to resign from his campaign a few weeks ago after describing Mrs Clinton as a " monster " ( in what she hoped would be an off - the - record comment ) .
The Clinton campaign may be under some pressure to distance itself from Rubin 's attack on a Nobel Peace Prize - winning politician who served for four years as Northern Ireland 's First Minister .
Following up on my previous article about why the MLS will be successful in the future , I have realized that not many people know just how the MLS works today .
Sure there are two tables , a playoff system , and some weird rules about players and salaries , but who knows exactly what goes on in this league ?
Fortunately for readers , I do , and for what I do n’t know , the MLS website definitely does .
League Structure
As mentioned before , the league is split up into two tables : Eastern Conference and Western Conference .
The structure is based on the geographical distribution of clubs .
Have a look at the image :
Teams in the East are : Chicago Fire , Columbus Crew , DC United , Kansas City Wizards , New York Red Bulls , New England Revolution , and Toronto FC .
The Western teams are : Chivas USA , Colorado Rapids , FC Dallas , Houston Dynamo , Los Angeles Galaxy , Real Salt Lake , and San Jose Earthquakes .
When Seattle enters the league next year , it will be in the Western Conference , and when Philadelphia enters the league in 2010 , it will join the East .
The MLS lumps all teams together into one table to decide on a couple of awards :
The first place team overall wins the MLS Supporters Shield and qualifies for the CONCACAF Champions League
The first through fourth place teams overall qualify for the SuperLiga
In the regular season , all teams play thirty matches .
They play everybody home and away ( that ’s 26 ) and then play against a four teams from their own conference again .
I ’m not sure , but I think the four teams that each team play is assigned at random .
Squads ( or Rosters )
Major League Soccer , following in the footsteps of American leagues such as the NBA and NFL , have a salary cap .
What this means is that each club can only pay their players a certain amount of combined money .
For example , if the salary cap was set at $ 3 million , I could pay three players $ 1 million , or I could pay one player $ 2 million and the other two half a million .
The new Designated Player Rule ( known affectionately as the Beckham rule ) allows each MLS club to pay two players as much as they want .
Obviously , this is named after David Beckham because of his gigantic deal with the Los Angeles Galaxy that pays him between 4 and 5 million dollars a year until 2011 .
There are many small rules about team rosters that are not worth going into because they never affect the game being played .
However , one more rule to take note of is this : each team is allowed eight international players ( or non -US citizens ) .
Toronto FC , because of their Canadian location , have been given two extra international roster spots that may only be used on US nationals .
The SuperDraft and Supplemental Draft are also carried over from other domestic sports leagues , where clubs can acquire former college players and young players that are members of Generation adidas — a special program for gifted younger players .
Recap of this year ’s MLS SuperDraft .
PlayOffs
The MLS playoffs , known as the MLS Cup , are one of the hot debatable topics in American soccer .
However , I am here to inform about the playoffs , not give opinions , so here it is .
Qualifiers for the playoffs are :
The top three teams from each conference
The next two best MLS teams , regardless of conference
There are three rounds of playoff matches .
There are Conference Semi Finals , Conference Finals , and the MLS Cup Final .
The Conference Semi Finals are played over two legs , with the lower placing team hosting the first match .
The Conference Championship is one - off , hosted by the higher placing advancing team .
The MLS Cup Championship is hosted at a neutral site ( in 2008 it will be the Home Depot Center , the home of the LA Galaxy ) .
Continental Competitions
Of course , knowing how good a team is against clubs from its own country is a worthless endeavor if they are n’t going to be matched up against other clubs from across the continent ( or the world ) .
There are two continental competitions that MLS teams are eligible for : the SuperLiga and the new CONCACAF Champions League , which fans have needed for a long time .
The SuperLiga is played between the top four MLS clubs and four clubs from the Mexican Premera División .
The exact details of the competition have not been announced .
The CONCACAF Champions League will be played among 24 teams , four of which will come from the MLS .
The top two MLS clubs will not enter until the group stage , but the other two will have to participate in a two - leg preliminary round .
There will be four groups of four in the group stage , with teams playing all other teams in their group twice .
The knockout round , all the way through to the Final in late April 2009 , will be played over two legs .
The winner of the competition will advance to the FIFA Club World Cup .
In the Future …
There are several things that will probably change .
A few of these concepts ( including the David Beckham rule and the allocation of extra international players ) are up for review in 2009 .
Since the league is planning on having only eighteen teams by 2012 , the single table and uneven scheduling will probably remain for a while .
For now , fans will have to enjoy what the MLS has to offer until they make reforms to the format .
Even when the reforms start , it is bound to be slow , just like the league ’s expansion .
So the key for MLS fans , as ever , is to be patient .

For personal reasons , I do not browse the web from my computer .
( I also have not net connection much of the time . )
To look at page I send mail to a demon which runs wget and mails the page back to me .
It is very efficient use of my time , but it is slow in real time .
( A disclaimer that advances this notion of incestuousness : I have been a guest on “ Hardball ” on occasion , but probably not more than a half - dozen times over the years .
The New York Times also has a partnership with NBC in which the news organizations coordinate some aspects of their political coverage , posting politics - related stories and videos on each other ’s Web sites .
And Matthews and I have the same book agent , for what that ’s worth . )
“ People are a little impressed with themselves , ” Griffin went on to say , continuing his commentary about the scene .
“ It ’s a bit of an echo chamber . ”
Matthews is central to that echo chamber  at the Ritz , as in the 2008 presidential campaign .
He is , in a sense , the carnival barker at the center of it , spewing tiny pellets of chewed nuts across the table while comparing Obama to Mozart and Clinton to Salieri .
At one point , Matthews suddenly became hypnotized by a TV over the bar set to a rebroadcast of “ Hardball . ”
“ Hey , there I am  it ’s me , ” he said , staring at himself on the screen .
“ It ’s me . ”
There is a level of ubiquity about Chris Matthews today that can be exhausting , occasionally edifying and , for better or worse , central to what has become a very loud national conversation about politics .
His soothing - like - a- blender voice feels unnervingly constant in a presidential campaign that has drawn big interest , ratings and voter turnout .
He gets in trouble sometimes and has to apologize  as he did after suggesting that Hillary Clinton owed her election to the Senate to the fact that her husband “ messed around . ”
He is also something of a YouTube sensation : see Chris getting challenged to a duel by the former Georgia governor , Zell Miller ; describing the “ thrill going up my leg ” after an Obama speech ; dancing with ( and accidentally groping ) Ellen DeGeneres on her show ; shouting down the conservative commentator Michelle Malkin ; ogling CNBC ’s Erin Burnett .
And he has provided a running bounty of material for Media Matters for America , a liberal media watchdog , which has devoted an entire section of its Web site ( “ The Matthews Monitor ” ) to cataloging Matthews ’s alleged offenses , especially against Hillary Clinton and women generally .
Image Credit ... Olaf Blecker for The New York Times
In addition to doing “ Hardball , ” Matthews is the host of a Sunday morning show on NBC , “ The Chris Matthews Show , ” has been a staple of the network ’s coverage of presidential debates and has helped moderate two of them .
He is also a frequent guest on NBC and MSNBC news shows and an ongoing spoof target on “ Saturday Night Live . ”
It can be difficult not to hear Darrell Hammond ’s long - running impression of Matthews when Matthews himself is speaking .
Matthews , for his part , says he loves the Hammond impression and sometimes catches himself “ doing Hammond doing Matthews . ”
If parody is an emblem of pop-culture status  signifying a measure of permanence 
Matthews belongs on any Mount Rushmore of political screaming heads .
Matthews is as pure a political being as there is on TV .
He is the whip - tongued , name - dropping , self - promoting wise guy you often find in campaigns , and in the bigger offices on Capitol Hill or K Street .
( “ Rain Man , ” NBC ’s Brian Williams jokingly called Matthews , referring to his breadth of political knowledge . )
He wrote speeches for Jimmy Carter , worked as a top advisor to Tip O’Neill , ran unsuccessfully for Congress himself in his native Philadelphia at 28 .
In an age of cynicism about politics , Matthews can be romantic about the craft , defensive about its practitioners and personally affronted when someone derides Washington or “ the game . ”
He can also be unsparing in his criticism of those who run afoul of his “ take . ”
“ I am not a cheerleader for politics per se , ” Matthews says .
“ I am a cheerleader for the possibilities of politics . ”
This election season , MSNBC has placed great emphasis on politics , devoting 28 percent of its airtime to the subject last year ( compared with 15 percent for Fox News and 12 percent for CNN , according to the Project for Excellence in Journalism ) .
The thrilling 2008 presidential campaign has been a boon , and in the first quarter MSNBC ’s prime - time audience rose 63 percent over the previous year ( compared with 12 percent for the Fox News Channel and 70 percent for CNN , though MSNBC still draws many fewer viewers overall ) .
As Matthews is clearly a signature figure on the network , and one of the most recognizable political personalities on the air , this has been something of a heyday for him .
DJ Andy Greener broadcast for an hour unaware he was not live A radio DJ spent an hour talking on his breakfast show without realising that listeners could not hear him .
Andy Greener , a volunteer DJ at Radio Teesdale , forgot to press a crucial button to make his show live .
Instead of his show , listeners heard 60 minutes of music and jingles as an automated back - up system kicked in to prevent radio silence .
He was alerted to his mistake when his station manager , listening at home , tried to call in .
Peter Dixon repeatedly tried to alert his DJ to his mistake .
But the former police officer , known to listeners as Mr Andy , was too busy presenting his show to answer the phone .
Eventually , Mr Dixon got through and Greener began broadcasting again .
Media attention " I 've been involved with community radio for about four years and I 've been doing this three days a week for 10 months and have never done it before , " Greener told the BBC News website .
After this I do n't think I 'll be forgetting again !
DJ Andy Greener
He said he felt " a bit uncomfortable " with the media attention his mistake had attracted but that any publicity for the station was " absolutely brilliant " .
" I 'm starting to get to the stage of being a bit sick of it all , but I look forward to getting back on the air on Monday , " he said .
" After this , I do n't think I 'll be forgetting again , " he added .

McCain least popular of presidential candidates in Gallup poll Eric Mayes
Published : Thursday April 3 , 2008
|
Print This Email This McCain has soft support among business donors , too Obama rakes in donations from real estate , financial services industries Afraid that Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) too closely resembles President George Bush , voters named him the most unpopular of the three presidential candidates , according to Gallup 's latest poll released Thursday .
The finding was bolstered by campaign finance reports that showed McCain raking in far less than his Democratic counterparts .
Clinton was the runner - up in the Gallup poll -- foes worrying that electing her would just put her husband back in the Oval Office .
Obama ended up being the candidate with the fewest critics , perhaps because he 's seen less of the political limelight .
Those who did pan him cited his lack of experience .
Potential voters were n't the only ones turning away from McCain .
According to the Wall Street Journal , business donors have ignored him , instead pouring their funds into the coffers of the Democrats .
The Republican nominee raised $ 13.1 million through February , while Clinton raised $ 27.1 million and Obama collected $ 22.5 million .
" The Republican standard - bearer 's attempt to claw back financial support from the GOP 's business base could be a pivotal factor in determining the outcome of the presidential race , " the Journal 's Brody Mullins wrote .
Financial - services , insurance and real - estate companies so far have donated to Obama over McCain by almost 2:1 -- and favored Clinton by even more .
Health - care and pharmaceutical firms have given three times as much to each of the two Democrats as to McCain .
Defense firms put McCain ahead of Obama , but behind Clinton .
Energy , construction and agribusiness firms have given more to both Democrats .
Only the transportation industry gave more to McCain than the Democrats .
Campaign donations were similar to Gallup 's findings .
Respondents who took part in Gallup 's poll choose McCain as the least desirable candidate for three reasons .
They listed his associations with the Iraq war , President George W. Bush and the Republican Party .
Clinton foes said they found her untrustworthy and Obama critics cited his lack of experience .
McCain led in the overall tally with 40 percent of those polled saying he was their least favorable candidate .
Clinton garnered a 36 percent unfavorable rating .
Obama trailed with just 20 percent of voters saying he was their least favorite candidate .
Among Democrats , 76 percent named McCain as their least favorite candidate .
Clinton followed with 16 percent and Obama had 9 percent .
Republicans divided their answers among the two Democrats but Clinton outstriped Obama by a 60 to 34 percent margin .
Only 3 percent of Republicans said they found McCain the least desirable candidate .
A look at individual results showed four out of 10 of those polled who disliked Obama said his lack of experience concerned them .
Another 8 percent said it they disliked his " religious affiliation . "
The poll did not clarify whether that meant his long relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. or that fact that he has family members who are Islamic .
The majority of Clinton critics said she was untrustworthy .
Nearly one quarter of her foes said she could not be trusted .
Another 18 percent said they did n't want Bill Clinton back in the White House .
McCain came out last because of his connections to the war in Iraq combined with what voters perceive as a similarity to Bush and simply the fact that he is a Republican .
Twenty - seven percent named the war , 25 percent his similarities to Bush and 23 percent his party .
Mondale issues blistering attack on Cheney
MinnPost.com | March 25 , 2008
Former Vice President Walter Mondale today accused the current vice president , Dick Cheney , of a wholesale assault on the Constitution , the balance of powers , and the system that evolved since World War II to coordinate intelligence and defense policy .
“ They wrecked that system , ” Mondale said this morning at a University of Minnesota scholarly conference on the vice presidency .
This is n’t some academic difference of opinion over the proper balance between branches of the federal government , Mondale said , during a question and answer session .
In the case that led to the conviction of Cheney ’s top aide , Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , Mondale said Cheney functioned as “ an ideological enforcer , silencing dissent , punishing critics , to sustain a flawed war policy based on cooked facts .
It ’s all there .
Read the case . ”
Mondale argued that freedom from higher political ambition freed Cheney to disrespect the Congress , the American people and the law .
Mondale said : “ The other morning , Mr. Cheney was on ‘ Good Morning America . ’
A reporter asked him : ‘ Well , polls now show that two thirds of the American people are opposed to this war .
Should n’t that mean something ?’
And [ Cheney ] said , ‘ So ? ’
“ Y’know , maybe he did n’t say it correctly or say it the way he meant it .
And I do n’t say that public opinion should govern everything .
But public opinion deserves respect and the president and the vice president ought to be worried about it .
“ I think our vice president ought to wake up every morning , like I did , wondering what he can do to enhance public support and respect .
And I believe an election - free unaccountable vice president , clothed with some of the aura and power of the president may , as this vice president has , act as though he were beyond accountability to anybody but the president — beyond the reach of the Congress , the court , the press , the Constitution and the American people .
“ It scares me and I think we ought to be thinking about it this fall as we pick a vice president . ”
“ I think this was a brutal , deliberate policy to ignore a wide range of written laws and constitutional principles and the legitimate powers of Congress …
It ’s different than anything we ’ve seen in American history and I think it ought to be seen not as two responsible positions , but ought to be seen as a dramatic challenge to American ’s system of government . ”
Mondale added : “ It ’s not that difficult .
If you ’re doing something that ’s against the law , stop it …
We never thought we had the right to ignore laws that were clearly applicable to the president . ”

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
As news outlets around the world pounded out headlines about crude oil reaching new highs Friday , one question dogged the effort :
Are prices really busting through historic levels if inflation is considered ?
The answer is sometimes , yes and sometimes , no .
The ambivalence lies in the historical benchmark for oil the record - keeper is using as well as the inflation index .
Market watchers that use one particular benchmark and the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) say oil has yet to reach the April , 1980 level of around $ 103.8 a barrel in real , or inflation - adjusted , terms .
Those that look at other benchmarks and indexes , however , say crude has already topped historical records in real - term .
On Friday , crude surged to $ 103.05 a barrel before closed modestly lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange , narrowing gaps with the $ 103.8 record but above records calculated with other measures .
See Futures Movers .
Here 's a glimpse into the confusion .
In 1980 , oil even was not traded on the Nymex .
The $ 103.8 real - term record was calculated with crude prices posted on the Wall Street Journal and adjusted by the CPI .
The benchmark , however , was not the most ideal , and the CPI only gauges goods bought by consumers , who rarely buy a barrel of crude oil and burn it in the backyard .
" The media 's reports on real - term historical prices are really creating a lot of confusion , " said James Williams , an economist at WTRG Economics , an energy research firm .
" Depending on who is calculating , you got different prices and records . "
“ ' The media 's reports on real - term historical prices are really creating a lot of confusion .
Depending on who is calculating , you got different prices and records . ' ” — James Williams , WTRG Economics
Regardless of the measure , current oil prices are at historic highs .
And some are advising using other measures to calculate oil prices .
The U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) says the best measure for determining oil prices might be the percentage of income Americans spend on petroleum products .
And by this measure , mid- and lower - income Americans are bearing the brunt of surging crude prices .
Benchmarks
For a start , there 's not just one source for oil prices .
Western Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) crude oil , the current underlying product for Nymex crude - oil futures , did n't start trading on the exchange until 1983 .
Before that , WTI prices were only based on trading between individual oil producers and buyers .
Back then , the Wall Street Journal posted monthly average WTI prices in the newspaper , but those prices barely changed .
In fact , WTI prices were the same for four months in 1980 .
According to WTI prices posted by the Journal in 1980 , oil reached the same price of $ 39.5 a barrel in four months starting from April , or about $ 103.8 in real - term adjusted by the CPI , namely the record high .
But in real trading , oil producers usually charged less than the posted prices , which adds more uncertainty on calling the $ 39.5 the highest level .
WTI crude futures gained attention after they were traded on the Nymex and slowly became a benchmark for oil prices .
But for reasons of consistency , WTI prices are not the best benchmark , analysts said , because the oil market is much more different now than it was when the futures market was unavailable .
A more consistent benchmark is the Imported Refiner Acquisition Cost ( IRAC ) , the EIA said in a recent report .
The IRAC is the average price U.S. refiners pay for imported oil in a given month .
Since the U.S. imports significant volumes of many different types of crude oil from many different countries , the EIA views the IRAC price as a representative measure of world oil prices .
According to the IRAC , oil prices were below $ 35 in the four months starting from April in 1980 , or about $ 90 if adjusted by the same CPI , much lower then the current oil prices .
The IRAC measure , however , has its only problem .
The crude oil U.S. refiners import are not necessarily all WTI , which is a type of high - quality crude and is more expensive than other types of oil with lower quality .
So the IRAC price is usually lower than the WTI price .
Indexes
Further confusion on calculating historical oil prices comes from inflation indexes .
While the CPI is widely quoted nowadays as a major tool to adjust historical data , it 's not the best gauge to be used on adjusting crude - oil prices .
" The CPI only measures a basket of consumer goods , while oil is an industry product , " said WTRG 's Williams .
" We all know consumers wo n't directly buy crude oil . "
A broader index is the GDP deflator , which measures inflation for the entire economy , not just a basket of consumer goods as the CPI does , Williams said .
For that reason , some oil analysts use the GDP deflator to adjust oil prices for inflation rather than the CPI .
Based on the GDP deflator , the current nominal record of $ 103.05 has already surpassed historic record levels .
Consumers ' pinch
The calculation of real - term crude prices sometimes can get really out of whack .
A barrel of oil once reached $ 20 in 1859 , shortly after oil was found in the United States , according to WTRG 's Williams .
That translates into a real - term price of over $ 400 , a level Nymex crude futures wo n't be able to catch up at least in the short term .
Those kinds of controversies have led some officials and analysts to believe the best gauge of oil prices is the portion of household income spent on petroleum products .
While consumers ' energy expenditures have been increasing rapidly in recent years , their disposable income has also grown significantly , and the current level of energy spending is not the highest in historical context .
According to the EIA , during the third quarter of 2007 , the most recent official data available , Americans spent an average of 5.7 % of their income on energy , 2.5 % less than in the second quarter of 1981 , when energy consumption spending as a share of income reached its peak over the last 50 years .
But just because the recent level is lower than the historic peak does n't mean all households have been impacted equally .
A 2006 report by Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago showed lower - income Americans spent more than 9 % of their expenditures on energy between 1982 and 2005 , nearly 3 % higher than top income households .
Thus deciding whether recent oil prices are the highest ever " may depend not only on which index is used , or how much the average household spends on energy , but also the income level of the particular household making the determination , " the EIA said in a January report .
Chris Wallace to Fox hosts :
Two hours of Obama - bashing is enough David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Friday March 21 , 2008

Print This Email This Veteran journalist Chris Wallace admonished Fox & Friends over their characterization of a comment in which Obama referred to his grandmother as a " typical white person . "
" I love you guys , but I want to take you to task if I may respectfully for a moment , " Wallace began .
" I have been watching the show ... , and it seems to me that two hours of Obama - bashing on this ' typical white person ' remark is somewhat excessive , and frankly , I think you 're somewhat distorting what Obama had to say . "
As the F&F hosts began grinning and shifting around in their seats , Wallace continued , " What he said was , ' The point I was making was not that my [ grandmother ] harbors any racial animosity -- she does n't -- but she is a typical white person ... , ' " which is where you generally have clipped it . "
As co-host Steve Doocy denied the charge , Wallace continued , " But what he went on to say is , '... who , if she sees somebody on the street that she does n't know , there 's a reaction that 's been bred into our experiences that do n't go away and that sometimes comes out in the wrong way , and that 's just the nature of race in our society . ' "
Added Wallace , " I 'm not saying that 's the most felicitous remark that anybody ever made , but I think it 's a little more complicated than we 've been portraying . "
Doocy interjected again , saying , " It just seems curious , because Barack Obama said this ... , but had Hillary Clinton said something on the other side , had she said , ' Well , that 's a typical Irish person , Polish person , Italian person , Swedish person , ' whatever , it'd hit the fan ! "
Responded Wallace , " I 've been watching on and off for a couple of hours and every clip I 've seen ends at ' that 's a typical white person , ' when in fact he 's going on to discuss the nature of race in our country , and again , I 'm not saying if he had it do over again that he'd necessarily say it that way , but I do n't think that he was making a hyper - racial remark . "
" I guess I just feel like on a day when he 's been endorsed by Bill Richardson , and we have this story about the passports , " he added , " I feel like two hours of Obama - bashing may be enough . "
The F&F hosts responded to Wallace with vehement defenses , but Wallace said that after Obama had given major speeches this week on race , Iraq , and the economy , his campaign might suggest that " in terms of deflecting attention away from the issues people really want to hear about , maybe it 's the media doing it , not Barack Obama . "
Wallace , son of 60 Minutes veteran Mike Wallace and reportedly a registered Democrat , is himself a Fox News host , which underscores his remarkable defense of the embattled Democratic presidential frontrunner .
Sam Graham - Felsen , a media staffer for the Obama campaign , wrote the following in a blog post at Obama 's official campaign site :
We appreciate Chris Wallace for doing his job as a tough but fair journalist on a network that has been deeply irresponsible over the last week in its unrelenting and sensationalistic coverage of Senator Obama .
Senator Obama gave the speech he did on Tuesday because he believes that Americans are ready for a thoughtful , mature discussion about race , and are hungry to move past media - generated controversies that distract from the struggles they face in their everyday lives .
If Fox News wants to play clips of the same offensive sound bites every day from now until November , that 's their right , but that type of coverage does a disservice to their viewers and to a nation that is facing serious challenges that merit thoughtful and honest reporting .
Earlier , before Wallace appeared on the show , F&F co-host Brian Kilmeade had temporarily walked off the set after Doocy made a crack at him after heated discussion of the Obama remark .
Campaigners against genetically modified crops in Britain last are calling for trials of GM potatoes this spring to be halted after releasing more evidence of links with cancers in laboratory rats .
UK Greenpeace activists said the findings , obtained from Russian trials after an eight - year court battle with the biotech industry , vindicated research by Dr Arpad Pusztai , whose work was criticised by the Royal Society and the Netherlands State Institute for Quality Control .
The disclosure last night of the Russian study on the GM Watch website led to calls for David Miliband , the Secretary of State for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs , to withdraw permission for new trials on GM potatoes to go ahead at secret sites in the UK this spring .
Alan Simpson , a Labour MP and green campaigner , said : " These trials should be stopped .
The research backs up the work of Arpad Pusztai and it shows that he was the victim of a smear campaign by the biotech industry .
There has been a cover - up over these findings and the Government should not be a party to that . "

Mr Simpson said the findings , which showed that lab rats developed tumours , were released by anti-GM campaigners in Wales .
Dr Pusztai and a colleague used potatoes that had been genetically modified to produce a protein , lectin .
They found cell damage in the rats ' stomachs , and in parts of their intestines .
The research is likely to spark a fresh row about GM crops in Britain .
Graham Thompson , a Greenpeace campaigner , said : " It is important because it backs up the research by Pusztai , which was smeared at the time by the industry . "
Brian John of GM Free Cymru , who released the findings , said the research was conducted in 1998 by the Institute of Nutrition of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences and has been suppressed for eight years .
It showed that the potatoes did considerable damage to the rats ' organs .
Those in the " control groups " that were fed non -GM potatoes suffered ill - effects , but those fed GM potatoes suffered more serious organ and tissue damage .
The potatoes contained an antibiotic resistance marker gene .
The institute that carried out the studies refused to release all the information .
However , Greenpeace and other consumer groups mounted a protracted legal battle campaign to obtain the report .
In May 2004 the Nikulinski District Court in Russia ruled that information relating to the safety of GM food should be open to the public .
The institute , however , refused to release the report .
Greenpeace and Russian activist groups again took the institute to court , and won a ruling that the report must be released .
Irina Ermakova , a consultant for Greenpeace , said she had conducted her own animal feeding experiments with GM materials .
" The GM potatoes were the most dangerous of the feeds used in the trials ... and on the basis of this evidence they cannot be used in the nourishment of people . "
Greenpeace said the Russian trials were also badly flawed .
Half of the rats in the trial died , and results were taken from those that survived , in breach of normal scientific practice .

Large home survey suggests 151,000 violent deaths .
Conflict leads to violent deaths , but counting them is controversial .
BRANDX
A survey from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) suggests that some 151,000 people died violent deaths in Iraq between 2003 and 2006 .
The latest figure adds to a set of widely differing estimates for the civilian death toll following the US - led invasion .
The figure , published today in the New England Journal of Medicine1 , is intermediate compared to previous efforts .
The online database Iraq Body Count has so far collated 47,000 deaths for this period , mainly from media reports .
But a controversial 2006 estimate from researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , based on home surveys , concluded there had been 601,000 violent deaths , more than 2 % of the Iraqi population2 .
The new study took data from the Iraq Family Health Survey , conducted by the country 's federal and regional ministries , in collaboration with the WHO .
In total , 9,345 households were surveyed .
The 2006 paper analysed data from 1,800 households .
Jon Pederson of Fafo , an Oslo , Norway - based organization that gathers information about living and working conditions , helped run a similar survey in Iraq in 2004 .
This United Nations - led project looked at 22,000 households and estimated that , up to then , between 18,000 and 29,000 had died .
Pederson says the WHO survey was methodologically robust , but its results are a little on the low side of what he would expect .
Household reporting always underestimates mortality compared to a straightforward body count , which is very difficult to do in times of conflict , he notes .
Mohamed Ali , at the Department of Measurement and Health Information Systems at the WHO in Geneva , says their survey was carefully designed and implemented by a large number of individuals , including local people .
Compare and contrast
The 2006 study also used a household survey to come up with its figure of 601,000 violent deaths .
" It ’s a your - word - against - mine situation .
Especially when one is six times lower than the other , " says Debarati Guha - Sapir , director of the Centre for Research on Epidemiology of Disasters in Brussels .
Guha -Sapir was not directly involved with any of these estimates .
Guha -Sapir has recently published a working paper analysing many estimates — including the Iraq Body Count , Johns Hopkins and Fafo surveys — and has come up with a death toll of around 139,000 .
From that basis , she thinks the WHO ’s total is about right .

But , she adds , she thinks the WHO 's sample is too small to come up with a definitive number , especially in Iraq where many people have been displaced , and violent deaths tend to be clustered in small areas .
“ The sample size is not really good enough to represent extremely variable conditions , ” she says .
Pederson is less worried about this .
“ This was an extremely difficult time to do a survey , ” he says .
“ No sample size is big enough , but [ around ] 10,000 is starting to come into the range where we can do something with the data . "
All surveys are imperfect , says Ali , and should be interpreted with caution .
What is important is that the number of deaths be documented .
" We 're not drawing any conclusions , " he says , but adds that " nearly 200,000 deaths is not a small number . "
WASHINGTON  The Florida Democratic Party chairwoman on Monday officially buried the possibility of redoing the state ’s disputed January presidential primary , saying there was no practical or affordable way to conduct a new election .
The chairwoman , Karen L. Thurman , essentially threw up her hands after failing to secure approval for a new election from state officials or the campaigns of Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama .
She said in a statement late Monday that party officials in Florida had proposed such a plan last week .
It was unceremoniously shot down , she said .
“ Thousands of people responded , ” Ms. Thurman said .
“ We spent the weekend reviewing your messages , and while your reasons vary widely , the consensus is clear : Florida does n’t want to vote again .
So we wo n’t . ”
A British territory in the Indian Ocean was used for American " torture " flights , despite categorical denials of Britain 's involvement from both Tony Blair and Jack Straw , the Government admitted yesterday .
The Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , had to make a humiliating apology to the Commons after it emerged that the US failed to tell British officials that two CIA rendition flights carrying suspected terrorists landed on the island of Diego Garcia in 2002 .
Six years on , one of the suspects is still being held by the US at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba .
The other has been released .
Mr Miliband denied there was a deliberate cover - up and said he believed the US had acted " in good faith " .
However , Gordon Brown , attending an EU summit in Brussels , expressed his " disappointment " and said Washington 's failure to disclose the flights earlier was " a very serious issue " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" The US has expressed regret that it did not admit at the time to these renditions through Diego Garcia , " he added .
" We have to assure ourselves these procedures will never happen again . "
America has used rendition flights to interrogate terror suspects – in particular since the attacks of 11 September 2001 .
The two flights which have now come to light , following an audit by officials in Washington , stopped to refuel on Diego Garcia on their way to Guantanamo Bay .
Mr Miliband said he was " very sorry indeed " to have to correct previous statements made by the then Prime Minister Mr Blair and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw that rendition flights had not used British bases .
He said the Diego Garcia cases had not come to light earlier because of an error in a previous US records search .
" The House and the Government will share deep disappointment at this news and about its late emergence , " he added .
" That disappointment is shared by our US allies .
They recognise the absolute imperative for the Government to provide accurate information to Parliament . "
Mr Miliband said each case involved a single detainee – neither of them British – who did not leave the aircraft while it was on the ground .
He told MPs that neither suspect was subject to torture by " water - boarding " .
Nevertheless , he said he had told officials to draw up a list of all flights about which concerns had been expressed regarding the use of UK territory .
In future , he added , Britain would approve CIA rendition flights through British bases only if the Government was satisfied they complied with British laws and the UK 's international obligations , including those under the UN Convention Against Torture .
Human rights activists voiced concern that the two cases which had been identified might only be the " tip of the iceberg " .
Kate Allen , of Amnesty International UK , said : " It is not enough for the Government simply to accept US assurances on correct behaviour in the war on terror .
We should retain our own integrity and act accordingly . "
As recently as January 2007 , Mr Blair assured the Intelligence and Security Committee he was satisfied that the US had at no time since 9/11 rendered an individual though the UK or its overseas territories .
After forcing a single ISP in Denmark to block The Pirate Bay , it now appears that the IFPI has a plan to sue all of the major Swedish ISPs to force them to do the same .
Telia Sonera , a large Swedish ISP is refusing to be bullied , stating that such blocking and filtering actions are illegal under EU law .
Now that the IFPI has realized that it ca n’t sue every file - sharer in the world , it tries to force ISPs to block their customers from accessing filesharing sites such as The Pirate Bay .
The IFPI recently forced an Israeli ISP to block access to HTTPShare.com – which boosted its visitors significantly – but it ’s the block it achieved against The Pirate Bay in Denmark that is currently being used as leverage against other ISPs , this time in Sweden .
When IFPI pressure forced Danish ISP ‘ Tele2 ’ to block access to The Pirate Bay , the trade organization chose to view this as some sort of landmark decision which could be used to make other ISPs take the same action , regardless of the likelihood that the block ordered by Denmark broke EU law .
According to reports , the IFPI is using this ‘ successful ’ block as a legal hammer to start hitting Swedish ISPs over the head with , as it formulates its plan to sue all of Sweden ’s major ISPs into blocking The Pirate Bay .
One such ISP is Telia Sonera , the dominant internet provider in Sweden with a total of 106 million subscribers across Europe .
According to a report , they have received a letter from the IFPI which states that legal measures will be taken against them unless they block The Pirate Bay initially , and also some other ( as yet unnamed ) sites connected to it .
However , Telia is highly experienced in its field and has a very clear understanding of its obligations under the law , law which does not require them to block sites or filter content .
Patrik Hiselius of Telia Sonera explains :
“ The rules say that we as Internet carriers are not allowed to listen in on what our customers are sending to each other or are talking with each other about .
That ’s something police and prosecutors are allowed to do after a decision has been made about it in court . ”
Unfortunately for the IFPI , the law is very stringent when it comes to wiretapping communications .
Eavesdropping is allowed , but only in cases of very severe crime .
Anna HÃ¶rnlund , a lawyer with the The Swedish Post and Telecom Agency believes that it ’s impossible to identify illegal file - sharing without breaking the law on wiretapping : “ To get access to this information , there needs to be a crime that is punishable by imprisonment and where a prosecutor believes charges can be made that leads to prison .
In those cases , the ISP can hand over the information to the police .
I do n’t know how they think they will get through this by suing the ISP . ”
Patrik Hiselius of Telia Sonera agrees that the record companies have a problem to solve he says they are approaching the issue in the wrong manner :
“ The best way to meet the demand for music and film on the Internet would be to make good , simple legal services available with good pricing .
The legal sites still have lots of shortcomings when it comes to availability . ”
The IFPI has recently sued Irish ISP Eircom , claiming that it ’s responsible for the actions of its users .
TJ McIntyre , chairman of Digital Rights Ireland ( DRI ) said : “ ISPs are intermediaries .
They are not , in law , responsible for what Internet users do , any more than [ the post office ] is responsible for what individuals send in the mail .
In fact , European law specifically states that they may not be put under a general obligation to monitor the information they transmit . ”
Clearly the IFPI believes that European law does n’t count when applied to their interests .
If their lawyers were n’t getting so financially fat from these frivolous lawsuits , maybe they would take the time to explain it to them .

Terry Eagleton , one of Britain 's most abrasive public intellectuals , has added to that reputation of late through his ongoing feud with Martin Amis over Islam .
And now he has written a book that sees Jesus as a Palestinian insurgent .
But , after a lifetime of baiting the establishment , the academic world has had enough of him .
Why would that be , asks Tim Adams
' Let me make one thing clear before we start , ' Terry Eagleton says .
' I did not do this book about Jesus just to piss off Martin Amis . '
I guess he would n't mind too much if it did , though .
The book about Jesus is a new reading of the Gospels , out in time for Christmas , in which Eagleton asks the question , ' Was Christ a revolutionary ? ' and answers it mostly in the affirmative .
It is a typical Eagleton stocking - filler : short , iconoclastic , fiercely clever ; it places Jesus on the fringe of Palestinian insurgents against Rome , in the political wing of the anti-imperialist Zealots .
The essay takes Eagleton back to his earliest intellectual outings at Cambridge in the Sixties , where he made a name for himself contributing to a curious Marxist Christian magazine called Slant .
It is also the latest offensive in his argument with what he likes to call ' smug , liberal , rationalist ' opinion , of which his ongoing war of words with Amis is the most visible engagement .
Eagleton - that endangered species in Britain , a public intellectual ; formerly Warton Professor of English at Oxford , currently John Edward Taylor Professor of Cultural Theory at Manchester - has always looked to ' rough up the edges of the mainstream ' , as he calls it .
Having been fashionably Marxist for much of his career , he is now unfashionably so .
Approaching 65 , he has spent four decades squaring up to establishments , whether religious , academic , literary or metropolitan .
The Amis feud is good gossip - column fodder because both protagonists are long used to believing themselves the smartest men in the room , but it also gets somewhere near the heart of the current schism in the liberal left over the response to Islamist terrorism .
The feud began when Eagleton took issue with Amis 's now infamous remark , made in an interview , that after the failed plot to blow up transatlantic planes in August 2006 he felt ' a definite urge ' to argue that British Muslims in general ' must suffer ' for the actions of suicide bombers ' until they got their house in order ' .
By suffering he meant ' strip searching people who look like they 're from the Middle East or from Pakistan ' , ' not letting them [ Muslims ] travel ' , and ' further down the road ' , deportation .
These comments , Eagleton wrote , sounded not unlike the ' the ramblings of a British National Party thug ' and he cemented his insult by suggesting that Amis had inherited this racism from his late father Kingsley , 'an anti-Semitic boor , a drink - sodden , self - hating reviler of women , gays and liberals ' .
The invective was given added edge by the fact that it coincided with Amis 's contract to start teaching alongside Eagleton at Manchester .
Eagleton 's attack has subsequently been rehashed by the columnist Yasmin Alibhai - Brown and the novelist Ronan Bennett , interventions which have drawn vehement defence of Amis from his old friend Christopher Hitchens .
Amis has distanced himself from his original remarks ( ' a thought experiment , or a mood experiment ' ) , called Eagleton a ' disgrace to his profession ' and ' a deluded flailer and stirrer ' , stood up for his father , and expressed the wish ' in a collegial spirit , that Eagleton would now shut up about it ' .
If he knew anything about Eagleton , that wish was never likely to be granted .
I 'd gone to meet him in Derry , where his second wife lectures at the university and where they have a house ( they have another in Dublin , which they share with their three children , including a baby of six months ) .
He suggests we sit in the old Unionist Guildhall on the edge of the garrison walls , just down the road from the Bloody Sunday memorial , a place not unused to sectarian debate .
Eagleton is an engaging presence , softly spoken , quick to laugh , and chooses his words with care .
It seems to me that ' the great feud ' masks a more telling argument ; I wonder whether he sees Amis as a worthy opponent ?
' Well , ' he says , coming out fighting , ' I have no idea why we should listen to novelists on these matters any more than we should listen to window cleaners .
I do n't know where their status comes from .
When someone like Ian McEwan stands up and says , " I believe in individual freedom , " you know , it 's like : " Hallelujah , put up your hands all those that do n't , " but such words do not respect a much larger problem . '
And that problem is ?
' The implication from Amis and McEwan - and from Hitchens and Richard Dawkins - is that civilisation and atheist rationalism go together , and I think that is a very dangerous argument to make .
The debate over God - Muslim or Christian - is for them increasingly becoming code for a debate on civilisation versus barbarism .
I think one needs to intervene and show the limitations of that .'
To understand Eagleton 's sense of such limitations it is necessary to know a little of his past .
He was brought up in Salford , Manchester , the middle child of a working - class Irish Catholic family with aspirations ( he was the only boy he knew who owned a coat ) .
His early years were shaped by fundamentalist religion : he named his recent , darkly comic memoir The Gatekeeper after the formative time he spent as the altar boy in a Carmelite nunnery , witnessing the moments when young girls took the veil and said goodbye to their families for ever .
He went to a grammar school run by the De La Salle brotherhood , toyed with the idea of becoming a priest but instead won a place at Cambridge , fell under the influence of Raymond Williams and became a different kind of cultish guru : a Marxist literary critic .
Eagleton is fond of saying ' what you are in the end is what you cannot walk away from ' .
One of the things he has been unwilling to discard is his Catholicism , though he has found a revolutionary strain to suit him .
As a result he not only attacks ' muscular ' liberals like Amis and Hitchens from the left , but also from a position that is not so much religious as anti-atheist .
His current truculence began with an entertaining dismantling of Richard Dawkins 's The God Delusion in the London Review of Books that kicked off : ' Imagine someone holding forth on biology whose only knowledge of the subject is The Book of British Birds , and you have a rough idea of what it is to read Richard Dawkins on theology . '
Eagleton believes that growing up steeped in the Church gives him an edge over his metropolitan foes , and that whatever the sins of Catholicism , it has never been opposed to rigorous self - analysis .
' They buy their atheism on the cheap , ' he says , of Dawkins and Hitchens in particular , ' because they have never been presented with an interesting version of faith .
One of the impulses of my writing - and the new book - has been to try to differentiate a version of Christianity worth having .
With people like Dawkins there is a kind of inverted evangelism ; I find it extraordinary that not once does he question the terms of his science . '
Would Eagleton call himself a Christian ?
' I am a lapsed Catholic ; the Church is cunning in that you can never really leave it .
I have deep objections to the way it has screwed up people 's lives , though I have gone to Mass occasionally right through my life .
It 's like keeping a foot in a culture that I value . '
He suggests that the question ' do you believe in God ? ' is akin to asking someone whether they believe in the Loch Ness monster .
Dawkins , he says , seems to imagine God 'if not exactly with a white beard then at least as some kind of chap ' , whereas even in the simplest sense , ' for Judeo - Christianity , God is not a person in the sense that Al Gore arguably is ...
He is the condition of possibility of any entity whatsoever , including ourselves .
He is the answer to why there is something rather than nothing .
God and the universe do not add up to two any more than my envy and my left foot constitute a pair of objects . '
Eagleton is not convinced this God exists , but believes that anyone who holds that He does is to be respected , while Dawkins and his acolytes , he argues , ' consider that no religious belief , any time or anywhere is worthy of any respect whatsoever ' .
It is from this position that Eagleton derives his attack on the ' liberal arrogance ' , underpinned by Godlessness , of Amis and his friends .
But how does this relate to the current fundamentalism - when a belief in God leads to a belief in jihad , how can you respect that ?
' One has to understand fundamentalism as a kind of fear , ' Eagleton says .
' A theologian friend of mine maintains that the opposite of love is not hate , it is fear .
The image of Jesus in the Gospels is of someone who is fearless .
People clutching on to their region or sect are very fearful of what lies beyond , and therefore very dangerous . '
He puts some of this fear down to the fallout from ' transnational capitalism ' that destroys regional and religious identity .
I wonder where he stands on the pointed question that Amis recently put to his impeccably liberal audience at the ICA : ' Do you feel morally superior to the Taliban ? '
( Only about a third raised a hand to say they did , a nice demonstration of relativist liberal guilt . )
Eagleton lets out a sharp laugh .
' I certainly hope I am morally superior to people who believe in slaughtering innocents .
But what I object to is the dangerous fudging of the line between the Muslim world and the Taliban , and the easy moral superiority that leaves us blind to our own crimes , or the crimes done in our names .
It is an obvious point , but one still worth making , that it was our own barbarism and colonialism in the Middle East that has helped to create these situations in the first place .
Amis and Hitchens have become perversely silent on the crimes of Western civilisation .
Western civilisation has produced enormous advances , but not to see the darker side of that , not to see the barbarism of the West , and not to see that at a time when we are killing thousands in Iraq and Afghanistan , seems extraordinarily naive . '
Eagleton has a practised ability to change the terms of a question , a product of the years when he used to excuse himself from High Table at Oxford in order to debate the progress of the struggle with comrades from the Workers ' Socialist League and shop floor activists from the car plant at Cowley .
The caricature has always been that of the armchair revolutionary , singing rebel songs in Irish pubs , before slipping back to the dreaming spires .
He liked to romanticise himself in his Oxford days as ' the barbarian in the citadel ' , spreading sedition to the sons and daughters of privilege .
Though his detractors charged him with intellectual bandwagon - jumping , he has stayed stubbornly faithful to his teenage socialism , a fact which has given him revered status among two generations of dissenting undergraduates .
It has also caused him , on occasion , to shape the world to fit his argument .
The most notable example of this in recent years is his 2005 book Holy Terror , which attempts to confront the current global conflicts through the prism of history , in particular the problem that ' the left is at home with imperial power and guerrilla warfare but embarrassed on the whole by the thought of death , evil , sacrifice or the sublime ' .
Eagleton struggles to contain the idea of an Islamist suicide bomber into an ideological vision of political martyrdom .
' Suicide bombers die so that others may die so that others may live ' is the formulation he comes up with at one point , which comes dangerously close to seeing bus bombers as freedom fighters for a distant cause , the charge Amis makes against left - wing ' appeasers ' .
Did Eagleton really see Hasib Hussain and the rest in that way ?
' No , no , I utterly repudiate that idea , ' he says , quickly .
' That kind of terrorism must be utterly and absolutely condemned . '
When asked about the suicidal insurgents in Baghdad , however , he apparently favours the line of John Pilger and others that equates the coalition invasion with the Third Reich .
' Well , ' he says , ' I believe one has a right to fight against occupation .
It is a right that would have been exercised by the British in the Second World War , and which was exercised by the French ...'
But what if those fighting against occupation want not to liberate their state from oppression but to return it to the Middle Ages through terror ?
' Support , ' he says , ' must always be critical of aims .
I think it is perfectly possible to say : in as much as you are fighting for a democratic self - governing society , we are with you . '
But is n't that a fudge too : how many committed democrats are there among the militias ?
' I think , ' he says , answering a different question , ' the whole Iraq folly is a good demonstration of the fact that you cannot impose democracy by force .
We always like to think that where there is a problem there is a solution .
The situation we have created in Iraq may well prove the opposite , that there now is no adequate solution .
We have painted ourselves into a corner , and whichever way we turn may well make things worse . '
Eagleton concedes that one of the reasons that he has not shifted his views over the years is that a drift toward the right is ' such a terrible cliche ' .
He has always been uncommonly wary of being assimilated by what he sees as the establishment ; he had the shock of his life when the Daily Mail called him ' a national treasure ' .
He is relishing the current spat partly because it allows him to believe that he has not mellowed .
His Catholicism does not extend so far as an interest in confessionals ; his memoir was constructed to give as little of his interior life away as possible .
If there was a defining event in his life it was the timing of the death of his father : Eagleton was informed of it while he was in the middle of his Cambridge entrance exam , and his immediate reaction was that it had ruined his chances .
He won a place anyway , but at Oxbridge claims he was always socially insecure : ' In those days Cambridge was much more patrician , ' he says .
' I felt a deep sense of alienation , which is really just a posh way of saying that I did not fit in .
My response to that was to go out of my way to prove myself intellectually . '
That effort could be said to have informed Eagleton 's life right up to the point that he gave up his chair at Oxford in 2001 ; he is uncomfortable with the fact that he did not leave earlier , in particular that he turned down a role at the fledgling Open University , saying now : ' I have often regretted that , ' before adding that 'one of the least creditable reasons I stayed within Oxbridge was to prove to the bastards that I could ' .
Contemporaries have suggested that for a Marxist , Eagleton was always an extremely effective careerist .
It would be uncharitable to suggest that this trait might also inform a small part of his current animosity .
Still , just before we end our interview , he lets slip the news that he has recently been told that Manchester will be terminating his contract early in the new year .
' They are throwing me out on the grounds of age , ' he says , bleakly .
' Along with two other distinguished professors .
We 're 65 , but it is a discretionary decision .
There is some financial crisis going on apparently .
It 's not as though they pay me a fortune but I suppose they will save something .
The students are getting rather het up about it .'
Maybe , I suggest , they need the money to pay Martin Amis to run his creative writing classes .
' Well , ' he says , smiling and bristling just a little , 'it is certainly profoundly odd that during this financial crisis they can afford to hire someone like him ...'

Diary of a spat : Eagleton versus Amis
9 September 2006
Martin Amis is quoted in the Times magazine , in the wake of the failed plot to blow up planes , as saying he feels a ' definite urge ' to argue that the British Muslim community should suffer ' until they got their house in order ' .
1 August 2007
The second edition of Terry Eagleton 's Ideology : An Introduction is published .
In the introduction , the author likens Amis 's comments to ' the ramblings of a British National Party thug ' .
8 October
Columnist Yasmin Alibhai - Brown describes Amis in The Independent as being ' with ... the Muslim - baiters and haters ' , and says that his pronouncements sound like those of Osama bin Laden .
10 October
Eagleton criticises the press for making personal attacks on him and for largely ignoring Amis 's remarks .
11 October
In an open letter to Alibhai - Brown , Amis insists that Eagleton has distorted his comments .
19 November
Novelist Ronan Bennett writes a feature for the Guardian in which he calls Amis 's views 'as odious an outburst of racist sentiment as any public figure has made in this country for a very long time ' .
21 November
Christopher Hitchens mounts a defence of Amis in the Guardian , writing that Amis has been pilloried for ' honestly attempting to ventilate the question [ of Islamism and reactions to it ] and to clarify it ' .
1 December
Amis rejects Bennett 's accusations of racism , writing in The Guardian that he has never advocated the discriminatory treatment of Muslims .
He also criticises Eagleton for starting ' this ragged furore ' .

Inactive lifestyles and poor diets are driving the obesity problem
The chairman of the International Obesity Taskforce wants world leaders to agree a global pact to ensure that everyone is fed healthy food .
Professor Philip James said the challenge of obesity was so great that action was needed now , even without clear evidence of the best options .
He also called for stricter rules on marketing and food labelling .
Professor James , of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , UK , was speaking in Boston at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS )
He commented : " This is a community epidemic that is actually a response to all the wonderful apparent industrial and economic development changes that we 've seen , with a collapse in the need for physical activity , and now a targeting of children to make profits by big industry in food and drink .
" We have to change that , and it will not come unless we have a coherent government - led strategy .
The issue is : have we got the political will ? "
Feeling the strain
He added that it was important that all food used a " traffic lights " labelling scheme so that consumers could immediately assess fat , sugar and salt content .
Some UK supermarkets have gone for " traffic light " labels
" So we 're in the process of trying to make it clear that if you 're concerned about the health and economics of a society you should take this seriously . "
Ten percent of the world 's children are either overweight or obese , twice as many as the malnourished , said Professor James .
" A huge range of analyses show that we have not been looking at the problem of children 's nutrition and well - being properly .
" They 're disadvantaged from birth , their academic achievement is impaired , their earning power is diminished , and they almost certainly have a life expectancy which is less than that of their parents . "
Ongoing battle
New data from Scandinavia showed that the weight of a child at the age of 7 - 12 predicted whether or not they were going to die early from heart disease or other problems , he said .
" We now have to think in a totally different way and recognise that it's the life cycle , " he added .
" Because these children start off being born small , they are then exposed to totally inappropriate environments , and they are therefore super - sensitive . "
Another expert , Professor Rena Wing , presented research at the AAAS in Boston suggesting that large - scale changes in diet and exercise were needed to prevent obesity .
A study of 5,000 men and women who lost an average of 70 lbs ( 30kg ) , and kept the weight off for six years , shows that large lifestyle changes - such as exercising 60 to 90 minutes a day - were needed to keep people slim .
" The obesity epidemic wo n't go away simply because people switch to skimmed milk from whole milk , " she said .
" They need to substantially cut their calories and boost their physical activity to get to a healthy weight - and keep minding the scale once they do . "

ROAD TRANSPORT :
Peugeot Moovie
The Portugese designer André Costa took another novel approach to ease of city parking and manoeuvring .
His design Moovie , made for the 2005 Concours de Design Peugeot , features two huge hub - less side - wheels which are used for both driving and steering .
Each wheel is independently driven by an electric motor , allowing the Moovie to rotate on its own axis and squeeze into the tightest parking spots .
To increase stability , the two side - wheels are tilted inwards under a ten degree angle .
The front - end conceals two small additional wheels which only operate as safety supports .
In the future it could be possible to make such a vehicle self - balancing using gyroscopes and balance sensors .
This is already employed on the Segway scooter and is suggested for the EMBRIO one - wheeled motorcycle concept .
The Moovie concept car built by Peugeot has a length of just 2,3 metres ( 7.6 ft ) and width and height of 1,5 metres ( 4.9 ft ) .
Access is created by two large sliding doors placed in the centre of the hub - less side - wheels .

PERSONAL MOBILITY
Embrio : One - Wheeled Motorcycle
The EMBRIO Advanced Concept is a one - wheeled recreational and commuting vehicle for the year 2025 , designed by the Canadian company Bombardier Recreational Products .
Although the riding position is similar to that of a motorcycle , the vehicle uses sensors and gyroscopes to balance up to two passengers on a large single wheel whilst driving .

Although the vehicle will also remain stable when motionless , with two small front wheels deployed at speeds below 20 kilometres per hour ( 12.5 mph ) .
To move forward , the rider activates a trigger on the left handlebar .
At a speed of 20 kilometres per hour ( 12.5 mph ) the front wheels or " landing gear " retracts so the rider is balancing on the large single wheel .
To turn the rider leans to the left or right .
The brake is activated by a trigger on the right handlebar .
Fuel cells running on hydrogen provide electricity for the electric motor which drives the single wheel .

Blade Runner : Rail & Road Hybrid
Furthermore an interesting crossbreed between light rail and a bus is the Blade Runner concept , developed by the British company Silvertip Design .
The Blade Runner is aimed to reduce traffic congestion as well fuel consumption and pollution by utilizing a dual - mode vehicle concept .
The Blade Runner is equipped with both road wheels with rubber tires as well as retractable rail wheels .
This makes it possible for the vehicle to switch between driving on roads and fixed railway tracks embedded in a road surface .
When running on such rails , the road wheels still provide the driving and braking power while the weight is carried by the track .
This combined system makes the Blade Runner more versatile than a train and more fuel efficient than a truck .
The fuel efficiency is due to the lesser rolling resistance between train wheel and track , compared to road - wheels , and improved aerodynamics .
Blade Runner can be configured to run along existing ballasted railway track , but will need additional pavement installed level with the rails for the vehicles to be able to get on and off the system .
Embedded rail systems would typically provide access for the vehicles and the traction surface needed for the enhanced performance when approaching junctions .
Such a track could be installed down the median of existing highways .
For long - distance traveling the Blade Runner can run more efficiently on rails with a saving in fuel consumption of between 20 and 55 per cent , depending on the configuration .
When required , the vehicle can retract the train wheels in order to deviate from the railway and carry on by road to deliver and collect like an ordinary bus or truck .
This ability to change from rail to road - mode greatly enhances the versatility of the Blade Runner .
The vehicle can travel in automated , guided vehicle convoys or be manually driven .
The Blader Runner is under development by the British company Silvertip Design , which in 2004 built a fully functioning 1:8 scale model and is conduction tests on a specially built track .
The project has so far been backed by the British freight trailer and body builder Don-Bur and the British government ’s Department of Trade and Industry .
Silvertip Design has furthermore built and tested a full sized semi-trailer truck fitted with a steering rear bogie used in the Blade Runner design .

Moller Skycar : VTOL Flying Car
The Skycar M400 is a flying car prototype which utilizes Vertical Take - Off and Landing ( VTOL ) technology .
This makes it possible to take off and land without the use of an airport runway .
The American company Moller International envisions a future where flying car owners can simply take to the skies directly from their driveway .
The Skycar M400 has seating capacity for four people , but its design can also be scaled up to the six - seating M600 , or scaled down to the single - passenger M100 .
The Skycar has a highly streamlined design equipped with four ducted - fan nacelles – two placed on either side of the cockpit .
Each nacelle fully encloses the engine and fans and produces both lift and propulsion when airborne .
Vertical lift is obtained during takeoff by redirecting the airflow downwards by deflection vanes inside of each nacelle .
Of great importance for the operation of a VTOL machine is a lightweight construction .
Therefore the Skycar is constructed for a large part from fibre reinforced plastic composite material .
The Skycar M400 is equipped with eight rotary engines of the Wankel type with multi-fuel capabilities .
These engines offer a high power versus weight ratio .
For safety reasons four groups of two engines each power the four nacelles .
If one engine fails , the fans can be driven by the back - up unit .
In flight the Skycar can achieve a cruising speed of 440 kilometres per hour ( 275 mph ) and a maximum speed of over 600 kilometres per hour ( 375 mph ) .
On the ground the Skycar is capable to travel short distances as an automobile .
Maximum ground speed is limited to approximately 50 kilometres per hour ( 30 mph ) .

E/S Orcelle :
Powered by sun , wind and waves .
Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics developed the E/S Orcelle " Zero Emission Ship " concept for a ship which uses no conventional engines , uses no fossil fuels and releases no harmful emissions into the atmosphere or pollution into the sea .
Aimed for the year 2025 , the E/S Orcelle is powered by the three renewable energy sources available at sea : sun , wind and waves .
With the concept , Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics wants to showcase what could be achieved given current and future technologies and a world devoid of fossil fuels .
The vessel is equipped with three large sails for wind propulsion .
Each sail is constructed of a lightweight composite material and has a surface area of 1400 square metres ( 15,069 ft2 ) .
The rigid sails can be folded upward and outward as well as rotated about the masthead to fix the best position to extract wind energy through the creation of drag force or lift force , or a combination of the two .
The front of the sails are fitted with solar cells .
Each solar panel has a surface area of 800 square metres ( 8,611 ft2 ) .
When there is little or no wind energy available , the sails can be tilted , laid down or otherwise directed towards the sun for maximum solar energy collection .
The hull of the ship is furthermore fitted with a total of twelve fins , which harness and transform wave energy into hydraulic , electrical or mechanical energy .
Each fin has a surface area of 210 square metres ( 2,260 ft2 ) .
The fins can also propel the ship , driven themselves by wave energy or by the electricity or mechanical energy available on board .
Approximately half the energy on the E/S Orcelle will be produced by an on - board fuel cell system , which convert hydrogen fuel into electricity .
Any additional electricity from the solar cells and fins can also be stored and converted into hydrogen .
Electricity generated by the fins , solar cells and fuel cells is used to power two variable speed electric pod propulsion systems .
One pod is fitted at each end of the main hull , replacing the traditional stern propeller and rudder and requiring less power .
Each pod houses an electric motor , gearbox and propeller in a single unit able to provide full power and 360 - degree maneuvrability .
Besides the streamlined and slender main hull , the E/S Orcelle has four support hulls .
In combination with the fins , these support hulls provide extra stability at sea , eliminating the need for the vessel to take on and release ballast water .
The ship is made from aluminium and plastic composites .
The E/S Orcelle is designed as a car carrier with a capacity of 10,000 cars on its eight cargo decks and a cruising speed of 15 knots ( 28 km/h or 17 mph ) .

This article is excerpted from chapter 7 of America ’s Great Depression .
“ To scoff at Hoover ’s tragic failure to cure the depression as a typical example of laissez - faire is drastically to misread the historical record . ”
If government wishes to alleviate , rather than aggravate , a depression , its only valid course is laissez - faire  to leave the economy alone .
Only if there is no interference , direct or threatened , with prices , wage rates , and business liquidation will the necessary adjustment proceed with smooth dispatch .
Any propping up of shaky positions postpones liquidation and aggravates unsound conditions .
Propping up wage rates creates mass unemployment , and bolstering prices perpetuates and creates unsold surpluses .
Moreover , a drastic cut in the government budget  both in taxes and expenditures  will of itself speed adjustment by changing social choice toward more saving and investment relative to consumption .
For government spending , whatever the label attached to it , is solely consumption ; any cut in the budget therefore raises the investment - consumption ratio in the economy and allows more rapid validation of originally wasteful and loss - yielding projects .
Hence , the proper injunction to government in a depression is cut the budget and leave the economy strictly alone .
Currently fashionable economic thought considers such a dictum hopelessly outdated ; instead , it has more substantial backing now in economic law than it did during the 19th century .
Laissez - faire was , roughly , the traditional policy in American depressions before 1929 .
The laissez - faire precedent was set in America ’s first great depression , 1819 , when the federal government ’s only act was to ease terms of payment for its own land debtors .
President Van Buren also set a staunch laissez - faire course , in the Panic of 1837 .
Subsequent federal governments followed a similar path , the chief sinners being state governments , which periodically permitted insolvent banks to continue in operation without paying their obligations .
[ 1]
In the 1920 –1921 depression , government intervened to a greater extent , but wage rates were permitted to fall , and government expenditures and taxes were reduced .
And this depression was over in one year  in what Dr. Benjamin M. Anderson has called “ our last natural recovery to full employment . ”
Laissez - faire , then , was the policy dictated both by sound theory and by historical precedent .
But in 1929 , the sound course was rudely brushed aside .
Led by President Hoover , the government embarked on what Anderson has accurately called the “ Hoover New Deal . ”
For if we define “ New Deal ” as an antidepression program marked by extensive governmental economic planning and intervention  including bolstering of wage rates and prices , expansion of credit , propping up of weak firms , and increased government spending ( e.g. , subsidies to unemployment and public works )  Herbert Clark Hoover must be considered the founder of the New Deal in America .
Hoover , from the very start of the depression , set his course unerringly toward the violation of all the laissez - faire canons .
As a consequence , he left office with the economy at the depths of an unprecedented depression , with no recovery in sight after three and a half years , and with unemployment at the terrible and unprecedented rate of 25 percent of the labor force .
$ 35 $ 29
Hoover ’s role as founder of a revolutionary program of government planning to combat depression has been unjustly neglected by historians .
Franklin D. Roosevelt , in large part , merely elaborated the policies laid down by his predecessor .
To scoff at Hoover ’s tragic failure to cure the depression as a typical example of laissez - faire is drastically to misread the historical record .
The Hoover rout must be set down as a failure of government planning and not of the free market .
To portray the interventionist efforts of the Hoover administration to cure the depression , we may quote Hoover ’s own summary of his program , during his presidential campaign in the fall of 1932 :
We might have done nothing .
That would have been utter ruin .
Instead we met the situation with proposals to private business and to Congress of the most gigantic program of economic defense and counterattack ever evolved in the history of the Republic .
We put it into action … .
No government in Washington has hitherto considered that it held so broad a responsibility for leadership in such times … .
For the first time in the history of depression , dividends , profits , and the cost of living , have been reduced before wages have suffered … .
They were maintained until the cost of living had decreased and the profits had practically vanished .
They are now the highest real wages in the world .
Creating new jobs and giving to the whole system a new breath of life ; nothing has ever been devised in our history which has done more for … “ the common run of men and women . ”
Some of the reactionary economists urged that we should allow the liquidation to take its course until we had found bottom … .
We determined that we would not follow the advice of the bitter - end liquidationists and see the whole body of debtors of the United States brought to bankruptcy and the savings of our people brought to destruction . [ 2 ]
The Development of Hoover ’s Interventionism : Unemployment
Hoover , of course , did not come upon his interventionist ideas suddenly .
It is instructive to trace their development and the similar development in the country as a whole , if we are to understand clearly how Hoover could so easily , and with such nationwide support , reverse the policies that had ruled in all previous depressions .
Herbert Clark Hoover was very much the “ forward - looking ” politician .
We have seen that Hoover pioneered in attempts to intimidate investment bankers in placing foreign loans .
Characteristic of all Hoover ’s interventions was the velvet glove on the mailed fist : i.e. , the businessmen would be exhorted to adopt “ voluntary ” measures that the government desired , but implicit was the threat that if business did not “ volunteer ” properly , compulsory controls would soon follow .
When Hoover returned to the United States after the war and a long stay abroad , he came armed with a suggested “ Reconstruction Program . ”
Such programs are familiar to the present generation , but they were new to the United States in that more innocent age .
Like all such programs , it was heavy on government planning , which was envisaged as “ voluntary ” cooperative action under “ central direction . ” [ 3 ]
The government was supposed to correct “ our marginal faults ”  including undeveloped health and education , industrial “ waste , ” the failure to conserve resources , the nasty habit of resisting unionization , and seasonal unemployment .
Featured in Hoover ’s plan were increased inheritance taxes , public dams , and , significantly , government regulation of the stock market to eliminate “ vicious speculation . ”
Here was an early display of Hoover ’s hostility toward the stock market , a hostility that was to form one of the leitmotifs of his administration . [ 4 ]
Hoover , who to his credit has never pretended to be the stalwart of laissez - faire that most people now consider him , notes that some denounced his program as “ radical ”  as well they might have .
So “ forward - looking ” was Hoover and his program that Louis Brandeis , Herbert Croly of the New Republic , Colonel Edward M. House , Franklin D. Roosevelt , and other prominent Democrats for a while boomed Hoover for the presidency . [ 5 ]
Hoover continued to expound interventionism in many areas during 1920 .
Most relevant to our concerns was the conference on labor - management relations that Hoover directed from 1919 to 1920 , on appointment by President Wilson and in association with Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson , a former official of the United Mine Workers of America .
The conference  which included “ forward - looking ” industrialists like Julius Rosenwald , Oscar Straus , and Owen D. Young , labor leaders , and economists like Frank W. Taussig  recommended wider collective bargaining , criticized “ company unions , ” urged the abolition of child labor , and called for national old - age insurance , fewer working hours , “ better housing , ” health insurance , and government arbitration boards for labor disputes .
These recommendations reflected Hoover ’s views . [ 6 ]
Hoover was appointed Secretary of Commerce by President Harding in March 1921 , under pressure from the left wing of the Republican Party , led by William Allen White and Judge Nathan Miller of New York .
( Hoover was one of the first of the modern breed of politician , who can find a home in either party . )
We have seen that the government pursued a largely laissez - faire policy in the depression of 1920 – 1921 , but this was not the doing of Herbert Hoover .
On the contrary , he “ set out to reconstruct America . ” [ 7 ]
He only accepted the appointment on the condition that he would be consulted on all economic policies of the federal government .
He was determined to transform the Department of Commerce into “ the economic interpreter to the American people ( and they badly need one ) . ” [ 8 ]
Hardly had Hoover assumed office when he began to organize an economic conference and a committee on unemployment .
The committee established a branch in every state having substantial unemployment , along with subbranches in local communities and mayors ’ emergency committees in 31 cities .
[ 9 ]
The committee contributed relief to the unemployed , and also organized collaboration between the local and federal governments .
As Hoover recalls :
We developed cooperation between the federal , state , and municipal governments to increase public works .
We persuaded employers to “ divide ” time among their employees so that as many as possible would have some incomes .
We organized the industries to undertake renovation , repair , and , where possible , expand construction . [ 10 ]
Standard Oil of New Jersey announced a policy of laying off its older employees last , and it increased its repairs and production for inventory ; US Steel also invested $ 10 million in repairs immediately upon conclusion of the conference . [ 11 ]
In short , the biggest businesses were the first to agree .
Happily , the depression was about over by the time these measures could take effect , but an ominous shadow had been cast over any future depression , a shadow that would grimly materialize when the 1929 crash arrived .
Once again , these measures bore the characteristic Hoover stamp ; the government compulsion and planning were larded with the rhetoric of “ voluntary cooperation . ”
He spoke of these and other suggested measures as “ mobilization of cooperative action of our manufacturers and employers , of our public bodies and local authorities . ”
And there came into use the now all too familiar war analogy : “ An infinite amount of misery could be saved if we have the same spirit of spontaneous cooperation in every community for reconstruction that we had in war . ”
While the government did not greatly intervene in the 1920 – 1921 recession , there were enough ominous seeds of the later New Deal .
In December 1920 , the War Finance Corporation was revived as an aid to farm exports , and a $ 100 million Foreign Trade Financial Corporation was established .
Farm agitation against short - selling led to the Capper Grain Futures Act , in August 1921 , regulating trading on the grain exchanges .
Furthermore , on the state level , New York passed rent laws , restricting the eviction rights of landlords ; Kansas created an Industrial Court regulating all key industries as “ public utilities ” ; and the Non-Partisan League conducted socialistic experiments in North Dakota . [ 12 ]
Perhaps the most important development of all , however , was the President ’s Conference on Unemployment , called by Harding at the instigation of the indefatigable Herbert Hoover .
This was probably the most fateful omen of antidepression policies to come .
About 300 eminent men in industry , banking , and labor were called together in September 1921 to discuss the problem of unemployment .
President Harding ’s address to the conference was filled with great good sense and was almost the swan song of the Old Order ’s way of dealing with depressions .
Harding declared that liquidation was inevitable and attacked governmental planning and any suggestion of Treasury relief .
He said , “ The excess stimulation from that source is to be reckoned a cause of trouble rather than a source of cure . ” [ 13 ]
To the conference members , it was clear that Harding ’s words were mere stumbling blocks to the wheels of progress , and they were quickly disregarded .
The conferees obviously preferred Hoover ’s opening speech , to the effect that the era of passivity was now over ; in contrast to previous depressions , Hoover was convinced , the government must “ do something . ” [ 14 ]
The conference ’s aim was to promulgate the idea that government should be responsible for curing depressions , even if the sponsors had no clear idea of the specific things that government should do .
The important steps , in the view of the dominant leaders , were to urge the necessity of government planning to combat depressions and to bolster the idea of public works as a depression remedy . [ 15 ]
The conference very strongly and repeatedly praised the expansion of public works in a depression and urged coordinated plans by all levels of government . [ 16 ]
Not to be outdone by the new administration , former President Wilson , in December , added his call for a federal public - works - stabilization program .
The extreme public - works agitators were disappointed that the conference did not go far enough .
For example , the economist William Leiserson had thought that a Federal Labor Reserve Board “ would do for the labor market what the Federal Reserve Board did for the banking interests . ”
But the wiser heads saw that they had made a great gain .
As a direct result of Hoover ’s conference , twice as many municipal bonds for public works were floated in 1921 and 1922 as in any previous year ; federal highway grants - in - aid to the states totaled $ 75 million in the autumn of 1921 , and American opinion was aroused on the entire subject .
It was no accident that the conference had arrived at its interventionist conclusions .
As usually happens in conferences of this type , a small group of staff men , along with Herbert Hoover , actually prepared the recommendations that the illustrious front men duly ratified . [ 17 ]
Secretary of the crucial Public Works Committee of the conference was Otto Tod Mallery , for a long time the nation ’s leading advocate of public - works programs in depressions .
Mallery was a member and guiding spirit of the Pennsylvania State Industrial Board and Secretary of the Pennsylvania Emergency Public Works Commission , which had pioneered in public - works planning , and Mallery ’s resolutions thoughtfully pointed to the examples of Pennsylvania and California as beacon lights for the federal government to follow . [ 18 ]
Mallery was one of the leading spirits in the American Association for Labor Legislation ( AALL ) an organization of eminent citizens and economists devoted to the promotion of government intervention in the fields of labor , unemployment , and welfare .
The Association had held the first national unemployment conference in early 1914 .
Now , its executive director , John B. Andrews , boasted that the presidential conference ’s recommendations followed the standard recommendations formulated by the AALL in 1915 .
These standard recommendations featured public works and emergency public relief , at the usual hours and wage rates  the wage rates of the boom period were supposed to be maintained . [ 19 ]
Neither was the conference ’s following of the AALL line a coincidence .
Aside from Mallery ’s critical role , the conference also employed the expert knowledge of the following economists , all of whom were officials of the AALL : John B. Andrews , Henry S. Dennison , Edwin F. Gay , Samuel A. Lewisohn , Samuel McCune Lindsay , Wesley C. Mitchell , Ida M. Tarbell , Mary Van Kleeck , and Leo Wolman . [ 20 ]
It seems clear that the businessmen at the conference were not supposed to mold policy ; their function was to be indoctrinated with the Hoover - AALL line and then to spread the interventionist gospel to other business leaders .
Andrews singled out for particular praise in this regard Joseph H. Defrees , of the United States Chamber of Commerce , who appealed to many business organizations to cooperate with the mayors ’ emergency committees , and generally to accept “ business responsibility ” to solve the unemployment problem .
President Samuel Gompers of the American Federation of Labor ( AF of L ) also hailed the widespread acceptance by industry of its “ responsibility ” for unemployment , as an outcome of this conference .
Hoover did his best to intervene in the recession , attempting also to stimulate home construction and urging banks to finance more exports .
Fortunately , however , Harding and the rest of the cabinet were not convinced of the virtues of governmental depression “ remedies . ”
But eight years later , Hoover was finally to have his chance .
As Lyons concludes , “ A precedent for federal intervention in economic depression was set , rather to the horror of conservatives . ” [ 21 ]
It is , of course , a sociological law that a government bureau , once launched , never dies , and the conference was true to this law .
The conference resolved itself into three research committees , run by a staff of experts , with Hoover in overall command .
One project bore fruit in Leo Wolman ’s Planning and Control of Public Works , a pro–public works study published in 1930 .
A second committee published a study on Seasonal Operation in the Construction Industry , in 1924 , in cooperation with the Division of Building and Housing of the Department of Commerce .
This work urged seasonal stabilization of construction , and was in part the result of a period of propaganda activity by the American Construction Council , a trade association headed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
Its foreword was written by Herbert Hoover . [ 22 ]
The most important project was a study of Business Cycles and Unemployment , published in 1923 .
Hoover invited the National Bureau of Economic Research ( headed by Wesley C. Mitchell ) to make a “ fact - finding ” study of the problems of forecasting and control of business cycles , and then appointed a Committee on Business Cycles to draft policy recommendations for the report .
Chairman of the committee was Owen D. Young , and other members included Edward Eyre Hunt , who had been secretary of the President ’s Conference , Joseph Defrees , Mary Van Kleeck , Clarence Woolley , and Matthew Woll of the AF of L. Funds for the project were considerately supplied by the Carnegie Corporation .
Wesley C. Mitchell , of the National Bureau and AALL , planned and directed the report , which included interventionist chapters by Mallery and Andrews on public works and unemployment benefits , and by Wolman on unemployment insurance .
While the National Bureau was supposed to do only fact - finding , Mitchell , in discussing his report , advocated “ social experimentation . ” [ 23 ]
Meanwhile , Hoover had not been idle on the more direct legislative front .
Senator W.S. Kenyon of Iowa , in late 1921 , introduced a bill supported by Hoover , embodying recommendations of the conference and specifically requiring a public - works - stabilization program .
In the December 1921 hearings , the Kenyon Bill was supported by numerous leading economists , as well as by the American Federation of Labor , the American Engineering Council ( of which Hoover had just been named president ) , and the United States Chamber of Commerce .
One of the supporters was Wesley C. Mitchell .
The bill never came to a vote , however , largely due to healthy senatorial skepticism based on laissez - faire ideas .
The next public - works - stabilization bill before Congress was the Zihlman Bill in the House .
This was promoted by the National Unemployment League , formed in 1922 for that purpose .
Hearings were held in the House Labor Committee in February 1923 .
Hoover backed the proposal , but it failed of adoption .
Finally , Hoover presented the report on business cycles and unemployment to the Congress , and strongly urged a public - works program in depressions .
Later , in 1929 , Hoover ’s Committee on Recent Economic Changes would also support a public - works program .
In 1924 , the AALL continued its agitation .
It participated in a national conference proposing public - works planning .
The conference was called by the Federated American Engineering Societies in January .
In 1923 , Wisconsin and Massachusetts were persuaded to adopt a stabilizing public - works program .
Massachusetts was directly swayed by testimony from the ubiquitous Andrews and Mallery .
These state programs were never translated into effective action , but they did indicate the developing climate .
In January 1925 , Hoover had the satisfaction of seeing President Coolidge adopt his position .
Addressing the Associated General Contractors of America ( a group that stood to gain by a government building program ) , Coolidge called for public - works planning to stabilize depressions .
Senators George H. Pepper and James Couzens tried to pass public - works - planning legislation in 1925 and 1926 , but they failed , along with later attempts by Senator Wesley Jones , who submitted bills that had been drafted in Hoover ’s Department of Commerce .
The Republican Senate was the most recalcitrant , and one Pepper Bill was filibustered to death there .
Even favorable reports by its Commerce Committee could not sway the Senate .
By this time , not only Hoover and Coolidge , but also Secretary Mellon , the Democratic Party in 1924 , and later Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York , had endorsed the public - works program .
In May 1928 , Senator Robert F. Wagner ( D , NY ) introduced three bills for comprehensive public - works planning , including the creation of an employment stabilization board , but the plan was not considered by Congress . [ 24 ]
After Hoover was elected president , he became more circumspect in presenting his views , but he carried on the fight with renewed vigor .
His technique was to “ leak ” the “ Hoover Plan ” to trusted associates , who would obviously be presenting Hoover ’s views .
He chose as his vehicle Governor Ralph Owen Brewster of Maine .
Brewster presented a public - works plan to the Conference of Governors in late 1928 , and waxed eloquent about the plan as designed to “ prevent depressions . ” [ 25 ]
His use of the term “ Road to Plenty ” was hardly a coincidence , for Hoover had adopted the plan of Messrs .
Foster and Catchings , which had recently been outlined in their famous book , The Road to Plenty ( 1928 ) .
The authors had submitted the plan to Brewster , and , after Hoover ’s endorsement , Brewster brought Professor William T. Foster along to the Governors ’ Conference as his technical advisor .
Foster and Catchings , bellwethers of inflation and the bull market and leading underconsumptionists , had been closely involved in the public - works agitation .
Foster was director of the Pollak Foundation for Economic Research , founded by investment banker Waddill Catchings .
The pair had published a series of very popular books during the 1920s , agitating for such panaceas as public works and monetary inflation . [ 26 ]
Although seven or eight governors were enthusiastic about the Hoover - Foster - Catchings Plan , the conference tabled the idea .
A large part of the press hailed the plan in extravagant terms , as “ prosperity insurance , ” a “ prosperity reserve , ” or as a “ pact to outlaw depression ” ; while more conservative organs properly ridiculed it as a chimerical and socialistic effort to outlaw the law of supply and demand .
It was not surprising that William Green of the AF of L hailed the plan as the most important announcement on wages and employment in a decade , or that the AF of L’s John P. Frey announced that Hoover had now accepted the old AF of L theory that depressions are caused by underconsumption and low wages . [ 27 ]
The press reported that “ labor is jubilant , because leaders believe that the next President has found … a remedy for unemployment which , at least in its philosophy and its groundwork , is identical with that of labor . ” [ 28 ]
The closeness of Foster and Catchings to Hoover is again demonstrated by the detailed account of their own plan that they published in April 1929 .
In an article entitled “ Mr. Hoover ’s Plan : What It Is and What It Is Not  A New Attack on Poverty , ” they wrote authoritatively that Hoover should wield a stabilization public - works reserve , not of $ 150 million , as had often been mentioned in previous years , but of the gigantic sum of $ 3 billion .
This plan would iron out prices and the business cycle , and stabilize business .
At last , scientific economics was to be wielded as a weapon by an American president : “ The Plan … is business guided by measurements instead of hunches .
It is economics for an age of science  economics worthy of the new President . ” [ 29 ]
The Development of Hoover ’s Interventionism : Labor Relations
We cannot fully understand Hoover ’s disastrous interference in the labor market during the depression without tracing the development of his views and actions on the labor front during the 1920s .
We have seen that his Reconstruction Program and his Economic Conference of 1920 praised collective bargaining and unionism .
In 1920 , Hoover arranged a meeting of leading industrialists with “ advanced views ” on labor relations to try ( unsuccessfully ) to persuade them to “ establish liaison ” with the American Federation of Labor . [ 30 ]
From 1919 through 1923 , Hoover tried to persuade private corporations to insure the uninsurable by adopting unemployment insurance , and in 1925 he praised the American Federation of Labor as having “ exercised a powerful influence in stabilizing industry . ”
He also favored the compulsory unemployment of a child labor amendment , which would have lowered the national product , and raised labor costs as well as the wages of competing adult workers .
Most important of Hoover ’s activities in the labor field was his successful war against United States Steel and its chairman , Judge Elbert H. Gary , a war conducted as a “ skillful publicity campaign ” ( in the words of a Hoover admirer ) against “ barbaric ” hours of work in the steel industry . [ 31 ]
The success of this battle made it much easier later on to persuade businessmen to go along with his labor policies during the 1929 depression .
Hoover had decided that the 12 - hour day in the steel industry must be eradicated and replaced by the 8 - hour day .
He persuaded Harding , lapsing from his usual laissez - faire instincts , to hold a conference of steel manufacturers in May 1922 , at which Harding and Hoover called on the magnates to eliminate the 12 - hour day .
An admiring biographer notes with satisfaction that Hoover made the steel leaders “ squirm . ” [ 32 ]
It was of course easy for Harding and Hoover , far removed from the necessity of meeting a payroll or organizing production , to tell other people how long and under what conditions they should work .
Hoover was supported by such “ enlightened ” steelmen as Alexander Legge and Charles R. Hook , but bitterly opposed by other leaders like Charles M. Schwab , and of course by Judge Gary , chairman of the board of US Steel and president of the American Iron and Steel Institute .
The war was on .
The steel agitation , it should be pointed out , had not been begun by Hoover .
It originated back in September 1919 , when Gary refused to engage in collective bargaining with a workers ’ union .
The workers struck on that issue , and the strike was led by Communist leader William Z. Foster .
By the time the strike had failed , in January 1920 , public opinion , properly regarding the strike as Bolshevik inspired , was squarely on the side of US Steel .
By this time , however , the Interchurch World Movement had appointed a Commission of Inquiry into the strike ; the commission issued a report favorable to the strikers in July 1920 , and thereby initiated the 8 - hour day agitation . [ 33 ]
The report started a propaganda war , with the nation ’s leftists attempting to change the whole temper of public opinion .
The Reverend A.J. Muste , the Socialist New York Call , Labor , and The Nation backed the report , while business associations strongly attacked the inquiry .
The latter included the National Association of Manufacturers , the National Civic Federation , the Wall Street Journal , and others .
Many religious papers , however , were persuaded by the prestige of the committee ( a prestige in religion that somehow carried over to secular matters ) to change their previous views and to line up on the antisteel side .
It was at this critical point in the battle that Hoover entered the fray and persuaded President Harding to join him .
Hoover “ deliberately broke the story ” of the unsuccessful private meeting with Gary , Schwab , and the others to the press .
He told the press that President Harding was “ attempting to persuade industry to adopt a reasonable working day . ” [ 34 ]
Thus did the government mobilize public opinion on the side of the union .
Hoover managed to have the national Engineering Societies  effectively dominated by Hoover  issue a report ( again outside of their competence ) endorsing the 8 - hour day in November 1922 .
Hoover eulogized the report , wrote the introduction , and persuaded Harding to sign it .
Under the presidential pressure , Judge Gary appointed a committee of the steel industry , headed by himself , to study the question .
The committee reported on May 25 , 1923 , unanimously rejecting the 8 - hour day demands .
US Steel also issued a reply to the Interchurch Report , written by Mr. Marshall Olds , and endorsed by the prominent economist , Professor Jeremiah W. Jenks .
Abuse rained down on the steel industry from all sides .
Forgotten were the arguments used by US Steel , e.g. , that the steel workers preferred the longer 12 - hour day because of the increased income , and that production would suffer under an 8 - hour schedule . [ 35 ]
This and other arguments were swept away by the wave of emotionalism whipped up over the issue .
The forces of the Social Gospel hurled anathemas .
“ Social Justice ” and “ Social Action ” committees of Protestant , Catholic , and Jewish organizations set up a clamor on issues about which they knew virtually nothing .
Attaching a quantitative codicil to the qualitative moral codes of the Bible , they did not hesitate to declare that the 12 - hour day was “ morally indefensible . ”
They did not elaborate whether it had suddenly become “ morally indefensible ” or whether it , and even longer work days , had also been morally wicked throughout earlier centuries .
If the latter , it was certainly strange that countless preceding generations of churchmen had overlooked the alleged sin ; if the former , then a curious historical relativism was now being mingled with the presumably eternal truths of the Bible .
The American Association for Labor Legislation of course entered the fray , and threatened federal maximum - hour legislation if the steel industry did not succumb to its imperious demands .
But the most effective blow was a stern public letter of rebuke sent to Gary by President Harding on June 18 , written for the president by Hoover .
Faced by Harding ’s public requests and demands , Gary finally surrendered in July , permitting Hoover to write the notice of triumph into Harding ’s Independence Day address .
The Hoover - Harding victory over US Steel effectively tamed industry , which , faced by this lesson , no longer had the fight to withstand a potent combination of public and governmental pressures . [ 36 ]
Nor did this exhaust Hoover ’s labor interventionism during the 1920s .
Hoover played a major role in fostering railway unions , and in foisting upon the railroad industry the Railway Labor Act  America ’s first permanent incursion of the federal government into labor - management relations .
The railroad problem had begun in World War I , when the federal government seized control of the nation ’s rails .
Run by Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo , the government ’s policy was to encourage unionization .
After the war was over , the railway unions tried their best to perpetuate this bastion of socialism , and advocated the Plumb Plan , which called for joint operation of the railroads by employers , unions , and the government .
The railroads were returned to private owners in 1920 , but Congress gave a dangerous sop to the unions by setting up a Railroad Labor Board , with tripartite representation , to settle all labor disputes .
The board ’s decisions did not have the force of law , but they could exert an undue pressure on public opinion .
The unions were happy with this arrangement , until the government representatives saw the light of economic truth during the depression of 1921 , and recommended reductions in wage rates .
The nonoperating railway unions conducted a nationwide strike in defiance of the proposed reduction in the summer of 1922 .
While Attorney General Daugherty acted ably in support of person and property by obtaining a federal injunction against union violence , the “ horrified ” Mr. Hoover , winning Secretary of State Hughes to his side , persuaded Harding to force Daugherty to remove the injunction .
Hoover also intervened privately but insistently to try to wring pro-union concessions from the railroads .
After the unions lost their strike , they determined to rewrite the law so that they could become established with the help of federal coercion .
From 1923 on , the unions fought for a compulsory arbitration law .
They achieved this goal with the Railway Labor Act of 1926 , which , in effect , guaranteed collective bargaining to the railway unions .
The bill was drafted by union lawyers Donald Richberg and David E. Lilienthal , and also by Herbert Hoover , who originated the idea of the Railway Labor Mediation Board .
Seeing the growing support for such a law and lured by the promised elimination of strikes , the bulk of the railroad industry surrendered and went along with the bill .
The Railway Labor
Act  the first giant step toward the collectivization of labor relations  was opposed by only a few far - sighted railroads , and by the National Association of Manufacturers . [ 37 ]
Even more mischievous than Hoover ’s pro-union attitude was his adoption of the new theory that high wage rates are an important cause of prosperity .
The notion grew during the 1920s that America was more prosperous than other countries because her employers generously paid higher wage rates , thus insuring that workers had the requisite purchasing power to buy industry ’s products .
While high real wage rates are actually the consequence of greater productivity and capital investment , this theory put the cart before the horse by claiming that high wage rates were the cause of high productivity and living standards .
It followed , of course , that wage rates should be maintained , or even raised , to stave off any threatening depression .
Hoover began championing this theory during the Unemployment Conference of 1921 .
Employers on the manufacturing committee wanted to urge lowering wage rates as a cure for unemployment , but Hoover successfully insisted on killing this recommendation . [ 38 ]
By the mid-1920s , Hoover was trumpeting the “ new economics ” and attacking the “ old economics ” that resisted the new dispensation .
In a speech on May 12 , 1926 , Secretary Hoover spread the gospel of high wage rates that was to prove so disastrous a few years later :
not so many years ago  the employer considered it was in his interest to use the opportunities of unemployment and immigration to lower wages irrespective of other considerations .
The lowest wages and longest hours were then conceived as the means to obtain lowest production costs and largest profits ….
But we are a long way on the road to new conceptions .
The very essence of great production is high wages and low prices , because it depends upon a widening … consumption , only to be obtained from the purchasing - power of high real wages and increased standards of living . [ 39 ]
Hoover was not alone in celebrating the “ new economics . ”
The National Industrial Conference Board reported that , while during the 1920 – 1921 depression , wage rates fell by 19 percent in one year , the high - wage theory had taken hold from then on .
More and more people adopted the theory that wage - cutting would dry up purchasing power and thus prolong the depression , while wage rates held high would quickly cure business doldrums .
This doctrine , allied with the theory that high wage rates cause prosperity , was preached by many industrialists , economists , and labor leaders throughout the 1920s . [ 40 ]
The Conference Board reported that “ Much was heard of the dawn of a new era in which major business depressions could have no place . ”
And Professor Leo Wolman has stated that the prevailing theory during the 1920s was that “ high and rising wages were necessary to a full flow of purchasing power and , therefore , to good business . ” [ 41 ]
As the final outgrowth of the famous conference of 1921 , Hoover ’s Committee on Recent Economic Changes issued a general multivolume report on the American economy in 1929 .
Once again , the basic investigations were made by the National Bureau .
The committee did not at all foresee the Great Depression .
Instead , it hailed the price stability of the 1920s and the higher wages .
It celebrated the boom , little realizing that this was instead its swan song : “ with rising wages and relatively stable prices we have become consumers of what we produce to an extent never before realized . ”
In the early postwar period , the committee opined , there were reactionary calls for the “ liquidation ” of labor back to prewar standards .
But , soon , the “ leaders of industrial thought ” came to see that high wages sustained purchasing power , which in turn sustained prosperity .
They began consciously to propound the principle of high wages and low costs as a policy of enlightened industrial practice .
This principle has since attracted the attention of economists all over the world  its application on a broad scale is so novel . [ 42 ]
This change in the industrial climate , according to the committee , came about in a few short years , largely due to the influence of the Conference on Unemployment .
By the fall of 1926 , steel magnate Eugene Grace was already heralding the new dispensation in the Saturday Evening Post . [ 43 ]
The conclusions of the Hoover - appointed economic committee were ominous in their own right .
“ To maintain the dynamic equilibrium ” of the 1920s , it declared , leadership must be at hand to provide more and more “ deliberate public attention and control . ”
In fact , “ research and study , the orderly classification of knowledge … well may make complete control of the economic system a possibility . ”
To maintain the equilibrium , “ We … [ must ] develop a technique of balance , ” the technique to be supplied by economists , statisticians , and engineers , all “ working in harmony together . ”
And so , President Herbert Hoover , on the eve of the Great Depression , stood ready to meet any storm warnings on the business horizon . [ 44 ]
Hoover , the “ great engineer , ” stood now armed on many fronts with the mighty weapons and blueprints of a “ new economic science . ”
Unfettered by outworn laissez - faire creeds , he would use his “ scientific ” weapons boldly , if need be , to bring the business cycle under governmental control .
Hoover did not fail to employ promptly and vigorously his “ modern ” political principles , or the new “ tools ” provided him by “ modern ” economists .
And , as a direct consequence , America was brought to her knees as never before .
Yet , by an ironic twist of fate , the shambles that Hoover abandoned when he left office was attributed , by Democratic critics , to his devotion to the outworn tenets of laissez - faire .

In reality , public works only prolong the depression , aggravate the malinvestment problem , and intensify the shortage of savings by wasting more capital .

The payment of charity wages as high as market rates began in the depression of 1893 ; public works as a depression remedy started on a municipal scale in the recession of 1914 –1915 .
The secretary of Mayor John Purroy Mitchell ’s New York Committee on Unemployment urged public works in 1916 , and Nathan J. Stone , chief statistician of the US Tariff Board , urged a national public works and employment reserve in 1915 .
Immediately after the war , Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York and Governor Frank O. Lowden of Illinois urged a national public - works - stabilization program .

The American Construction Council was formed in response to the hounding of the New York construction industry by state and federal authorities during the depression of 1920 – 1921 .
The governments charged the industry with “ price - fixing ” and “ excessive profits . ”
Hoover and Roosevelt together formed the council in the summer of 1922 , to stabilize and organize the industry .
The aim was to cartelize construction , impose various codes of operation and “ ethics , ” and to plan the entire industry .
Franklin Roosevelt , as president of the council , took repeated opportunity to denounce profit seeking and rugged individualism .
The “ codes of fair practice ” were Hoover ’s idea .

One of these industrialists was the same Charles M. Schwab , head of Bethlehem Steel , who had bitterly fought Hoover in the 8 - hour day dispute .
Thus , in early 1929 , Schwab opined that the way to keep prosperity permanent was to “ pay labor the highest possible wages . ”

The Best of Murray N. Rothbard
In 1993 , the Dutch Nobel prize - winning physicist Gerard t’Hooft suggested that all the information in a region of space can be represented as a hologram , an idea that implies that the laws of physics that govern our universe are somehow encoded on its ( higher dimensional ) boundary .
This idea , known as the holographic principle , has a certain elegance and so has received widespread attention from some theorists although nobody knowns whether it is a true description of the universe or not .
If it is true , Jae -Weon Lee from the Korea Institute for Advanced Study in Seoul and some pals , say that this boundary should emit Hawking radiation .
Hawking originally dreamt up this radiation idea to describe a process that might occur near the event horizon of a black hole .
When pairs of virtual particles pop into existence ( as they do all over the universe ) , they normally annihilate each other and disappear again .
But near a black hole , one of these particles can cross the event horizon while the other makes its escape and this gives the impression that the black hole is emiting radiation .
Lee ’s team say a similar thing may happen at the holographic boundary and that the energy this creates might be responsible for making the expansion of the universe accelerate .
They also explain why this radiation does not interact with ordinary matter and so is not seen in other ways : it ’s wavelength , being universe - sized , is too long .
Seems as good an explanation as any other at this stage , after all the competition is ideas like quintessence , k- essence and quintoms .
Two things though : if this radiation exerts a force , why would it act to accelerate the expansion of the universe and not decelerate it ?
Lee and co are not convincing on this point .
And , I wonder whether t’Hooft , who has some exotic ideas of his own about quantum determinism , would say that this kind of cosmic Hawking radiation is not compatible with the holographic principle and therefore bunkum .

Hillary Clinton is facing intense questions about her honesty in the aftermath of the Bosnia videos , the Washington Post Fact Checker elaborates on the issue in detail , after the Clinton campaign claimed , that Hillary Clinton “ misspoke ” .
I ’d like to ask the question : How come ?
She was so specific down to the details of which aircraft she used and that it was equipped with an armoured cockpit , and hey she was right , and then “ misspoke ” about the details of her arrival at the Tuzla airfield – a bit of a stretch !
This is n’t her only misspeech , however .
Hillary Clinton claimed , she was highly sceptical if not downright against NAFTA right from the start .
As we know now , she has been deeply involved in marketing the treaty , as First Lady .
Here ’s the video which perfectly contrasts what she said , to what happened , I had posted this here before :
But that ’s not all :
Right before the Ohio primaries , there suddenly popped up a story , which implied , that an aide to Barack Obama told Canadians the critical campaign rhetoric against NAFTA was more or less , just campaign noise .
This “ leak ” helped Hillary Clinton a lot in winning Ohio .
Mark Penn said :
“ It had a significant impact , ” Mark Penn said during a conference call with reporters early Thursday .
“ I think it is going to be a serious issue moving forward in this campaign .
It raised serious questions about Obama . ”
The leak of that memo is quite a scandal in Canada and reason for a government probe .
Now it turns out that the person who “ leaked ” that information Prime minister Harper ’s chief of staff Ian Brodie , had initially implied the Clinton campaign not the Obama campaign :
The CTV story reportedly orginated from Harper ’s chief of staff Ian Brodie , who told reporters in Ottawa that Hillary Clinton ’s campaign assured Canadian officials they need not worry about her NAFTA rhetoric .
There ’s been no explanation for why the focus shifted to Obama in the CTV report that went to air .
It would be interesting to know how this shift in focus happened , indeed .
Moreover if she was for NAFTA as a First Lady , then shortly against it during the campaign , does n’t she have a much stronger motive to go and calm down the Canadians ?
It would be good to hear a definite statement on NAFTA by both candidates !

Obama Campaign Claims Clinton Has ' Character Gap '
In sharpest attack to date , Obama camp assails rival as untrustworthy .
March 21 , 2008  --
The campaign of Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , delivered one of its harshest , most negative attacks yet today , asserting that Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , is lacking in character and regularly misleads voters .
" She is not seen as trustworthy by the American people , " said Obama campaign manager David Plouffe in a conference call with reporters this morning , citing a Gallup poll released this week indicating that only 44 percent of the American people consider Clinton " honest and trustworthy , " as opposed to 67 percent for Sen.
John McCain , R - Ariz. , and 63 percent for Obama .
Plouffe said this perception would make it " next to impossible " for Clinton to win the general election .
" To head into a general election with over half the electorate not believing you are trustworthy is a serious problem , " Plouffe said .
" The American people will not elect a candidate that they do not see as trustworthy . "
Obama Camp Goes Negative
In the past the Obama campaign has raised these numbers to merely argue this would be a difficult hurdle for Clinton to clear , though it stopped short of blaming her for the perception she 's not trustworthy .
Not today .
Today , the Obama campaign blamed Clinton for what Gallup called a " perceived honesty gap " and Plouffe called a " character gap . "
Greg Craig , a former White House attorney under President Clinton who serves as a senior adviser to the Obama campaign , added that Clinton 's newly released schedules from her days as first lady did not support her claims of foreign policy experience .
" Her access was very limited and her trips abroad were largely ceremonial , " Craig said .
" She says she is ready to be commander in chief based on claims that are not supported by reality . "
Plouffe said Clinton is " consistently engaged in political calculation to mislead voters " and laid out a case that Clinton is a liar ( though he never used the L word so forbidden in politics . )
He cited Clinton 's claim that she was always opposed to North American Free Trade Agreement while those recently released White House schedules indicate she had repeated meetings to push the treaty toward final congressional passage .
" Sen. Clinton misled the voters of Ohio , " he said , arguing that Clinton had been duplicitous and double - dealing when it came to claims that she had helped pass the Family and Medical Leave Act , in her push for revotes in Michigan and Florida , and in her claims that her campaign is not promoting the story about Obama 's relationship with the controversial Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
Casting Character Doubts
The campaign manager also mentioned a recent " 60 Minutes " interview in which Clinton said Obama was n't a Muslim " as far as I know . "
" She has shared prayer breakfasts with Sen . Obama and knows without a shadow of a doubt that he is a Christian , " Plouffe said .
" These kinds of evasions and misleading of voters causes a real ' character gap . ' "
For its part , the Clinton campaign released a campaign memo calling Obama " desperate to change the subject , " and accusing his campaign of reckless tactics .
" It 's not a pretty sight -- it 's all part of a pattern of just words , " said the Clinton memo , saying Obama " calls for high - minded debates while practicing lowdown politics . "
" It 's no surprise that Americans are expressing serious doubts about his ability to answer the 3 a.m. call , " concluded the Clinton campaign memo .
In light of accusations from the Clinton campaign that there is still much unknown about Obama , Plouffe said , " If Sen .
Clinton wants to have a conversation about electability and vetting , we 're happy to have it .
…
The central assertions in her candidacy have proven to be false . "
Assailing the Clintons ' refusal so far to release any recent tax returns or the names of donors to the William J. Clinton Presidential Library , Plouffe asked , " What are the Clintons scared of ?
Why wo n't they release this information ? …
What 's lurking there ? "

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - Democrat Hillary Clinton pressed on Wednesday for a new vote in Michigan that could be crucial to her aspirations in the tight battle with Barack Obama to be the party ’s presidential nominee in November .

“ I am here for one simple reason : to make sure Michigan ’s votes are counted and your voices are heard in this election , ” the New York senator said in a hastily arranged visit to the state .
Democratic nominating contests in Michigan and Florida in January were invalidated by the national party because both states violated party rules .
Both states were denied delegates to the August party convention that picks the nominee .
Clinton , a former first lady , won both contests and needs the delegates in those states if she hopes to overcome the lead Obama has built up .
Clinton urged rival Obama , a senator from Illinois , to give his backing to a proposal that would allow the state to hold a new Democratic contest in Michigan .
“ Senator Obama speaks passionately on the campaign trail about empowering the American people .
Today I am urging him to match those words with actions , ” she said .
“ We need to either count the votes that have already been cast in Michigan and Florida or have new full and fair elections so that we can have your voices and your votes counted , ” she said to applause .

Michigan Democratic
Party leaders said on Tuesday a proposal to hold additional primary voting in June was stalled and unlikely to be approved before a deadline this week .
Opposition from lawmakers backing Obama ’s campaign seemed certain to scuttle any proposal .
Michigan and Florida were stripped of a combined 366 delegates to the nominating convention after violating party rules that barred early nominating contests .
Those delegates could become pivotal with the likelihood neither candidate will reach the 2,024 delegates needed to clinch the nomination .
Florida Democrats have abandoned efforts to vote again but Clinton supporters still hope to have a new vote in Michigan .
Many Democrats fear that snubbing Michigan delegates at the convention could make it difficult for the party to win the state in November .
After Clinton ’s speech former Michigan Gov. Jim Blanchard , co-chair of her campaign in the state , said she had made a convincing argument for a new vote and Obama “ needs to realize that it will be hard to campaign in Michigan if a fresh vote is not held . ”
Robert Ficano , chief executive of Wayne County , and an uncommitted Democratic superdelegate , said the two sides need to find a compromise solution .
But Dennis Denno , spokesman for Michigan state Sen. Buzz Thomas , an Obama supporter , said Clinton ’s speech had not altered the situation .
“ Nobody can get past the hurdles and concerns out there over holding a fresh vote , ” he said .
An attorney for the Obama campaign , Robert Bauer , released a memo on Wednesday raising questions about constitutional and other legal hurdles , ranging from treatment of voters abroad and a lack of time to prepare a new election .
Critics of a new vote have also expressed concern over a rule that would bar independents and Democrats who voted in the January Republican primary from voting in the rerun contest .

I 've been playing with code for exact real arithmetic .
Unfortunately I 've been too busy to get it polished but I do have time to mention two interesting and counterintuitive facts about real arithmetic on computers .
It 's also a good opportunity to say a tiny bit more about exhaustive search Firstly , what does exact real arithmetic mean ?
It 's a widely held belief that computers ( at least idealised Turing machines with as much memory as you need ) can't represent real numbers precisely .
This is a myth .
For example , a common way to represent real numbers is as lists of binary digits .
Any programming language that supports the notion of an infinite stream , like Haskell , can therefore represent an infinite stream of digits .
If you 're unhappy with the notion of an infinite stream , think functionally instead .
Define a stream to be a function that takes as argument an integer n and returns the nth element .
For examplecan be interpreted as exactly representing the real number 1/3=0.010101 ...
This is a perfectly well defined object that sits in a finite amount of memory .
So we do n't need infinite computers to represent real numbers as sequences of binary digits .
( Though you may notice that we can't represent all real numbers , for example Chaitin 's much overrated constant .)
Exact real arithmetic is simply arithmetic with real numbers represented with some representation like this .
So now I 'm ready to mention the first counterintuitive result .
If we represent real numbers as streams of binary digits like above ( maybe stored with an exponent or a separate integer part ) then The argument is straightforward .
Suppose our addition function receives these two inputs : 0.000000 ... and 0.01111111 ...
What should it output as the first digit after the " binary " point ?
If the first stream continues as repeating zeroes forever , and the second stream eventually turns into an infinite stream of zeroes , then this digit should be 0 .
But if both streams eventually turn into infinite streams of ones , then this digit should be 1 , as a result of the carry that will happen .
But there 's no way an addition function can know what will eventually happen to these streams .
In order to compute the first digit of the result , it needs to see all of the digits of the inputs .
But no computable function can view all of the input digits .
And hence addition is impossible to implement .
But that 's no reason to give up .
The problem is n't fundamental to exact real arithmetic , it 's an issue with the representation being used .
So what representation should we be using ?
One place to look is at how mathematicians define the real numbers .
A popular approach is via the Cauchy sequence .
A real number can be defined as a sequence of rational numbers a , a , a ... with the property that for any ε , there is a point in the sequence beyond which the difference between any two elements is less than ε .
For example the sequence 3,31/10,314/100,3141/1000 , ... might represent π.
So we might try to copy this and represent real numbers as streams of rationals .
In a way it works .
The resulting type will have all the properties of real numbers that you know and love .
But unfortunately it's not a very useful representation because you can't answer even the most basic queries about real numbers with it .
For example , there 's no way of extracting a rational approximation with given accuracy from such a sequence .
You know that given any accuracy , if you walk down the sequence far enough you 'll find a suitable rational , but you do n't know how far down the sequence to walk .
So we need to modify this representation so that not only is each term in the sequence an approximation to the desired real , but that there is a way of finding approximations to a desired accuracy .
One simple way is this : choose the rational numbers in the sequence so that the nth rational is within 2 of our desired real .
When I say ' Cauchy sequence ' below I 'll mean a sequence with a constraint like this .
Note that this representation is highly non-unique .
There are many sequences that could be used to represent any real number .
But this is n't a problem .
Even the standard decimal representation is non-unique because 1 and 0.999 ... recurring both represent the same real .
This means we can write functions on our real representation that depend on the specific sequence we 've chosen to represent a real number and hence can't be interpreted as functions of the real numbers .
( Eg. consider the trivial function that just returns the first element of he sequence . )
But it 's still possible to write functions are well - defined in the sense that if two different representations of the same real are passed in as inputs , then the returned sequences represent the same real , even though the actual sequences may be different .
For example , we can write a function to halve a real number simply by halving all of the rationals in the Cauchy sequence .
Exercise : give a well - defined implementation of addition using this representation .
( Hint : It 's a short one - liner in Haskell , but it 's not completely trivial . )
Now I can state the second counterintuitive result :
Before proving that , I want to say something more about exhaustive search over streams .
You may remember that I rewrote the key proof using more elementary language because the original work was phrased in the language of topology .
Explaining that properly would require me to set up quite a bit of mathematical machinery .
However , I can give a hint as to why topology is connected to the computability of certain functions .
The key reason is this : by and large , Topology is the study of continuous functions .
Consider Cauchy 's definition of continuity .
The function f is continuous at x if for all ε , there exists a δ such that whenever |y - x|total functions for streams .
So the condition that f be continuous is more or less the condition for f to continue to be productive .
And that means we can talk about the computability of such functions in terms of continuity and use the language of topology to talk about computability .
I find this quite amazing .
Cauchy 's centuries old definition of continuity contains within it the seeds you need to define the notion of computability for codata .
( One cool thing about this is that topology has a concept called compactness .
Compact spaces share many properties with finite sets .
In particular , the interval [ 0,1 ] ={x |0≤x ≤1} is compact .
And that suggests that maybe it can be searched in a finite time .
That suggestion is correct and is the reason why it 's possible to exhaustively search the infinite space of streams in finite time . )
I wish I could give some references for further reading on this but I pulled it together from little clues scattered over many papers and presentations on the web .
If someone knows the canonical reference on computability and topology , maybe they could post it in the comments .
Update : Do n't miss this excellent post by Andrej Bauer .
Would n’t it be nice if the Supreme Court cared a little more about corporate responsibility and average Americans instead of the stress of corporate execs who are making a few hundred million dollars ?
Sheesh .
The best democracy money can buy .
Exxon Mobil , the giant oil corporation appearing before the Supreme Court yesterday , had earned a profit of nearly $ 40 billion in 2006 , the largest ever reported by a U.S. company — but that ’s not what bothered Roberts .
What bothered the chief justice was that Exxon was being ordered to pay $ 2.5 billion — roughly three weeks ’ worth of profits — for destroying a long swath of the Alaska coastline in the largest oil spill in American history .
“ So what can a corporation do to protect itself against punitive - damages awards such as this ? ”
Roberts asked in court .
The lawyer arguing for the Alaska fishermen affected by the spill , Jeffrey Fisher , had an idea .
“ Well , ” he said , “ it can hire fit and competent people . ”
The rare sound of laughter rippled through the august chamber .
The chief justice did not look amused .
I could n’t come up with anything worthwhile to post today , so I will just amuse you with 3 cats in 3 boxes .

The following post closely resembles outright hackery .
Rest assured , it is very sincere and heartfelt hackery .
The special election to replace the late Tom Lantos is only a few weeks away , and it looks as though former State Senator Jackie Speier has the race sewn up .
But a group of free culture enthusiasts , led by Harvard 's John Palfrey , are working to persuade Lawrence Lessig to run for the seat .
Lessig , a law professor at Stanford , the leading light of the free culture movement , and now a scholar focused on corruption and the fate of democracy , has a highly unusual pedigree .
As a kid , he was a teenage Reaganite and hardcore libertarian .
Though he later drifted to the left , Lessig 's leftism ( leftishm ? ) reflects a Millian sensibility that informs his thinking about the uses and abuses of government and corporate power .
More encouraging still , he clerked for Richard Posner and Antonin Scalia .
His worldview derives from a serious and lasting engagement with conservative ideas .
This accounts in part for his decidedly unconventional tack in Eldred v. Ashcroft , in which he made an originalist case against the scandalous Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 .
After losing the case , Lessig offered an insightful mea culpa that 's well worth your time .
The image that will always stick in my head comes from an editorial that ran in The New York Times .
While the reaction to the Sonny Bono
Act itself was almost unanimously negative , the reaction to the court 's decision was mixed .
The press coverage that attacked the decision did so because it left standing a silly and harmful law .
That " grand experiment " that we call " the public domain " is over , the paper said .
When I can make light of it , I think , " Honey , I shrunk the Constitution . "
But I can rarely make light of it .
We had in our Constitution a commitment to free culture .
In the case that I fathered , the Supreme Court effectively renounced that commitment .
A better lawyer would have made them see differently .
Call him a crazed egomanic , but there 's something really remarkable about the way Lessig takes a manifest failure of our constitutional system personally .
He 's not in public life because he was charming and popular in high school , or to find some lobbying sinecure or because he is convinced the other side constitutes an American Taliban that must be shamed and then destroyed .
Rather , Lessig is most concerned with preserving the immune system , the organic intellectual defenses , of a free and open society , something conservatives and liberals alike ought to care about very much .
Of course there are many avenues through which to effect political change , perhaps the most important of which is raising awareness of the issues at stake .
Lessig has brilliantly pursued that course .
In leaving behind questions surrounding copyright , though , he 's recognized that there are deeper problems with the body politic , and deeper questions concerning the vitality and indeed the viability of representative democracy in a society like our own .
The time may now have come for Lessig to bring his considerable rhetorical skills and intellectual prowess to the legislative branch .
Dying is not always good for your citations :
The information content of academic citations is subject to debate .
This paper views premature death as a tragic " natural experiment , " outlining a methodology identifying the " citation death tax " — the impact of death of productive economists on the patterns of their citations .
We rely on a sample of 428 papers written by 16 well known economists who died well before retirement , during the period of 1975 - 97 .
The news is mixed : for half of the sample , we identify a large and significant " citation death tax " for the average paper written by these scholars .
For these authors , the estimated average missing citations per paper attributed to premature death ranges from 40 % to 140 % ( the overall average is about 90 % ) , and the annual costs of lost citations per paper are in the range 3 % and 14 % .
Hence , a paper written ten years before the author ’s death avoids a citation cost that varies between 30 % and 140 % .
For the other half of the sample , there is no citation death tax ; and for two Nobel Prize - caliber scholars in this second group , Black and Tversky , citations took off overtime , reflecting the growing recognitions of their seminal works .

From the big - time Arrested Development fans at E ! and “ Page Six ” ( who knew ? ) comes word that Jason Bateman and Jeffrey Tambor have been contacted , by either Mitchell Hurwitz or Ron Howard , about possibly appearing in an Arrested Development movie .
One imagines such a film could be helped through development by former AD cast member Michael Cera ’s prominence in Oscar - nominated moneymaker Juno ( not to mention a certain critically acclaimed box - office smash that makes There Will Be Blood look like Meet the Spartans ) .
Could this exciting news just be the setup for a financially disastrous , casual - viewer - alienating excursion into a world of obscure tropes that can only be fully understood by those who ’ve watched all three seasons of Arrested Development multiple times ?
Good God , we hope so !
After the jump , our list of the ten inside jokes we hope most to see carried over in an Arrested Development film — presented , of course , without explanation .

A number of media outlets have picked up on John McCain ’s embrace of fringe televangelist John Hagee , although ( thanks in part to the Catholic League ’s efforts ) the focus has been on Hagee ’s anti-Catholic sentiment rather than the pastor ’s far - right political views or his obsession that Israel must be defeated by a Russian - Arab military alliance , perhaps preceded by a U.S. invasion of Iran , in order to usher in Armageddon and the second coming of Jesus .
But few have paid attention to the other far - right televangelist McCain embraced last week , Rod Parsley .
You wo n’t hear Parsley rail against Catholics , but you will hear him rail against gays , abortion , Islam , judges , and People For the American Way .
And in Ohio , he has built a political machine of partisan “ Patriot Pastors ” who will turn their churches into get - out - the - vote campaigns .
Someday , around a year from now , one of your friends is going to say to you , “ Let ’s go to the High Line . ”
Now , this person might be talking about the High Line park , the well - publicized ribbon of greenery that ’s being constructed on an abandoned elevated rail line in far west Chelsea , running north from Gansevoort all the way to 34th Street .
Or your friend might be referring to the High Line neighborhood : the new skyline of glittering retail spaces and restaurants and condos , designed by brand - name architects like Frank Gehry and Jean Nouvel and Robert A.M. Stern , with names like the High Line Building and High Line 519 and HL23 .
Or your friend might mean the High Line Terrace and Lounge in the new condo tower at 245 Tenth , which promises prospective residents views over the High Line , along with “ polished cervaiole marble floors . ”
Or maybe your friend wants to go to the Highline Thai restaurant on Washington Street , or the High Line Ballroom , a recently opened concert venue , which , starting May 9 , will be part of the High Line Festival , an event curated by David Bowie and showcasing such snazzy right - now artists as Ricky Gervais and Arcade Fire .
Granted , a few of these events will be barely within yodeling distance of the High Line — you know , the railroad — but no matter :
Two of the festival ’s producers , Josh Wood and
David Binder , chose the name less for a proximity to the High Line than for their philosophical alignment with the park .
“ The High Line is very much about aesthetics and design , ” says Binder .
“ We ’re trying to be as well . ”
“ Everyone in New York City has been so supportive of the High Line , ” says Wood .
“ It ’s probably the one public - works project that no one has anything bad to say about . ”
Given all this activity , it ’s probable that , like most New Yorkers , you ’ve already heard of the High Line .
It ’s also probable that , like most New Yorkers , you ’re only vaguely aware of what exactly it ’s going to be .
Maybe the last time you thought about it was in 2003 , when Friends of the High Line — the nonprofit group that ’s been fighting doggedly to save it for the past eight years — held an open design competition for creative suggestions as to its ultimate fate .
The results were exhibited at Grand Central Terminal , and submissions ranged from a permanent nature preserve to a roller coaster .
One of the winning entries was a 22 - block - long elevated swimming pool .
So here ’s an update .
First , the short version : The High Line is a brand - new park .
In the sky .
Now , the longer , slightly more complicated version : The High Line is , according to its converts ( and they are legion ) , the happily - ever - after at the end of an urban fairy tale .
It ’s a “ flying carpet , ” “ our generation ’s Central Park , ” something akin to “ Alice in Wonderland … through the keyhole and you ’re in a magical place . ”
It ’s also the end - product of a perfect confluence of powerful forces : radical dreaming , dogged optimism , neighborhood anxiety , design mania , real - estate opportunism , money , celebrity , and power .
In other words , it ’s a 1.45 - mile , 6.7 - square - acre , 30 - foot - high symbol of exactly what it means to be living in New York right now .
But first , let ’s start with the park .
If New York were in the practice of erecting statues to living people , you could make a good case that Joshua David and Robert Hammond should be cast in bronze tomorrow .
You can almost picture their monument , too — perhaps the two of them smiling , arm in arm , hard hats on their heads — which you could unveil next spring at the projected opening of the High Line park .
Or , instead , you could place that statue in the lobby of Craftsteak , the cavernous , warmly lit restaurant at the corner of Tenth Avenue and 15th Street , where I met Hammond and David for dinner on a recent rainy April night .
Walking along 15th toward Craftsteak , you ’ll find as good a tour of the new Manhattan , pressed up shoulder to shoulder with the old one , as you ’re likely to find .
In one block I passed an auto - repair shop ( “ Foreign and Domestic ” ) , the display windows of Jeffrey department store , a car wash right under the High Line , and a jam - packed opening at Milk Gallery , where well - dressed art - world attendees were lit up sporadically by the pop of flashbulbs .
On Tenth , Escalades and limos sat idling with their blinkers on , outside Morimoto , or Del Posto , or Craftsteak , the massive restaurants drawing diners to their tastefully humble façades .
As it happens ( and this story has a lot of “ as it happens ” moments ) , Hammond , who is a part - time painter , has three of his works hanging in Craftsteak , and a huge painting by Stephen Hannock of the High Line , as seen from a nearby rooftop , is displayed in the restaurant ’s main dining room .
“ We took him up on the building to help him get that vantage point , ” says Hammond .
“ And we used an old photo taken from the same place in the thirties as a reference .
It ’s amazing that , besides the Gehry building ” — which is visible in the painting as a skeletal shell full of lights , mid-construction — “ how little in the neighborhood has changed . ”
Over the years , there have been other efforts to reimagine the High Line as a public space — as early as 1981 , the architect Steven Holl proposed a project preserving the railbed , which he praised as “ a suspended green valley in the Manhattan Alps ” — but these were all lost in legal wrangling or dismissed as the idle noodlings of urban fantasists .
Where Hammond and David have been successful , though , is in assembling a glamorous coalition of tastemakers , the right people at the right time , and convincing them that a neighborhood green space could be a win - win for everyone involved .
From the beginning , they presented the High Line as a kind of industrial - chic anchor , a sculpture in the sky , in a blossoming arts district .
Their save –the–High Line effort , which at first glance seemed impossible , now , in hindsight , seems inevitable , given how the High Line can appeal both to people ’s rediscovered nostalgia for the city ’s iron - age past and to that tingling , money - flushed excitement for tomorrow , in which every inch of Manhattan will be reclaimed and converted into an impeccably designed playground .
Together , the pair is unfailingly gracious and quick to deflect praise .
They refuse to even really acknowledge what is essentially their victory lap .
They share a bemused ambivalence toward all the profiteers now benefiting from the High Line ’s prestige .
Early on , they looked into trademarking the name “ High Line , ” but found they could n’t , any more than you could trademark “ Central Park . ”
Besides , they say , eight years ago , an overabundance of enthusiasm for the idea of the High Line was the least of their problems .
David recalls an early City Council meeting they attended , along with socialite Amanda Burden , where their pie-eyed plan was so roundly ridiculed that , he says , “ You really did feel like you were getting pissed on . ”
Then Burden rose to speak .
“ She rallied the most incredible response about how great it is that there are still dreamers in New York , ” says David .
“ Since when is dreamers a dirty word ? ” says Hammond .
It ’s easy to see how , with their combined strengths , they went from stuffing envelopes in an apartment in Chelsea in 1999 to attending a groundbreaking ceremony in 2006 at which every politician within a hundred - mile radius —
Hillary , Schumer , Nadler , Bloomberg — crowded the podium , smiling for the photo op .
Hammond , who ’s 37 , used to work as a marketing and Internet consultant , and he pairs an artist ’s eye with a salesman ’s vigor for cold - calling contacts .
David , who ’s 43 , is a former freelance journalist with a specialty in urban design , which came in handy while writing the High Line literature and eloquently articulating the group ’s goals .
They also share a strong interest in aesthetics .
When I call them one day at their office and ask what they ’re up to , David says , “ We ’re arguing about fonts . ”
As it happens , Hammond and David met by accident , when they sat next to each other at a community - board meeting about the High Line in 1999 .
Both of them had hoped to connect with whatever Save the High Line movement was already organizing , only to discover that no such movement existed .
After the meeting , they started talking and decided to form a group themselves .
“ Of course , ” says David , “ we did n’t realize we were stepping into a fight that had been in the courts since the early eighties . ”
See , the High Line was built in the thirties to service the warehouses along the West Side .
It replaced a Tenth Avenue train track that ran down the middle of the street and , with distressing frequency , ran down pedestrians .
( The street was nicknamed Death Avenue . )
No sooner was the High Line built , however , than train traffic slowed to a trickle , thanks to a double whammy of the Depression and the popularity of truck transport .
The last train ran on the High Line in 1980 , at which point it was more or less abandoned : a typical shard of industrial blight , left to rust and grow wild with weeds .
Conrail , the railroad that owned the High Line , wanted it gone .
A consortium of local property owners , led by one of the area ’s largest interests , Edison Parking , a company run by Jerry Gottesman , wanted it gone .
The city wanted it gone .
And the only reason it is n’t gone is that , essentially , no one wanted to pay to take it down .
And so the High Line languished , untouched and off - limits , while legal battles over its fate smoldered for the better part of twenty years .
Which brings us to 1999 , when Hammond and David met and formed Friends of the High Line .
From the beginning , they knew they needed to invest their cause with a certain intangible downtown sexiness , to excite potential donors about the possibilities for this long - neglected piece of industrial detritus .
They enlisted Paula Sher , a partner at the graphics firm Pentagram , to design a logo and a look for their literature .
Then Hammond started hounding every notable and / or powerful person he could think of : gallerists like Paula Cooper and Matthew Marks , architects like Richard Meier , and the well - connected like Amanda Burden , who had a seat on the City Planning Commission .
These efforts , of course , pleased no one who ’d been entangled in the long battle to topple the High Line , least of all Gottesman , who was eager to build a FedEx depot on his property at Tenth and 18th .
By this point , Mayor Giuliani had thrown his support behind the drive to demolish the railway .
To prevent that , Hammond and David decided to sue .
They needed $ 60,000 in up - front legal fees , so the Friends of the High Line held its first fund - raiser , in December 2000 , at the Lucas Schoorman gallery in Chelsea .
They sent out fliers , one of which ended up in the hands of Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick , who actually showed up at the party .
As David remembers it , a newspaper also covered the event — and framed it the next day as a celebrity push to stop FedEx .

“ They totally got it wrong , ” says Hammond .
“ But it was instant branding , ” says David .
“ Just by luck , we were celebrity darlings . ”
Gottesman , by the way , never did get to build that FedEx depot .
That parcel is now destined to house a 35 - to - 40 - story complex , developed by Edison Properties and to be designed , at last report , by Robert A.M. Stern .
Nearly everyone involved in the Save the High Line effort — from Gifford Miller to Amanda Burden to Edward Norton to Diane Von Furstenberg — will tell you about their hallelujah moment .
The idea of a park on a railbed in the sky can be a little hard to get your head around , especially if your only vantage point is looking up from street level at its rusted , pigeon - shit - scarred underbelly .
“ But the moment Robert got me up there , I fell in love with it , ” says Miller .
“ You ’re in the clouds , as it were — on the level of the Jetsons . ”
I first truly understood this phenomenon when I ducked through a hobbit - size door in the backside of a Tenth Avenue warehouse — and stepped directly out onto the High Line , between 25th and 26th Streets .
Here , the railbed stretches off in both directions , resembling a lush , weedy boulevard unspooling over the city streets .
I was accompanied at the time by Douglas Oliver , who owns the Williams Warehouse , along with a silent partner .
A trim man in his early sixties , with curly , salt - and - pepper hair , Oliver was wearing a collarless black peacoat and a black - and - white ascot .
Currently , his warehouse is used to store sets for soap operas ; as we walked among the stashed sofas and upended , ornate lamps , he shouted to his superintendent , “ Hey , Felix , where ’s my favorite coffin ? ”
Then we all stooped through the door he punched in his back wall three years ago , and boom , there we were , on the High Line — a moment that felt like stepping through the back of the wardrobe , out into Narnia .
The High Line has always been closed to the public , so from the beginning , Hammond and David understood that — fancy brochures and professionally produced videos aside — they had to find a way to bottle and sell this hallelujah moment .
A friend recommended they contact the photographer Joel Sternfeld , who had shot ruins in Rome .
They invited him up for a visit .
Sternfeld remembers his own High Line epiphany .
“ Suddenly , it ’s green !
It ’s a railroad !
It ’s rural !
Where am I ? ” he says .
As he stood out on the railbed , mouth agape , Hammond whispered to him , “ Joel , we need the money shot . ”
Sternfeld worked on the project for a full year .
“ I could go up there anytime I wanted , ” he says .
“ That was one of the greatest gifts of my life .
I had my own private park . ”
On one afternoon , in 2001 , he invited The New Yorker ’s Adam Gopnik to tag along , and Gopnik subsequently rhapsodized about the structure in a florid essay .
“ The High Line does not offer a God ’s - eye view of the city , exactly , ” he wrote , “ but something rarer , the view of a lesser angel : of a Cupid in a Renaissance painting , of the putti looking down on the Nativity manger . ”
As it happens , Edward Norton , the actor , whose grandfather was a visionary developer who helped save Boston ’s Faneuil Hall , read Gopnik ’s paean , and decided he should lend his name and support to the Friends of the High Line effort .
He phoned them up and , later , became a public face for the group , appearing on Charlie Rose and speaking at events .
“ He ’d say , ‘ Look , there are a lot of people who want your money , ’ ” Hammond recalls .
“ ‘ There are a lot of causes out there doing more important things — saving lives or educating kids . ’
Then he summed it up in a way I always liked : ‘ This is about optimism .
This is about New York reinventing itself . ’ ”
Now , standing on the landing of Oliver ’s bricked - over loading bays six years later , you can hear the construction crews ten blocks south — that familiar sound of New York reinventing itself .
The initial phase of the new park stops at 20th Street ; Phase 2 , from 20th to 30th Streets , likely wo n’t be done until 2009 .
Still , for Oliver , it ’s not hard to envision the future .
“ I ’m seeing a restaurant , maybe a gallery , ” he says , then , gesturing to the loading bays , “ All this could become glass . ”
He and his partner bought the building in 1978 , for $ 75,000 cash down .
Now he fields constant calls about selling .
He ’s been offered well over $ 100 million , but figures it ’s probably worth more .
He ’s heard the building at Tenth and 15th that houses Craftsteak and Del Posto just sold for $ 150 million .
Faith Hope Consolo , a retail specialist for Douglas Elliman , foresees a 12 to 15 percent rise in prices all across the neighborhood : retail , commercial , residential .
Even modest properties are benefiting .
A nearby space on West 21st , nestled literally right under the High Line , is currently up for rent .
The broker also imagines a restaurant , a gallery .
“ It ’s a really unique space , ” he says .
Ten years ago , he leased it to the auto - body shop for $ 20,000 a month .
Now he ’s asking $ 70,000 a month .
Oliver does n’t envision selling , however — he ’d rather partner with a gallerist or a restaurateur , do something “ in the spirit of the High Line . ”
He recently spent $ 2 million to upgrade the building ’s façade .
Now he ’d like to stick around to enjoy his good fortune .
“ These days around here , you see women in fur coats buying million - dollar paintings , ” he says .
“ When I bought this place , the women in fur coats around here were usually men . ”
He was an early supporter of the Friends of the High Line , making what he describes as a “ substantial ” donation .
“ A lot of good ’s come out of the High Line , ” he says .
“ This is a gold mine .
The landlords should be thanking them . ”
In fact , even before the city announced , in June 2005 , that it had approved the rezoning plan that would preserve the High Line and allow for new construction projects all along its length , savvy real - estate speculators had grasped the potential of a “ High Line ” neighborhood .
The developer Alf Naman , who ’d been circling the area since the mid-nineties , bought up about a half - dozen properties .
“ I saw what happened in Tribeca , ” he says , “ and I did n’t want to miss out here . ”
He ’s now developing three properties , including a hotel that will look out directly on the High Line and a condo tower by architect Jean Nouvel at 100 Eleventh Avenue , with a bistro - style restaurant on the main floor .
( Danny Meyer is rumored to be the eventual tenant . )
André Balazs , the hotel impresario , who was also an early donor to Friends of the High Line , purchased two plots of land on either side of the track , near 14th Street , where he ’s building a Standard Hotel .
“ We started construction before it was even clear who owned the High Line , ” he says — a gamble that he says now is “ looking brilliant . ”
His hotel will literally straddle the High Line , and in his ideal vision , Balazs will offer his guests direct access through a stairway from the hotel to the park — though the details of who can or ca n’t build entrances to the High Line , and what exactly those entrances might look like , and whether you can put patio chairs or café tables out on the High Line grounds , are all still being hashed out with the city .
But Balazs is confident he ’ll get his staircase .
“ This is going to happen , ” he says .
Farther north , the architects Della Valle Bernheimer are building two new projects , one on 459 West 18th and one at 245 Tenth Avenue , and Jared Della Valle is still looking for other opportunities .
“ But there ’s been a frenzy in the neighborhood , ” he says , “ to the point that properties are trading at a rate that does n’t make any sense . ”
Some mid-block parcels are still coming on the market , as leases run out or reluctant sellers are swayed by the arrival of the money truck .
“ But the majority of the A locations ” — meaning ones right on the High Line — “ have already traded hands . ”
He mentions the one crown jewel that ’s still available — a huge lot at 18th and Tenth Avenue , right next to Gehry ’s building .
“ We put an offer on that , ” he says , “ but we dropped out when prices went through the roof . ”
Prices in the neighborhood have gone up 30 percent in the last year , and are now among the highest in the city , with some lots going for over $ 500 a developable square foot .
I ask Della Valle how those numbers compare with other Manhattan neighborhoods .
He pauses .
“ There ’s not much out there .
You ’re talking Central Park West . ”
For developers , investing at those prices , he says , is “ like Russian roulette , except there are four bullets in the gun instead of one . ”
Of course , far West Chelsea , with its mix of low - income housing and hot - spot restaurants and galleries and supersize clubs , has long been a neighborhood in transition .
But the arrival of the High Line — it ’s a park !
In the sky !— offers developers a glamorous , one - of - a- kind amenity to pitch to millionaire buyers .
Balazs , for one , is confident he ’ll recoup his investment , but he ’s not so sure about those who got there after him .
“ There are parts of the High Line that have charm , and other parts where it ’s really nothing more than a piece of steel running through a piece of property , ” he says .
“ But the mere phrase High Line is now a buzzy phrase .
So I think you ’re going to find all sorts of worthless developments going up , where people will happily tag the name ‘ High Line ’ to their project , hoping to give an otherwise lackluster project some sizzle . ”
There are three central ironies to the story of the High Line .
The first is that , for twenty years , local property owners were the main opponents to the park - conversion plan .
At the height of his battle with Friends of the High Line , Edison ’s Gottesman launched a propaganda campaign .
“ They had one flyer that said , ‘ Money does n’t grow on trees , and last we checked , it is n’t growing in the weeds of the High Line , ’ ” says Hammond .
“ Now the irony is , money is growing in the weeds of the High Line — for them , and they ’re picking it . ”
The second irony is that , despite all the good vibes and upbeat statements from politicians at every level of the food chain , the stretch of the High Line that runs from 30th to 34th Street , fully 30 percent of its total length , is still in danger of demolition .
Its fate is more or less in the hands of the MTA , which owns the Hudson Rail Yards .
The MTA wants to sell its land for maximum profit and , by all indications , is not planning to make preservation of the High Line a condition of the sale .
The last irony is that the rest of the High Line — the one that Sternfeld photographed , the one that sparks that reliable hallelujah moment in the hearts of one goggle - eyed visitor after another — is n’t being saved at all .
In fact , it was doomed from the start .
Hammond and David knew that , in order to rally initial support , they had to convince people that the High Line was worth preserving in the first place , and they did so with Sternfeld ’s bucolic images of an untouched pasture in the sky .
But now the High Line , by necessity , is being stripped to its foundations .
The Friends of the High Line spent a long time trying to figure out if that original park could be preserved , but it just was n’t feasible .
“ That landscape existed because nobody could go up there , ” says David .
“ And to get people to go up there , you have to do something different . ”
The architects Diller Scofidio +
Renfro , who are designing the new park along with landscape architects Field Operations , initially submitted a plan using “ flyovers ” — basically , plankways that would sit over the existing High Line flora — but discovered there was too much industrial contamination on the site .
“ To let people go up there , ” says Ric Scofidio , “ we had to strip it . ”
So when the new park opens next year , it will offer visitors a very different , essentially artificial experience .
The park will ideally evoke the feel of the old , untouched High Line , which is now preserved only in Sternfeld ’s loving photographs .
Many of the same plants are being planted , some of the old rail track will be reused , and a concrete pathway will gently nudge visitors toward a similarly meandering experience as they travel from one end to the other .
As for the new buildings around the High Line , that ’s out of Scofidio ’s hands .
“ Right now , a lot of the buildings along the High Line have blank walls , because there ’s been no reason to open to the High Line , ” he says .
“ If those blank walls suddenly become filled with balconies and windows , that ’s going to change the atmosphere .
But that ’s going to happen .
You ca n’t avoid it . ”
Hammond and David are more upbeat about the flourishing neighborhood .
They react to concerns about all the radical changes with only a slight hint of weary defensiveness — like two researchers who ’ve spent ten years trying to crossbreed a unicorn , and now they have to endure complaints about all the hot - dog stands popping up around the unicorn ’s stable .
“ It ’s very important for me to understand everything that ’s happening here in the context of this much broader movement happening all over the city , ” says David .
“ It ’s just happening in a slightly different way here , because of the High Line . ”
I asked Sternfeld if , having spent a year documenting the High Line in his own private park , he now felt mournful about its passing .
He said , “ Yes , no question about it .
I feel really sad .
It was beautiful .
It was perfect .
It was authentic .
I wish everyone could have the experience that I had .
But you ca n’t have 14 million people on a ruin . ”
Since the High Line that you ’ll walk on a year from now is n’t going to feel like the High Line you could n’t walk on a year ago , let me try to lay out for you what your future hallelujah moment might feel like .
At the south end , near the meatpacking district , the Standard Hotel , with its maybe - or - maybe - not staircase , will rise , bowlegged , with its trademark upside - down signage , eighteen stories above the park .
There will be a satellite branch of the Whitney museum nearby .
From the street , you can ascend the stairs to the High Line park and head north along a pathway of interlocking concrete planks .
You can probably even bring a dog — as it stands , pets will be allowed on the High Line , but not bikes .
( “ The Hudson River Park is a fast park , ” says Scofidio .
“ We envision this as a slow park . ” )
In early designs for the park , slim and stylish visitors are illustrated wandering idly through the sculpted grounds , among such oddball imagined details as a cantilevered grandstand on which people are seated watching 2001 : A Space Odyssey .
( Those elements — the grandstand , a proposed “ water feature ” that would have featured an urban beach — have since been discarded . )
And as you walk , from time to time you ’ll stand above an intersection , where you can enjoy a unique , unbroken vista from one side of Manhattan to the other ; basically , the view you might get if you could stand in the middle of the road , not get run over , and be 30 feet tall .
As for the rest of the view , you can expect a veritable Disneyland of starchitecture , with ten new buildings currently rising and roughly fifteen more in development — some with access right to the High Line , some simply hugging its edge ; some scaled humbly to the surrounding historical blocks , some potentially as high as 40 stories , and some that are new buildings built on top of existing buildings , like crumpled crystal top hats .
One of the new towers , at 200 Eleventh Avenue , will offer “ en suite parking ” to tenants ( basically , an elevator that will take your car from street level and park it directly outside your apartment ) , pending community - board approval ; Madonna ’s rumored to be sniffing around .
Another planned tower will tilt over the High Line , stooping slightly at its midsection like a butler ushering you through a door .
And all of these buildings , as you pass them , will feature walls of condos and lounges and restaurants with windows full of people looking down from their sparkling new towers at the High Line , and you .
What you ’ll get , in other words , is a thoughtfully conceived , beautifully designed simulation of the former High Line — and what more , really , do we ask for in our city right now ?
Is n’t that what we want : that each new bistro that opens should give us the feeling of a cozy neighborhood joint , right down to the expertly battered wooden tables and exquisitely selected faucet knobs ?
And that each new clothing boutique that opens in the space where the dry cleaner ’s used to be — you know , the one driven out by rising rents — should retain that charming dry cleaner ’s signage , so you can be reconnected to the city ’s hardscrabble past even as you shop for a $ 300 blouse ?
And that each dazzling , glass - skinned condo tower , with the up - to - date amenities and Hudson views and en suite freaking parking , should be nestled in a charming , grit- chic neighborhood , full of old warehouses and reclaimed gallery spaces and retroactively trendy chunks of rusted urban blight ?
Is n’t that exactly what we ask New York to be right now ?
Think of all the big , less attractive developments —
Atlantic Yards , the Jets stadium , Moynihan Station , ground zero — that have foundered .
Yet the High Line went from impossible dream to construction in under ten years .
After 9/11 , Hammond and David thought they were sunk — who would care now about an abandoned railbed ?
But instead the possibilities of the High Line caught people ’s imagination and stirred their ardor more than ever — and why not ?
It ’s a tabula rasa , sturdy enough to absorb whatever idyllic vision of the city you endorse .
It ’s pastoral , yet futuristic !
It ’s exclusive in its aesthetics , yet accessible to everyone !
Do n’t get me wrong :
It ’s impossible not to cheer the efforts of two guys who started with few allies and spent eight years of their lives fighting for a brand - new park .
In the sky !
What a great idea !
Who does n’t love a park ?
And the High Line , as it existed , could not be expected to continue to run like a rusted bridge , untouched and unsullied , over the roiling crosscurrents of abundant money and development fever and relentless , transformative good taste — not in the New York we live in now , not in this city , where every parcel is coveted , every square inch monetized , even in the air .
In order to persuade all the property owners to sign over their rights , the Department of City Planning , led by Burden , used the tool of allowing the owners to transfer their development rights to surrounding properties .
Then they rezoned parts of West Chelsea to allow for new , larger developments .
This plan includes provisions that will , in theory , encourage the mid-block galleries on the cross blocks to stay , in the hope that the galleries wo n’t be run out by new stores and residences , the way they once were in Soho .
It ’s a good plan .
It even won an award .
As Faustian bargains go , it ’s pretty honorable , given that everyone — the preservationists , the developers , the neighbors , the weekend visitors — seems happy .
For the most part .
Well , almost everyone .
At Tenth and 18th , you ’ll find La Lunchonette restaurant , which has been open there for nineteen years .
By all rights , its owner , Melva Max , should be ecstatic about the High Line .
From her front window , she has a beautiful view of one of the most visible stretches of the track .
I point this out to her , but she ca n’t see it .
All she sees is the 30 - story condo tower she ’s heard is going to rise in the vacant lot right across the street .
“ People say to me , ‘ You ’re going to be so busy , the restaurant will be full of people all the time , ’ ” she says .
“ But I really do n’t think these will be the kind of people who are going to walk out of their fancy buildings to come over here and have an omelette . ”
Michael Sorkin , the architect and writer , who lives in Chelsea , is also in favor of the park .
Who does n’t love a park ?
“ It ’s going to be a great park , ” he says .
“ But if it proves to be another really big nail in the process of making Manhattan into the world ’s largest gated community , so be it .
Let it be remembered for that . ”
David hears those concerns and answers by pointing to Central Park : another entirely constructed landscape , buoyed by money but enjoyed by everyone .
The High Line , too , he says , will be a public space that just happens to be surrounded by some of the most expensive real estate in the world .
True — but unlike Central Park , the High Line is n’t big enough to allow you to ever truly escape that fact .
Everyone , from park visitors to nearby diners to condo dwellers to hotel guests , will be invited to enjoy the High Line , but each from their own side of the glass .
As it happens , the High Line arrives at the exact moment when the legacy of Robert Moses — the imperious former New York City parks commissioner who had his own visions for the city — is being rehabilitated , or at least exhumed .
Three separate museums this year mounted exhibits asking visitors to revisit his grandly imagined , and subsequently vilified , plans to remake New York into an expressway - laden megaplex , efficiently absorbing the daily swarms of auto - bound commuters .
The most notorious of these schemes is the one that never got built :
The Cross - Manhattan Expressway , an elevated highway that would have wiped out much of Soho and torn through the heart of Greenwich Village .
Jane Jacobs , the feisty , elfin champion of small - scale urbanism , opposed , and eventually defeated , Moses , and her theories on lively neighborhoods with bustling sidewalks , with dry cleaners and diners and greengrocers , have been entrenched as conventional wisdom ever since .
Whatever you think of Moses ’s legacy , there ’s one thing Moses and the High Line have in common .
We can look back now and see Moses ’s work as an artifact of its time ; a result , right or wrong , of his idea of the city , of what New York could , and should , become .
The High Line , too — by which I mean the park , the neighborhood , the festival , the ballroom , the lounge — will one day look to us like a monument to the time we live in now .
A time of great optimism for the city ’s future .
A time of essentially unfettered growth .
A time when a rusted railbed could beget a park , and a park could beget a millionaire ’s wonderland .
And a time when the city was , for many , never safer , never more prosperous , and never more likely to evoke an unshakable suspicion : that more and more , New York has become like a gorgeous antique that someone bought , refurbished , and restored , then offered back to you at a price you could n’t possibly afford .

1930s
Construction begins on the High Line elevated railway ; trains deliver freight to local warehouses until 1980 .
1980s
West Chelsea becomes notorious as a postindustrial wasteland , populated by body shops , truck yards , and transvestite prostitutes .
1984
Transportation consultant Peter Obletz buys the abandoned High Line for $ 10 — allowing Conrail to avoid $ 5 million in demolition costs .
The deal is later nullified .
1987
Dia Art Foundation moves to a warehouse in West Chelsea — and sparks an art - world migration that transforms the neighborhood .
1999
Chelsea residents Joshua David , left , and Robert Hammond meet at a community - board meeting and start Friends of the High Line .
2001
In his last days as mayor , Giuliani puts the demolition of the High Line in motion — but the plan is halted by a lawsuit brought by Friends of the High Line .
( They lose the case but win the war — by converting Bloomberg to their cause . )
2001
After reading a story about the High Line in The New Yorker , Edward Norton contacts Friends of the High Line , and becomes a public face for the group .

2003
Friends of the High Line hold an open call for ideas ; one of the winning entries is a 22 - block - long swimming pool .
2006
Construction begins on the first phase of the High Line park — the railbed , pictured here in a Joel Sternfeld photo , is stripped to make way for a new landscape .
2007
The High Line Festival debuts on May 9 , curated by David Bowie and featuring acts from Air to Ricky Gervais at venues as far - flung as Radio City Music Hall .

Karen volunteered in Ghana in a combination program of orphanage and HIV / Aids volunteering .
Karen , who has has a Bachelors degree in Sociology , wrote to us about her experiences :
“ First of all I want to thank you Scott so much for coordinating this trip !
It was one of the most incredible experience of my life .
I do n’t know how to put it all into words .
From the moment we stepped off the plane I felt comfortable and accepted .
Our Coordinator Elvis met us with a smiling face at the airport .
He was amazing — showing us around , introducing us to our host family , his family and friends .
Even though we were only there for two weeks we saw so much ( Accra , Cape Coast , Kakum , Monkey Sanctuary , Wli Falls ) — thanks to Elvis !
I ca n’t thank Cosmic Volunteers enough for all your support ! ”
Here is more of Karen ’s feedback on her volunteer programs in Ghana .
The Pretrip Guide
Since I have very limited experience traveling oversees I was quite nervous and afraid I would n’t know everything I would have to do to prepare myself .
Your pre-trip guide was a lifesaver !!
Local Coordinator
I do n’t know how to express how great Elvis was !
He is an amazing person and so helpful .. truly an inspiration .
He picked us up from the airport , gave us a tour of the city the next day ( he was our own personal tour guide the entire trip ) .
It felt more like family then anything .
Host Family
Our host mothers , Effie and Joyce ( we stayed with two families ) were amazing .
Both women were very friendly , hospitable and I felt like family to them .
Staying with a host family is truly a way to immerce yourself in the culture .
Sightseeing
We did so much site - seeing in such a little time !
We went to Cape Coast , Kakum , Wli Falls , HoHoe , a monkey sanctuary .
In Cape Coast we toured the Cape Coast Castle ..
We walked into the dark cellars were slaves were held .. that was really powerful .
HoHoe and Wli Falls were very beautiful .
Did volunteering abroad changed you in any way ?
Would you volunteer again ?
Absolutely .
It was ( and still is ) difficult coming back to the States after leaving Ghana .
In Ghana people have so little yet they are so happy ( so different from so many Americans ) .
Visiting Ghana has made me want to be a better person .
I understand that I do n’t need so many material possessions .. I now want to live a more simpler life .
I have worked in the human service field my entire life .
Before going to Ghana I was starting to feel burnt out at my job .
I was feeling frustrated by bureaucracy and what I felt to be lack of support and services for the people I serve ( I work with developmentally disabled individuals ) .
I now understand how fortunate and how many services we do have in the States and for that I am grateful and will not take anything for granted .

I have n't said much about metaethics - the nature of morality - because that has a forward dependency on a discussion of the Mind Projection Fallacy that I have n't gotten to yet .
I used to be very confused about metaethics .
After my confusion finally cleared up , I did a postmortem on my previous thoughts .
I found that my object - level moral reasoning had been valuable and my meta - level moral reasoning had been worse than useless .
And this appears to be a general syndrome - people do much better when discussing whether torture is good or bad than when they discuss the meaning of " good " and " bad " .
Thus , I deem it prudent to keep moral discussions on the object level wherever I possibly can .
Occasionally people object to any discussion of morality on the grounds that morality does n't exist , and in lieu of jumping over the forward dependency to explain that " exist " is not the right term to use here , I generally say , " But what do you do anyway ? " and take the discussion back down to the object level .
Paul Gowder , though , has pointed out that both the idea of choosing a googolplex dust specks in a googolplex eyes over 50 years of torture for one person , and the idea of " utilitarianism " , depend on " intuition " .
He says I 've argued that the two are not compatible , but charges me with failing to argue for the utilitarian intuitions that I appeal to .
Now " intuition " is not how I would describe the computations that underlie human morality and distinguish us , as moralists , from an ideal philosopher of perfect emptiness and / or a rock .
But I am okay with using the word " intuition " as a term of art , bearing in mind that " intuition " in this sense is not to be contrasted to reason , but is , rather , the cognitive building block out of which both long verbal arguments and fast perceptual arguments are constructed .
I see the project of morality as a project of renormalizing intuition .
We have intuitions about things that seem desirable or undesirable , intuitions about actions that are right or wrong , intuitions about how to resolve conflicting intuitions , intuitions about how to systematize specific intuitions into general principles .
Delete all the intuitions , and you are n't left with an ideal philosopher of perfect emptiness , you 're left with a rock .
Keep all your specific intuitions and refuse to build upon the reflective ones , and you are n't left with an ideal philosopher of perfect spontaneity and genuineness , you 're left with a grunting caveperson running in circles , due to cyclical preferences and similar inconsistencies .
" Intuition " , as a term of art , is not a curse word when it comes to morality - there is nothing else to argue from .
Even modus ponens is an " intuition " in this sense - it 's just that modus ponens still seems like a good idea after being formalized , reflected on , extrapolated out to see if it has sensible consequences , etcetera .
So that is " intuition " .
However , Gowder did not say what he meant by " utilitarianism " .
Does utilitarianism say ...
That right actions are strictly determined by good consequences ?
That praiseworthy actions depend on justifiable expectations of good consequences ?
That probabilities of consequences should normatively be discounted by their probability , so that a 50 % probability of something bad should weigh exactly half as much in our tradeoffs ?
That virtuous actions always correspond to maximizing expected utility under some utility function ?
That two harmful events are worse than one ?
That two independent occurrences of a harm ( not to the same person , not interacting with each other ) are exactly twice as bad as one ?
That for any two harms A and B , with A much worse than B , there exists some tiny probability such that gambling on this probability of A is preferable to a certainty of B ?
If you say that I advocate something , or that my argument depends on something , and that it is wrong , do please specify what this thingy is ... anyway , I accept 3 , 5 , 6 , and 7 , but not 4 ; I am not sure about the phrasing of 1 ; and 2 is true , I guess , but phrased in a rather solipsistic and selfish fashion : you should not worry about being praiseworthy .
Now , what are the " intuitions " upon which my " utilitarianism " depends ?
This is a deepish sort of topic , but I 'll take a quick stab at it .
First of all , it 's not just that someone presented me with a list of statements like those above , and I decided which ones sounded " intuitive " .
Among other things , if you try to violate " utilitarianism " , you run into paradoxes , contradictions , circular preferences , and other things that are n't symptoms of moral wrongness so much as moral incoherence .
After you think about moral problems for a while , and also find new truths about the world , and even discover disturbing facts about how you yourself work , you often end up with different moral opinions than when you started out .
This does not quite define moral progress , but it is how we experience moral progress .
As part of my experienced moral progress , I 've drawn a conceptual separation between questions of type
Where should we go ?
and questions of type How should we get there ?
( Could that be what Gowder means by saying I'm " utilitarian " ? )
The question of where a road goes - where it leads - you can answer by traveling the road and finding out .
If you have a false belief about where the road leads , this falsity can be destroyed by the truth in a very direct and straightforward manner .
When it comes to wanting to go to a particular place , this want is not entirely immune from the destructive powers of truth .
You could go there and find that you regret it afterward ( which does not define moral error , but is how we experience moral error ) .
But , even so , wanting to be in a particular place seems worth distinguishing from wanting to take a particular road to a particular place .
Our intuitions about where to go are arguable enough , but our intuitions about how to get there are frankly messed up .
After the two hundred and eighty - seventh research study showing that people will chop their own feet off if you frame the problem the wrong way , you start to distrust first impressions .
When you 've read enough research on scope insensitivity - people will pay only 28 % more to protect all 57 wilderness areas in Ontario than one area , people will pay the same amount to save 50,000 lives as 5,000 lives ... that sort of thing ...
Well , the worst case of scope insensitivity I 've ever heard of was described here by Slovic :
Other recent research shows similar results .
Two Israeli psychologists asked people to contribute to a costly life - saving treatment .
They could offer that contribution to a group of eight sick children , or to an individual child selected from the group .
The target amount needed to save the child ( or children ) was the same in both cases .
Contributions to individual group members far outweighed the contributions to the entire group .
There 's other research along similar lines , but I 'm just presenting one example , ' cause , y'know , eight examples would probably have less impact .
If you know the general experimental paradigm , then the reason for the above behavior is pretty obvious - focusing your attention on a single child creates more emotional arousal than trying to distribute attention around eight children simultaneously .
So people are willing to pay more to help one child than to help eight .
Now , you could look at this intuition , and think it was revealing some kind of incredibly deep moral truth which shows that one child 's good fortune is somehow devalued by the other children 's good fortune .
But what about the billions of other children in the world ?
Why is n't it a bad idea to help this one child , when that causes the value of all the other children to go down ?
How can it be significantly better to have 1,329,342,410 happy children than 1,329,342,409 , but then somewhat worse to have seven more at 1,329,342,417 ?
Or you could look at that and say : " The intuition is wrong : the brain can't successfully multiply by eight and get a larger quantity than it started with .
But it ought to , normatively speaking . "
And once you realize that the brain can't multiply by eight , then the other cases of scope neglect stop seeming to reveal some fundamental truth about 50,000 lives being worth just the same effort as 5,000 lives , or whatever .
You do n't get the impression you 're looking at the revelation of a deep moral truth about nonagglomerative utilities .
It 's just that the brain does n't goddamn multiply .
Quantities get thrown out the window .
If you have $ 100 to spend , and you spend $ 20 each on each of 5 efforts to save 5,000 lives , you will do worse than if you spend $ 100 on a single effort to save 50,000 lives .
Likewise if such choices are made by 10 different people , rather than the same person .
As soon as you start believing that it is better to save 50,000 lives than 25,000 lives , that simple preference of final destinations has implications for the choice of paths , when you consider five different events that save 5,000 lives .
( It is a general principle that Bayesians see no difference between the long - run answer and the short - run answer ; you never get two different answers from computing the same question two different ways .
But the long run is a helpful intuition pump , so I am talking about it anyway . )
The aggregative valuation strategy of " shut up and multiply " arises from the simple preference to have more of something - to save as many lives as possible - when you have to describe general principles for choosing more than once , acting more than once , planning at more than one time .
Aggregation also arises from claiming that the local choice to save one life does n't depend on how many lives already exist , far away on the other side of the planet , or far away on the other side of the universe .
Three lives are one and one and one .
No matter how many billions are doing better , or doing worse .
3 = 1 + 1 + 1 , no matter what other quantities you add to both sides of the equation .
And if you add another life you get 4 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 . That 's aggregation .
When you 've read enough heuristics and biases research , and enough coherence and uniqueness proofs for Bayesian probabilities and expected utility , and you 've seen the " Dutch book " and " money pump " effects that penalize trying to handle uncertain outcomes any other way , then you do n't see the preference reversals in the Allais Paradox as revealing some incredibly deep moral truth about the intrinsic value of certainty .
It just goes to show that the brain does n't goddamn multiply .
The primitive , perceptual intuitions that make a choice " feel good " do n't handle probabilistic pathways through time very skillfully , especially when the probabilities have been expressed symbolically rather than experienced as a frequency .
So you reflect , devise more trustworthy logics , and think it through in words .
When you see people insisting that no amount of money whatsoever is worth a single human life , and then driving an extra mile to save $ 10 ; or when you see people insisting that no amount of money is worth a decrement of health , and then choosing the cheapest health insurance available ; then you do n't think that their protestations reveal some deep truth about incommensurable utilities .
Part of it , clearly , is that primitive intuitions do n't successfully diminish the emotional impact of symbols standing for small quantities - anything you talk about seems like " an amount worth considering " .
And part of it has to do with preferring unconditional social rules to conditional social rules .
Conditional rules seem weaker , seem more subject to manipulation .
If there 's any loophole that lets the government legally commit torture , then the government will drive a truck through that loophole .
So it seems like there should be an unconditional social injunction against preferring money to life , and no " but " following it .
Not even " but a thousand dollars is n't worth a 0.0000000001 % probability of saving a life " .
Though the latter choice , of course , is revealed every time we sneeze without calling a doctor .
The rhetoric of sacredness gets bonus points for seeming to express an unlimited commitment , an unconditional refusal that signals trustworthiness and refusal to compromise .
So you conclude that moral rhetoric espouses qualitative distinctions , because espousing a quantitative tradeoff would sound like you were plotting to defect .
On such occasions , people vigorously want to throw quantities out the window , and they get upset if you try to bring quantities back in , because quantities sound like conditions that would weaken the rule .
But you do n't conclude that there are actually two tiers of utility with lexical ordering .
You do n't conclude that there is actually an infinitely sharp moral gradient , some atom that moves a Planck distance ( in our continuous physical universe ) and sends a utility from 0 to infinity .
You do n't conclude that utilities must be expressed using hyper -real numbers .
Because the lower tier would simply vanish in any equation .
It would never be worth the tiniest effort to recalculate for it .
All decisions would be determined by the upper tier , and all thought spent thinking about the upper tier only , if the upper tier genuinely had lexical priority .
As Peter Norvig once pointed out , if Asimov 's robots had strict priority for the First Law of Robotics ( " A robot shall not harm a human being , nor through inaction allow a human being to come to harm " ) then no robot's behavior would ever show any sign of the other two Laws ; there would always be some tiny First Law factor that would be sufficient to determine the decision .
Whatever value is worth thinking about at all , must be worth trading off against all other values worth thinking about , because thought itself is a limited resource that must be traded off .
When you reveal a value , you reveal a utility .
I do n't say that morality should always be simple .
I 've already said that the meaning of music is more than happiness alone , more than just a pleasure center lighting up .
I would rather see music composed by people than by nonsentient machine learning algorithms , so that someone should have the joy of composition ; I care about the journey , as well as the destination .
And I am ready to hear if you tell me that the value of music is deeper , and involves more complications , than I realize - that the valuation of this one event is more complex than I know .
But that 's for one event .
When it comes to multiplying by quantities and probabilities , complication is to be avoided - at least if you care more about the destination than the journey .
When you 've reflected on enough intuitions , and corrected enough absurdities , you start to see a common denominator , a meta - principle at work , which one might phrase as " Shut up and multiply . "
Where music is concerned , I care about the journey .
When lives are at stake , I shut up and multiply .
It is more important that lives be saved , than that we conform to any particular ritual in saving them .
And the optimal path to that destination is governed by laws that are simple , because they are math .
And that 's why I'm a utilitarian - at least when I am doing something that is overwhelmingly more important than my own feelings about it - which is most of the time , because there are not many utilitarians , and many things left undone .

odf - converter - integrator is an easy way to open Microsoft Office 2007 files ( also called Office Open XML , .docx , .xlsx , and .pptx ) with a high - quality conversion on any Linux or Windows system in any OpenOffice.org .
odf - converter - integrator uses the high - quality odf - converter code ( which converts between Office Open XML and OpenDocument ) as packaged by Novell and integrates it into the operating system .
That means when you click on a .docx/.xlsx /.pptx file on a web page , in an email attachment , or your desktop , odf - converter - integrator springs into action , converts the .docx/.xlsx/.pptx to an .odt/.ods/.odp , and then automatically opens the new document in OpenOffice.org , StarOffice , Abiword , KWord , Gnumeric , Microsoft Office 2003 , or whatever is your default ODF editor .
odf - converter - integrator is simply a little glue to overcome the integration limitation of the Novell odf - converter , which cannot integrate into most editions of OpenOffice.org ( such as the vanilla / Sun Microsystems edition , Fedora , OxygenOffice , and others ) .
Out of the box OpenOffice.org version 3 opens Microsoft Office 2007 documents , but often odf - converter - integrator converts with better quality .
See the article " A better .docx converter " for details .
On Ubuntu , odf - converter - integrator works even better : the integration is more seamless , and it saves in Microsoft Office formats with high quality too !

The Consumer Agency and local health inspectors are concerned about the safety of snow and ice structures that have become a regular part of the winter scene in many parts of the country .
Especially in northern districts , various kinds of snow or ice structures are built during the winter months .
These include working hotels built of snow , igloos , restaurants and snow castles intended as children 's play areas .
Usually , these are open to the public for an entrance fee , or in some cases , for free .
Structures made of ice or snow for real public use are considered consumer services that fall under the provisions of product safety laws .
As such , whoever offers such services is responsible for their safety .
Some are constructed by professionals , but some are also the work of completely amateur groups .
As construction materials , snow and ice pose some very special challenges for builders .
The stability of such structures is affected not just by the properties of the snow and ice used , but also by conditions during construction , changing weather and other environmental factors .
Officials are quick to point out that very little research has been done on the use of snow and ice in construction .

" All of the Palestinians must be killed ; men , women , infants , and even their beasts . "
This was the religious opinion issued one week ago by Rabbi Yisrael Rosen , director of the Tsomet Institute , a long - established religious institute attended by students and soldiers in the Israeli settlements of the West Bank .
In an article published by numerous religious Israeli newspapers two weeks ago and run by the liberal Haaretz on 26 March , Rosen asserted that there is evidence in the Torah to justify this stand .
Rosen , an authority able to issue religious opinions for Jews , wrote that Palestinians are like the nation of Amalekites that attacked the Israelite tribes on their way to Jerusalem after they had fled from Egypt under the leadership of Moses .
He wrote that the Lord sent down in the Torah a ruling that allowed the Jews to kill the Amalekites , and that this ruling is known in Jewish jurisprudence .
Rosen 's article , which created a lot of noise in Israel , included the text of the ruling in the Torah : " Annihilate the Amalekites from the beginning to the end .
Kill them and wrest them from their possessions .
Show them no mercy .
Kill continuously , one after the other .
Leave no child , plant , or tree .
Kill their beasts , from camels to donkeys . "
Rosen adds that the Amalekites are not a particular race or religion , but rather all those who hate the Jews for religious or national motives .
Rosen goes as far as saying that the " Amalekites will remain as long as there are Jews .
In every age Amalekites will surface from other races to attack the Jews , and thus the war against them must be global . "
He urges application of the " Amalekites ruling " and says that the Jews must undertake to implement it in all eras because it is a " divine commandment " .
Rosen does not hesitate to define the " Amalekites of this age " as the Palestinians .
He writes , " those who kill students as they recite the Torah , and fire missiles on the city of Siderot , spread terror in the hearts of men and women .
Those who dance over blood are the Amalekites , and we must respond with counter - hatred .
We must uproot any trace of humanitarianism in dealing with them so that we emerge victorious . "
The true outrage is that most of those authorised to issue Jewish religious opinions support the view of Rabbi Rosen , as confirmed by Haaretz newspaper .
At the head of those supporting his opinion is Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu , the leading religious authority in Israel 's religious national current , and former chief Eastern rabbi for Israel .
Rosen 's opinion also has the support of Rabbi Dov Lior , president of the Council of Rabbis of Judea and Samaria ( the West Bank ) , and Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu , the chief rabbi of Safed and a candidate for the post of chief rabbi of Israel .
A number of political leaders in Israel have also shown enthusiasm for the opinion , including Ori Lubiansky , head of the Jerusalem municipality .
There is no dispute among observers in Israel that the shooting in Jerusalem three weeks ago that killed eight Jewish students in a religious school was pivotal for Jewish authorities issuing religious opinions of a racist , hateful nature .
The day following the Jerusalem incident , a number of rabbis led by Daniel Satobsky issued a religious opinion calling on Jewish youth and " all those who believe in the Torah " to take revenge on the Palestinians as hastily as possible .
A week following the operation , a group of leading rabbis issued an unprecedented religious opinion permitting the Israeli army to bomb Palestinian civilian areas .
The opinion is issued by the " Association of Rabbis of the Land of Israel " and states that Jewish religious law permits the bombing of Palestinian civilian residential areas if they are a source of attacks on Jewish residential areas .
It reads , " when the residents of cities bordering settlements and Jewish centres fire shells at Jewish settlements with the aim of death and destruction , the Torah permits for shells to be fired on the sources of firing even if civilian residents are present there . "
The opinion adds that sometimes it is necessary to respond with shelling to sources of fire immediately , without granting the Palestinian public prior warning .
A week ago , Rabbi Eliyahu Kinvinsky , the second most senior authority in the Orthodox religious current , issued a religious opinion prohibiting the employment of Arabs , particularly in religious schools .
This religious opinion followed another that had been issued by Rabbi Lior prohibiting the employment of Arabs and the renting of residential apartments to them in Jewish neighbourhoods .
In order to provide a climate that allows Jewish extremist organisations to continue attacking Palestinian citizens , Rabbi Israel Ariel , one of the most prominent rabbis in the West Bank settlement complex , recently issued a religious opinion prohibiting religious Jews involved in attacks against Palestinians to appear before Israeli civil courts .
According to this opinion , they must instead demand to appear before Torah courts that rule by Jewish religious law .
Haaretz newspaper noted that what Rabbi Ariel was trying to achieve through this religious opinion has in fact already taken place .
The first instance of such a court in Kfar Saba ordered the release of a young Jewish woman called Tsevia Teshrael who attacked a Palestinian farmer in the middle of the West Bank .
And there are Jewish religious authorities that glorify killing and praise terrorists , such as Rabbi Yitzhaq Ginsburg , a top rabbi in Israel who published a book entitled Baruch the Hero in memoriam of Baruch Goldstein , who committed the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in 1994 when he opened fire and killed 29 Palestinians as they were performing the dawn prayer in Hebron in the southern West Bank .
Ginsburg considers his act " honourable and glorious " .
The danger of these religious opinions lies in the fact that the religious authorities issuing them have wide respect among religious Jewish youth .
And while only 28 per cent of Israel 's population is religious , more than 50 per cent of Israelis define themselves as conservative and grant major significance to opinions issued by Jewish religious authorities .
According to a study conducted by the Social Sciences Department of Bar Elon University , more than 90 per cent of those who identify as religious believe that if state laws and government orders are incongruous with the content of religious opinions issued by rabbis , they must overlook the former and act in accordance with the latter .
What grants the racist religious opinions a deeper and far - reaching impact is the fact that for the last decade followers of the Zionist religious current , who form nearly 10 per cent of the population , have been seeking to take control of the army and security institutions .
They are doing so through volunteering for service in special combat units .
The spokesperson 's office in the Israeli army says that although the percentage of followers of this current is low in the state 's demographic makeup , they form more than 50 per cent of the officers in the Israeli army and more than 60 per cent of its special unit commanders .
According to an opinion poll of religious officers and soldiers supervised by the Interdisciplinary Centre Herzliya and published last year , more than 95 per cent of religious soldiers and officers say that they will execute orders from the elected government and their leaders in the army only if they are in harmony with the religious opinions issued by leading rabbis and religious authorities .
Wasil Taha , Arab Knesset member from the Tajammu Party led by Azmi Bishara , says that these religious opinions lead to the committal of crimes .
He mentions religious opinions issued by a number of rabbis in mid-1995 that led to the assassination of former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin at that time .
" If that 's what happens when religious opinions urge attacks against Jewish leaders such as Rabin , what will the situation be like when they urge attacks against Palestinian leaders and the Palestinian public ? " he asks .
" We , as Arab leaders , have begun to feel a lack of security following this flood of religious opinions , and we realise that the matter requires a great deal of caution in our movements as we are certain that there are those who seek to implement these opinions , " he told Al - Ahram Weekly .
Taha dismisses those who ask about the role of the government and Israeli political cadre in confronting these extremist religious opinions .
" The ministers in the Israeli government and the Knesset members compete to incite against the Palestinian public and do n't hesitate to threaten expulsion of the Palestinians who live on their land in Israel and carry Israeli citizenship outside of Israel 's borders , just as former deputy premier Avigdor Lieberman and representative Evi Etam did , " Taha said .
He notes that Palestinian citizens within Israel have begun to take extreme precautionary measures since the issue of these religious opinions , including security measures around mosques and public institutions and informing officials of public demonstrations so that members of Jewish terrorist organisations can be prevented from attacking participants .
Taha holds that the sectors of the Palestinian population most likely to be harmed by these religious opinions are those living in the various cities populated by both Jews and Palestinians , such as Haifa , Jaffa , Lod , Ramleh and Jerusalem .
Palestinian writer and researcher Abdul - Hakim Mufid , from the city Um Fahem , holds that the religious opinions of rabbis have gained major significance due to the harmony between official rhetoric and that of the rabbis .
Mufid notes that official Israeli establishments have not tried to confront the " fascist " rhetoric expressed in these religious opinions even though they are capable of doing so .
" Most of the rabbis who issue tyrannical religious opinions are official employees in state institutions and receive salaries from them .
And the state has not held these rabbis accountable or sought to prohibit the issue of such opinions , " he told the Weekly .
Mufid points out that when the official political institution is in a crisis , the Zionist consensus behind these religious opinions grows more intense , and offers as an example the religious opinions relied upon by Rabbi Meir Kahane in the early 1980s to justify his call to forcefully expel the Palestinians .
Mufid adds that Israel in practice encourages all those who kill Palestinians , and points to the way that the Israeli government dealt with the recommendations of the Orr Commission that investigated the Israeli police 's killing of 13 Palestinians with Israeli citizenship in October of 2000 .
The government closed the file even though the commission confirmed that the police had acted aggressively towards the Palestinian citizens .
Mufid suggests that what makes the racist rhetoric the rabbis insist upon influential is the silence of leftist and liberal voices , and the lack of any direct mobilisation against it .

This little LED - lit cube is much more than just a paper lantern :
It ’s a translucent and flexible thin - film electronic circuit that hooks up a battery to an LED , limber enough to be folded into an origami box .
And the coolest thing about circuits like these ?
You can make them at home .
In what follows , we combine basic electronics ( an LED Throwie ) and papercraft ( a traditional origami balloon ) to make what might be called an “ LED Foldie . ”
The circuitry consists of aluminum foil traces , ironed onto adhesive paper such as freezer paper , photo mounting paper , or even a laser printed pattern .
Something constructed this way can then be folded so fit an LED and battery to complete the circuit .
Besides the throwies themselves , this was inspired in part by the beautiful LED Floaties [ via Make ] .
The first step in designing a three - dimensional circuit like this is to see where the parts go .
After that we will unfold the model , draw circuit paths between the points that we want to connect , and go from there .
To get started , we first folded an origami balloon , and then inserted the components where we wanted them .
The balloon has a convenient pocket on the side for a lithium coin cell , and a single hole that allows you to point an LED into the interior of the balloon .
( And you can follow along with balloon folding in this flickr photo set . )
We knew we wanted the LED to go into the hole in the bottom of the balloon , so we tucked the leads into the folds on the side opposite the battery .
We marked up the locations of the battery and LED terminals on the origami balloon– while still folded – and then unfolded our “ circuit board . ”
At this point , we have the component locations marked , but no lines drawn between them .
The next step is to add those circuitry lines ( circuit board wires , or traces ) between the battery and LED .
One thing to keep in mind for interfacing papercraft to electronics : it ’s helpful if the circuit traces fold over the leads for the LED in order to maintain good contact .
After connecting the dots ( so to speak ) we have the resulting layout of our circuit .
( See PDF below as well . )
Pretty simple here– only two wires !
The two round pads contact the two sides of the battery , and the two angled pads contact the two leads of the LED .
The next step is to actually fabricate our circuit board .
We ’ve actually found two slightly different techniques that work well , so we ’ll show you both .
First is the “ Freezer paper ” method ( which also works with sheets of dry mount adhesive ) , where you laminate foil traces to the plastic - coated paper .
Second is the “ Direct Toner ” method , where you print out a circuit diagram on a laser printer and laminate the foil to the printed toner .
( Both of these methods of fabricating paper circuitry can be applied in all kinds of other arenas besides origami .
Our origami balloon example provides a good demonstration of the techniques ! )
METHOD I : The “ Freezer paper ” method
Lay the circuit layout diagram over a piece of aluminum foil and trace over it with a stylus ( a wooden skewer or blunt toothpick works well ) to make an indented outline .
Next , cut out your traced pattern .
Scissors work well , of course .
Be careful not to tear the foil !
Prefolding your paper and comparing to your circuit layout will show you where to lay the aluminum foil pieces out on your paper .
Then , use an iron to laminate the foil to the paper .
What kind of paper ?
The easiest ( but slightly obscure ) choice is “ dry mount adhesive , ” which is tissue paper infused with high - quality hot - melt glue .
You can get sheets or rolls of it from art supply places for use in mounting artwork and photography .
Much more common and equally workable is freezer paper .
Freezer paper is a common plastic - coated paper that you can get on rolls at the grocery store– look in the section with the aluminum foil .
( Place foil on the shiny side of the freezer paper ) .
We used a small hobby iron to fuse the foil to our different papers , but a regular iron works just as well .
The dry mount adhesive did not require much heat , while the freezer paper needed the iron to be on high– that plastic has to melt .
We folded a larger sheet of parchment paper over the whole circuit during ironing in order to keep the adhesives from sticking to the iron and other surfaces .
We also experimented with waxed paper , which was not sticky enough for the aluminum foil .
We even tried ironing copper leaf onto waxed paper , and though it adhered well , it was too fragile and the traces broke upon folding .
It would probably work reasonably well in an application where folding is n’t required :
It was absolutely beautiful and completely unreliable for origami .
Once the foil is adhered to the paper , it is time to refold it .
Insert the components , and it lights up .
If it does n’t light up , try turning your battery around .
If it still does n’t light up , make sure your LED leads are contacting the traces .
Hint for this circuit :
You wo n’t hurt the LED by plugging it in backwards to that little battery , so this is a better method than actually trying to keep track of the polarity .
The LED Foldie naturally wants to sit on the heaviest part , the battery , with the LED projecting into the side of the balloon .
The weight of the battery helps keep the circuit connected .
METHOD II : The “ Direct Toner ” method
Our last breakthrough came when we created a pdf pattern to print out .
We realized that you could fuse the foil directly to the toner from a laser printer .
You can print out the pattern ( laser printers only : no inkjet ! ) and iron your foil pieces directly to the paper .
Caveat : while the foil sticks well to the toner , it is n’t quite strong enough that you can just iron on a giant sheet of foil and have it only stick where there ’s toner , so you still need to cut out the foil shapes , at least roughly .
After printing out the pattern , place it over your aluminum foil , trace the outlines , and cut out the foil pieces .
Place your foil carefully over the pattern , and iron very well , very hot .
Be sure to cover your work with parchment paper or you will get toner on your iron .
When your foil is stuck to the toner , cut out the square and get ready to fold .
Fold gently so as to disturb the traces as little as possible .
They may come loose in areas with multiple folds , but should stay on enough for assembly .
Inflate , add battery and LED , and admire the glow .
As before , if you have trouble , try turning your battery around and making sure that the leads of the LED are making contact with the foil .
And there it is : a bridge between papercraft and electronics , or perhaps between etch - at - home printed circuit boards and high - end flex PCBs .
We think that there ’s some potential here .
Your turn !
What kinds of origami can you light up ?
As always , we ’d love to see your project pictures in the Evil Mad Science Auxiliary .
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ended some years ago .
In Iraq , the war ended with the fall of Saddam Hussein ’s government ; in Afghanistan , with the fall of the Taliban government .
What ’s been happening since is occupation and resistance to occupation .
It ’s always helpful to call things by the right name .
One of the ways using the wrong word can trip us is illustrated by John McCain ’s campaign theme .
We have to win the war in Iraq , he keeps saying .
Ending a war implies either winning or losing .
No such baggage is attached to an occupation .
You can end an occupation without either winning or losing .
You just withdraw your troops .
The fact that what is going on in Iraq is an occupation is proven by the nature of the conflicts .
They are between factions of Iraqis .
Our guys are caught in the crossfire or killed by Iraqis who oppose our presence .
There are no large - scale attacks directed against us .
Those who want to continue the occupation paint a horrific picture of what they claim will happen if we withdraw  a massive civil war , genocide or a regional war .
There is no hard evidence to support any of those suppositions .
But even if they happen , they need not concern us .
Lots of factions in different parts of the world decide to kill each other from time to time , and we do n’t interfere .
As long as there are no Americans to get caught in the crossfire , let the Iraqis have their civil war if that ’s what they want .
On the other hand , there ’s never been civil war in Iraq .
There were rebellions against the Baathist government and , before that , against the British - sponsored governments , but before our occupation , Sunnis and Shia intermarried and lived side by side .
There were always Christians in Iraq and , until the state of Israel was created , Jews .
That was , in fact , true throughout the Middle East .
As for al - Qaeda , it has been virtually wiped out in Iraq  not by us , but by Sunni tribesmen who turned against it because of its murderous fanaticism .
McCain keeps confusing al - Qaeda with Shia and trying to link it to Iran , but al - Qaeda is a fundamentalist Sunni group way outside the mainstream of Islam .
Most of its members are Saudis or Egyptians .
It was never in Iraq until our war and occupation gave it an excuse to come in .
It ’s never been in Iran .
For American politicians to suppose that without us it would thrive and grow in Iraq is just proof of their ignorance .
Our presence in Iraq is the only thing that made al - Qaeda viable .
Our occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan are the principal selling points in al - Qaeda propaganda .
We have no interests , strategic or otherwise , in either country .
The last thing al - Qaeda wants is for us to withdraw , which is why it should be the first thing we do .
Whatever someone imagines we gain by staying in Iraq and Afghanistan is far outweighed by what we are losing .
We are losing lives in dribs and drabs , and we are losing treasure at an alarming rate .
We have severe internal problems that our military presence in the Middle East aggravates .
Our military is on the verge of being broken .
Some Nobel laureates estimate the war will end up costing us $ 3 trillion .
Well , plain and simple , we ca n’t afford it .
We should never go to war unless there are tangible , identifiable benefits for the American people for doing so .
Try to think of a benefit we have gained from Iraq or Afghanistan .
There are none .
We deposed two governments that were not attacking us or threatening to attack us , and we let get away the private terrorist group that had attacked us .
It does not matter that they were bad governments .
There are lots of bad governments in this world .
The only bad government we have an obligation to change is the one in Washington , D.C .
If we do n’t change direction in this country , we ’re going to end up impoverished and bankrupt , and you know what ?
Iraq and Afghanistan will still be the messes they are today .
If you were of a nervous disposition , you might be thinking that judgment day is nigh for the British economy , after all the excess , easy money and booming house prices of recent years .
America looks like it is already in recession , one that threatens rapidly to become the biggest slump since the 1920s .
The collapse a week ago of the country 's fifth - largest investment bank , Bear Stearns , signalled that the crisis sweeping the world 's credit markets had taken a decisive turn for the worse .
The wobbles in the HBOS share price last week , although based on groundless rumours , are a sign of how frayed nerves have become .
Certainly , those hoping that the drying up of global money markets last August , which brought down Northern Rock in September , would be just a passing phase are sorely disappointed .
In the budget the Treasury said the credit crunch would probably last until summer 2009 , although no one can know for sure .
As a result , Alistair Darling had to mark down another £ 20bn of borrowing to cover an expected shortfall in tax revenues .
That means both of Labour 's cherished fiscal rules are likely to go out the window .
The credit problems have endured because the banking system had got more pumped up with reckless lending and ever more creative and incomprehensible " assets " than even the worst pessimist had feared .
As a result , the unwinding of all this , or " deleveraging " , is taking longer and proving more painful than had been thought .
Banks are keeping their money for themselves and winding in risky lending that only a year ago they were revelling in .
That is where the impact spills out of the credit markets and into the real economy - and that is where the pain is being felt .
" There is a lot of credit rationing going on .
Indeed , the credit markets are pricing in Armageddon , " says Richard Batty , a strategist at Standard Life Investments .
He says this is showing up in the US mortgage market , where interest rates on the long - term mortgages beloved of Americans have pushed up above 6 % , even though the Federal Reserve has been slashing short - term rates , bringing them last week down to 2.25 % .
Small wonder that experts in the US predict another 10 - 15 % off house prices there in the next year , adding to the 15 % drop seen over the past year .
A 25 - 30 % house price fall in two years counts as a crash in anyone 's book .
The question is , of course , how bad can it get in Britain ?
We 've already seen that lending to first - time buyers has slumped by a third since last summer while first - time buyer numbers have dropped to a record low .
Lending to buy - to - let landlords is drying up too .
After a decade that has seen house prices triple , banks are finally realising that lending up to 100 % and more of a property that could soon be worth less than its purchase price is not terribly clever .
In the case of many of those now infamous inner-city new - build blocks beloved of landlords , purchase prices have long been above the true value of the properties , with developers making false claims about the potential rents in order to shift them to gullible investors .
From the current perspective , the idea that house prices in Britain , which are already sliding , can just drift sideways after such a boom is optimistic to say the least .
Some have long argued , however , that house prices are well supported in Britain because there is not much new housing being built and the population is expanding .
We need a trigger such as rising unemployment to push prices down , because that hits demand hard , they say .
Figures last week showed that employment has hit another record high , although it fell for the first time in six years in the financial services sector - a sign of the pain being felt in the City .
But what is happening now is that strong demand for somewhere to live is manifesting itself in strong rises in rents , rather than house prices .
Make no mistake , there is a demand shock happening in the housing market caused by the credit crunch .
Remember that economics textbooks define demand as " a need or want backed by the ability to buy " .
It is this ability to buy that has been hit .
Ask any estate agent where are his or her first - time buyers - the traditional prop of the market - and they will tell you that they have disappeared .
Likewise would - be landlords .
Both these groups have suffered a slamming of the door to the world of easy credit unless they have a very sizeable deposit .
Add to that a growing realisation that house prices are extremely high by almost any measure and you have a change in sentiment among buyers .
That sentiment could prove long - lasting and so prices could fall sharply , although probably not as sharply as in the US .
However , US house prices doubled over the last decade , rather than tripled , so UK values have potentially further to fall .
Commercial property prices are already in freefall and down 10 - 15 % since the autumn .
Legal & General forecast last week that they are likely to fall as much again , especially if the credit crunch continues unabated .
It was n't so long ago that investment experts were telling us that commercial property was a good bet - safe as houses .
For the housing market , much will depend on how far the Bank of England cuts interest rates .
The City thinks rates will come down by 0.75 points or more by the end of this year .
That is not much , because the Bank remains concerned about inflation from rising food and energy prices .
It will provide some relief to homeowners on variable rates but may not make money any more available to new buyers .
This credit crunch is more about the availability of money than its price .
If you accept that a fall in house prices is likely , the question becomes : then what ?
Will consumer spending , on which the economy has depended for years , also collapse ?
Quite possibly , although the Bank has argued for some time that the link between house prices and consumer spending is less clear than you may think .
Resilient
Robert Barrie , chief European economist at Credit Suisse , takes the view that though some sort of economic slowdown is likely , one should hesitate before assuming everything is going to hell in a handcart .
For a start , he argues , retail spending has held up well , in spite of the weak credit and housing conditions .
Rate cuts will help consumers , he says , as will the fact that shops are cutting their prices on almost everything but food , thereby making consumers ' incomes go further .
" We do n't want to argue that things ca n't go wrong in the UK economy or that this is likely to be anything other than a difficult year , " Barrie says .
" However , it seems to us - against the record of the past 10 years and the behaviour of the economy at the start of this year - that sentiment may again be unduly pessimistic . "
A document on the Treasury 's website issued at the time of the budget argues that the UK has the most resilient of the world 's major economies because of its flexible and competitive nature and the strength of its policy - making framework .
You may argue that they would say that , would n't they ?
But the document does highlight data showing the UK economy has had remarkably stable growth and inflation over the past decade or more .
Growth has been twice as stable as that in the US over the past decade .
Barrie argues that should mean a recession here is twice as unlikely as in the US .
One thing 's for sure : with consumer debts at record levels and house prices way too high , that resilience will face its sternest test yet over the next 12 months .
Judgment day may be nigh .
When it comes to personal characteristics and diversity , the 2008 presidential race has covered a lot of ground .
Are Americans prepared to embrace an African - American candidate ( Obama ) ?
A woman ( Clinton ) ?
A Mormon ( Romney ) ?
A Latino ( Richardson ) ?
A thrice - married serial adulterer ( Giuliani ) ?
But the one question that no one seems anxious to talk about is the fact that John McCain , at age 72 , would be the oldest person ever elected president .
There ’s apparently some public discomfort over this , but it ’s ground that few are prepared to tread .
In his big foreign policy speech the other day in Los Angeles , McCain began his remarks with a personal anecdote :
“ When I was five years old , a car pulled up in front of our house in New London , Connecticut , and a Navy officer rolled down the window , and shouted at my father that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor .
My father immediately left for the submarine base where he was stationed .
I rarely saw him again for four years . ”
Now , I suspect the story was intended to remind the audience about the proud military history in McCain ’s family , but there were probably more than a few people who heard the anecdote and thought , “ Wait , McCain was already five in 1941 ? ”
I mention this in part because the new NBC / WSJ poll ( pdf ) asked respondents if they think Americans are prepared to elected an otherwise qualified candidate , who happens to be have certain characteristics .
72 % of Americans , for example , said the country is prepared to elect an African - American president , and 71 % said we ’re also ready for a woman president .
But when asked about a candidate over the age of 70 , the number dropped to 61 % .
This is n’t a new problem , which is all the more reason it ’s surprising this is barely a blip on the political world ’s radar .
I half - expected the age issue to be a bigger deal .
Way back in February 2007 , an WaPo / ABC poll asked Americans : “ I ’m going to read a few attributes that might be found in a candidate for president .
Please tell me if each would make you more likely to vote for that candidate for president , or less likely to vote for that candidate , or if it would n’t matter . ”
When the attributes mentioned race , gender , religion , and marital status , poll respondents generally did n’t care at all .
When the poll mentioned a 72 - year - old candidate , 58 % said they would be “ less likely ” to vote for such a candidate — more than the totals for a woman , African American , and / or Mormon combined .
Around the same time , a USAT / Gallup showed that 42 % of voters said they would n’t support an otherwise qualified 72 - year - old candidate .
But that was well over a year ago , before the race began in earnest .
Have the numbers changed ?
Not much .
A CBS / NYT poll last month asked American what the best age is for a president .
A majority ( 55 % ) preferred someone in their 50s , while a president in his or her 40s was second ( with 26 % ) .
How many preferred someone in their 70s ?
Less than one percent .
Earlier this month , the WaPo polled on this again , and found that Americans still are n’t on board with electing the oldest president in history .
Poll respondents were told that Hillary Clinton would be the first female president .
20 % said that makes them more enthusiastic about her candidacy , while 11 % said less .
They were told that Barack Obama would be the first African - American president .
16 % said that makes them more enthusiastic about his candidacy , while 11 % said less .
And when told about McCain ’s age , 4 % said that makes them more enthusiastic about his candidacy , while 27 % said less .
Here ’s the catch : Americans may not like the idea of a 72 - year - old candidate , but no one has any idea how to take advantage of this .
What are Dems supposed to do , tell elderly jokes ?
That ’s clearly not going to happen .
Voters may not be comfortable with McCain ’s age , but figuring out what to do about this may be one of the more complicated questions facing Dems in the general election .
Last Thursday at Hell Roaring Canyon , Potter believed he was finally ready to walk the 180 - foot rope while tethered to a leash around his waist .
During a couple weeks of rehearsal , he had felt exposed on the rope , with a touch of vertigo .
A parabola of sandstone curved off to his right , never more than 60 feet away .
To his left , the gorge yawned a half - mile wide .
Straight ahead , the rope was anchored to a narrow promontory that seemed to hover , drawing his vision a mile down the canyon .
“ When I get in the middle , an emptiness takes over , ” Potter said .
“ I felt a little helpless . ”
On his first few attempts at sunset , the temperature dipping into the 30s , Potter straddled the rope as he fell , barrel - rolling into a sitting position and scooting back to the ledge .
And then with impeccable balance and concentration , his arms waving in smooth , swooping motions , he reached midway and beyond .
The rope was more taut than a regular slackline .
Still , it gave about two feet in the middle and moved a foot from side to side .
Potter kept his equilibrium .
The leash ’s metal ring dragged behind him , giving a reassuring scrape along the rope that was amplified by the canyon ’s acoustics .
He secured the rope between his two biggest toes , focusing on a yellow flag hanging from the outcropping at the end of the line .
He grew more confident and his breathing became shallow and loud and when he covered the distance Potter let out a whoop .
It was at times like this , full of calm and terror , Potter said , that he felt most connected to himself and his surroundings .
“ When there ’s a death consequence , when you are doing things that if you mess up you die , I like the way it causes my senses to peak , ” Potter said .
“ I can see more clearly .
You can think much faster .
You hear at a different level .
Your foot contact on the line is accentuated .
Your sense of balance is heightened .
I do n’t seem to feel that very often meditating . ”
From the time he was a boy , Potter said , he had a recurring dream .
He was in the air and people were giving him instructions in high - pitched squeaks , teaching him how to fly .
At the end of his dream , he began to fall , dropping toward a dead tree , and then he awakened .
As a climber , he came to believe that he might be seeing his own death .
But as a highliner and BASE - jumper , he said , he had come to view his dream as an affirmation of flight instead of a portent of mortality .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) – China has replaced North Korea as one of the top three U.S. enemies , according to a poll of Americans .
Iran topped the list , with 25 percent naming it when asked which country is the greatest U.S. enemy , according to the Gallup Poll .
Iraq came next at 22 percent , then China with 14 percent .
North Korea was named by 9 percent – half the number who cited it a year earlier .
Pyongyang agreed last year to disable its nuclear facilities in exchange for aid , though disputes have continued over implementing the deal .
China , a growing economic rival of the U.S. , was cited by 11 percent as top enemy a year ago .
Gallup first asked the question in early 2001 , before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 .
At the time , Iraq was seen as the biggest foe , followed by China and Iran .

We all have strong opinions about Windows XP on the XO laptop , and soon according to Laptop Mag , our greatest fears or hopes will be realized :
Negroponte says that a Windows operating system is in the process of being fine - tuned on the XO as we speak .
“ Microsoft and OLPC are in discussion on how to release it , as well as how to announce , ” he said .
Negroponte added that the Windows operating system should be available on the XO in less than 60 days .
For me , that paragraph represents the end of a dream .
I say that XP on the XO is the end of One Laptop Per Child as an educational project .
With a Microsoft operating system , an XO becomes a " $ 200 laptop " , a cheap Toshiba replacement , not an educational learning tool for children .
With the Sugar User Interface , OLPC can claim to have a Constructionist learning methodology , it can claim to be promoting exploration and learning , it can even hope to activate the view source key .
But once you put on XP , no matter how much it may be customized to leverage the XO hardware , children will not be taught to " learn learning " as Negroponte promised .
They will be taught " ICT skills " , a phrase Negroponte himself railed against .
Ministries of Education will be tempted to lock down XO 's in computer labs and revert the whole one laptop per child idea back to one to many , effectively negating the goal of this grand dream .
Yes , for me XP on the XO is the end of OLPC , no matter who is the CEO .

Motorists who talk on cell phones drive slower on the freeway , pass sluggish vehicles less often and take longer to complete their trips , according to a University of Utah study .
“ At the end of the day , the average person ’s commute is longer because of that person who is on the cell phone right in front of them , ” says University of Utah psychology Professor Dave Strayer , leader of the research team .
“ That SOB on the cell phone is slowing you down and making you late . ”
“ If you talk on the phone while you ’re driving , it ’s going to take you longer to get from point A to point B , and it ’s going to slow down everybody else on the road , ” says Joel Cooper , a doctoral student in psychology .
Cooper is scheduled to present the study in Washington on Wednesday , Jan. 16 during the Transportation Research Board ’s annual meeting .
The board is part of the National Academies , parent organization of the National Academy of Sciences , National Academy of Engineering and Institute of Medicine .
Joel Cooper , a University of Utah doctoral student in psychology , demonstrates how subjects in a new study talked on a cell phone while operating a driving simulator .
The new Utah study found that motorists on cell phones contribute to traffic congestion because they drive slower and are less likely to pass slow - moving vehicles .
Credit : Ivana Vladisavljevic , University of Utah .
Cooper and Strayer conducted the study with Ivana Vladisavljevic , a doctoral student in civil and environmental engineering , and Peter Martin , an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering and director of the University of Utah Traffic Lab .
Martin says that , combined with Strayer ’s previous research , the new study shows “ cell phones not only make driving dangerous , they cause delay too . ”
Previous Research on Wireless Phones and Driving
In recent years , Strayer ’s research group has published studies showing that :
Hands - free cell phones are no less dangerous while driving than hand - held cell phones because the conversation itself is the major distraction .
When young adults talk on cell phones while driving , their reaction times become as slow as reaction times for senior citizens .
Drivers talking on cell phones are as impaired as drivers with the 0.08 percent blood alcohol level that defines drunken driving in most states .
Highway statistics suggest drivers on cell phones are four times more likely to be in an accident , and Strayer ’s earlier research suggests the risk is 5.36 times greater .
The Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association claims 240 million U.S. subscribers in a nation of 303 million people .
An insurance company survey estimated 73 percent of wireless users talk while driving .
Another survey found that during any given daytime moment , 10 percent of U.S. drivers are using cellular phones .
The researchers note that 50 countries have adopted laws banning handheld phones while driving .
But they say hands - free phone conversations are distracting , “ thus , the majority of current regulation appears to be misguided . ”
How the New Study Was Conducted
The earlier studies found that cell phone users follow at greater distances , are slower to hit the brakes and are slower to regain speed after braking .
But such research did n’t examine how traffic efficiency is influenced by individual cell phone users .
That led to Strayer and Martin discussing the possibility of using computers to simulate numerous individual cell phone users ’ driving behavior and thus overall traffic .
So their doctoral students – Cooper and Vladisavljevic – conducted the new study as a step toward an eventual computer “ microsimulation ” of numerous drivers and vehicles .
The new study used a PatrolSim driving simulator .
A person sits in a front seat equipped with gas pedal , brakes , steering and displays from a Ford Crown Victoria patrol car .
Realistic traffic scenes are projected on three screens around the driver .
The new study involved 36 University of Utah psychology undergraduates .
Each student drove through six , 9.2 - mile - long freeway scenarios , two each in low , medium and high density traffic , corresponding to freeway speeds of 70 mph to 40 mph .
Each 9.2 - mile drive included 3.9 miles with two lanes in each direction and 5.3 miles with three lanes each way .
Traffic speed and flow mimicked Interstate 15 in Salt Lake City .
Each student spoke on a hands - free cell phone during one drive at each level of traffic density , and did not use a cell phone during the other three drives .
A volunteer on the other end of the phone was told to maintain a constant exchange of conversation .
The drivers were told to obey the 65 - mph speed limit , and use turn signals .
That let participants decide their own speeds , following distances and lane changes .
“ We designed the study so that traffic would periodically slow in one lane and the other lane would periodically free up , ” Cooper says .
“ It created a situation where progress down the road was clearly impeded by slower moving vehicles , and a driver would benefit by moving to the faster lane , whether it was right or left . ”
The Findings : Talking While Driving Means Plodding Along
“ Results indicated that , when drivers conversed on a cell phone , they made fewer lane changes , had a lower overall mean speed and a significant increase in travel time in the medium and high density driving conditions , ” the researchers wrote .
In medium and high density traffic , drivers talking on cell phones were 21 percent and 19 percent , respectively , less likely to change lanes ( roughly six lane changes per 9.2 - mile drive versus seven or eight lane changes by drivers not on cell phones ) .
That may seem minor , “ but if you have a lot of people who are not changing lanes and driving slower , this could substantially reduce traffic flow , ” Cooper says .
When considered with the earlier studies , “ it ’s going to increase traffic congestion , ” says Strayer .
“ You have motorists on cells phones who tend to drive slower , their reaction times are slower , if they do hit the brakes it takes them longer to come back up to highway speed , and they are less likely to change lanes .
Overall , they are more likely to gum up the highways . ”
In low , medium and high traffic density , cell phone users spent 31 percent , 16 percent and 12 percent , respectively , more time following within 200 feet of a slow lead vehicle than undistracted drivers .
That meant they spent 25 to 50 more seconds following another vehicle during the 9.2 - mile drive .
“ If you were not distracted by talking on a cell phone , you would overtake and pass the slower vehicle and come to your destination faster , ” Vladisavljevic says .
Strayer adds : “ If you get two or three people gumming up the system , it starts to cascade and slows everybody ’s commute . ”
He acknowledges that , “ in itself , staying in a lane and not passing might be construed as being safer , just as driving slightly slower or having a greater following distance also could be considered safer .
But if you are doing that so you can take your mind off the road and talk on the phone , that is n’t safer . ”
Compared with undistracted motorists , drivers on cell phones drove an average of 2 mph slower and took 15 to 19 seconds longer to complete the 9.2 miles .
That may not seem like much , but is likely to be compounded if 10 percent of all drivers are talking on wireless phones at the same time , Cooper says .
Vladisavljevic already has begun computer “ microsimulations ” of multiple vehicles .
She tried the simulation repeatedly with the proportion of drivers on cell phones ranging from none to 25 percent .
“ We saw an increase in delays for all cars in a system , and the delays increased as the percentage of drivers on cell phones increased , ” she says .
Strayer says it is important to show how cell phone use affects traffic because “ when people have tried to do cost - benefit analyses to decide whether we should regulate cell phones , they often do n’t factor in the cost to society associated with increased commute times , excess fuel used by stop - and - go traffic and increased air pollution , as well as hazards associated with drivers distracted by cell phone conversations . ”
Martin says transportation analysts include two components – accidents and delay – when they calculate the “ user costs ” associated with road travel .
“ A fatal accident could cost as much as $ 5 million when we take into account medical , property and loss - of - income costs , ” says Martin .
“ Delay is measured by a composite number representing a measure of the value of a typical American traveler 's time .
Today , this number is about $ 13 per hour .
While the costs associated with accidents seem high , there are so very few of them , comparatively , they actually are dwarfed by the user costs associated with delay .
If we compile the millions of drivers distracted by cell phones and their small delays , and convert them to dollars , the costs are likely to be dramatic .
Cell phones cost us dearly . "

Mr Marks , whose findings are to be published this week in Nature Australia magazine , says the first successful captive breeding of wombats was recorded in Hannover , Germany , in 1982 .
" With absolute precision , details of the wombat 's sex life were recorded and , surprisingly , it seemed anything but modest , " he says .
" It appeared to be a physically demanding process , complete with chasing , biting , grunting and loads of heavy breathing . "
Then in 1990 , Mr Marks filmed the first common wombat courtship and mating in captivity in Australia , at Tonimbuk Farm in south - eastern Victoria .
" The female , after a prolonged period of copulation in the same position , broke away and began to trot in a pattern of circles and figures of eight .
" The male chased her , following closely behind , and then bit her on the rump , " he says .
" She immediately stopped just long enough to permit him to roll her on her side and begin copulating again .
" If the male was slow to mount , she would kick back aggressively and not let him roll her on her side again until she had run round in more circles and figures of eight .
This happened seven times . "
Space seems to be the key .
Mr Marks says without the " hard to get " figure eight dance , the female will not allow the male to mount .
But zoo keepers are catching on .
Mr Marks says biologist Catriona MacCallum at the Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo has had spectacular wombat breeding success .
" Joining and modifying the pen systems to permit a chase , she not only found that wombat breeding was possible in captivity , but she found herself with the first recorded case of wombat twins . "
Mr Marks says he hopes his study will solve the sloth - like image problem of the common wombat , making the furry marsupials " the symbol of Australian male sexual virility " .

A little over a year ago , TorrentSpy.com was still the most visited BitTorrent site , but times have changed .
After an expensive two year battle with the MPAA , TorrentSpy decided to throw in the towel and the site has now shut down permanently .
TorrentSpy is no more , Justin Bunnell , the founder of the site writes : “ We have decided on our own , not due to any court order or agreement , to bring the TorrentSpy.com search engine to an end and thus we permanently closed down worldwide on March 24 , 2008 . ”
The main reason for the shutdown is the ongoing legal battle with the MPAA , which started February 2006 .
“ We now feel compelled to provide the ultimate method of privacy protection for our users – permanent shutdown , ” Justin writes .
By the end of 2006 TorrentSpy was more popular than any other BitTorrent site , but this changed quickly in August 2007 , when a federal judge ordered TorrentSpy to log all user data .
The judge ruled that TorrentSpy had to monitor its users in order to create detailed logs of their activities , and hand these over to the MPAA .
In a response to this decision – and to ensure the privacy of their users – TorrentSpy decided that it was best to block access to all users from the US .
This led to a huge decrease in traffic and revenue .
This was not enough for the MPAA , who argued that TorrentSpy had ignored the court decision .
The legal battle continued , and this eventually led to a preventative closure of the site by Justin , to protect the privacy of its users .
Brokep from
The Pirate Bay had this to say about the closure : “ Today all big torrent sites are pressured somehow .
TPB has its share of pressure , however we expected it and have a legal system that is more just in cases like this .
The way that the copyright lobby is going at this is totally wrong and we ca n’t let them win .
And we wo n’t let them win .
Today we reached a loss of a site , but it was more a person having to give up for economical reasons than anything else .
The copyright lobby has their big cards – money and influence .
In the long run they will have to give up as well .
And when they do , I ’ll go to the US and buy Justin a well - deserved beer . ”
At this point it is not clear what will happen to the TorrentSpy.com domain .
Perhaps Justin should offer it to other BitTorrent site owners ?
Let 's see this Treasury Department list again ... Aiman Al - Zawahiri .... Radovan Karadzic ....
Alexander Lukashenko .... ah , Tour & Marketing International .
Steven Marshall , the owner of T&M and affiliated websites such as www.cuba-hemingway.com, www.cuba-oldhavana.com, and www.cubanculture.com, is a British travel agent with an interest in Cuban culture who sells tours to Cuba to European tourists .
Unfortunately for Mr. Marshall , the American government has little sympathy for those who do n't share its hardline views of the Caribbean nation .
Imagine his surprise when he woke up one day and rubbed his eyes clear - unbeknown to him , his company had been blacklisted by the American government , and his hosting company Enom had shut down all his websites .
The American government 's obsession with all things Castro has led to some of the most restrictive trade sanctions in the world .
Since 1963 , the Office of Foreign Asset Control ( OFAC ) - an arm of the Treasury Department that enforces asset forfeiture decrees against international drug king pins , terrorists and assorted political undesirables - has robustly asserted its authority to seize assets of Americans or American companies that in any way , shape or form provide hard currency to the Castro regime .
But as the New York Times reported yesterday , the Treasury Department is taking an even more expansive view of its jurisdiction over the Cuban embargo , if the T&M case is indicative of things to come .
The case also threatens to renew lingering concerns in the internet community over continued American dominance of the internet .
Marshall is a British citizen living in Spain .
He sells tours to tourists in Europe , which imposes no restrictions on travel to Cuba .
His servers were located in the Caribbean .
His only proven ties to the United States were domain registrations through ICANN - approved registrar Enom and his use of the .com top level domain , whose registry is , for all intents and purposes , owned by Verisign , an American company with close ties to the American government .
The move by OFAC has troubled American experts on internet law .
Should registration through an American registrar or registry really justify American jurisdiction and the forfeiture of websites which are not even hosted on American shores ?
Pierre Boileau , come out , come out , wherever you are
The " Specially Designated Nationals " ( SDN ) list can be found online , and consists largely of internationally known drug dealers , top flight terrorists , and political strongmen and their cronies .
It can be cross - referenced by sanction program or by national origin , such as Burma , or , of course , Cuba .
Cuba , in fact , is the only country with websites even listed - and none of those were owned by or affiiated with the Cuban government .
They are all ( or were ) owned by T&M International .
It is also the only country with travel agencies listed , including agencies based in Germany , Mexico and Canada .
( Dodgy South American airlines do n't count . )
One of the troubling issues raised by the OFAC list is that many of the websites owned by T&M are purely informational , such as those listed above , and purely informational websites are supposedly exempt from the sanctions regime .
They should n't be there in the first place , whether the Cuban embargo is a waste of time or not .
And what about individuals such as Pierre Boileau of Montreal ( er , the Canadian climate scientist ? ) and Alfred Stern of Prague , who are listed as SDNs under the Cuba section without any of the usual aliases associated with terrorists or international criminals - just names on a list , residents of American allies .
How were they put on ?
How do they get off , if they should n't be there ?
Who knows ?
Whether it's an individual with an uncommonly common name , such as Alfred Stern , or an informational website , such as www.cuban-baseball.com, the procedure for removal is the same - throw yourself at the mercy of the same bureaucrats who threw you on the list in the first place , and hope they believe you .
Good luck , friend .
Steven Marshall chose to transfer his domains to registrars not under the thumb of the American government , mostly in the .net top level domain .
Here comes the free hand of the market - the outsourcing of the blacklist
Those thoughts are even less comforting in light of the direction the United States is heading as far as enforcement of financial regulations goes .
One of the most controversial trends in American government the last decade has been the outsourcing of services traditionally performed by the government .
As increased pressure , mostly via the Patriot Act , has been put on private industry to enforce government laws and regulations ( they can be severely penalized if they do not ) , banks and other institutions that fall under the jurisdiction of OFAC are increasingly turning to private companies for " compliance solutions " to help them navigate OFAC regulation and supervise their transactions .
A little - known by product of this trend has been the development of private databases that go above and beyond the SDN list supplied by the government , which are sold to financial institutions to insure that absolutely no shady transactions will ever put the bank at risk .
It is , for all intents and purposes , the outsourcing of the blacklist , to companies accountable to no one .
Accuity Solutions , the world leader in this regard , has parlayed its stranglehold as the official registrar of American bank routing numbers into a nice business selling privately developed lists of " Politically Exposed Persons " ( PEPs ) and SDNs to financial institutions concerned with potential exposure to illegal transactions .
As any American who has ever had to deal with a faulty credit report knows , trying to get a private company to correct misinformation can be like dealing with a communist bureaucracy .
Fortunately , the court system has yet to be privatized , right ?
Well , that did n't help Steven Marshall , because Enom pro-actively seized his domains and cut him off after a phone call from the OFAC - there was no legal proceeding at all .
Not even the usual draconian asset forfeiture proceedings - at least according to federal court filings at cases .
justia.com and the New York Times .
Nothing .
Of course this is Cuba , and the Bush administration has drawn an even harder line than its predecessors in this regard , and he wo n't be around much longer .
Will it matter ?
The bureaucracy , after all , is forever . ®
Olbermann : Bush administration lies like a discount department store David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday April 11 , 2008
|
Print This Email This After President Bush announced the planned withdrawal of some troops from Iraq in his speech on Thursday , MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann described the Bush administration as the " discount department store of presidencies , " comparing it to a retailer that first increases prices by one - third and then dramatically advertises a 25 % off sale .
Blasting Bush 's " dissembling , tortured logic , sophistry , and outright dishonesty , " Olbermann proposed to " fact- check Mr. Bush -- as if the word ' fact ' and the name ' Bush ' belong anywhere near each other . "
Olbermann began by examining Bush 's claim that " by July 31 , the number of US combat brigades in Iraq will be down by 25 % from last year . "
Olbermann acknowledged that the number of brigades will fall from 20 back to 15 -- the same as it was prior to the surge -- but pointed out that the actual number of troops will remain higher : 140,000 next fall , compared with 132,000 in January 2007 .
" The point of sending those five brigades , " Olbermann pointed out , " was not , we were told , to reduce violence enough that they could leave , but enough that other brigades could leave , a decision General Petraeus has now said cannot be made any earlier than September . "
Olbermann called Bush 's claim to be following Petraeus 's recommendation to postpone any decision until September " a lie , " pointing out that Bush himself had admitted in an interview recorded before the speech , " My answer is no .
I 'm not going to say that .
I 'm going to say that I agree with David . "
Having completed his scrutiny of Bush 's dissembling on troop drawdowns , Olbermann turned to an extraordinary " milestone ... as Mr. Bush , in just 15 minutes , escalated yet again his own definition of the victory that must by won by US troops . "
At 11:28 , Bush referred to " our declared goal , a free Iraq that can protect it 's people , support itself economically , and take charge of its own political affairs . "
But at 11:41 , he told US soldiers , " The day will come when Iraq 's a stable democracy that helps fight our common enemies and promote our common interests in the Middle East , and when that day arrives , you 'll come home with pride in your success . "
" ' Our common enemies , " Olbermann repeated sarcastically , " defined just minutes before as al Qaeda and Iran .
Iran , the fellow Shi'ites next door , now Iraq 's ally , thanks to Mr. Bush 's war , which ended decades of Iraq and Iran keeping each other in check . "
Olbermann finished by focusing on Bush 's cynical attitude towards the troops , noting that his promise to reduce deployments in Iraq from 15 to 12 months would not affect one single soldier currently serving there , but only those sent after next August 1 .
Olbermann singled out Bush 's claim that the military remains " resilient enough to fight and win this war on terror .
...
Our troops want to win .
... I believe the surest way to depress morale and weaken the force would be to lose in Iraq . "
" Perhaps Mr. Bush 's worst fantasy , " Olbermann concluded , " that nothing could depress troop morale more than failing to meet his goals in Iraq .
It is rendered obscenely transparent by the worst possible metric of morale .
... US troops are committing suicide at record levels . "

Human beings , like all other species on this planet , have a history .
We came into existence through a process of slow , grinding trial - and - error , occurring over geological time via the sieve of differential survival .
And like all species , our bodies and our genes reflect and bear witness to that history .
Far from being perfect , one - time creations , we still bear the scars of the evolutionary process that made us .
This post will discuss some of the lines of evidence which hint at humanity ’s past .
I wo n’t repeat that well - known example of an evolutionary vestige , the human appendix .
Instead , I ’m going to focus on a few other examples that are n’t as widely discussed .
• Toes .
It ’s only because we ’re used to having toes that we do n’t usually consider how strange they are .
Why do our feet have these stubby , non-functional digits on the ends ?
They ca n’t grip nearly as well as fingers , and we do n’t need them to balance or to walk .
( Why not just have a fused front of the foot ? )
By contrast , anyone who observes other primate species can see that they have , not two hands and two feet , but four hands , all of which are good for grasping .
As human beings gained the ability to stand and walk upright , our feet lost their grasping function , but the digits themselves , though now shrunken and largely useless , remain .
• Lanugo .
This little - known developmental phenomenon is an important clue to our mammalian past .
Lanugo is a coat of fine , downy hair that fetuses grow while in the womb , covering the entire body except for the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands .
Typically , lanugo is shed by the seventh or eighth month of pregnancy , although premature infants may retain it for several weeks after birth .
The question is why we grow it at all , and the theory of evolution can easily explain this as a vestigial characteristic retained from our furry ancestors .
• Goosebumps .
Fitting neatly together with lanugo is the vestigial human trait called the pilomotor reflex .
When a person is cold or frightened , tiny muscles at the base of each hair contract , causing body hair to stand on end .
In animals with thicker fur , this is a useful reflex : erect hairs trap air to create a layer of insulation , and they also make the animal appear larger and more intimidating .
In humans , however , it is pointless .
Like lanugo , goosebumps are a giveaway clue indicating that relatively hairless human beings are descended from furry progenitors .
• Hiccups .
Yes , hiccups are a sign of humanity ’s evolutionary past .
In fact , unlike goosebumps or lanugo , which merely point to our shared history with hairier mammals , hiccups point all the way back to the time when humanity ’s ancestors were amphibians .
According to this article by Neil Shubin ( HT : The Panda ’s Thumb ) , the hiccup reflex is controlled by an area of the brain that we share with tadpoles .
The hiccup consists of a sharp inhalation followed by a closing of the glottis ( the valve at the top of the windpipe ) .
In tadpoles , which have this same reflex , the inhalation draws water into the mouth , where the gills can process the oxygen it contains , but closes the glottis so the water does not enter the lungs .
For tadpoles , it ’s a vital breathing reflex ; in humans , it ’s a hiccup .
And the same measures that often arrest hiccups in human beings ( inhaling carbon dioxide , stretching the chest wall by taking a deep breath ) also stop the gill - breathing reflex in tadpoles .
• The true human tail .
One of the most shocking – for creationists , anyway – human atavisms is the true human tail .
On rare occasions , human infants are born with short , non-prehensile , but undeniably real tails , up to several inches in length and containing nerves , blood vessels , muscle fibers , and sometimes even extra vertebrae .
They can move through voluntary muscle contraction .
In fact , all human embryos grow tails while in the womb , and normally they are reabsorbed before birth .
The true human tail is the result when this does not happen .
Usually they are surgically removed , although they are benign .
For an evolutionary scientist , the reason why we grow them is obvious : we are descended from an ancestor species which had them .
For creationists , who claim that human beings were created complete and separate as we currently are , it must be difficult to explain why we have so many vestigial structures that link us to other species of mammals .
• The fused chromosome 2 .
It ’s long been known that human beings have 23 pairs of chromosomes , while the other great apes such as gorillas and chimpanzees have 24 .
It is all but impossible that the lineage that led to humans could have completely lost all this genetic material and still produced a viable organism .
Where , then , did the extra chromosomes go ?
Chromosomes are tipped with distinctive segments of DNA called telomeres and have another special segment called a centromere in the middle .
Lo and behold , human chromosome 2 has a telomere on one end , then an inactivated centromere , then a segment of telomeres in the middle , then another centromere , then a final telomere – the structure we would expect to find if two chromosomes had fused into one .
When we compare this chromosome to the two appropriate ape chromosomes , we find a compelling match , indicating that this chromosomal fusion occurred at some point after the human lineage split from our ape relatives .
• The vitamin C pseudogene .
Unlike most mammals , human beings ca n’t synthesize their own vitamin C ; we must ingest it as part of our diet , or else we get the disease of scurvy .
Under the hypothesis of special creation , humans were created this way from the beginning , so we would n’t expect evidence that we once had this ability but have since lost it .
However , according to evolution , we are descended from other mammals , and since most mammals can make their own vitamin C , we ’d expect that human ancestors did have this ability at some point as well .
If this is so , our genes may preserve evidence of it .
Sure enough , human beings have a version of the vitamin C synthesis gene , but ours is “ broken ” , disabled by mutations .
Our primate relatives , who also lack this ability , also have broken versions of the gene .
Just as evolutionary theory would predict , the same disabling mutations that exist in the human gene can be found in the genes of chimpanzees , orangutans , and macaques – compelling evidence that we are all descended from a primate common ancestor who incurred this mutation at some point in the past .
( It ’s likely that this mutation was n’t selected against because all primate diets are rich in fruit , providing abundant vitamin C. )
Taken together , the scars of evolution provide abundant evidence of humanity ’s history .
Like all species on this planet , we are not unique special creations .
We are one end result of a long process of mutation sieved through selection , a countless series of adaptive compromises and tradeoffs .
Our very bodies testify to the natural forces that have shaped us through the vast expanses of time .
Way before the sun peeks over the horizon , a few chosen people awaken from their slumber and dive head first into their day .
These chosen few accomplish a ton before the rest of us would ever consider rising from our nice warm beds .
Who are these juggernauts that have command over the morning hours ?
In theory , your productivity level should n’t differ if you rise at 4 am or 11 am .
What matters is the quality of sleep that ’s giving your mind and body sufficient time to recover .
These early rising juggernauts , these unstoppable agents of productivity , they see things differently .
They see these early hours as their chance to lay claim to their share of the day .
They rise with purpose , act with determination , and achieve ruthlessly .
The sun has not caught me in bed in fifty years .
– Thomas Jefferson
The world is in awe of these special people , so let ’s take a look at what pops them out of bed like a toaster strudel and what gets them up , sometimes before the alarm !
Appointment With Waking
The harsh truth about the human body is that we ’re creatures of habit .
In some ways this can be extremely inconvenient when trying to take on new things .
However , if we allow ourselves to live within the rules of our body ’s natural cycle , which is a 24 - hour circadian rhythm , we will be pleased with the body ’s functionality .
This means that when you find a waking hour that will work best for you each day of the week , you should stick to it .
This will allow your body to want to support you in your endeavor of waking up , and rise you out of bed feeling fresh as a daisy .
The King and The Pauper Way Of Eating
The way our bodies function optimally is if we eat like a king in the morning and a pauper in the evening .
This means that it ’s best to eat heavier , bigger portions in the morning because these meals will give us high energy throughout the day and then burn off .
Eating like a pauper , meaning small light meals , in the evening allows us to go to sleep on an empty stomach .
If your body is functioning normally , and you do n’t have stomach ulcers , going to sleep on a mostly empty stomach will allow you to sleep better .
This nightly fast allows your body to take it ’s focus away from digestion and put it towards repair and rejuvenation of the body ’s cells .
Living With Purpose
Young children will do anything to avoid going to sleep at night .
These same children are also the ones that ca n’t wait to get out of bed first thing in the world .
The simple reason for this non-lazy behavior is that they do n’t want to miss a thing .
As adults we may need more persuasion than ‘ not wanting to miss a thing ’ .
This is why we take extra steps in creating fun , life changing goals , and scheduling specific ways of how we ’ll get a step closer to these goals during this coming day .
What we all need is not necessary a cause we ’re willing to die for , but at least a cause we ’re willing to LIVE for .
Plan Your Day
We can say we ’re going to live with purpose , but unless we plan , we can tell ourselves that we ’ll start living with purpose next week , or the week after that .
Planning is one of the fundamental ways to maximize your mind to achieve your goals , and as such it plays a critical role in allowing us to have an awesome day , everyday .
We need not do more than take 15 minutes the night before to succinctly organize the next days schedule .
A schedule complete with waking time , most important things of the day , eating and recreational allowances .
Having a tight schedule allows me to live out my day with definitive purpose , while getting more done , having more fun , and not wasting precious moments of my life .
“ Happy people plan actions , they do n’t plan results ” – Dennis Wholey
The Water Hack
A bit of water before bed and half a liter as soon as you get up .
The water before bed will serve in the rejuvenation process we mentioned above .
While you sleep all your cells will fill up with this fresh water and create an over all well being within your body .
The water in the morning does two things .
One is it provides your first dose of water to get your mind and body going .
Another function , as told to me by my endocrinology teacher ( a very qualified person to say this ) , is that a dose of water in the morning triggers a cascade of physiological functions that engages your digestive system and causes you to excrete feces .
You ’ll feel nice and light first thing in the morning !
Work That Body
In number 1 above I mentioned that our bodies adapt around a 24 - hour circadian rhythm .
This works for sleep , eating , exercise , and many other bodily functions .
We ’re a pretty efficient physiological machine when you think about it .
This is why getting a dose of exercise is optimal in the morning .
It gets the blood flowing and stimulates you to function on a higher level .
“ Those who think they have not time for bodily exercise will sooner or later have to find time for illness . ” – Edward Stanley
Once you ’re used to this routine , your body will prepare by providing you with high energy before you start to work out .
As you can see , if you wake up with this high energy , you ’re going to just pop out of bed .
Have ‘ Me’ Time
No morning is completely satisfying unless you ’ve scheduled in some ‘ Me ’ time .
Whether you enjoy meditating to clear you mind and give you laser sharp focus , or reading to gain some new knowledge about the world , make sure you schedule in this time .
There may very a variety of things you enjoy doing , so this will be custom tailored to the individual .
The point is that when you have something you REALLY enjoy doing right when you get up , you wo n’t be able to wait until that alarm goes off till you jump out of bed and get to it !
See , that ’s all it takes ! 🙂

Washington
BEHIND any successful politician lies a usable contradiction , and John McCain ’s is this :
We love him ( and occasionally hate him ) for his stubborn individualism , yet his politics are best understood as a decade - long attack on the individual .
The presumptive presidential nominee of the Republican Party has seduced the press and the public with frank confessions of his failings , from his hard - living flyboy days to his adulterous first marriage to the Keating Five scandal .
But in both legislation and rhetoric , Mr. McCain has consistently sought to restrict the very freedoms he once exercised , in the common national enterprise of “ serving a cause greater than self - interest . ”
Such sentiment can sound stirring coming from a lone citizen freely choosing public service .
But from a potential president , Mr. McCain ’s exaltation of sacrifice over the private pursuit of happiness 
“ I did it out of patriotism , not for profit , ” he snarled to Mitt Romney during the final Republican presidential debate  reflects a worryingly militaristic view of citizenship .
“ We are fast becoming a nation of alienating individualists , unwilling to put the unifying values of patriotism ahead of our narrow self - interests , ” Mr. McCain warned in a speech during his 2000 presidential campaign .
He added that “ cynicism threatens to become a ceiling on our greatness . ”
Most immigrants are now from Asia and the Middle East
The 2006 census counted more than 6 m foreign - born people out of Canada 's population of 31.2 m , the highest ratio of immigrants since the 1930s .
The immigrant population grew four times as fast as the Canadian - born population between 2001 - 2006 .
Nearly 60 % of the newcomers came from Asia and the Middle East .
Growth
The new data illustrate that Canada is experiencing another great wave of immigration - led population growth .
Canada 's statistics office , Statistics Canada , has previously reported that Canada experienced the highest population growth rate of the Group of Eight industrialised countries from 2001 to 2006 .
The traditional Anglo - European face of Canada is changing
In 1971 , Europeans accounted for 61.6 % of immigrants , while in 2006 they accounted for 16.1 % of recent immigrants - the second - largest group .
Combined with declining birth rates , the census data points to significant ethnic and cultural changes as Canada looks due to become reliant on immigration for population growth by around 2030 .
People speaking neither French nor English as their native language now make up 20 % of the total population , the highest recorded in the recent past .
Chinese languages are now the third most commonly spoken , followed by Italian , German , Punjabi , Spanish , Arabic , Tagalog and Portuguese .
The three largest cities of Toronto , Montreal and Vancouver continue to attract the bulk of new immigrants , at nearly 70 % .
Freedom of speech and digital rights groups plan to argue on its behalf at a legal hearing on 29 February .
The hearing will decide whether to continue a court order that removed links to some of the Wikileaks sites from the net 's address books .
The order was sought by Swiss bank Julius Baer after internal documents were placed on Wikileaks .
Speech test
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation are planning to " intervene " for Wikileaks at the continuation hearing .
The rights groups claim the order that knocked Wikileaks offline in the US raises " serious First Amendment concerns " .
" Blocking access to the entire site in response to a few documents posted there completely disregards the public 's right to know , " said ACLU attorney Ann Brick in a statement .
The order granted for Julius Baer by US district judge Jeffrey White ordered Dynadot - the company that hosts the Wikileaks website in America - to remove all mentions of the site from its address books .
Anyone in the US trying to find Wikileaks would have to consult this address list to find the website .
The bank took the action in mid-February because , it is understood , the documents hosted could have had an impact on a separate case being heard in Switzerland .
Julius
Baer said the case had nothing to do with free speech .
" This action has been brought solely to prevent the unlawful dissemination of stolen bank records and personal account information of its customers , " lawyers for the bank wrote in court papers .
" Many of those documents have also been altered and forged , " said the legal filing .
However , the attempt to get the documents removed spurred many other sites to host them and Wikileaks ' sites in other countries were largely unaffected by the ruling .
The US site itself was also reachable by those that knew its numerical net address rather than just its English name .
In total , 18 organisations have pledged support for Wikileaks in documents filed to the US court that will hear the legal argument .
Editor 's note : CNN Contributor Roland Martin has listened to several of the sermons of Rev. Jeremiah Wright from Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago .
Portions of the sermons have been excerpted in recent stories .
As this whole sordid episode regarding the sermons of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright has played out over the last week , I wanted to understand what he ACTUALLY said in this speech .
I 've been saying all week on CNN that context is important , and I just wanted to know what the heck is going on .
I have now actually listened to the sermon Rev. Wright gave after September 11 titled , " The Day of Jerusalem 's Fall . "
It was delivered on Sept. 16 , 2001 .
One of the most controversial statements in this sermon was when he mentioned " chickens coming home to roost . "
He was actually quoting Edward Peck , former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and deputy director of President Reagan 's terrorism task force , who was speaking on FOX News .
That 's what he told the congregation .
He was quoting Peck as saying that America 's foreign policy has put the nation in peril :
" I heard Ambassador Peck on an interview yesterday did anybody else see or hear him ?
He was on FOX News , this is a white man , and he was upsetting the FOX News commentators to no end , he pointed out , a white man , an ambassador , he pointed out that what Malcolm X said when he was silenced by Elijah Mohammad was in fact true , he said Americas chickens , are coming home to roost . ”
" We took this country by terror away from the Sioux , the Apache , Arikara , the Comanche , the Arapaho , the Navajo .
Terrorism .
" We took Africans away from their country to build our way of ease and kept them enslaved and living in fear .
Terrorism .
" We bombed Grenada and killed innocent civilians , babies , non-military personnel .
" We bombed the black civilian community of Panama with stealth bombers and killed unarmed teenage and toddlers , pregnant mothers and hard working fathers .
" We bombed Qaddafi 's home , and killed his child .
Blessed are they who bash your children 's head against the rock .
" We bombed Iraq .
We killed unarmed civilians trying to make a living .
We bombed a plant in Sudan to pay back for the attack on our embassy , killed hundreds of hard working people , mothers and fathers who left home to go that day not knowing that they 'd never get back home .
" We bombed Hiroshima .
We bombed Nagasaki , and we nuked far more than the thousands in New York and the Pentagon and we never batted an eye .
" Kids playing in the playground .
Mothers picking up children after school .
Civilians , not soldiers , people just trying to make it day by day .
" We have supported state terrorism against the Palestinians and black South Africans , and now we are indignant because the stuff that we have done overseas is now brought right back into our own front yards .
America 's chickens are coming home to roost .
" Violence begets violence .
Hatred begets hatred .
And terrorism begets terrorism .
A white ambassador said that y'all , not a black militant .
Not a reverend who preaches about racism .
An ambassador whose eyes are wide open and who is trying to get us to wake up and move away from this dangerous precipice upon which we are now poised .
The ambassador said the people we have wounded do n't have the military capability we have .
But they do have individuals who are willing to die and take thousands with them .
And we need to come to grips with that . "
He went on to describe seeing the photos of the aftermath of 9/11 because he was in Newark , N.J. , when the planes struck .
After turning on the TV and seeing the second plane slam into one of the twin towers , he spoke passionately about what if you never got a chance to say hello to your family again .
" What is the state of your family ? " he asked .
And then he told his congregation that he loved them and asked the church to tell each other they loved themselves .
His sermon thesis :
1 . This is a time for self - examination of ourselves and our families .
2 . This is a time for social transformation ( then he went on to say they wo n't put me on PBS or national cable for what I 'm about to say .
Talk about prophetic ! )
" We have got to change the way we have been doing things as a society , " he said .
Wright then said we can't stop messing over people and thinking they can't touch us .
He said we may need to declare war on racism , injustice , and greed , instead of war on other countries .
" Maybe we need to declare war on AIDS .
In five minutes the Congress found $ 40 billion to rebuild New York and the families that died in sudden death , do you think we can find the money to make medicine available for people who are dying a slow death ?
Maybe we need to declare war on the nation 's healthcare system that leaves the nation 's poor with no health coverage ?
Maybe we need to declare war on the mishandled educational system and provide quality education for everybody , every citizen , based on their ability to learn , not their ability to pay .
This is a time for social transformation . "
3 . This is time to tell God thank you for all that he has provided and that he gave him and others another chance to do His will .
By the way , nowhere in this sermon did he said " God damn America . "
I 'm not sure which sermon that came from .
This does n't explain anything away , nor does it absolve Wright of using the N - word , but what it does do is add an accurate perspective to this conversation .
The point that I have always made as a journalist is that our job is to seek the truth , and not the partial truth .
I am also listening to the other sermons delivered by Rev. Wright that have been the subject of controversy .
And let me be clear :
Where I believe he was wrong and not justified in what he said based upon the facts , I will say so .
But where the facts support his argument , that will also be said .
So stay tuned .

In response to the numerous reports of molten metal under ground zero , defenders of the official version of 9/11 have tried to argue that it was not steel , but some other kind of metal with a lower melting point .
Are they right ?
Let 's take a look at what eyewitnesses say .
Here are what top experts who eyewitnessed the molten metal say :
The structural engineer responsible for the design of the WTC , described fires still burning and molten steel still running 21 days after the attacks ( page 3 )
still running 21 days after the attacks ( page 3 )
The head of a team of scientists studying the potential health effects of 9/11 , reported , " Fires are still actively burning and the smoke is very intense .
In some pockets now being uncovered , they are finding molten steel "
"
According to reporter Christopher Bollyn , MarkLoizeaux , president the world 's top demolition company , and Peter Tully , head of a large construction firm , said the following :
Tully told AFP that he had seen pools of " literally molten steel " in the rubble .
Loizeaux confirmed this : " Yes , hot spots of molten steel in the basements , " he said , " at the bottom of the elevator shafts of the main towers , down seven levels . "
The molten steel was found " three , four , and five weeks later , when the rubble was being removed , " he said .
He confirmed that molten steel was also found at WTC 7 , which mysteriously collapsed in the late afternoon .
Here 's what eyewitness firefighters say :
New York firefighters recalled in a documentary film , " heat so intense they encountered rivers of molten steel "
"
A NY firefighter described molten steel flowing at ground zero , and said it was like a " foundry " or like " lava "
flowing at ground zero , and said it was like a " foundry " or like " lava "
According to a member of New York Air National Guard 's 109th Air Wing , who was at Ground Zero from September 22 to October 6 , " One fireman told us that there was still molten steel at the heart of the towers ' remains .
Firemen sprayed water to cool the debris down but the heat remained intense enough at the surface to melt their boots "

Firemen sprayed water to cool the debris down but the heat remained intense enough at the surface to melt their boots "
As late as five months after the attacks , in February 2002 , firefighter Joe O'Toole saw a steel beam being lifted from deep underground at Ground Zero , which , he says , " was dripping from the molten steel "

Here 's what other credible eyewitnesses say :

The modern nation of Iraq is built upon foundations that go back to some of humanity 's earliest complex cultures .
It was in Iraq , also known as Mesopotamia , that Babylonian king Hammurabi regularized the law in the Code of Hammurabi , c. 1772 BCE .
Under Hammurabi's system , society would inflict upon a criminal the same harm that the criminal had inflicted upon his victim .
This is codified in the famous dictum , " An eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth . "
More recent Iraqi history , however , tends to support the Mahatma Gandhi 's take on this rule .
He is supposed to have said that " An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind . "
Capital and Major Cities
Capital : Baghdad , population 9,500,000 ( 2008 estimate )
Major cities : Mosul , 3,000,000
Basra , 2,300,000
Arbil , 1,294,000
Kirkuk , 1,200,000
Government of Iraq
The Republic of Iraq is a parliamentary democracy .
The head of state is the president , currently Jalal Talabani , while the head of government is Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki .
The unicameral parliament is called the Council of Representatives ; its 325 members serve four - year terms .
Eight of those seats are specifically reserved for ethnic or religious minorities .
Iraq 's judiciary system consists of the Higher Judicial Council , the Federal Supreme Court , the Federal Court of Cassation , and lower courts .
( " Cassation " literally means " to quash " - it is another term for appeals , evidently taken from the French legal system . )
Population
Iraq has a total population of about 30.4 million .
The population growth rate is an estimated 2.4 % .
About 66 % of Iraqis live in urban areas .
Some 75 - 80 % of Iraqis are Arabs .
Another 15 - 20 % are Kurds , by far the largest ethnic minority ; they live primarily in northern Iraq .
The remaining roughly 5 % of the population is made up of Turkomen , Assyrians , Armenians , Chaldeans and other ethnic groups .
Languages
Both Arabic and Kurdish are official languages of Iraq .
Kurdish is an Indo - European language related to Iranian languages .
Minority languages in Iraq include Turkoman , which is a Turkic language ; Assyrian , a Neo-Aramaic language of the Semitic language family ; and Armenian , an Indo - European language with possible Greek roots .
Thus , although the total number of languages spoken in Iraq is not high , the linguistic variety is great .
Religion
Iraq is an overwhelmingly Muslim country , with an estimated 97 % of the population following Islam .
Perhaps , unfortunately , it is also among the most evenly divided countries on Earth in terms of Sunni and Shi'a populations ; 60 to 65 % of Iraqis are Shi'a , while 32 to 37 % are Sunni .
Under Saddam Hussein , the Sunni minority controlled the government , often persecuting Shi'as .
Since the new constitution was implemented in 2005 , Iraq is supposed to be a democratic country , but the Shi'a / Sunni split is a source of much tension as the nation sorts out a new form of government .
Iraq also has a small Christian community , around 3 % of the population .
During the nearly decade - long war following the US - led invasion in 2003 , many Christians fled Iraq for Lebanon , Syria , Jordan , or western countries .
Geography
Iraq is a desert country , but it is watered by two major rivers - the Tigris and the Euphrates .
Only 12 % of Iraq 's land is arable .
It controls a 58 km ( 36 miles ) coast on the Persian Gulf , where the two rivers empty into the Indian Ocean .
Iraq is bordered by Iran to the east , Turkey and Syria to the north , Jordan and Saudi Arabia to the west , and Kuwait to the southeast .
Its highest point is Cheekah Dar , a mountain in the north of the country , at 3,611 m ( 11,847 feet ) .
Its lowest point is sea level .
Climate
As a subtropical desert , Iraq experiences extreme seasonal variation in temperature .
In parts of the country , July and August temperatures average over 48 °C ( 118 °F ) .
During the rainy winter months of December through March , however , temperatures drop below freezing not infrequently .
Some years , heavy mountain snow in the north produces dangerous flooding on the rivers .
The lowest temperature recorded in Iraq was - 14 °C ( 7 °F ) .
The highest temperature was 54°C ( 129°F ) .
Another key feature of Iraq 's climate is the sharqi , a southerly wind that blows from April through early June , and again in October and November .
It gusts up to 80 kilometers per hour ( 50 mph ) , causing sandstorms that can be seen from space .
Economy
The economy of Iraq is all about oil ; " black gold " provides more than 90 % of government revenue and accounts for 80 % of the country 's foreign exchange income .
As of 2011 , Iraq was producing 1.9 million barrels per day of oil , while consuming 700,000 barrels per day domestically .
( Even as it exports almost 2 million barrels per day , Iraq also imports 230,000 barrels per day . )
Since the start of the US - led War in Iraq in 2003 , foreign aid has become a major component of Iraq 's economy , as well .
The US has pumped some $ 58 billion dollars worth of aid into the country between 2003 and 2011 ; other nations have pledged an additional $ 33 billion in reconstruction aid .
Iraq 's workforce is employed primarily in the service sector , although about 15 to 22 % work in agriculture .
The unemployment rate is around 15 % , and an estimated 25 % of Iraqis live below the poverty line .
The Iraqi currency is the dinar .
As of February 2012 , $ 1 US is equal to 1,163 dinars .
History of Iraq
Part of the Fertile Crescent , Iraq was one of the early sites of complex human civilization and agricultural practice .
Once called Mesopotamia , Iraq was the seat of the Sumerian and Babylonian cultures c. 4,000 - 500 BCE .
During this early period , Mesopotamians invented or refined technologies such as writing and irrigation ; the famous King Hammurabi ( r. 1792 - 1750 BCE ) recorded the law in the Code of Hammurabi , and over a thousand of years later , Nebuchadnezzar II ( r. 605 - 562 BCE ) built the incredible Hanging Gardens of Babylon .
After about 500 BCE , Iraq was ruled by a succession of Persian dynasties , such as the Achaemenids , the Parthians , the Sassanids and the Seleucids .
Although local governments existed in Iraq , they were under Iranian control until the 600s CE .
In 633 , the year after the Prophet Muhammad died , a Muslim army under Khalid ibn Walid invaded Iraq .
By 651 , the soldiers of Islam had brought down the Sassanid Empire in Persia and began to Islamicize the region that is now Iraq and Iran .
Between 661 and 750 , Iraq was a dominion of the Umayyad Caliphate , which ruled from Damascus ( now in Syria ) .
The Abbasid Caliphate , which ruled the Middle East and North Africa from 750 to 1258 , decided to build a new capital closer to the political power hub of Persia .
It built the city of Baghdad , which became a center of Islamic art and learning .
In 1258 , catastrophe struck the Abbasids and Iraq in the form the Mongols under Hulagu Khan , a grandson of Genghis Khan .
The Mongols demanded that Baghdad surrender , but the Caliph Al - Mustasim refused .
Hulagu 's troops laid siege to Baghdad , taking the city with at least 200,000 Iraqi dead .
The Mongols also burned the Grand Library of Baghdad and its wonderful collection of documents - one of the great crimes of history .
The caliph himself was executed by being rolled in a carpet and trampled by horses ; this was an honorable death in Mongol culture because none of the caliph 's noble blood touched the ground .
Hulagu 's army would meet defeat by the Egyptian Mamluk enslaved people - army in the Battle of Ayn Jalut .
In the Mongols ' wake , however , the Black Death carried away about a third of Iraq 's population .
In 1401 , Timur the Lame ( Tamerlane ) captured Baghdad and ordered another massacre of its people .
Timur 's fierce army only controlled Iraq for a few years and was supplanted by the Ottoman Turks .
The Ottoman Empire would rule Iraq from the fifteenth century through 1917 when Britain wrested the Middle East from Turkish control and the Ottoman Empire collapsed .
Iraq Under Britain
Under the British / French plan to divide the Middle East , the 1916 Sykes - Picot Agreement , Iraq became part of the British Mandate .
On November 11 , 1920 , the region became a British mandate under the League of Nations , called the " State of Iraq . "
Britain brought in a ( Sunni ) Hashemite king from the region of Mecca and Medina , now in Saudi Arabia , to rule over the primarily Shi'a Iraqis and Kurds of Iraq , sparking widespread discontent and rebellion .
In 1932 , Iraq gained nominal independence from Britain , although the British - appointed King Faisal still ruled the country and the British military had special rights in Iraq .
The Hashemites ruled until 1958 when King Faisal II was assassinated in a coup led by Brigadier General Abd al - Karim Qasim .
This signaled the beginning of a rule by a series of strongmen over Iraq , which lasted through 2003 .
Qasim 's rule survived for just five years , before being overthrown in turn by Colonel Abdul Salam Arif in February of 1963 .
Three years later , Arif 's brother took power after the colonel died ; however , he would rule Iraq for just two years before being deposed by a Ba'ath Party - led coup in 1968 .
The Ba'athist government was led by Ahmed Hasan Al - Bakir at first , but he was slowly elbowed aside over the next decade by Saddam Hussein .
Saddam Hussein formally seized power as president of Iraq in 1979 .
The following year , feeling threatened by rhetoric from the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the new leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran , Saddam Hussein launched an invasion of Iran that led to the eight - year - long Iran - Iraq War .
Hussein himself was a secularist , but the Ba'ath Party was dominated by Sunnis .
Khomeini hoped that Iraq 's Shi'ite majority would rise up against Hussein in an Iranian Revolution - style movement , but that did not happen .
With support from the Gulf Arab states and the United States , Saddam Hussein was able to fight the Iranians to a stalemate .
He also took the opportunity to use chemical weapons against tens of thousands of Kurdish and Marsh Arab civilians within his own country , as well as against the Iranian troops , in blatant violation of international treaty norms and standards .
Its economy ravaged by the Iran - Iraq War , Iraq decided to invade the small but wealthy neighboring nation of Kuwait in 1990 .
Saddam Hussein announced that he had annexed Kuwait ; when he refused to withdraw , the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to take military action in 1991 in order to oust the Iraqis .
An international coalition led by the United States ( which had been allied with Iraq just three years earlier ) routed the Iraqi Army in a matter of months , but Saddam Hussein 's troops set fire to Kuwaiti oil wells on their way out , causing an ecological disaster along the Persian Gulf coast .
This fighting would come to be known as the First Gulf War .
Following the First Gulf War , the United States patrolled a no- fly zone over the Kurdish north of Iraq to protect civilians there from Saddam Hussein 's government ; Iraqi Kurdistan began to function as a separate country , even while nominally still part of Iraq .
Throughout the 1990s , the international community was concerned that Saddam Hussein 's government was trying to develop nuclear weapons .
In 1993 , the US also learned that Hussein had made a plan to assassinate President George H. W. Bush during the First Gulf War .
The Iraqis allowed UN weapons inspectors into the country , but expelled them in 1998 , claiming that they were CIA spies .
In October of that year , US President Bill Clinton called for " regime change " in Iraq .
After George W. Bush became president of the United States in 2000 , his administration began to prepare for a war against Iraq .
Bush the younger resented Saddam Hussein 's plans to kill Bush the elder and made the case that Iraq was developing nuclear weapons despite the rather flimsy evidence .
The September 11 , 2001 attacks on New York and Washington DC gave Bush the political cover he needed to launch a Second Gulf War , even though Saddam Hussein 's government had nothing to do with al - Qaeda or the 9/11 attacks .
Iraq War
The Iraq War began on March 20 , 2003 , when a US - led coalition invaded Iraq from Kuwait .
The coalition drove the Ba'athist regime out of power , installing an Iraqi Interim Government in June of 2004 , and organizing free elections for October of 2005 .
Saddam Hussein went into hiding but was captured by US troops on December 13 , 2003 .
In the chaos , sectarian violence broke out across the country between the Shi'a majority and the Sunni minority ; al - Qaeda seized the opportunity to establish a presence in Iraq .
Iraq 's interim government tried Saddam Hussein for the killing of Iraqi Shi'ites in 1982 and sentenced him to death .
Saddam Hussein was hanged on December 30 , 2006 .
After a " surge " of troops to quell violence in 2007 - 2008 , the US withdrew from Baghdad in June of 2009 and left Iraq completely in December of 2011 .

Have you ever been drawn to the calm beauty of abandoned buildings , or even tempted to explore forbidden structures in the urban landscape ?
For some , urban exploration is a hobby or even a mission .
Many urban explorers are also adept photographers who create amazing images showing the beauty of abandoned spaces .
Places : Urban explorers visit and document sites and spaces few venture into .
Many of these are expressly off - limits and illegal , from abandoned sewer , utility or transit tunnels to residential , commercial and institutional buildings .
Though approaches to urban exploration evolve , related practices date back hundreds of years .
Equipment : Urban explorations can be as simple as bypassing warning signs and ducking under red tape .
However , they can also be complex and require varying amounts of equipment .
The trick , of course , is knowing ahead of time as much as possible about the site or space you are planning to explore .

The Rebirth of Buses : N.Y. to D.C. for $ 1 Supercheap fares and high gas prices fuel a renaissance in bus travel .
March 28 , 2008  -- ALONG INTERSTATE
95 -- Imagine traveling from New York to Washington -- and back -- for less than the cost of a gallon of gas .
Sounds impossible , right ?
Not anymore .
A new bus line started service Thursday offering tickets on the well - traveled route for as low as $ 1 each way .
The company , called BoltBus , is the latest in a series of supercheap bus lines across the country trying to woo travelers away from trains , planes and their own cars .
So what do you get for $ 1 ?
I decided to find out for myself .
First , I must point out that not everybody gets that $ 1 fare .
BoltBus offers at least one seat on each bus for that rockbottom price .
Then as seats start to fill up , the price goes up .
If you are , say , the fourth person to book a seat , it might cost $ 7 .
Wait a little longer , maybe $ 10 or $ 15 .
The top price is $ 20 if booked online , $ 25 if you buy your ticket last - minute from the driver .
( There is also a 50 - cent surcharge for booking online . )
" The earlier you book the seat , the cheaper it will be , " said Dustin Clark , a spokesman for the bus line .
Basically , if you want a cheap trip you need to book early and do it over the Internet with a credit card .
That is in stark contrast to Greyhound 's traditional service where , Clark said , 90 percent of the tickets are purchased at bus terminals or over the phone .
Another change that saves money : BoltBus does n't use the normal city bus depots .
The bus picks up and drops off passengers at a designated street corner in each city .
With the train and the plane -- or even a regular Greyhound bus -- there is usually an indoor or covered place to sit and wait .
For my trip on BoltBus , I found myself standing on a street corner in Washington , D.C. , waiting .
And then it started to rain .
Passengers huddled together under umbrellas , counting down the minutes until the bus arrived .
I had to remind myself :
The ticket cost only a dollar .
Bus Traffic Grows
BoltBus -- a joint operation of Greyhound and Peter Pan bus lines -- is part of a growing number of bus companies trying to draw the American public back to motor coaches .
U.S. cities lost nearly one - third of their scheduled intercity bus service between 1960 and 1980 , and more than half of the remaining service between 1980 and early 2006 , according to a study by the Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development at DePaul University in Chicago .
Joseph Schwieterman , a DePaul professor and director of the institute , said that in those decades buses were filled with low - income travelers and almost nobody else .
" Women traveling alone , who were once the staple of the bus market , fled partly out of fears about safety , " he said .
" The inner cities also deteriorated , which made bus stations places to avoid .
And of course , discount airline travel became widely pervasive . "
Schwieterman said that now , after those decades of decline , bus travel is having a national resurgence in popularity .
" Young people do n't feel any particular stigma riding the bus , unlike us old - timers who came to see buses as a mode of last resort , " he said .
" It 's been a remarkable combination of factors ranging from sky - high fuel costs to growing frustration with traffic congestion . "
While bus travel has started to rebound , it is still consumed by individuals traveling alone for vacation or to visit friends and family .
" There are a few briefcase carrying business travelers onboard , and we still do n't see a lot of families , " Schwieterman said .
" It tends to be younger people and leisure travelers coming to the big city . "
The BoltBus Crowd
My fellow passengers were mostly those who decided to make the trip simply because the fare was so low .
Andrea Nazarian , from Gaithersburg , Md. , and her two sons and mother decided to spend a night in New York .
Their plan : visit the Museum of Modern Art , one of the few sites they have not seen in New York .
( By the way , admission to the museum is $ 20 , making the bus ride really seem like a bargain . )
So why did the family decide to take the trip ?
" Because it was a dollar , " Nazarian said , adding that it cost her more to take the subway to the bus stop .
In the past , the family has driven , flown and taken the train .
This was its first time taking the bus .
Did they think there was a stigma to taking a bus ?
" I do n't think so anymore , " Nazarian said .
" Especially with the price of gas , who cares ? "
Doris Henry and her daughter , Neisha , were doing a day trip to New York .
" I saw $ 1 and I could n't believe it , " Henry said .
" So I 'm taking a day to spend some quality time with my daughter . "
" You can't compare it to driving .
Considering gas and tolls , it 's quite a bargain , " she added .
" I love Amtrak , but it 's expensive . "
Smart Marketing
BoltBus is just the latest transportation company to lure passengers in with the promise of ridiculously low prices .
The idea is to catch somebody 's attention who might have never thought about making the trip .
Last year , Skybus Airlines launched service with at least one seat on each of its flights for $ 10 .
And just this week , Spirit Airlines was running another ridiculously low - priced promotion , offering some seats for a penny .
BoltBus even boards by groups -- A , B , C , -- a system pioneered by discounter Southwest Airlines .
Two years ago , Coach USA launched a discount bus line called Megabus , which offered intercity travel for as low as $ 1 .
It started with service from Chicago to other Midwest cities such as Detroit , St. Louis , Milwaukee and Cleveland .
In August , the company added bus routes out of Los Angeles to other California cities and to Las Vegas and Phoenix .
Now Megabus plans to go head - to - head with BoltBus on the East Coast .
BoltBus plans to start service between New York and Boston sometime in April , and its Web site also mentions planned service to Philadelphia .
Megabus plans to serve all those cities plus Baltimore , Buffalo , N.Y. , and Toronto .
These lines have to compete with so - called Chinatown buses : low - fare bus lines like Fung Wah and Lucky Star that operate between the two cities '
Chinese neighborhoods , as well as other new upstarts , including DC2NY , Vamoose and Washington DeLuxe .
Also trying to get a piece of the action is LimoLiner , which casts itself as an upscale bus with leather seats , a private rear cabin for up to 10 people to hold meetings , complimentary snacks and drinks , satellite TV with news channels and fresh flowers in the bathroom , the bus line 's " signature touch . "
LimoLiner , however , charges a hefty $ 89 one way between New York and Boston .
For $ 1 , BoltBus was n't quite as lavish .
But BoltBus and other bus companies are trying to shed the image held by many Americans of buses being rundown and uncomfortable .
The new sales pitch : free wireless Internet and power outlets .
I have to admit , the ability to surf the Web on my laptop was a big selling point for me -- until I actually got on the bus .
The connection was slow and I hit a few dead zones .
There was only one other person on my half - full bus who had a laptop out .
Also missing : a place to put my laptop .
BoltBus does n't have any tray tables , leaving my laptop to rest on , well , my lap .
The bus was scheduled to take just four hours , compared with Greyhound 's express bus at 4 hours 20 minutes .
( How do they cut out those 20 minutes ?
Clark , the spokesman for both companies said , " I do n't know . " )
Regardless , the bus was 27 minutes late .
But did I care ?
No. it still cost less than a penny for each mile I traveled .
Wikipedia for Cheminformatics - A Simple Web API for Finding CAS Numbers in Compound Monographs 2008-04-02T00:00:00.000Z
Good news for cheminformatics : Chemical Abstracts Service ( CAS ) has agreed to help Wikipedia users curate its collection of CAS numbers .
As a result of the diligence of some hard - working volunteers , chemistry 's most universal system for referring to chemicals can now be used far more effectively by the worlds biggest open repository of knowledge .
Would n't it be great to be able to pull these CAS numbers from Wikipedia programmatically ?
Perspective
Estimates place the number of Wikipedia pages dealing with individual inorganic and organic substances in the thousands .
( I 'll use the term " compound monographs " to describe them . )
One factor acting to keep this number low is poor visibility of these entries .
Unlike most chemical databases , Wikipedia can't , by itself , be easily searched by structure .
As chemically - aware tools for indexing Wikipedia begin to emerge , look for six things to happen :
The number of Wikipedia compound monographs will increase significantly .
The quality of monographs for intermediate - to well - known compounds will increase substantially .
Demand for user - friendly interfaces to Wikipedia 's chemical content will increase .
Wikipedia users will become interested in storing and finding ever more diverse kinds of information about each compound .
Bench chemists will start to include Wikipedia as one of their preferred literature search techniques , leading to …
More creative tools for using the chemical content of Wikipedia .
As noted previously , it was n't too long ago that indexing of the chemical literature was done solely by volunteers .
Wikipedia offers an intriguing way to channel the innate drive for chemists to combine their own work and experience with that of others to build useful information tools for the community .
But for now we are left with the question of how to index the chemical content of Wikipedia .
Although a few systems have been proposed , the only practical method is through the use of CAS numbers .
Which brings us to the subject of today 's tutorial .
A Quick CAS Number API for Wikipedia
The Ruby program below will accept the title of any Wikipedia compound monograph title and return the CAS number for the compound being discussed , or an error message if none was found :
require ' rubygems ' require ' hpricot ' require ' open - uri ' require ' cgi ' class Wikikemi @cas = nil attr_reader : cas def initialize title uri = URI.escape ( " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
#{title} " ) puts " loading ... # {uri} " doc = Hpricot ( open ( uri ) ) table = ( doc / " table " ) [ 0 ] table.inner_html.match ( /( [ 0 - 9 ] {2,7} ?\-[ 0 - 9 ] { 2} \-[ 0 - 9 ] ) / ) if table @cas = $ 1 end end while true puts " Enter the title of the Wikipedia page , for example : ' benzene ' " monograph_title = gets.chomp w = Wikikemi.new monograph_title puts w.cas ? " [ # {w.cas} ] " : " CAS number not found " end
This program makes use of the excellent Ruby HTML parser , Hpricot .
Saving the above code to a file called wikikemi.rb , we can run it with :
ruby wikikemi.rb
For example , we can look up the CAS numbers for Ferrocene , Lipitor , or 1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-Decahydronaphthalene :
ruby wikikemi.rb
Enter the title of the Wikipedia page , for example : ' benzene ' ferrocene loading ...
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferrocene [ 102-54 - 5 ]
Enter the title of the Wikipedia page , for example : ' benzene ' lipitor loading ...
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipitor [ 134523-00 -5 ]
Enter the title of the Wikipedia page , for example : ' benzene '
1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-Decahydronaphthalene loading ...
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-Decahydronaphthalene [ 91-17-8 ]
All this method requires is that the Wikipedia page lists the correct CAS number in its Drugbox or Chembox template .
Fortunately , CAS has agreed to help make this happen .
Conclusions
A little Ruby code is all it takes to build a working CAS number lookup system using Wikipedia .
Although this may be useful as a standalone tool , it becomes much more powerful when made part of a larger cheminformatics system .
But that 's a story for another time .

Via CNN :
It took two days , but Obama - mania finally crashed President Bush 's party in Africa ever so briefly on Sunday .
Jennifer Loven of the Associated Press asked Bush a question about his AIDS relief plan and then turned to Kikwete to note the excitement in Africa about Obama 's candidacy and asked the African leader to comment on " what you think it says about America that we might elect a black President with roots in Africa ? "
Even though that part of the question was not directed at him , Bush weighed in first with mock exasperation that everyone seemed to be forgetting he was treated like a rock star on the trip .
" It seemed like there was a lot of excitement for me , wait a minute , " the President said to laughter .
" Maybe you missed it . "

A recent AlterNet post said “ Let ’s Call the Superdelegate Process What It is : Election Rigging ”
Well let ’s look at this .
What is “ rigging ” except a process of denying certain individuals a fair opportunity to compete in a contest the outcome of which is already “ fixed ” before the contest occurs ?
We need to see this alleged rigging through superdelegates to the Democratic National Convention in the broader context of how American elections actually are rigged .
They are rigged , I will argue , in that they deny opportunity for election to four categories of people : ( a ) the relatively poor ; ( b ) those of relatively extreme political persuasions ; ( c ) those who are challenging a sitting holder of a public office ; ( d ) people of less appealing or charismatic personalities .
The wealthy ( or those who have access to the resources of wealth ) , political “ centrists ” , office incumbents and the personally appealing are able to enjoy advantages that practically “ rig ” elections in their favors .
I wo n’t devote too much space to elaborating on these well - known sources of advantage and disadvantage in electoral contests .
Political campaigns are so outrageously expensive , and public financing of them is so grievously inadequate , that one must either be independently wealthy or willing and able to accept the contributions of those vested interests who are only too willing to invest in some political influence through contributing to their campaigns .
Our quadrennial presidential elections , involving a system of two parties relatively even in voting strength , guarantee that candidates of more purely conservative or progressive political views must , to attract the all - important support of “ independents , ” tack their political appeals toward the center of political philosophies , hoping only that they wo n’t so egregiously offend their conservative or progressive “ base ” that these folks will stay home on election day , or else support 3rd party candidates who are more congenial to their beliefs .
As to challenger disadvantage , it ’s about as easy to unseat an incumbent legislator as it is to beat the home team in a professional basketball game ; the political game is “ rigged ” in favor of the incumbent because people evaluate their representative in terms of how much he or she “ does for ” the home district or state , how much for example those much - maligned “ earmarks ” will come home to the local pork barrel .
Finally , the factor of “ charisma ” or the “ likeable ” personality is a huge factor in our elections ; as was said about G.W. Bush , the average Joe would be more likely to want to “ have a beer ” with him than either of his opponents , the wooden Gore or the aristocratic Kerry .
With the exception of Truman and Ford ( both of whom gained their presidencies by constitutional rising from the vice - presidency rather than by election ) , all our Presidents since FDR have been more or less such charismatics , no matter how disastrous for the country some of their presidencies may have been .
I could go on , but I want to get to the superdelegates .
To re-iterate the lament against superdelegates , it is said that they are allowed to substitute their “ own ” voices for those of the “ ordinary ” voters who have voted in primaries and caucuses .
I have two things to say about these charges .
The first is to observe that , if elections generally in this country are “ rigged ” in the manner I ’ve suggested above , these superdelegates will not be immune from the same influences that influenced those sacred “ voters ” in the primaries and caucuses .
They owe their own elections to personal or sponsored wealth , they are raised in the 2 - Party culture which defines the preferred candidate as the one must “ viable ” in competition with the other party , they have been judged and their electoral opponents have been judged in terms of their likeability .
In other words , they will use their judgment in the same way “ ordinary ” voters choose the candidate they think will fare best in the general election ; if these judgments are divided in the electorate , they will be divided in the superdelegates ; a “ wash out ” in terms of their supposedly decisive influence , which seems exactly to be happening as Clinton support among superdelegates erodes and that of Obama increases ( with , I predict , declines in claims of superdelegate “ rigging ” from those in the Obama camp ) .
The second and more “ principled ” point that I would make about superdelegates is the view that it perhaps is a good thing for “ democracy ” if these men and women are somewhat independent of the views of “ the voters ” in making their choices for a nominee .
Tocqueville , whose views Noorani likes to quote in his article , is somewhat admiring of the genius of the American Constitution ’s “ checks and balances ” that help to ameliorate what the French aristocrat saw as the tendency toward a “ tyranny of the majority ” in American life .
“ Representative ” bodies like city , county , state and national legislatures involve a process of “ deliberation ” prior to votes that commit the given entity to a line of public policy .
A member of Congress should , in this view , be able to give a more reasoned consideration to a decision than can typically be done in a political campaign in which , before voters “ speak ” with their votes , they have been bombarded with the likes of sound bite commercials , bumper stickers and swift boat attacks on candidates .
There is a certain genius , I think , in a political party reserving a certain number of seats at a nominating convention for persons who are “ uncommitted ” and therefore presumably amenable to reasoning and debate .
Maybe superdelegates are not the best way to do this ; they are , after all , subjected to the same “ rigging ” influences that I described above .
But at least they are men and women with some degree of experience in deliberation on issues that arise in their executive or legislative offices so that , absent another distribution formula , it may be as good a way as any to keep the nomination of a presidential candidate “ open ” to candidates none of whom have captured a majority of delegates in primaries and caucuses .
I close with the words of an American contemporary of Tocqueville , Henry David Thoreau which , even though they do n’t sound so “ democratic , ” may contain an element of political wisdom when it comes to determining the “ virtue ” of different presidential candidates .
“ A wise man will not leave the right to the mercy of chance , nor wish it to prevail through the power of the majority .
There is little virtue in the action of masses of men . ” ( Civil Disobedience ) .
IN THE past week Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has damned it as a “ worthless piece of paper ” and China 's premier , Wen Jiabao , has moaned that it is causing his country “ big pressure ” .
The dollar 's relentless decline — it hit a new low of $ 1.49 against the euro on November 21st — is prompting jibes from America 's critics , jangling investors ' nerves and giving policymakers headaches .
Nowhere are the dilemmas more acute than in the Gulf , where virtually all the oil - rich states peg their currencies to the greenback .
The combination of soaring oil prices and the tumbling dollar is distorting their economies and fuelling inflation .
When the Gulf states meet on December 3rd in Qatar , they should agree to loosen their ties to the dollar .
The argument for linking to the greenback was to provide an anchor for the region 's economies , many of which are small , open and financially immature .
In effect , the Gulf states import America 's monetary policy .
The trouble is that a fixed currency makes it hard for oil exporters to adjust to swings in the price of oil .
And monetary policy in the world 's largest oil - importer is not always right for those who sell the stuff .
Soaring oil prices have brought the Gulf Arabs huge riches .
Their real exchange rates , as a result , ought to rise .
The simplest way to do that is for the currency to strengthen , but the peg prevents nominal appreciation .
Worse , the dollar itself has been falling .
The result is rising domestic inflation .
Some smaller Gulf economies now have inflation rates of around 10 % .
What is to be done ?
The two most widely discussed options are to revalue or to shift to a currency basket ( which Kuwait has already done ) .
By repegging their currencies to the dollar at a higher rate , the Gulf states would alleviate some of today 's inflationary pressure .
But they would not address the underlying mismatch between any oil exporter and a dollar peg .
Switching the peg to a basket of currencies that included , say , the euro and yen as well would give the Gulf states a bit more protection against oil - price swings , but it is hardly a perfect fit .
Since most big currencies belong to oil importers , the Gulf States would still be linking their currencies to monetary conditions that may not suit them .
Eventually , the currency pegs should be abandoned .
After all , developed economies that are big commodity exporters , such as Norway , allow their currencies to float .
In recent years many emerging economies have shifted from exchange - rate pegs to a “ managed float ” .
Instead of aiming for an exchange rate , their central banks have an inflation target .
If the Gulf states move to a single currency , as they plan to in the next few years , that currency should surely float .
But floating is not feasible in the short - term .
These countries have no history of independent monetary policy and few institutions to conduct it .
Look beyond a basket
For the moment , the Gulf states are stuck with a currency peg .
But they could do better than the dollar .
One intriguing idea is to include the oil price as part of a basket that includes the leading currencies ( see article ) .
This would ensure their currencies absorbed some of the impact of oil - price swings .
A big uncertainty is what such a shift would mean for the dollar .
In the short term , the effect on the Gulf states ' appetite for greenbacks would not be dramatic , since the dollar would have a big weight in any basket .
And there should not be a sudden sale of the oil exporters ' dollar reserves .
The worry is that the end of the Gulf states ' dollar peg would send jittery investors into a panic .
That risk is real .
But with oil prices rising and the dollar falling , the dangers of inaction are greater .
The Gulf states need to get rid of their dollar peg now .

PORT -AU - PRINCE ( Reuters ) -
Four people were killed in southern Haiti when demonstrators protesting the high cost of living clashed with security forces , a local official said on Friday .
The United Nations said protesters rioted in the town of Les Cayes on Thursday , burning shops , shooting at peacekeepers and looting containers at a U.N. compound .
“ At least four people have been killed and about 20 others wounded , ” said Gabriel Fortune , a senator from the southern region , who condemned the violent behavior of the demonstrators .
“ The movement started well , but it was spoiled by the intrusion of a number of criminals that have nothing to do with the legitimate demands of the population , ” said Fortune .
Food prices in Haiti , the poorest country in the Americas , have soared in recent months , stoking anger against the government of President Rene Preval .
Preval ’s election in 2006 raised expectations that the country would finally start on the path to stability after decades of turbulence , culminating in the February 2004 ouster of former president Jean - Bertrand Aristide .
Les Cayes was tense after the riots and the U.N. force trying to maintain peace in the volatile Caribbean country sent 100 peacekeepers as reinforcements , the U.N. statement said .
A small group of protesters broke into the U.N. compound in Les Cayes , damaging the main gate and ignoring warning shots from peacekeepers , the statement said .
“ The protesters also burned shops in Les Cayes and threw rocks and fired weapons at some of the blue helmets during the night . ”
At least two U.N. vehicles were burned , demonstrators threw rocks at cars and at least one woman was raped , according to local officials and radio reports .
“ This hunger is unbearable and the government has to act now , otherwise we will burn down and destroy everything , ” a demonstrator shouted into a local reporter ’s microphone .
At a news conference , Prime Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis denounced what he called manipulation of the protests .
“ We know that these demonstrations have been infiltrated by individuals linked to drug dealers and other smugglers , ” he said , calling on the protesters to stop the demonstrations .
Alexis said the government had immediately made available about $ 10 million to help fight the high cost of living .
He announced job creation and credit programs and said food would be distributed and fertilizer prices cut in half .
Haiti , which shares the island of Hispaniola with the more prosperous Dominican Republic , has been relatively tranquil recently , although a resurgence in kidnappings and crime has alarmed the United Nations .
Just under 9,000 Brazilian - led U.N. peacekeepers and civilian police are stationed in Haiti .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon this week called on the international community and Haiti ’s leaders to keep up their efforts to bring stability to the country .
“ The potential for regression remains , ” he said in a report .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Portable media players such as iPods are unlikely to interfere with heart pacemakers , a U.S. Food and Drug Administration researcher reported on Thursday .

Portable media players such as iPods are unlikely to interfere with heart pacemakers , a Food and Drug Administration researcher reported on Thursday .
REUTERS / Mike Blake
His tests of a variety of iPods showed they did not produce enough of an electromagnetic field to interfere with the devices .
FDA researcher Howard Bassen and colleagues set up a complex experiment using a saline - filled bag to simulate the human body and a coil sensor designed to pick up electromagnetic emissions .
They measured the magnetic fields produced by four different iPod models : a fourth - generation iPod and an iPod with video , and an iPod nano and an iPod shuffle .
They also measured the voltages delivered to the inside of the pacemaker by the magnetic fields from the iPods .
All their measurements indicated the iPods could not affect cardiac pacemakers , they reported in the journal BioMedical Engineering OnLine .
“ We measured magnetic field emissions with a 3 - coil sensor
placed within 1 cm ( half an inch ) of the surface of the player .
Highly localized fields were observed ( only existing in a one square cm area ) , ” they wrote .
“ Based on the observations of our in - vitro study we conclude that no interference effects can occur in pacemakers exposed to the iPods we tested , ” they concluded .
Two reports had suggested otherwise .
Last year cardiologists operated an iPod during a patient ’s examination , and reported in the journal Heart Rhythm that they had seen interference with the pacemaker .
And last May , a study presented by a 17 - year - old high school student to the Heart Rhythm Society annual meeting in Denver caused a stir when he said he detected electrical interference half of the time when the iPod was held 2 inches from the patient ’s chest for 5 to 10 seconds .
The FDA researchers did not examine any portable music devices other than iPods , which are made by Apple Inc . .

What 's Changed Since Va. .
Tech Massacre ?
As campuses try to increase notification , some students push to allow guns .
Feb. 16 , 2008  --
It 's been almost 10 months since the nation 's worst school shooting rampage , when a crazed gunman killed 33 people at Virginia Tech .
That massacre prompted anguished debates about campus security , gun laws , and the privacy rights of the mentally ill , with lawmakers pushing various proposals , and campuses vowing to institute new policies .
Since last August , there have been several other school shootings , including Thursday 's rampage by Steven Kazmierczak , who shot and killed five people before turning the gun on himself at Northern Illinois University .
So , what has been done ?
Or is there only so much that can be done to prevent violence on campuses without creating armed fortresses ?
Hundreds of college campuses have taken steps to revamp their notification procedures , in the wake of the Virginia Tech massacre , when students were n't informed about the shooter for hours , according to campus security experts .
" Many of them have made changes , from text messaging systems and e-mail systems , to more old - fashioned methods , such as the use of sirens and loudspeakers , " said Carolyn Reinach Wolf , a lawyer and founder of Campus Behavioral Health Risk Consultants LLC .
The administration at NIU seems to have taken those steps , according to Wolf .
Students and faculty learned about the shootings on their BlackBerries and voice mail within minutes .
Administrators have also distributed booklets with color - coded tabs identifying various emergency situations , according to a school spokesperson .
Last December , when graffiti , referencing the Virginia Tech massacre , was found in a women 's bathroom at NIU , the campus was shut down for a day .
" Whatever changes and modifications NIU made , worked very well yesterday , " said Wolf .
" In addition , it seemed like they were very well coordinated with off - campus law enforcement .
What was missing at Virginia Tech was the timing , where it took them several hours to institute their safety policy . "
Other changes have been slower to come : Although both the House and Senate passed amendments to the Cleary Act , which mandated that warnings should be sent out within 30 minutes , and recommended that schools need to adopt emergency notification procedures , they are being held up , due to squabbling between the White House and Congress .
" Campuses are n't the ivory towers that they 're perceived to be , " said Alison Kiss , program director of Security on Campus , a nonprofit group that pushes for increased school safety .
" Most campuses still need to have more notification for their students and faculty . "
Gun laws vary from state to state , and Illinois is generally considered to have strict gun laws , according to Wolf .
Since Kazmierczak did not have a police record , he qualified to buy guns , including the Remington 12 gauge shotgun and Glock 9 mm pistol he purchased at a gun store .
This morning , some NIU parents , led by Dr. Connie Catellani , plan a press conference to push for tougher gun laws .
" A call to action — to put all federal and state elected officials and candidates on notice , that parents will no longer take " the gun lobby is too powerful " as an excuse not to have tougher gun laws in the U.S. , " wrote the group in a press release .
Most campuses , including NIU , do not allow students to carry guns on campus .
Utah is the only state that lets students carry concealed weapons .
But , since Virginia Tech , 12 states are considering bills that would allow students to have concealed weapons permits at public universities .
Helping push the effort is Students for Concealed Carry on Campus , an Internet - based group , which claims to have 11,000 members , reports USA Today .
From April 21 to 25 , the group will hold a nationwide protest by getting students to wear empty holsters to class .
Some states , including Virginia , are considering legislation to require public colleges and universities to notify a parent if a student is deemed a danger to himself or others .
This did not happen in the case of Virginia Tech shooter Seung Hui Cho , although the issue is being hotly debated by privacy advocates .
The U.S. Senate recently passed a bill that would call on school administrators to contact parents if a student is considered a harm to themselves or others .
It is awaiting action by the House .
Questions remain as to how much can be done to prevent a gunman intent on wreaking havoc on college campuses , which pride themselves on their openness .
" You know , I wish I could tell you that there was a panacea for this kind of thing , but you 've noticed that there 's been multiple shootings all over this country within the last six months , " NIU Police Chief Don Grady told reporters .
" It 's a horrendous circumstance , and ... it 's unlikely that anyone would ever have the ability to stop an incident like this from beginning . "
We 're not quick to cover the chain restaurant scene , but how could we not .
Hoping to keep eaters in McDonald 's long after they 've finished their Quarter Pounder , the company is redesigning hundreds of restaurants to encourage customers to hang around like they do at Starbucks .
We 're so lucky :
The first McDonald 's in the nation to get feng - shui-ed is in Hacienda Heights — off the 60 towards Diamond Bar — where " earth tones and exotic fauna " will replace the former Hi-C red and electric yellow palate .
There will also be a McCafe , an upscale coffee bar , and exterior water elements symbolizing " life and relaxation . "

Nation 's First Feng Shui Inspired McDonald 's Restaurant Opens its Doors in Hacienda Heights
HACIENDA HEIGHTS , Calif. , Feb. 13 / PRNewswire / --
A local McDonald 's restaurant recently unveiled a one - of - a- kind Feng Shui - inspired design , the nation 's first .
The restaurant , located at 15628 Gale Avenue , blends classic architecture with modern Feng Shui aspects including water elements , earth tones , red accents and exotic fauna .
The recently renovated restaurant also features San Gabriel Valley 's first McCafe , a coffee bar adjacent to the front counter .
Feng Shui is the practice of placement and arrangement of space to achieve harmony with the environment .
The five elements of fire , earth , wood , water and metal play an important role in the practice of Feng Shui in that the placement of these elements effects how energy is manifested .
The restaurant combines elements of water located on the exterior of the dining area , symbolizing life and relaxation , with elements of fire and red accents throughout the dining area to symbolize good luck , laughter and light .
The dining area also features symmetrically balanced seating arrangements in earth tone shades , pendant lights to warm up the interior , an elevated PlayPlace and three plasma televisions .
The unique design was created using the expertise of Feng Shui Grand Master , Dr. Chi-Jean Liu and noted Long Beach design firm , JBI Industries , Inc .
" We chose a Feng Shui design that creates a soothing environment for our customers to better enjoy their dining experience , " said Mark Brownstein , McDonald 's owner / operator .
" We are pleased to bring this unique experience to our customers in a one - of - a- kind Feng Shui decor while serving our quality meals . "
The recently renovated McDonald 's also features McCafe , serving coffee made from McDonald 's Premium Roast Coffee .
The coffee bar adjacent to the front counter serves cappuccinos , lattes and mochas .
In addition to consulting for corporate clients , Dr. Liu has received various national and international awards .
He has also been featured in several local television and print media including KNBC's " Good Day LA , " Los Angeles Times , Pasadena Star News and Orange County Register .
For four decades , JBI Industries , Inc. has been the leader in quick service restaurant design and interiors .
JBI Industries , Inc designs and constructs restaurant interiors that create exciting dining experiences and drive sales that set the benchmarks for the food service industry .
Mark Brownstein , along with his business partners Peter Horner and Bryan Carmack own 23 McDonald 's restaurants in Southern California and are part of the McDonald 's Operators '
Association of Southern California which is comprised of more than 600 franchised and company - owned McDonald 's restaurants in the counties of Los Angeles , Orange , Riverside , San Bernardino and Ventura .
A Pro-Thought Manifesto ( I 've had this lurking around in my file of half - written rants for some time .
It came up in conversation today and someone expressed interest in reading it , so I thought perhaps it was time to polish it up and post it .
I 'm probably mostly preaching to the choir here , but I wanted to get it down in writing anyway . )
I am , as any but my newest readers will not need to be told , a thoroughgoing computer geek .
Some people loudly and vocally express dislike of computer geeks ; being one myself , I naturally notice this when it happens around me , and occasionally try to fathom what it is they dislike .
Some people , for example , seem to dislike computer geeks because they dislike computers in particular .
That 's fair enough ; I do n't have to like it , of course , but I can understand it .
I dislike some other kinds of people on a similar basis : for example , aggressive sales pitches and ubiquitous advertising annoy me , and hence I 'd be likely to feel a certain antipathy towards someone if I found out that those things were what they did for a living , or ( even worse ) for fun .
But there 's another reason for disliking geeks which I find a lot harder to forgive : as closely as I can tell , some people dislike geeks ( of all stripes ) not because of any specific attitude to their field , but essentially because they dislike the fact that geeks think about things for fun .
You hear words like ‘ sad ’ bandied about with great abandon ; you hear a veiled , and sometimes not so veiled , disapproval of anyone spending time sitting at a computer – or whatever – which they ‘ ought ’ to be spending drinking beer and watching TV .
And it really makes me cross when people do this , or when they demonise the use of thought and reasoning in any other context .
We have more than enough trouble in the world already due to people not thinking , so encouraging further failure or refusal to think seems to me to be at least misguided , and at worst culpable .
I 'm not saying that you have a moral duty to use your brain all the time ( although I might well be persuadable that you have a duty to use it some of the time ) .
I have nothing against leisure pursuits that do n't involve thinking , or even that involve killing some of your brain cells ; I indulge in them myself regularly .
What I hate is people saying it's a bad thing that sometimes I do think for fun , or think about things I might otherwise do on autopilot ; when people try to make it morally wrong , or legally wrong , or ( most perniciously ) socially unacceptable to use my brain .
Another example : some people are terribly quick to throw around words like ‘ over - analysing ’ .
Now there is such a thing as over - analysing something : it 's the point at which you 're going round and round in circles trying to squeeze juice out where there is none , the point where you should have given up and admitted you do n't know what something means and are not achieving anything by trying to figure it out .
Deciding you 're over - analysing is a last resort when you genuinely are n't getting anywhere ; but some people seem to be keen to use the phrase pre- emptively as a means of encouraging people to deal with issues by means that do n't involve thinking in the first place .
So here is my personal Pro- Thought Manifesto , which I think to myself whenever I encounter this attitude : Every human being 's birthright , the thing that sets us apart from other mammals , is a brain capable of thought and reasoning .
The use of the brain for this purpose , in general , should be encouraged .
Thinking is not a moral imperative , at least all the time .
There is nothing wrong with choosing leisure activities that do n't involve thought ; you can't blame people for being too tired , too ill , too distracted or simply too stupid to think at any particular moment ; it 's not even easy to blame people for not wanting to think about particular things because they find it uncomfortable .
The use of the brain should be seen as admirable and praiseworthy , but not in general an absolute duty .
But if anyone discourages or disparages the use of the brain , this is a bad thing and should be vigorously argued against ; and if anyone attempts to forcibly prevent people from using their brains , this is not to be tolerated .
I have a brain .
I like to use it for fun ; I habitually use it in my day - to - day life ; and I instinctively turn to it for help when I 'm in difficult situations .
That is the way I am ; I feel strongly that it is a good way to be ; and I will not be made to feel like a second - class citizen for it .
OK , more of a rant than a manifesto , but it 's the best I can do .

More on higher education : USA TODAY 's Mary Beth Marklein offers insight on college admissions , classes and trends , and she wants to hear from you The ID card at Portland State University in Oregon has long been the key to campus life , allowing students to check out books , get into buildings and access their meal plans .
A few years ago , the school created another use for the IDs : buying books and school supplies .
Students just had to activate their ID as a debit card by opening a bank account promoted by the university .
The school , under an exclusive deal with a bank , earned money when students swiped their cards and signed for a purchase .
It also profited based on how much money students kept in their accounts .
STORY : Cuomo examining pacts between colleges , banks EXCLUSIVE : Debit - card policies at the 15 largest universities CHART :
How overdraft fees impact young consumers Hundreds of students protested , angry that the school was promoting a bank account they felt cost students more than other banking options .
Their objections now are being echoed by a growing number of consumer groups and college students across the nation .
They argue that universities are profiting at students ' expense through exclusive debit card and checking account deals that can net a school hundreds of thousands of dollars a year .
" I 'm not an angry long - haired hippie against corporations , " says Ryan Klute , 25 , a graduate student at Portland State .
" But it 's a bad idea when the university and the company have a vested interest in you spending your money so they can make money off you . "
Such concerns are beginning to draw attention from state officials .
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo , who investigated the student - loan industry last year , has begun examining debit card relationships between colleges and banks , his office said late last week .
Cuomo's inquiry into student - loan providers led to changes within a system in which major colleges apparently received financial perks for touting lenders that did n't necessarily offer the best deals for students .
Banks have long pitched credit cards on campuses through exclusive deals with university alumni and athletic groups .
But in marketing financial products to students , debit card partnerships have become the next frontier .
Why ?
One major reason is that debit card use is growing faster than credit card use , and young adults have proved especially willing to embrace the financial industry 's push for cashless payments .
Students also tend to be short on cash .
That makes them a reliable source of fees for banks , which charge up to $ 38 each time consumers overdraw their accounts .
There 's another factor , too : Banks want to forge ties with students that will last well beyond the college years .
" You 'd hope that if we have established a relationship with an individual in college , when they go to buy the first car , their first house , they would think of us , " says Steve Dale , a spokesman for U.S. Bank , which has partnered with 28 colleges to issue ID cards that can double as debit cards .
Such deals are particularly attractive to public universities facing severe cuts in state funding .
That helps explain why , even as some colleges limit credit card marketing on campus , they still let banks pitch accounts and debit cards to students .
Banks want to attract students with debit cards — through combination ID cards — and then sell them other products , such as credit cards , says Robert Huber , who consults with colleges on multipurpose cards .
Debit card partnerships are " not a backdoor way but a gateway for banks to market other products , " says Ed Mierzwinski , consumer program director at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group .
Far fewer colleges have debit card than credit card alliances , but more are joining the move to ID - debit cards .
In 2007 , 127 schools had joined with banks to issue ID cards that double as debit cards , a 144 % jump from 2002 , according to CR80 News , an industry publication .
A USA TODAY survey of the nation 's 15 largest universities by enrollment reveals that more than half now have bank card relationships with financial institutions .
In most cases , that means the student ID card doubles as a debit card .
" If the big universities are doing it , then it 's likely the small ones will follow , " says Margaret Reed , an associate accounting professor at the University of Cincinnati .
" If I were a student , I would n't be happy " that colleges are pushing a product that earns them money .
Students should n't assume the bank account and debit card promoted by the university will be a good deal for them , says Greg McBride , a senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com .
" In life , you 're going to pay for convenience , " McBride says .
" If the goal is to get the most out of your money , it pays to shop around . "
' Hard to walk away from '
Under these contracts , large universities can generate revenue — up to $ 1 million or so a year , USA TODAY found .
The University of Minnesota has one of the most lucrative deals among the 15 largest schools .
It receives a guaranteed $ 1 million a year — on top of a $ 2 million signing bonus — under its contract with TCF Financial .
The university uses that revenue for student services , including scholarships and late - night buses , says Shirley Everson , director of University of Minnesota 's campus card office .
" You can go from university to university , and they 'll tell you that ( the revenue ) carrot is hard to walk away from , " says Andrew Perkins , campus card manager at Arizona State University , which hopes to soon link its ID card to a bank card that students can use anywhere in the world .
Portland State 's 4 - year - old deal , which was reviewed by USA TODAY , projects that the school will reap more than $ 300,000 and save hundreds of thousands more in administrative costs from the ID - debit card over five years .
Portland State and other schools say money is n't the main reason they seek partnerships with financial institutions .
" Frankly , ( the money ) is not enough for us to do much with , " says Dee Wendler , Portland State 's associate vice president for finance , adding that the school is getting " much less " than originally projected .
" We wanted to move our systems away from Social Security numbers , and this was a way to recard the campus " without significant cost to the school , Wendler says .
( Typically , banks bear the administrative costs of reissuing ID cards under the deals . )
The school encourages students to open a bank account with its bank partner , Higher One , and to have any financial aid transferred electronically — rather than by check — to save them time and the school money , Wendler says .
Portland State students are issued a free ID card with a MasterCard logo , but they 're not required to link it to the bank account and use it as a debit card .
Those who prefer a regular ID card that can't double as a debit card can get one for $ 20 .
The school agreed to provide the alternative ID after students protested the new card , Wendler says .
But only 110 current active students — out of about 25,000 — have paid for the alternative ID , she notes .
The university and Higher One also have addressed other student concerns , they say , such as revamping the card - activation process after students complained that it was too easy for them to accidentally sign up for the bank account .
Some consumer groups worry that colleges are choosing financial partners mainly for the revenue they stand to receive and ignoring bank fees imposed on students of modest means .
One big moneymaker for banks is letting customers overdraw their accounts , then hitting them with a fee for doing so .
The Center for Responsible Lending , a consumer advocacy group , estimates that overdraft fees cost consumers $ 17.5 billion each year — 11 % more than the $ 15.8 billion that consumers are overdrawing on their accounts .
College students tend to be hurt disproportionately , the center says .
" More so than anyone else , they are willing to use their debit cards for small - dollar transactions , " says Eric Halperin , director of the center 's Washington office .
" When they do overdraft , it can be amazingly expensive . "
Young adults ages 18 - 24 pay more than $ 3 in fees on average for every $ 1 overdrawn , compared with nearly $ 2 in fees paid by other adults , the center 's data show .
Because of the outsize impact of these fees on college students , Halperin says , schools that strike deals with banks should require the financial institution to deny a transaction — at no charge to the student — if there is n't enough money to cover it .
If the bank mistakenly approves a transaction that overdraws an account , Halperin adds , it should waive any resulting fee .
Colleges with ID - debit card deals typically let banks charge students overdraft fees .
" Given the debt loads students have , the last thing a university should be doing is adding more debt to a student 's life , and that 's what overdraft fees do , " Halperin says .
But Gail Cunningham , a spokeswoman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling , says she believes that " it 's OK for ( college students ) to be charged overdraft fees as long as they 're not ( excessively ) punitive .
" The reality , " Cunningham says , is that " in the real world , no one is going to coddle them along . "
Banks say the earlier students learn about financial management , the better .
By charging students fees for overdrawing their accounts , says Nessa Feddis , senior federal counsel at the American Bankers Association , banks are providing them with " an opportunity to learn to manage a bank account . "
Jean Ann Fox , director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America , rejects that argument : " That 's like saying we 're going to let you drive into trees so you can learn ( not to abuse ) alcohol . "
Coffee overdrafts : $ 150 Kevin Wendt , a graduate student at the University of Minnesota , says he sees nothing wrong with his school teaming with a bank , TCF Financial , to provide him with a student ID that doubles as a debit card .
" Because the university had a relationship with the bank , I knew exactly where to go , " says Wendt , 23 , adding , " I even got a free sweatshirt for opening up an account . "
Wendt overdrew on his account a few times , he says , but " almost every time , I 'd be able to call up and say , ' Can you reverse it ? '
And ( the bank ) did . "
TCF does n't always waive overdraft fees .
But its overdraft policies are " well - publicized , and students know the rules and generally abide by them , " TCF spokesman Jason Korstange wrote in an e-mail .
Meanwhile , PNC Bank automatically waives the overdraft fee for first - time offenders at the 14 schools it partners with on ID - debit cards .
Wachovia , with 16 such alliances , gives all students who open a new checking account a one - day free pass on overdraft fees .
Brad Vehafric , a junior at Portland State , signed up for a bank account linked to his student ID card when he was a freshman .
He bought a couple of coffees with the card one day , he says , assuming he had enough money in the account .
The debit - card transactions went through , but because he did n't have enough money to cover them , he was charged about $ 150 in fees .
He asked Higher One to refund the charges , he says , but was denied .
Vehafric paid the fees and closed his account soon after .
Mark Volchek , Higher
One 's chairman , says the bank account it offers to students charges no monthly fees and requires no minimum balance , but " like any other checking account , there are some times when students will incur fees . "
Overall , the fees charged are comparable to those of other national banks , he adds .
If students lack enough money in their accounts , Higher One , unlike many other financial institutions , generally denies the debit card transaction , Volchek says .
But that 's not always possible , he notes , because some merchants will authorize a purchase without checking the buyer 's available balance .
In such cases , Volchek says , if an overdraft occurs , the bank charges students a fee to offset its costs and to hedge against losses if students do n't repay the amount overdrawn .
Vehafric says that if banks are partnering with universities to pitch products to college students , they should be more lenient with their fees — and more willing to forgive minor transgressions .
" Why charge $ 30 for a $ 2 cup of coffee ? " he asks .
" It 's obvious that some profit angle is associated with it , and that 's not congruent with student interests . "

Q I have a 42 - inch TV and want to upgrade my DVD player .
I saw you recommended the Oppo 980H .
Should I head in this direction or spend $ 399 and get the PS3 for Blu-ray ?
I watch movies and never play video games .
DAVID MCANALLEN , Pittsburgh
A My personal preference would be Blu-ray because I have a very large screen and a sound system fully compatible with the PS3 .
In your case we need to evaluate a few things to see if you want to get into Blu-ray right now .
With a screen larger than 50 inches the difference in picture quality between even the best DVD upscaling and Blu-ray is night and day , Blu-ray being far superior .
At 42 inches the difference in picture quality is n't nearly as pronounced .
Blu -ray audio is always much better , as long as you have a system capable of working with it .
In the case of the PS3 this means a receiver compatible with multichannel PCM audio over HDMI .
Most consumers have older receivers with multichannel analog inputs .
These work best with standalone Blu-ray players having multichannel audio outputs , a feature the PS3 lacks .
Unfortunately , none of the Blu-ray standalones on the market are worth recommending , save a single model from Panasonic ( the DMP - BD30 ) that costs $ 100 more than the PS3 but is n't as capable .
Anyone wanting or needing a standalone Blu-ray player should definitely wait at least until this summer , when fully developed standalone players will be available .
The Oppo DV - 980H is a great DVD player , but if you own a lot of DVDs or want the very best picture quality available from the DVD format , consider spending the $ 399 on the Oppo DV - 983H .
Oppo has built quite a reputation for customer service and DVD picture quality , and the DV - 983H is state - of - the - art , providing noticeably better images than the DV - 980H .
( In a recent test the DV - 983H duplicated the DVD upscaling scores of the $ 5,000 video processor I use in my own system . )
Attorney General Michael Mukasey was supposed to end the cynical politicization of the Justice Department .
But the sudden disbanding of the United States attorney ’s public corruption office in Los Angeles looks like business as usual .
There were a number of sensitive inquiries under way at the high - profile office , including an investigation of Representative Jerry Lewis , the powerful California Republican who directed hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarks to favored government contractors while chairman of the appropriations committee .
Representative Lewis denied any wrongdoing as investigators tracked ties between windfall government contracts and lucrative campaign donations .
One former staff specialist on earmarks crossed over to become a potent lobbyist for contractors .
The inquiry appears to have lagged during the administration ’s strategic reshuffling of United States attorneys .
Thomas O’Brien , the United States attorney in Los Angeles , says the 17 lawyers in the unit will be transferred to other units without diminishing the anticorruption effort .
He insists the revamping of his office will allow pursuit of more corruption cases , not fewer .
In 2000 , after a terrorist ambush killed 17 sailors aboard the USS Cole , Navy commanders grew increasingly wary of intelligence leaks regarding the plans of ships heading into the Persian Gulf .
During that time of heightened awareness of leaks , Hassan Abu-Jihaad -- a Muslim convert from Phoenix whose name used to be Paul Hall , and a signalman aboard the USS Benfold -- was accused of passing along details to terrorists that included the planned movements of his Navy battle group when it was to pass through Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf in April , 2001 .
Yesterday , in federal court in Connecticut , Abu -Jihaad was convicted and faces up to 25 years in federal prison when he is sentenced in May .
( He was prosecuted in New Haven because the investigation first focused on a Connecticut - based Internet service provider . )
Here 's the AP story .
What 's odd about Abu - Jihaad 's case is that , according to his attorney , Dan LaBelle , a four - year investigation that spanned two continents failed to turn up proof that his client leaked details of ship movements .
And prosecutors , while they say Abu - Jihaad sympathized with the enemy and admitted disclosing military intelligence , acknowledged they did not have direct proof that he leaked the ship details .
However , authorities say the leaked documents closely matched what Abu - Jihaad , who was honorably discharged in 2002 , would have had access to as a signalman , and that he was the only member of the military who was communicating with the suspected terrorists .
They cited one e-mail in which he called the attack on the USS Cole in 2000 a " martyrdom operation " and praised " the men who have brong ( sic ) honor ... in the lands of jihad Afghanistan , Bosnia , Chechnya , etc . "
" Mr. Abu -Jihaad jeopardized the lives of countless American servicemen and women and , as a member of the U.S. Navy , his conduct was shameful and deceitful , " said Kathryn Feeney , an agent with the defense criminal investigative service .

A Stellar Explosion You Could See on Earth !
Robert Naeye
NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center
Astronomers are familiar with seeing amazing things through their telescopes .
But nothing prepared them for an incredible explosion detected early Wednesday morning by NASA ’s Swift satellite .
At 2:12 a.m. EDT , Swift detected an explosion from deep space that was so powerful that its afterglow was briefly visible to the naked eye .
Even more astonishing , the explosion itself took place halfway across the visible universe !
Never before has anything so far away come even close to naked - eye visibility .
The explosion was so far away that it took its light 7,500,000,000 ( 7.5 billion ) years to reach Earth !
In fact , the explosion took place so long ago that Earth had not yet come into existence .
" No other known object or type of explosion could be seen by the naked eye at such an immense distance , " says Swift science team member Stephen Holland of NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " We do n’t know yet if anyone was looking at the afterglow at the time it brightened to peak visibility .
But if someone just happened to be looking at the right place at the right time , they saw the most distant object ever seen by human eyes without optical aid .
"
If you venture out to a remote location and gaze into the sky on a dark , moonless night , the farthest object you can see with your naked eye is a spiral galaxy called M33 .
The galaxy is far away by Earthly standards , but it is nearby on a cosmic distant scale .
The light from M33 takes 2,900,000 ( 2.9 million ) years to reach Earth , making it thousands of times closer than the March 19 explosion .
The explosion itself is called a gamma ray burst , since much of the explosion ’s energy was in the form of gamma rays .
A gamma ray is a type of light with energy far higher than the light we see with our eyes .
Most gamma ray bursts originate when huge stars die and explode .
Instead of blowing material in all directions , they channel an incredible amount of energy into two high - speed jets , like turbocharged cosmic blowtorches .
When these jets plow into surrounding clouds of gas , they light up the gas , generating an afterglow that can be seen by telescopes in space and on Earth .
The afterglows generally get fairly bright , but never before has an afterglow been visible to the naked eye .
The March 19 gamma ray burst ’s afterglow was bright enough for about 30 seconds that someone could have seen it without a telescope or binoculars .
" Even by the standards of gamma-ray bursts , this burst was a whopper , " says Swift lead scientist Neil Gehrels of NASA Goddard .
" It blows away every gamma ray burst we ’ve seen so far .
" Astronomers have just begun their scientific analysis of the burst , so they do not know yet why it was so powerful , and why the afterglow was so much brighter than other afterglows .
Perhaps the burst itself was more energetic than other bursts , or perhaps its jets were very narrow , and were aimed directly at Earth .
Swift normally detects about two gamma ray bursts per week .
But March 19 was a special day .
The satellite detected four bursts on that day , which is a Swift record for one day .
“ Coincidentally , the passing of Arthur C. Clarke the day before seems to have set the universe ablaze with gamma ray bursts , ” says Swift science team member Judith Racusin of Penn State University in University Park , Pa .
Iraq War ' Blank Check ' Balloons Besides demanding Iraq
War money with no withdrawal timetables attached , the Bush administration has insisted on another kind of “ blank check ” – war spending that has more than doubled in four years while evading serious congressional oversight because it ’s wrapped in “ emergency ” appropriations bills – a study says .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly The Congressional Research Service reported that the average monthly costs to fund military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan has reached about $ 12.3 billion , $ 10 billion for Iraq alone , more than double what it cost to fund the war in 2004 .
CRS also noted that nearly all the $ 516 billion allocated by Congress to fund the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq has come from “ emergency ” spending bills that deprive Congress of the routine opportunity to scrutinize how the Pentagon spends the money .
Dozens of these “ emergency ” funding requests have zipped through Congress since 2001 in an unprecedented manner when compared with previous military conflicts , the CRS said .
In past wars , the bulk of the spending went through the normal appropriations process .
The Bush administration ’s use of emergency supplemental appropriations to fund the five - year - old war in Iraq and the seven - year conflict in Afghanistan may have wasted billions of taxpayer dollars , according to the CRS , an investigative arm of Congress .
“ Over 90 percent of [ the Defense Department ] funds were provided as emergency funds in supplemental or additional appropriations ; the remainder were provided in regular defense bills or in transfers from regular appropriations , ” said the CRS report , issued in February .
“ Emergency funding is exempt from ceilings applying to discretionary spending in Congress ’s annual budget resolutions .
Some Members have argued that continuing to fund ongoing operations in supplementals reduces congressional oversight . ”
Veronique de Rugy , a senior research fellow and budget scholar at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University , said funding the Iraq and Afghanistan wars through emergency legislation is both unusual and troubling because it complicates tracking the real cost .
“ While other wars have initially been funded using emergency supplementals , they have quickly been incorporated into the regular budget , ” de Rugy said .
“ Never before has emergency supplemental spending been used to fund an entire war and over the course of so many years . ”
De Rugy has just published an article on this topic , “ The Trillion - Dollar War , ” in the May issue of Reason magazine .
Skyrocketing Costs
The CRS report also questioned the reasons behind the skyrocketing costs for the wars .
“ Although some of the factors behind the rapid increase in DOD funding are known — the growing intensity of operations , additional force protection gear and equipment , substantial upgrades of equipment , converting units to modular configurations , and new funding to train and equip Iraqi security forces — these elements ” fail to justify the increase , the CRS said .
Furthermore , a $ 70 billion “ placeholder ” request included in the fiscal year 2009 budget that the Pentagon says will be used to finance operations in Iraq does not include any details on how the money will be spent “ making it impossible to estimate its allocation , ” according to the report .
The CRS added that the Pentagon has used these emergency supplemental requests to get Congress to fund equipment and vehicle upgrades that would otherwise come out of the Pentagon ’s annual budget .
“ Although some of this increase may reflect additional force protection and replacement of ‘ stressed ’ equipment , much may be in response to [ Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon ]
England ’s new guidance to fund requirements for the ‘ longer war ’ rather than DOD ’s traditional definition of war costs as strictly related to immediate war needs , ” the CRS said .
“ For example , the Navy initially requested $ 450 million for six EA - 18G aircraft , a new electronic warfare version of the F - 18 , and the Air Force $ 389 million for two Joint Strike Fighters , an aircraft just entering production ; such new aircraft would not be delivered for about three years and so could not be used to meet immediate war needs , ” the CRS said .
The CRS recommended that Congress immediately begin to demand more transparent accounting of the Pentagon ’s “ emergency ” spending in order to prevent any cost - shifting chicanery .
However , in the short term , the Bush administration again is citing imminent budget shortfalls for the troops if Congress does n’t approve the war funding requests immediately .
On Wednesday , in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee , Gen. Richard Cody , the Army ’s vice chief of staff , said the military will soon run out of cash if lawmakers do n’t act to approve a $ 102 billion emergency supplemental spending bill to continue funding military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ We start running out of military pay for our force in June , we start running out of operational dollars that we can flow to the force in early July , ” Cody said .
“ It ’s all about time now .
Those will be the consequences of not getting the supplemental . ”
The CRS and the Government Accountability Office generally accept Cody ’s time - frames on the prospective shortfalls , but note that the Pentagon could dip into its budget and transfer other funds to finance operations in Iraq until late September or early October , which would give Congress more time to scrutinize the emergency funding request .
Dire Warnings
These dire warnings from the Bush administration – about troops in a war zone running out of money – have become routine since Democrats won control of Congress in November 2006 .
Republican lawmakers and administration officials have said failure by Democrats to pass the emergency spending bills is tantamount to not supporting the troops , rhetoric that has often worked in spooking Democrats into capitulation .
Last year , Defense Secretary Robert Gates threatened to fire more than 200,000 Defense Department employees and contract workers because congressional Democrats balked at approving the administration ’s spending package for funding the Iraq War .
The Congressional Budget Office and the GAO told Congress that Gates could tap into the Pentagon ’s $ 471 billion budget to fund the war while Congress continued to debate the merits of giving the White House another “ blank check ” for Iraq .
But the Congress soon blinked .
The Democrats are likely to find themselves in a similar predicament this year , caught between political pressure to “ support the troops ” and accounting concerns regarding the administration ’s financial data .
In a letter to Congress on March 17 , the GAO said the $ 108 billion in war funding that the Pentagon has recently requested is based on “ unreliable ” financial data and should be considered an “ approximation . ”
A Pentagon spokesman did not return calls for comment .
But a GAO spokeswoman said the DOD has been struggling with “ deficiencies in the Pentagon ’s financial management system ” that contributed to the unreliable data .
She would not elaborate .
Some academic studies have projected the total cost of the Iraq War soaring past $ 2 trillion .
However , the Congressional Budget Office said trying to estimate future costs for the war is difficult “ because DOD has provided little detailed information on costs incurred to date . ”

Religion in schools – long overdue for a radical rethink
Editorial by Terry Sanderson
It seems the issue of “ faith schools ” is not going away – however much the Government would like it to .
The NSS is doing its best to keep this vital subject on the boil and in the public eye .
The most recent example of this was when we drew the attention of the Observer to an outrageous document published by the Catholic bishop of Lancaster , Patrick O’Donoghue , which he sent to all Catholic schools in his diocese .
The bishop , it seems , wants to introduce a Taliban - style regime of Catholic orthodoxy in his diocese ’s schools .
You can read what the Observer made of the story here and the bishop ’s gob - smacking demands here
We have been told continually by the churches and the Government that “ faith schools ” are not about indoctrination and are not primarily about proselytising .
The Lancaster document , with its revealing title , Fit for Mission , tells a different tale .
Fit for Mission ?
Is that what our schools have become – “ missioning ” grounds for failing religion ?
It is time that the Government told the churches that it will no longer collude in the promotion of religion at public expense in this way .
It is time for Ed Balls to do what other education ministers have not had the guts to do – tell the Archbishops and the bishops that their time is up in schools .
But how are we to overcome the very successful barrage of propaganda that the churches and mosques put out about how important a sense of morality is in schools – a sense of morality which , of course , only they can provide ?
How are we to challenge the deeply ingrained idea that religion is vital for children ?
Why does it seem so radical — even revolutionary — to suggest that , actually , children can have a perfectly adequate education without the input of priests , imams and vicars ?
They manage quite well in America and France without such interference in the education system .
The time has come for us to leave behind the idea that it is OK for religion to be pushed and promoted in schools so long as “ humanism ” or “ atheism ” gets a mention along the way .
But it is not OK .
It is far from OK .
We should stop asking for crumbs from the table and demand instead a neutral space in which children can learn without competing ideologies trying to use schools to recruit new members .
But while the humanist movement continues to go along with the idea that it is important to educate children about religion in our state schools , the clerics will always be on hand to ensure it is done their way .
And whatever small concessions they might make to “ critical input from non-religious standpoints ” it will always be they who have their hands on the steering wheel .
If we are to have religious education in schools at all ( and , personally , I see no need for it ) , then it should be taught as an academic subject in short courses created by independent academics , not by agenda - pushing evangelists .
As well as dismantling the “ faith school ” system , we need to get the churches , temples and mosques out of our schools completely and allow children to have a well - rounded , propaganda - free education that lets them reach their own conclusions .
At the moment , it starts in primary school with a contentious premise ( religion is good and , indeed , essential for a person to function in the world ) and then , throughout the whole of their school life , religious education will be on hand to reinforce that idea for children .
Anyone who has read the religious education framework will know that it is a charter for indoctrination – it is unbalanced , partisan and makes only the most grudging allowances for religions other than Christianity , and humanism gets only a fleeting mention .
Religious establishments and institutions in this country are at full liberty to preach their messages and to seek converts .
But the converts must be free agents who have made the decision to embrace the faith without pressure and coercion .
That is not the case in Britain ’s schools .
Children are not given the option of saying : “ I do n’t believe this and I do n’t want to have anything to do with it ” as they might be about political opinions and other contentious matters .
No .
Unless they get parental permission ( or sixth form self - withdrawal ) , they are forced — by law — to take part in worship .
Not just to attend it , but to take part in it .
In any other circumstance , this would be seen as a gross abuse of human rights .
Why is it not seen that way in the context of schools ?
Once again , we are told that it is part of the child ’s “ heritage ” and they must be made aware of it .
But is it ?
With only 7 % of people in this country worshipping on the average Sunday , religion is no longer the heritage of most people , it is something they have chosen not to embrace .
A Home Office survey showed that when asked to name the characteristics that were most important to them , the population of Britain ranked religion as ninth .
If we value it so little , why do we allow its enthusiasts to bully us into defending it and force - feeding it to children ?
Would we really be a nation of amoral reprobates if religion was not part of the state , and not part of the education system ?
Of course we would n’t .
And it is time for us to break free of the conditioning that has told us that we must cleave to God in order to have an ordered society .
The NSS ’s opposition to “ faith schools ” will increase in the coming months .
An unarguable case has been made against them and the time has come to demand action .
Schools must once again become repositories of knowledge , purveyors of facts , encouragers of skills , promoters of aspiration – not platforms for philosophies that seek to control our lives .

PORT -AU - PRINCE ( Reuters ) -
The Haitian government and the private sector of the impoverished Caribbean country announced an emergency plan on Saturday to bring down the price of rice by about 15 percent in a bid to stop food riots .
President Rene Preval , under fire from critics for not doing enough about the soaring cost of living after more than a week of violent protests , said the price cut would be partly funded by the Haitian private sector and partly by money from international donors .
Crowds of stone - throwing Haitians began battling U.N. peacekeepers and Haitian police in the south of the country on April 2 , enraged at the soaring cost of rice , beans , bread , cooking oil and other staples .
The unrest , in which at least five people died , spread to the capital Port - au - Prince this week , bringing the sprawling and chaotic city to a halt as mobs took over the streets , smashing windows , looting shops and setting fire to cars .
Preval , whose appeal on Wednesday for an end to the violence brought a tense calm to the capital , said the price of a sack of rice would come down to $ 43 from $ 51 .
Of that reduction , $ 3 would be paid by businesses .
“ The situation is difficult everywhere around the world , everyone has to make a sacrifice , ” Preval said at a news conference in the opulent National Palace in downtown Port - au - Prince .
“ We are not going to lower taxes on food ... , ” he said , reiterating that the poorest country in the Americas could not afford to cut its revenues or it would not have enough money to pay for longer term projects that create jobs and boost agriculture .
Food costs have soared worldwide because of a combination of surging demand in emerging countries such as China , competition with biofuels , high oil prices and market speculation .
Disturbances have broken out in a host of poor nations , primarily in Africa .
This is bullshit .

Mukasey Refuses to Order Grand Jury Probe of Bush Chief of Staff , Ex - White House Counsel Attorney General Michael Mukasey refused Friday to refer the House ’s contempt citations against two of President Bush ’s top aides to a federal grand jury .
Mukasey said White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and former presidential counsel Harriet Miers committed no crime .
As promised , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she has given the Judiciary Committee authority to file a lawsuit against Bolten and Miers in federal court .
“ The House shall do so promptly , ” she said in a statement .
Mukasey said Bolten and Miers were right in ignoring subpoenas to provide Congress with White House documents or testify about the firings of federal prosecutors .
“ The department will not bring the congressional contempt citations before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute Mr. Bolten or Ms. Miers , ” Mukasey wrote Pelosi .
Pelosi shot back that the aides can expect a lawsuit .
Read entire article …
Bush would never appoint ANYONE to US Attorney General that was n’t going to cover his ass watch his back .
And , as far as George W. Bush , ( and his entire Administration – yes , that means you too Mr. Cheney ) , having to answer to anyone – including ALL Americans and members of Congress – this is what Bush has to say :
“ This one ’s for you ! ”
Here ’s two words for Speaker Pelosi : INHERENT CONTEMPT !!
Enough with all the pussy - footing around !
Stop wasting precious time and money !
Inherent contempt
Under this process , the procedure for holding a person in contempt involves only the chamber concerned .
Following a contempt citation , the person cited is arrested by the Sergeant - at - Arms for the House or Senate , brought to the floor of the chamber , held to answer charges by the presiding officer , and then subjected to punishment as the chamber may dictate ( usually imprisonment for punishment reasons , imprisonment for coercive effect , or release from the contempt citation . )
Concerned with the time - consuming nature of a contempt proceeding and the inability to extend punishment further than the session of the Congress concerned ( under Supreme Court rulings ) , Congress created a statutory process in 1857 .
While Congress retains its “ inherent contempt ” authority and may exercise it at any time , this inherent contempt process was last used by the Senate in 1934 , in a Senate investigation of airlines and the U.S. Postmaster .
After a one - week trial on the Senate floor ( presided over by the Vice - President of the United States , acting as Senate President ) , William P. MacCracken , a lawyer and former Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Aeronautics who had allowed clients to rip up subpoenaed documents , was found guilty and sentenced to 10 days imprisonment .
[ 5 ]
MacCracken filed a petition of Habeas Corpus in federal courts to overturn his arrest , but after litigation , the US Supreme Court ruled that Congress had acted constitutionally , and denied the petition in the case Jurney v. MacCracken . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
Presidential pardons appear not to apply to a civil contempt procedure like the above , since it is not an “ offense against the United States ” or against “ the dignity of public authority . ” [ 8 ]
You do n’t need to go through the Attorney General or Justice .
Please , just DO IT !!
Senator John McCain landed in Iraq this morning on a official congressional visit taxpayer funded campaign stop with two members of his campaign , Senators Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman , and this morning on Late Edition Wolf Blitzer spoke with Senators Patrick Leahy and Diane Feinstein about the trip and whether it 's appropriate .
The clip begins with CNN's John King reporting from Iraq and he was more than willing to spew McCain 's talking points on the surge and how Senators Obama and Clinton want to wave the white flag of surrender .
Download Download
King : " ... John McCain says he's here as a member of the Senate , but it is a defining issue in the campaign .
It is John McCain who says either Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama would wave what he calls the " white flag of surrender " by rushing to get troops out of Iraq at a time when John McCain , and he will make the case here , says the surge policy is working and that while he would like to get the troops home , if they need to stay , Senator McCain says as a Senator or as the next president he would make the tough decision to keep them here . "
Both Leahy and Feinstein point out that McCain has a right to visit Iraq as a member of Congress , but agree he should n't have taken two members of his campaign with him , even though they are also members of Congress .
Leahy gets it right , this is nothing more than a photo op for McCain , who admits that he will be moving on to Great Britain for a fund raiser after his visit to Iraq .
Maybe the McSurge Triplets will get to go on another shopping spree and find more great bargains while they 're in Baghdad ?
Oh wait -- they can't go back to the same market they visited last year because that area of the city is now too dangerous .
Will McSame exploit this trip to raise campaign cash ?
You bet he will ...
Rudy Giuliani’s Dangerously Stupid Foreign Policy Vision
James Joyner · · 47 comments
Foreign Affairs is giving each of the major 2008 presidential candidates space to write a manifesto of their views on international relations .
Rudy Giuliani has weighed in with “ Toward a Realistic Peace . ” [ Also at RCP . ]
It is not particularly realistic — let alone Realist — and certainly does not contemplate peace .
Highlights :
“ We have responded forcefully to the Terrorists ’
War on Us , abandoning a decadelong — and counterproductive — strategy of defensive reaction in favor of a vigorous offense . ”
“ Much like at the beginning of the Cold War , we are at the dawn of a new era in global affairs , when old ideas have to be rethought and new ideas have to be devised to meet new challenges . ”
“ [ U ] nless we pursue our idealistic goals through realistic means , peace will not be achieved . ”
“ A realistic peace is not a peace to be achieved by embracing the ‘ realist ’ school of foreign policy thought .
That doctrine defines America ’s interests too narrowly and avoids attempts to reform the international system according to our values . ”
“ The first step toward a realistic peace is to be realistic about our enemies .
They follow a violent ideology : radical Islamic fascism , which uses the mask of religion to further totalitarian goals and aims to destroy the existing international system .
These enemies wear no uniform .
They have no traditional military assets .
They rule no states but can hide and operate in virtually any of them and are supported by some . ”
“ We must be under no illusions that either Iraq or Afghanistan will quickly attain the levels of peace and security enjoyed in the developed world today .
. . . [ S ] ome U.S. forces will need to remain for some time in order to deter external threats . ”
“ Many historians today believe that by about 1972 we and our South Vietnamese partners had succeeded in defeating the Vietcong insurgency and in setting South Vietnam on a path to political self - sufficiency .
But America then withdrew its support , allowing the communist North to conquer the South . ”
“ The United States must not rest until the al Qaeda network is destroyed and its leaders , from Osama bin Laden on down , are killed or captured . ”
“ The U.S. Army needs a minimum of ten new combat brigades .
It may need more , but this is an appropriate baseline increase while we reevaluate our strategies and resources .
We must also take a hard look at other requirements , especially in terms of submarines , modern long - range bombers , and in - flight refueling tankers . ”
“ The next U.S. president must also press ahead with building a national missile defense system .
America can no longer rely on Cold War doctrines such as ‘ mutual assured destruction ’ in the face of threats from hostile , unstable regimes .
Nor can it ignore the possibility of nuclear blackmail . ”
“ Constellations of satellites that can watch arms factories everywhere around the globe , day and night , above - and belowground , combined with more robust human intelligence , must be part of America ’s arsenal . ”
“ We must also develop detection systems to identify nuclear material that is being imported into the United States or developed by operatives inside the country .
Heightened and more comprehensive security measures at our ports and borders must be enacted as rapidly as possible . ”
“ Diplomacy should never be a tool that our enemies can manipulate to their advantage .
Holding serious talks may be advisable even with our adversaries , but not with those bent on our destruction or those who cannot deliver on their agreements . ”
“ The theocrats ruling Iran need to understand that we can wield the stick as well as the carrot , by undermining popular support for their regime , damaging the Iranian economy , weakening Iran ’s military , and , should all else fail , destroying its nuclear infrastructure . ”
“ Another step in rebuilding a strong diplomacy will be to make changes in the State Department and the Foreign Service .
The time has come to refine the diplomats ’ mission down to their core purpose : presenting U.S. policy to the rest of the world . ”
“ It is clear that we need to do a better job of explaining America ’s message and mission to the rest of the world , not by imposing our ideas on others but by appealing to their enlightened self - interest .
To this end , the Voice of America program must be significantly strengthened and broadened .
Its surrogate stations , such as Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty , which were so effective at inspiring grass - roots dissidents during the Cold War , must be expanded as well . ”
“ We should open [ NATO ] ’s membership to any state that meets basic standards of good governance , military readiness , and global responsibility , regardless of its location .
The new NATO should dedicate itself to confronting significant threats to the international system , from territorial aggression to terrorism . ”
“ Even as we work with [ Russia and China ] on economic and security issues , the U.S. government should not be silent about their unhelpful behavior or human rights abuses . ”
“ Ultimately , the most important thing we can do to help Africa is to increase trade with the continent .
U.S. government aid is important , but aid not linked to reform perpetuates bad policies and poverty . ”
The UN sucks but it ’s also very good .
Mumble mumble mumble .
“ Middle East , Africa , and Latin America remains mired in poverty , corruption , anarchy , and terror ” but it could be otherwise .
Somehow .
“ America has a clear interest in helping to establish good governance throughout the world .
Democracy is a noble ideal , and promoting it abroad is the right long - term goal of U.S. policy .
But democracy cannot be achieved rapidly or sustained unless it is built on sound legal , institutional , and cultural foundations . ”
“ Too much emphasis has been placed on brokering negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians — negotiations that bring up the same issues again and again .
It is not in the interest of the United States , at a time when it is being threatened by Islamist terrorists , to assist the creation of another state that will support terrorism .
Palestinian statehood will have to be earned through sustained good governance , a clear commitment to fighting terrorism , and a willingness to live in peace with Israel .
America ’s commitment to Israel ’s security is a permanent feature of our foreign policy . ”
“ Ever more open trade throughout the world is essential .
Bilateral and regional free - trade agreements are often positive for all involved , but we must not allow them to become special arrangements that undermine a truly global trading system . ”
“ Companies such as Pepsi , Coca - Cola , McDonald ’s , and Levi ’s helped win the Cold War by entering the Soviet market .
Cultural events , such as Van Cliburn ’s concerts in the Soviet Union and Mstislav Rostropovich ’s in the United States , also hastened change .
Today , we need a similar type of exchange with the Muslim countries that we hope to plug into the global economy . ”
“ A hybrid military - civilian organization — a Stabilization and Reconstruction Corps staffed by specially trained military and civilian reservists — must be developed .
The agency would undertake tasks such as building roads , sewers , and schools ; advising on legal reform ; and restoring local currencies . ”
“ Disorder in the world ’s bad neighborhoods tends to spread .
Tolerating bad behavior breeds more bad behavior .
But concerted action to uphold international standards will help peoples , economies , and states to thrive . ”
Giuliani ’s right on trade and cultural exchanges .
His embrace of a variation of Thomas Barnett ’s Systems Administration Corps is interesting and bold , albeit problematic for a variety of reasons .
Otherwise , I must concur in Matt Yglesias ‘ judgment : “ this man is batshit insane . ”
For a time , Giuliani was my favorite of the 2008 candidates .
He ’s got serious executive experience , is a charismatic leader , and sufficiently moderate on the social issues that I thought he had the chance to put together a 60 percent coalition to break the polarization that has so poisoned American politics in recent years .
While I disagree with him on abortion and some other issues , I was able to put that aside for a variety of practical reasons .
Unfortunately , the more I learn about Giuliani , the less I like him .
His chief advantage , the sense that he ’s a grown - up who will take a pragmatic but aggressive role in fighting the Islamist terrorists , is undermined by his unserious pandering .
The alarm first sounded for me with his politically astute but disingenuous attack on Ron Paul for his suggestion that al Qaeda hates our foreign policy , not just our freedom .
I chalked that up to the necessities of politics rather than a lack of understanding of the most important national security issue of our time .
The more I hear and read , though , the more I think Giuliani is either a charlatan or a simpleton .
Either he ’s lying to us and we therefore have no idea what his foreign policy will be or , worse , this is what he really thinks .
Either way , it ’s not good .
The “ Terrorists ’ War on Us ” label is annoying but , again , probably smart campaign politics .
I can abide sloganeering .
But the approach he lays out for fighting it seems designed to exacerbate it .
Indeed , it seems he intentionally picked out the worst parts of the foreign policies of George W. Bush , Bill Clinton , and Jimmy Carter .
Essentially , he wants to massively increase a defense budget that already spends more than the rest of the countries on the planet combined so as to buy more submarines and anti-missile systems to protect us against a land - based guerrilla movement .
We ’re then going to use that military to go in , apparently , to topple every regime we do n’t like and to wipe out every instance of non-democratic badness and spend decades occupying those countries .
All , of course , while winning friends and influencing people .
We ’re going to have a diplomatic policy that finally lives up to the caricature of Bush policy .
We ’re not going to talk to anyone unless they already agree with us .
Our diplomats are simply going to be propaganda instruments from now on .
And our media , too !
And we ’ll win the hearts and minds of Muslims everywhere by allying ourselves even more closely with the Israelis while punishing the Palestinian people .
We ’re going to spend billions on surveillance systems to ensure that nothing escapes the attention of the U.S. government .
We should learn the one lesson from Vietnam that no serious student of that war has learned :
We were THIS CLOSE to winning !
What ’s worse is that some team of experts actually wrote this , not Giuliani himself .
So this has been filtered and edited and focus grouped so as to appeal to a wider audience .
So , Giuliani ’s real views are probably much crazier .
Just think how well he ’d make decisions during an actual crisis !
Jim Henley has by far the most amusing synopsis of this piece I ’ve seen thus far ; I commend it to your in its entirety .
The best line :
You will not enjoy a day of peace so long as Rudy has anything to say about it .
Peace is something we will “ achieve ” in the distant future when the lion has been clubbed senseless with the lamb .
Ezra Klein thinks Giuliani is the standard bearer of the neo-cons , “ He ’s the closest thing to Cheney in the race — right down to the authoritative , secretive streak — and is probably the most dangerous of the Republican contenders . ”
His first commenter is right , though :
This is beyond ideology ; it ’s just dumb .
UPDATE : His illegal immigration policy is n’t any smarter .
It apparently involves nuking Mexico .
UPDATE : Alex Massie sums it up well in his post headline : “ PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH , STRENGTH THROUGH JOY , JOY THROUGH WAR . ”
And there ’s this :
Rudy ca n’t see a mole without wanting to whack it .
That might work on a city scale , but it ’s absurd to think that clearing hookers and pan handlers out of Times Square is somehow a blueprint for foreign policy .
Quite .
UPDATE : And the reviews keep pouring in !
Dan Drezner : “ Sweet Jesus . . . [ t ] his is an unbelievably unserious essay . ”
Steve Benen : “ His approach to foreign policy is spectacularly dangerous , irresponsible , and stupid .
Imagine Dick Cheney with a loaded gun in one hand , and an empty bottle of antidepressants in the other , and you can start to get the idea . ”
Fred Kaplan : “ Had it been written for a freshman course on international relations , it would deserve at best a C - minus ( with a concerned note to come see the professor as soon as possible ) . ”
