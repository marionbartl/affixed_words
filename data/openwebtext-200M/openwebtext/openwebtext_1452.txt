Reducing salt in the American diet by as little as one - half teaspoon ( or three grams ) per day could prevent nearly 100,000 heart attacks and 92,000 deaths each year , according to a new study .
Such benefits are on par with the benefits from reductions in smoking and could save the United States about $ 24 billion in healthcare costs , the researchers add .
A team from the University of California , San Francisco , Stanford University Medical Center and Columbia University Medical Center conducted the study .
The findings appear January 20 in online publication by the New England Journal of Medicine and also will be reported in the February 18 print issue of the journal .
The team 's results were derived from the Coronary Heart Disease Policy Model , a computer simulation of heart disease among U.S. adults that has been used by researchers to project benefits from public health interventions .
" A very modest decrease in the amount of salt , hardly detectable in the taste of food , can have dramatic health benefits for the U.S. , " said Kirsten Bibbins - Domingo , PhD , MD , lead author of the study , UCSF associate professor of medicine and epidemiology and the co-director of the UCSF Center for Vulnerable Populations at San Francisco General Hospital .
" It was a surprise to see the magnitude of the impact on the population , given the small reductions in salt that we were modeling , " Bibbins - Domingo added .
The CHD Policy Model found that reducing dietary salt by three grams per day ( about 1200 mg of sodium ) would result in 11 percent fewer cases of new heart disease , 13 percent fewer heart attacks , 8 percent fewer strokes , and 4 percent fewer deaths .
For African Americans , who researchers believe are more likely to have high blood pressure and may be more sensitive to salt , this degree of salt reduction could reduce new cases of heart disease by 16 percent and heart attacks by 19 percent .

" Reducing dietary salt is one of those rare interventions that has a huge health benefit and actually saves large amounts of money .
At a time when so much public debate has focused on the costs of health care for the sick , here is a simple remedy , already proven to be feasible in other countries , " said Lee Goldman , MD , MPH , senior author , executive vice president for health and biomedical sciences and dean of the faculties of health sciences and medicine at Columbia University .
The American Heart Association reports that salt consumption among Americans has risen by 50 percent and blood pressure has risen by nearly the same amount since the 1970s -- despite evidence linking salt intake to high blood pressure and heart disease .
" In addition to its independent benefits on blood pressure , reducing salt intake can enhance the effects of most anti-hypertensive ( blood pressure lowering ) agents and reduce complications associated with diabetes , obesity and kidney disease , " said Glenn M. Chertow , MD , study co-author , professor of medicine and chief of the Division of Nephrology at Stanford University .
According to federal government data , the average American man consumes more than10 grams of salt ( 4000 mg sodium ) daily .
Most health organizations recommend far lower targets -- no more than 5.8 grams of salt per day ( 2300 mg sodium ) and less than 3.8 grams for those over 40 .
Each gram of salt contains 0.4 grams of sodium .
" It 's clear that we need to lower salt intake , but individuals find it hard to make substantial cuts because most salt comes from processed foods , not from the salt shaker , " Bibbins - Domingo said .
" Our study suggests that the food industry and those who regulate it could contribute substantially to the health of the nation by achieving even small reductions in the amount of salt in these processed foods . "
The New York City Department of Public Health and other state and local municipalities nationally have seen salt as an important target for regulation .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg has already made sweeping changes to the City 's health regulations , including cutting trans fats in eating places and requiring fast - food restaurant menus to list calories .
Now the city is seeking to join a national movement in cutting salt intake by 25 percent , which he referenced in today 's State of the City address .
" Our projects suggest that these regulatory efforts could both improve health and save money because of the healthcare costs avoided , " said Bibbins - Domingo .
" For every dollar spent in regulating salt , anywhere from seven to 76 healthcare dollars could be saved . "

Sgt Wuterich said he regretted the loss of civilian lives
A US marine is to go on trial over the killing of 24 men , women and children in the Iraqi town of Haditha in 2005 .
The trial of Staff Sgt Frank Wuterich will go ahead after a military judge in California refused to dismiss the charges .
Sgt Wuterich is one of eight marines originally charged with murder or failure to investigate the killings .
The charges against six of them were dropped or dismissed , and one was acquitted .
Lawyers for Sgt Wuterich had argued that his case should be dismissed .
They said that an investigator into the incident was involved in meetings with the general who brought the initial charges against the soldiers .
But the judge ruled that there was no unlawful influence and no record of any " meaningful comment " between the general and an aide who had investigated the case as a military lawyer .
It means Sgt Wuterich faces a trial on charges of voluntary manslaughter and other crimes connected to the attack in Haditha .
The deaths occurred after a marine was killed by a roadside bomb .
Sgt Wuterich and a squad member were accused of shooting five men by a car at the scene .
Investigators say he then ordered his men to clear several houses with grenades and gunfire .
At an earlier hearing , Sgt Wuterich said he regretted the loss of civilian lives but believed he was operating within military combat rules when he ordered his men to attack .

Sometime within the past year , nearly 4,800 women participated in an experiment at Faceresearch.org , the online psychology laboratory of the Face Research Laboratory at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland .
They were young women , mostly in their early - to mid-twenties , and all identified their ethnicity as white .

We all know that globally , terrorism kills several hundred people every year .
We also know that tens of thousands of people die each year in the U.S. , due to lack of health care .
But this poster , designed by Schuhle - Lewis , connects the two issues in a pretty sobering way .
You ’ll notice that the poster is actually a stealthy infographic–there are 58 skulls ( count ’em ) in the illustration up top :
Visually stunning , this also raises some fundamental questions , no matter your politics .
First , the health - care study cited in the graphic is concerned mainly with people who die simply because they ’re not regularly monitoring their health .
But the numbers of people who do n’t die because they lack health care–and who take care of their health only when it ’s too late , in emergency rooms–is surely much larger .
That ’s wildly inefficient .
Emergency care is extravagantly expensive–and that in turn feeds the spiraling cost of medical care in the U.S .
( Note : We could find who designed the poster above — Any help out there ? )

Tax credits for first - time buyers have been extended until April
Sales of new homes in the US fell to their lowest level on record in February as the cold weather discouraged buyers , figures have shown .
Sales fell by 2.2 % to a seasonally - adjusted annual rate of 308,000 , down from a revised rate of 315,000 in January , the Commerce Department said .
It was the fourth consecutive monthly fall in home sales and a much lower figure than economists had expected .
Figures released on Tuesday showed existing home sales also falling .
" The housing market is really struggling to find its footing despite huge government support efforts .
The near - term outlook for the housing market remains quite poor , " said Zach Pandl at Nomura Securities .
Home sales have fallen every month since October .
This is partly explained by the extension in tax credits for home buyers , which were due to expire in November before being extended to April .
There had been a sharp upturn in sales before November as buyers rushed to take advantage of the credits .
Once they were extended , the incentive to buy disappeared .
If there is no pick - up in sales in March and April as buyers look to take advantage of the credits , analysts say , fears about the longer - term prospects for the housing market will heighten .
The median sales price for February was $ 220,500 ( £ 147,971 ) .
Inspired by a visualisation done last year of $ 1 trillion , I spent a little time playing with Google Sketchup to try and understand just how much money Anglo ( ie the public ) is expected to lose in its latest fiscal year .
So I started with the average male as used in Sketchup ( let ’s call him Seanie ) and drew him next to € 1 million in € 100 bills , to scale :
Next here ’s Seanie next to € 10 million :
And now Seanie next to € 100 million , on a standard euro sized pallet :
And oh yes , Seanie next to € 1 billion , in cool hard cash :
And finally , Seanie next to the lower end projected losses for Anglo : € 11 billion :

Yamalo - Nenets Autonomous Okrug ( Yamalo - Nenetsky , Yamalo - Nenetsia , Yamalia ) is a federal subject of Russia , part of the Tyumen region and the Ural Federal District .
Salekhard is the capital of the region .
/ The Yamalo - Nenets region could become a new supplier of halal meat to Muslims in Qatar .
This week Qatari officials will get their first taste of reindeer at Russia - Qatar investment forum in Doha .
Russia is rich in tasty reindeer .
Yamalo - Nenets region history
The first information about the Yamal land and indigenous peoples living there - the Nenets and Khanty , refer to the 11th century .
However , Novgorod merchants visited “ the Edge of the Earth ” ( this is how “ Yamal ” is translated from the Nenets language ) even earlier .
From 1187 , the lower Ob was under the control of Veliky Novgorod , and , after its fall , it passed to the Moscow princes .
In 1592 , Tsar Feodor sent an expedition for the final conquest of the lands of the “ great Ob . ”
In 1595 , one of the Cossack detachments built a fortress called Obdorsk ( today , it is the capital of the Yamal - Nenets Autonomous Okrug - Salekhard ) .
Obdorsk fortress became the northernmost Russian settlement in Siberia at the time .
Gradually the population grew , active trade in furs , mammoth bone , boats , fur clothes , and other goods was developed .
More historical facts …
This was promoted by the famous Obdorsk Fair .
In January - February , the Nenets and Khanty , merchants of Tobolsk , Yenisei , Arkhangelsk gubernias gathered there .
From 1796 to 1920 , this region was part of the Tobolsk gubernia ( province ) .
By the beginning of the 20th century , Obdorsk annually exported up to 3,200 tons of fish and about 50,000 fur skins ( arctic fox , fox , squirrel , ermine , etc. ) .
In 1930 , the Yamal ( Nenets ) district was formed as part of Uralskaya oblast with the center in Obdorsk .
In 1933 , Obdorsk was renamed to Salekhard ( meaning “ a settlement on the cape ” in the Nenets language ) .
In 1939 , according to the All - Union Population Census , there were 45,734 people in the district , including 15,348 nomads .
The main branches of the economy of the region in the pre-war years were the fishing industry and reindeer husbandry , harvesting of furs grew at a rapid pace - 10 times from 1931 to 1940 .
In 1944 , it was included in the Tyumen region .
After the end of the Second World War , a new branch of the economy ( fur farming ) began to develop rapidly ( silver - black foxes , blue arctic foxes , mink ) .
In the summer of 1958 , the Yamal - Nenets complex geological exploration expedition was established in Salekhard .
Intensive search for hydrocarbon deposits began .
From 1964 to 1966 , on Yamal , a number of large deposits of natural gas were discovered , including Gubkinsky deposit with a reserve of 350 billion cubic meters of natural gas and Urengoy deposit ( the largest in the world ) .
In 1977 , the Yamalo - Nenets okrug became an autonomous region .
In 1991 , the Yamalo - Nenets region adopted a declaration of sovereignty .
In 1992 , after the signing of the Federative Treaty , the Yamalo - Nenets Autonomous Okrug became a full - fledged subject of the Russian Federation .

Yamalo - Nenets okrug features
Most of the Yamalo - Nenets region is located within the northern part of the West Siberian Plain , a small part is located on the eastern slope of the Ural mountains .
From the north it is washed by the Kara Sea .
This province belongs to the regions of the Far North , more than half of its territory is located beyond the Arctic Circle .
The territory of the Yamalo - Nenets okrug is located in three climatic zones : arctic , subarctic and the zone of the northern strip of the West Siberian lowland .
The climate is determined by the presence of permafrost and the cold Kara Sea , the abundance of bays , rivers , marshes , and lakes .
Frequent magnetic storms are accompanied by colorful northern lights .
In general , the climate of this region is characterized by a long winter ( up to 8 months ) and a short summer , strong winds , a small amount of snow cover .
The average annual air temperature is negative , in the Far North it reaches minus 10 degrees Celsius .
The minimum temperature in winter drops to minus 55 degrees Celsius , in summer - up to plus 30 degrees Celsius .
The name of the region mentions the Nenets as the titular nationality inhabiting this territory , despite the fact that the majority of the local population is Russian .
The ethnic composition of the population according to the 2010 census : Russians ( 61.7 % ) , Ukrainians ( 9.7 % ) , Nenets ( 5.9 % ) , Tatars ( 5.6 % ) , Khanty ( 1.9 % ) .
The largest cities and towns are Novy Urengoy ( 111,000 ) , Noyabrsk ( 106,600 ) , Salekhard ( 48,300 ) , Nadym ( 45,000 ) .
Natural resources of the Yamalo - Nenets autonomous region
The region ’s water resources are rich and diverse : the coast of the Kara Sea , numerous bays , rivers , lakes , and underground waters .
Ob Bay is one of the largest sea bays in the Russian Arctic .
In total , there are about 300 thousand lakes and 48 thousand rivers , the largest of which are the Ob , Nadym , Taz , and Pur .
Yamalo - Nenets okrug is on the leading places in Russia for hydrocarbon reserves , especially natural gas and oil .
Today , Yamal produces about 90 % of all natural gas in Russia ( about 20 % of global production ) and more than 14 % of Russian oil and gas condensate .
In the Polar Urals , chrome , manganese , bauxite , and gold are mined .
At the same time , a huge part of the region ’s natural reserves is still waiting for industrial development .
One of the long - term projects is the development of the gas reserves of the peninsula and the shelf of the Kara Sea .
There are 11 gas - bearing and 15 oil and gas condensate fields discovered here .
Potential resources including gas on the shelf are estimated at 50.5 trillion cubic meters , liquid hydrocarbons - more than 5 billion tons .
One of the peculiarities of Yamal is that industrial development of natural resources and traditional activities of the indigenous population of the Far North coexist together .
The world ’s largest reindeer herd is grazed here - more than 600 thousand heads .
The tenth part of the whole area of the region - about 8 million hectares - is a specially protected natural area .

Egypt ’s Reluctant Revolutionary
Austrian Airlines Flight 863 touched down in Cairo at 5:30 p.m. today , completing its journey from Vienna two and a half hours late .
A jubilant crowd of Egyptians waited in Cairo ’s airport lobby , anywhere between 1,000 and 4,000 people , tracking the flight ’s progress carefully as they waved Egyptian flags and sang the national anthem .
Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei — former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , Nobel Peace Prize laureate , and potential presidential contender — was returning home .
ElBaradei ’s return represents a headache for Hosni Mubarak , Egypt ’s 81 - year - old president .
Mubarak is widely believed to be shepherding his son , Gamal , into the presidency , possibly as early as the upcoming 2011 presidential election .
But this past December , ElBaradei dropped a bombshell that complicated Mubarak ’s plans :
He would consider a run for Egypt ’s presidency — provided that the government ensured a fair campaign and revised the restrictive amendments to the Egyptian Constitution that outline who can contend for the presidency .
ElBaradei ’s third term at the IAEA expired on Nov. 30 , 2009 .
Since then , he has been living in Vienna , where the IAEA is based , reportedly tying up loose ends after 12 years at the helm of the organization .
In January , he gave an interview to Foreign Policy where he elaborated on his career at the IAEA and expanded on his future in Egyptian politics .
There was no shortage of skeptics who maintained that ElBaradei ’s return would elicit little more than an ambivalent reaction from the Egyptian public .
Yes , the " Draft ElBaradei " campaign boasts an official - looking website and a Facebook group of over 60,000 members .
But how many of those e-supporters would actually be motivated — and risk the potential government crackdown — to attend ElBaradei ’s homecoming ?
" In Egypt , we have a big gap between virtual life and reality , " worried Amr Choubaki , an Egyptian analyst with the al - Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies .
" Many people participate in the movement on the Internet , but the majority of them do n’t go to the street . "
For today , at least , the enthusiasm for ElBaradei ’s campaign exceeded expectations .
The fear of a crackdown , especially following the arrest of two opposition activists of the April 6 Movement on Thursday , turned out to be unnecessary .
Hassan Nafaa , a political science professor at Cairo University , credited the late arrival of ElBaradei ’s flight as part of the reason for the strong turnout .
" It was actually a help to us , because people realized the airport was safe , " he said .
" Those at the airport were able to contact their friends and tell them that there was no intervention from the security services . "
FP contributor Issandr Amrani’s Twitter feed ( @arabist ) provided a running commentary on the events transpiring at Cairo International Airport .
Egyptian security attempted to convince ElBaradei to avoid the crowd by leaving through the VIP lounge , but he refused .
The crowd ’s size kept him from leaving through the airport lobby , however , so he exited through another terminal — which , as onlookers pointed out , precluded the need to give a speech .
If ElBaradei does decide to pursue a presidential run , he will have at least one factor working for him : the unmistakable appetite for change in Egypt after nearly three decades of Mubarak .
" People are bored and tired of the Mubaraks — not only of the father , but of the wife , and of the two sons — who have dominated Egyptian politics for so long , " said Saad Eddin Ibrahim , a sociologist and noted Egyptian dissident .
" [ ElBaradei ] is equipped as well as anyone can be for the position … now the only question is whether he can build the infrastructure and the enthusiasm to overcome the obstacles that remain . "
And there is no shortage of obstacles .
The odds are still overwhelmingly against ElBaradei wresting power from the hands of the Mubaraks .
To build on the momentum achieved during his homecoming , ElBaradei must overcome a number of daunting challenges : the coercive power and legal restrictions raised by the Mubarak regime , the fractured nature of the anti-Mubarak opposition — and perhaps even his own ambivalence about playing a role in Egyptian public life .
The Egyptian police have no shortage of tools to wield against ElBaradei should he move ahead with his campaign .
Ibrahim , who has a decade ’s worth of familiarity with the regime ’s repressive tactics — most recently , in 2008 , he was sentenced by an Egyptian court to two years in prison for " defaming Egypt " — raised a litany of ways the regime could make ElBaradei ’s life difficult .
" The first is rumors — about him , about his family .
Next , they will use allegations that he is out of touch with Egypt , that he has been gone from the country for so long that he does not know what life is like there , " Ibrahim stated .
" Finally , they will use intimidation and threats , against him personally and against his family . "
But the Egyptian government will not only use its sizeable security apparatus against the opposition , it will also use its lawyers .
Article 76 of the Egyptian Constitution currently stipulates that presidential candidates must have a senior leadership position in a legal party for at least a year prior to running for president .
Since citizens looking to form a party must receive the approval of a committee dominated by Mubarak ’s National Democratic Party ( NDP ) — a condition that ElBaradei referred to as " laughable " in an interview with the Egyptian independent daily al - Shorouk — the Mubarak regime has effective control over who runs for president , and ElBaradei is technically not eligible .
" The constitution is written in a way that I can not run unless I join an existing party , which , to me , is not how a democratic system works , " ElBaradei told Foreign Policy in January .
But given the abject state of the Egyptian opposition movement , any kind of legislative or constitutional victory is highly unlikely .
After briefly flirting with a democratic opening in 2004 and early 2005 , Mubarak quickly reasserted his dominance over Egypt ’s political scene .
He seized firm control of the levers of power with 88.6 percent of the vote in the 2005 presidential election , while the NDP seized 311 of 454 seats in the Egypt ’s People ’s Assembly .
This was a shattering blow to the Egyptian opposition .
" They have suffered from a lack of popular personalities , a lack of ideas — and a lack of a popular constituency , " stated Amr Hamzawy , a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace .
To change the constitution , as ElBaradei has insisted , he ’ll need strong allies within the government .
But , at the moment , it appears unlikely that the opposition groups will be able to deliver .
ElBaradei ’s conditions for playing a role in Egyptian public life have also exacerbated these difficulties .
He has stated that unless radical revisions are made to the Egyptian Constitution – which the Mubarak regime has flatly stated will not occur before the 2011 election – he will not run for president .
It is unclear , however , if he intends to rally popular support within Egypt for those changes to be made .
" Asking [ Mubarak ] to change the rules of the game as a condition to play in the game is , in my mind , maybe unrealistic , " noted Hamzawy .
" You have to have a different attitude :
You have to be on the ground and struggle , create momentum , and lead an opposition movement , and then see what will come out . "
In his interview with Foreign Policy in January , ElBaradei assumed the role of a beleaguered draftee into Egypt ’s presidential race ; he stated that he would be perfectly happy to retire from public life but was being encouraged to run from those close to him .
The fact that he refrained from giving a speech at the Cairo airport , to the disappointment of his supporters , could be another sign that he ’s holding back .
The looming question is whether the Mubarak regime will provide the political space for ElBaradei to be an agent for change within Egypt — but something less than a full - fledged revolutionary .
Dr. Hassan Nafaa , the political science professor at Cairo University , noted that he had spoken to ElBaradei and that they had agreed he would gather 20 to 25 prominent Egyptian professors and activists to discuss the next step of his fledgling campaign .
" I hope this is a fruitful discussion for him , and also it will be for us to understand what we can expect from him , and how we can organize a campaign to pressure the government to amend the constitution , " Nafaa said .
So begins Egypt ’s 2011 presidential campaign — and even if most of ElBaradei ’s involvement is from the sidelines , his return presents some potential for reform in the long - stagnant world of Egyptian politics .
" A lot of hopeful Egyptians are rallying to his support , " said Ibrahim .
" And , at the very least , it will be good if he can shake up the regime . "

Domestic cats are what are called obligate carnivores .
This means , unlike dogs , they are true carnivores .
Meat must make up the majority of their diet and they have an extremely difficult time digesting vegetable matter .
Some vegetarians and vegans acquire pet cats and immediately want to switch them to a vegan or vegetarian diet for cats .
Sadly enough , these diets , and foods , do exist , and are marketed for cats through specialty stores that cater to vegetarians and vegans .
Regular dry cat food , the stuff sold through grocery stores and department stores , is already considered a poor source of meat for cats .
Indeed if you look at most dry cat food ingredient lists you will see corn as a key ingredient .
Corn is hardly a good meat source .
It is hard for cats to digest and is a well known cause of allergies for both cats , and dogs .
Most vegetarians are against eating fish and dairy , but a few find these acceptable and make up for not feeding chicken and other animals to their cat , but feeding it fish or dairy .
These people fail to note that while cats love fish and dairy neither are natural for them , and both can cause problems .
Fish , especially Tuna is high in mercury and PCB's .
Salmon is high in Calcium , and like the problems with calcium in milk , contributes to urinary tract problems .
Even boneless fish are high in phosphorus and magnesium , both of which contribute to urinary tract problems .
Additionally most cats are lactose intolerant so dairy products cause tummy upset and even diarrhea .
Cats need other vitamins and minerals not found in vegetarian , and certainly not in vegan , diets .
These include taurine , arachidonic acid , Vitamin A , and B12 .
Taurine is necessary in cat food and if lacking can make the cat blind .
Even dog food does not contain sufficient Taurine for cats .
Arachidonic Acid is a fatty acid that cats require .
It is present in eggs in only a small amount so meat is an ideal source .
Vitamin
A is found in some vegetables but cats cannot absorb it unless in the retinol form which only comes from meat sources ( particularly liver ) and is also limited in eggs .
Vitamin B12 can only come from meat sources as cats cannot synthesize their own .
Protein is the biggest concern .
While vegetarian , and vegan , cat foods claim a certain amount of protein , if it is in vegetable matter it is very hard for cats to digest .
As such a cat must eat a lot more food to get its full needs of protein .
Only one of these animals is a vegetarian .
Cats who are on vegetarian or vegan diets really are not vegetarians or vegans , they are just forced to eat that kind of food and if given the opportunity would certainly prefer to eat meat .
Cats are natural predators , they would love to kill and eat a mouse , bird , or anything .
In the United States a pet food must qualify under the AAFCO ( Association of American Feed Control Officials ) regulations .
Unfortunately these regulations are not terrifically high .
These regulations permit the use of cancerous tumors , worm infested organs , and even road kill and euthanized animals ( the later two will show up listed as meatmeal on an ingredient list ) .
As such it is no surprise that AAFCO regulations have approved some vegetarian and vegan cat foods .
It is up to you , the owner , to feed your cat correctly , not only should they not have foods that contain corn as the main ingredient , they should not be fed vegetarian , or vegan cat foods even if the food administration approves them for cats .
If a person wants a vegetarian or vegan pet , they should get a Rabbit , Guinea Pig , or even a Horse .
On the other hand I fully support a person 's choice for themselves to be a vegetarian , or vegan .

( CNN ) -- A South Korean couple arrested for allowing their baby to starve to death had been raising an online child , state media reported citing police sources .
The couple , residents of a Seoul suburb , allegedly neglected their prematurely born three - month - old daughter , feeding her just once a day in between 12 - hour stretches at a neighborhood internet cafe , the official Yonhap news agency reported .
Police said the couple had become obsessed with raising a virtual girl character called " Anima " in " Prius Online " , a popular role - playing game in South Korea .
" The couple seemed to have lost their will to live a normal life , because they did n't have jobs and gave birth to a premature baby , " said Chung Jin-won , a police officer .
" They indulged themselves in the online game of raising a virtual character so as to escape from reality , which led to the death of their real baby . "
Professor Kwak Dae-kyung of Seoul 's Dongguk University told the Yonhap news agency that the couple appeared to have lost track of reality .
" Online game addiction can blur the line between reality and the virtual world .
It seems that taking care of their on - line game character erased any sense of guilt they may have had for neglecting their daughter . "
Dae - kyung urged the government to prepare measures so that families and neighbors can contact local authorities or hospitals if anyone shows symptoms of online addiction .
" This kind of situation is not a problem that an individual can solve , " he said .
Moments ago the President issued a statement on the National Broadband Plan just released by the Federal Communications Commission :
America today is on the verge of a broadband - driven Internet era that will unleash innovation , create new jobs and industries , provide consumers with new powerful sources of information , enhance American safety and security , and connect communities in ways that strengthen our democracy .
Just as past generations of Americans met the great infrastructure challenges of the day , such as building the Transcontinental railroad and the Interstate highways , so too must we harness the potential of the Internet .
Expanding broadband across the nation will build a foundation of sustained economic growth and the widely shared prosperity we all seek .
I commend Chairman Julius Genachowski , the Commissioners , and the FCC staff for their hard work in developing the National Broadband Plan .
My Administration will build upon our efforts over the past year to make America 's nationwide broadband infrastructure the world ’s most powerful platform for economic growth and prosperity , including improving access to mobile broadband , maximizing technology innovation , and supporting a nationwide , interoperable public safety wireless broadband network .
It ’s hard to know what to be more nostalgic about , all those childhood dreams of space opera or the optimism of an era in which imagination and technology were booming and every other ad ended with a pitch to come work for the thriving company of the future .
“ To advance yourself professionally , you should become a member of one these teams .
Write to N. M. Pagan , ” reads a typical notice from the Martin Company , now part of Lockheed Martin .
You do n’t hear that much these days .
Back then , you , too , sitting at a drafting table or in a cubicle , designing antennas or self - locking nuts among acres of such boards and cubicles — “ Reaching for the Moon , Mr. Designer ? ” reads a Kaylock ad — could be a space hero .
And of course it was almost exclusively men depicted in the ads .
One exception was an ad from the National Cash Register Company for a new electronic machine for posting checks .
“ And what the POST - TRONIC does electronically the operator cannot do wrong — because she does n’t do it at all ! ” says the ad showing a woman floating in space at the machine ’s console .
Naturally , there was a hook to those recruitment ads , as Ms. Prelinger points out .
The real business of most of those aerospace companies was not the space program but defense — building fighters , bombers , missiles and other implements of the cold war , not to mention commercial airliners .
For many of these places , the space program was more of a hindrance than a boost to the bottom line , a sort of prestigious loss leader to attract cutting - edge talent .

Occasionally , as Ms. Prelinger reports , the darker side of this work bled through into the trade press and the ads , like when the Marquardt Corporation , which made small control rockets for satellites , showed a spy satellite aiming its lens down at Earth .
If the space fever began in 1957 with Sputnik , it cooled by 1962 , when the basic plan for the Apollo moon missions was set and there was no more space for imaginations to run wild .
Also , by then NASA ’s budget was leveling off .
Ms. Prelinger said that during this period about half a million engineers , scientists , draftsmen and other people followed the clarion call to blend their talents into the new age , swelling the ranks of aerospace workers to more than a million .
The Intelligence Project identified 512 " Patriot " groups that were active in 2009 .

We like to be in control of our own lives , and some of us have an automatic rebellious streak when we 're told what to do .
We 're less likely to do a task if we 're ordered to do it than if we make the choice of our own volition .
It seems that this effect is so strong that it even happens when the people giving the orders are ... us .
In a set of three experiments , Ibrahim Senay from the University of Illinois has shown that people do better at a simple task if ask themselves whether they 'll do it than if they simply tell themselves to do so .
Even a simple reversal of words - " Will I " compared to " I will " - can boost motivation and performance .
Therapists and managers alike are taught to ask people open questions that prompt them to think about problems for themselves , rather than having solutions imposed upon them .
Senay 's work suggests that this approach would work even if we 're counselling or managing ourselves .
When we question ourselves about our deeds and choices , we 're more likely to consider our motivations for doing something and feel like we 're in control of our actions .
The effect is small but significant .
To begin with , Senay asked 53 psychology students to solve an anagram task , rearranging the letters of ten words into ten new ones .
Before they started , they had to spend a minute thinking about either whether they would work on the task or simply that they would so do .
The first group ended up with significantly higher scores than the second .
For his next experiment , Senay duplicated the same effect without any explicit instructions .
Under the guise of a handwriting study , he asked 50 students to practice writing the words " I will " , " Will I " , " I " , or " Will " .
After 20 repetitions , they were given some anagrams to do .
The students who wrote " Will I " solved twice as many as those in the other groups .
None of them guessed the true purpose of the experiment .
Finally , Senay asked 56 students to once again write 20 lines of either " I will " or " Will I " .
Afterwards , they had to rate their intentions to start exercising regularly or continue doing so .
They also had to rate 12 reasons for exercising according to their relevance to them , from internal motivators like taking responsibility for their health to external motivators like feeling guilty or ashamed of being idle .
As before , the simple word swap had a significant effect .
The recruits who wrote " Will I " were more likely to want to exercise , and their extra impetus was driven by a boost of self - motivation rather than a stronger pull from outside influences .
This is n't the only study to show that subtle grammatical shifts can sway our intentions and behaviour .
Just last year , William Hart and Dolores Albarracın ( who also worked on Senay 's study ) showed that people are more likely to repeat their actions if they describe things they did in the imperfect tense ( " I was solving anagrams " ) than the perfect tense ( " I solved anagrams " ) .
The latter construction firmly suggests that something was completed , while the former has more of an ongoing vibe .
This area is ripe for more investigation .
Next , Senay wants to see if other verbs , like can , should or would , can affect our behaviour in a similar way .
He 's also interested in whether speaking in an active or passive voice matters - the answers to that question should be of interest to all scientists and science writers , especially in light of this excellent Nature piece on whether a constant use of the passive voice could be young harming scientists .
For now , Senay 's work is a testament not just to the subtle power of grammar , but to the value of introspection and the simple act of asking yourself questions .

The Army has filed charges for a special court - martial against Spc. Alexis Hutchinson , a single mother of a one - year - old baby .
Hutchinson missed her deployment to Afghanistan late last year when her child - care plans for her son , Kamani , fell through at the last minute .
Hutchinson and her attorneys had been working with the Army in good faith to resolve her situation administratively , rather than through the criminal process , and still hoped that would have been the most fair and compassionate way for the Army to deal with the difficult situation .
Maj .
Daniel Gallagher is the rear detachment commander of the 3rd Infantry Division , and is , according to Hutchinson ’s civilian attorney Rai Sue Sussman , “ the one who signed the charges [ against Hutchinson ] . ”

The first thing you have to know about procrastinating is that you should set your expectations realistically .
It took you a lifetime to get to where you are today in terms of procrastination , so it ’s not something you can fix overnight .
But it is something you can fix .
All you need is the dedication to do so and the willingness to try something new .
Since most of procrastination has to do with irrational beliefs and cognitive distortions , it is best to address these up - front .
First , it is usually easy to estimate the actual amount of time it takes to complete a task by keeping track of the amount of time spent on tasks .
For example , if you track that it takes you approximately five hours of study time to get an A or B on a history exam , you can use that information for helping to better schedule your study time on future exams .
Second , you will be no better motivated in the future than you are right now .
This common fallacy leads many people who procrastinate to simply putting off things into the future when they ’re in “ the right mood . ”
Your ability to be successful at any task is not dependent upon your mood .
Sometimes we have to do something we do n’t like to do , even if we do n’t feel like it , just to get it done .
That does n’t mean our results are going to be of lesser quality or the task will be a failure .
It just means that sometimes motivation comes after you ’ve started work on something .
And sometimes , working on a project helps bring about a change in our mood .
We ca n’t always expect to be in the right mood all the time .
Neither should you expect to only be able to work on things in life when you ’re in the right mood .
These are just elaborate excuses we make up to reinforce our procrastinating behavior .
You can , however , choose to ignore them .
Remember that as you go through this process , you must constantly challenge your cognitive distortions and irrational fears :
It is not hopeless ( few situations are truly hopeless )
( few situations are truly hopeless )
It is not too late ( there is always time if you start now )
( there is always time if you start )
You are smart enough ( or you would n’t have made it this far )
( or you would n’t have made it this far )
You ca n’t do it later ( as you ’ll just keep putting “ later ” off until later )
( as you ’ll just keep putting “ later ” off until later )
You will not perform better under pressure ( the best work is done when it is well thought - out )
Keep a Journal
Challenging your thoughts and beliefs about how you work and how to best complete a task is something you should get in the habit of doing on a daily basis .
It is sometimes helpful to people to keep a little journal of their thoughts that need to be challenged , as well as a rational response to the thought .
For example :
Thought Response “ I ’ll start work on that paper tomorrow since today ’s such a beautiful day ! ” I said that yesterday , too .
It sounds as if I ’m just putting off the inevitable , thinking I need to be in the “ right mood ” or something .
I think I ’ll spend 2 hours working on it today , and still have enough time later to reward myself with enjoying this beautiful day .
“ Oh gosh , I ca n’t believe how much I put off studying for this exam !
There ’s no point in studying now , I ’m sure I ’m going to fail . ”
Well , maybe I should n’t have waited so long to begin studying .
But I have been mostly keeping up with the chapters , and I know pretty much most of what ’s going to be on the exam .
If I start now , it looks like I ’ll be able to get a decent grade on it .
These are just a few examples of how to answer irrational thoughts , but you can come up with many others on your own .
The more you track and write down these kinds of thoughts , the easier it becomes to answer them !
Eventually , you ’ll be able to do this in your head , as soon as the thought pops into it .
But to get started , it ’s usually best to keep a journal .
Most people have so many thoughts throughout the day , you may be surprised by the number you record .
Many of them are harmless , but some of them are keeping you from beating your procrastination .
Those are the ones you should focus on .
You can also use a journal like this to help you keep track of other important things related to your procrastination .
For example , if it took you 8 hours to study for an exam instead of the 4 your allotted , this might be a good place to keep track of that information .
Then for the next exam , you can plan accordingly ( and far more easily ! ) .
Kansas City Wrongful Death Attorneys
Compassionate Support in Your Time of Need
No amount of money makes up for the death a loved one .
An admission or jury finding of negligence does n’t cure the grief and anger .
Yet a wrongful death lawsuit is for the survivors , to compensate for the personal and economic losses and to hold the negligent parties to justice for their careless or reckless actions .
The law firm of Dempsey & Kingsland , P.C. handles wrongful death litigation resulting from motor vehicle accidents and other negligence .
Our wrongful death attorneys have obtained notable verdicts and settlements for a variety of cases .
We practice personal injury in the Kansas City area and surrounding counties of Missouri and Kansas .
Contact us today for a free initial consultation if you lost a spouse , child , or parent to a preventable accident .
Call ( 816 ) 484-3776 .
Compensation in Wrongful Death Cases
Although each case is different , plaintiffs in wrongful death cases may be able to receive compensation for :
Funeral and burial costs
Loss of the future earnings of the deceased
Loss of household and family services provided by the deceased , including housework , yard work , child care , training , tutoring , care of elderly parents and more
Loss of nonpecuniary consortium , companionship , comfort , guidance , counsel , love , and support
The victim ’s conscious pain and suffering and medical expenses before death
Kansas and Missouri have different wrongful death laws .
Our lawyers advise clients about the specific provisions of statutes in each state .
We have the knowledge , tools , and experience to build strong cases and help clients obtain justice after a devastating loss .
Who May File a Wrongful Death Claim in Kansas City ?
State laws determine which parties may file a wrongful death claim :
Missouri : Missouri law allows surviving spouses , children , and grandchildren of the deceased to file a wrongful death lawsuit .
Parents of deceased minor children may also qualify .
Siblings are only permitted to file a wrongful death lawsuit in Missouri if the deceased party had no other surviving parents , spouses , children , or grandchildren .
Missouri law allows surviving spouses , children , and grandchildren of the deceased to file a wrongful death lawsuit .
Parents of deceased minor children may also qualify .
Siblings are only permitted to file a wrongful death lawsuit in Missouri if the deceased party had no other surviving parents , spouses , children , or grandchildren .
Kansas :
In Kansas , wrongful death claims are brought by the deceased person 's estate for the benefit of their " heirs at law , " or those who " take by intestate succession ( without a will ) under Kansas statues . "
For example , if the deceased left a surviving spouse , but no children , all property passes to the spouse by intestate succession .
In this situation , the surviving spouse would be considered an heir at law .
It is best to consult with a knowledgeable Kansas City wrongful death attorney to determine how this provision applies to your specific case .
How Long Do You Have to File a Wrongful Death Claim in Kansas City ?
It is important to remember that like any lawsuit , wrongful death claims must be filed within a certain time period in order to be heard by the courts .
This is known as a " statute of limitations . "
If the statute of limitations period passes and you have not yet filed a claim , you will essentially lose you right to sue and will be unable to pursue compensation for your loved one 's death .
Since complying with the statute of limitations can ultimately make or break your wrongful death claim , it is important to act fast and get an attorney involved early on in your case .
Missouri :
The statute of limitations for wrongful death in Missouri is three years from the date of death .
The statute of limitations for wrongful death in Missouri is from the date of death .
Kansas :
The statute of limitations for wrongful death in Kansas is two years from the date of death .
The statute of limitations may sometimes be extended or " tolled " in rare circumstances where the negligence leading to the deceased person 's death was concealed or otherwise unknown .
An attorney can review the circumstances of your case and help you understand how the statute of limitations applies to your claim .
Fighting Back Against the Insurance Company
Insurance companies often balk at large damages for the noneconomic aspects – such as loss of companionship , pain , and suffering – so we prepare claims from the start as if we will have to convince a jury .
Law partners Lee Dempsey and Bob Kingsland are accomplished trial lawyers who each bring more than 25 years of experience to your wrongful death case .
They are skilled at adding value to settlements through the use of experts , decades of accumulated knowledge , and by not caving in when insurers try to draw the line .
Work with Dempsey & Kingsland
Our Kansas
City wrongful death attorneys are here to counsel you about the legal process and discuss the calculations that make up a wrongful death claim .
We understand that many clients are concerned that they will be unable to take care of their families if the deceased was the breadwinner .
Others may worry about paying for child care or acquiring the skills needed to return to the workforce .
We offer you the answers to questions such as these , helping you understand your options and offering you new perspectives about your future .

Iran ’s Bubble Boys
Over the last seven months , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s base of support appears to have steadily shrunk : Countless conservative politicians and clerics , such as former Intelligence Minister Gholam - Hossein Mohseni - Ejei , have even parted ways with the Iranian president and joined the expanding group of his foes .
But though his list of detractors is getting longer , a number of men continue to stand behind the president , ensuring his hold on power .
Even some symbolic leaders of the opposition green movement , such as former President Mohammad Khatami , declared in recent days that they recognize Ahmadinejad as president of Iran , even if they remain convinced that his re-election on June 12 was rigged .
All the president ’s men — and they are all men , with the exception of the female health minister , Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi — fall into two categories .
Ahmadinejad ’s chosen advisors and cabinet members are either his relatives or men close to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , his powerful supporter .
No matter the amount of criticism or condemnation heaped on the men in this inner circle , the president has remained as loyal to his appointees as they are to him .
The most glaring example is Ahmadinejad ’s appointment two weeks ago of Judge Saeed Mortazavi as the head of Iran ’s Task Force Against Smuggling .
Mortazavi was just named in a report issued by the Iranian parliament as the man largely responsible for atrocities committed in July , following Iran ’s contested presidential election , by state security forces at the Kahrizak detention facility .
According to the report , some demonstrators in the opposition movement imprisoned in Kahrizak were killed , and others tortured , due to mismanagement and abuse .
The parliamentary committee said the dissidents were taken to the detention facility based on orders from Mortazavi , who at the time was Tehran ’s chief prosecutor .
After the deaths were reported in July , Khamenei ordered the facility closed .
Despite Mortazavi ’s tainted reputation — he is also notorious for shutting down hundreds of reformist newspapers and imprisoning their journalists in the late 1990s when he was a judge — Ahmadinejad has ignored widespread criticism of his appointment as the anti-smuggling chief .
The closest person to Ahmadinejad is his chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim - Mashaie , who is also the president ’s brother - in - law .
After Ahmadinejad was declared the winner in the June 12 election , he initially tapped Mashaie to be his vice president .
However , Mashaie ’s statement in 2008 that Iranians are " friends of all people in the world — even Israelis " angered conservatives , who pressured Ahmadinejad to rescind the appointment .
Ahmadinejad refused to back down until Khamenei instructed him to remove Mashaie .
Ahmadinejad ’s subsequent decision to appoint Mashaie as his chief of staff was striking because it defied even Khamenei .
Ignoring Mashaie ’s dismal reputation within Iran , Ahmadinejad praised him last week as " Olya Allah , " a man of God , when a group of supporters questioned him over his reliance on his chief of staff .
Such public adulation has become one of the hallmarks of Ahmadinejad ’s presidency .
Last summer , when bidding farewell to outgoing Health Minister Kamran Baqeri Lankarani , who is highly respected in Iran , Ahmadinejad praised him by saying : " He really worked hard .
I like him in a very special way personally .
He is such a clean and lovely person .
I said somewhere that he is like a peach and you just want to eat him . "
Unswerving loyalty has proven to be the blueprint for career advancement within Ahmadinejad ’s circle .
When Ahmadinejad wanted to secure control of the Intelligence Ministry , he appointed Heydar Moslehi as minister in August 2009 , even though Moslehi had no experience in intelligence work and was unknown in government circles .
Shortly beforehand , the president sacked Mohseni - Ejei , then intelligence minister , after he refused to participate in cabinet meetings with Mashaie , who was vice president at the time .
Some analysts in Iran think that Ahmadinejad used this as an excuse to place his own loyalist as head of the ministry , which plays a key role in spying on and identifying Iranians who work with the opposition movement inside Iran and outside the country .
Moslehi has served Ahmadinejad well .
He is the leading advocate of a government crackdown on the public intellectuals and journalists who form the intellectual wing of the opposition .
After the massive demonstrations in Iran last December , Moslehi stated in an interview on state - run television : " This unrest is different from that of the past and is a prearranged counterrevolutionary movement , designed by agents of the sedition . "
In addition to these loyalists , Ahmadinejad has deliberately chosen others who have close ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps ( IRGC ) , now the most important institution in Iran .
Mojtaba Hashemi-Samareh , who is rarely seen in public , is Ahmadinejad ’s chief political advisor and maintains close connections to both the IRGC and the Basij militias under their control .
He is a close childhood friend of the president and served as his campaign manager during the last presidential election .
He also shares Ahmadinejad ’s affinity for Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi , the powerful , radical cleric who thinks that a world war needs to occur for Islam to prevail around the globe .
Such an outcome , according to Yazdi and his followers , will return the Hidden Imam in Shiite theology back to Earth .
Ahmadinejad and Samareh have benefited from the symbiotic nature of their relationship .
When Samareh was the interim governor of the West Azerbaijan province , he appointed Ahmadinejad to be the governor of Maku , a small city in that province .
Samareh also has a healthy relationship with Khamenei .
Despite the greatest political upheaval in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution , popular demands for his resignation , and the great disdain in which even many conservatives hold him , Ahmadinejad has endured the storm by surrounding himself with these staunch loyalists .
This might enable him to complete his presidential term , but by ousting anyone who does not agree with him , he has deepened the fragmentation within the government and left behind a trail of enemies at a time when he could use more than a small circle of loyalists to confront an opposition movement that grows more formidable by the day .
Jerusalem ( CNN ) --
Israel has no intention of backing down in its argument with the United States over Israeli plans to build 1,600 apartments on disputed land in largely Arab East Jerusalem , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday .
" Our policy regarding Jerusalem is the same as it was over the past 42 years .
We have made it clear to the Americans that for us , building there is just like building in Tel Aviv , " Netanyahu said .
Israel captured the land in question in the spring of 1967 , nearly 43 years ago .
Netanyahu plans to leave for the United States on Sunday night and speak to the influential lobbying group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on Monday .
It is not clear if Netanyahu will meet President Obama on the trip .
Netanyahu also said Israel favors direct talks with the Palestinians .
" We can raise any issue for negotiation and have made it clear we can do so better through direct talks .
Only if you sit down and speak can you reach a real negotiation , " he said .
The two sides had agreed to indirect talks shortly before Israel announced that it plans to build some 1,600 housing units in a disputed part of East Jerusalem .
The move sparked protests and strained the U.S. relationship with Israel , though U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the relationship is " deep and broad " as well as " strong and enduring . "
Clinton has said she expects to meet with Netanyahu during his trip to Washington .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon said Friday the Middle East Quartet condemns Israel 's construction plans .
The Quartet comprises the four international entities seeking peace in the region : the United States , Russia , the European Union , and the United Nations .
The Quartet 's envoy , Tony Blair , said Friday that Israel was offering measures to kick - start the peace process .
Blair 's comments came after a meeting in Moscow , Russia , of the Quartet , which called for Israel and the Palestinians to have direct negotiations and reach a final settlement within two years .
Netanyahu pledged a package of moves to boost confidence and get the peace process back on track , Blair said .
Those measures include steps to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza , Blair said , but he did not specify whether the steps included prisoner releases .
Complex negotiations about the proposal are now taking place , said Blair , a former British prime minister .
Blair said he is certain that Israel genuinely wants a workable peace deal with the Palestinians , but that it is also important for Palestinians to know they would have a viable independent state .
" Arab - Israeli peace and the establishment of a peaceful state of Palestine in the West Bank and Gaza is in the fundamental interests of the parties , of all states in the region , and of the international community , " U.N. chief Ban said .
" In this regard , the Quartet calls on all states to support dialogue between the parties . "
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said he welcomed the Quartet 's statement and hoped it could be translated into action .
" I think it 's really more than words , " he said , " because this is coming at a time when the international community is at its feet now as regards Israeli settlement activity and Netanyahu is still being defiant .
Netanyahu is defying the whole international community now and he 's insisting to continue settlement activity , and he 's telling the world , ' Look , I 'm going to fool you -- I 'm not going to announce any tenders anymore , but I am going to continue with settlements . ' "
But Avigdor Lieberman , the Israeli minister of foreign affairs , indicated resistance to the 24 - month plan .
" You can't force peace in an artificial way with an unrealistic timetable , " he said on a visit Friday to Brussels , Belgium .
" Statements like this only distance a true settlement between Israel and the Palestinians . "
Israel and the Palestinians were supposed to hold indirect " proximity talks " with the Obama administration 's special envoy to the Middle East , former U.S. Sen.
George Mitchell .
But two days after those talks were announced , Israel revealed its plan to build the 1,600 units in East Jerusalem , and that put the entire process on hold .
Erakat said it would be " very difficult " to hold any negotiations -- including proximity talks -- unless Israel rescinds its plan to build in East Jerusalem .

Psychoanalysis and Religion By J.C. Popa After Freud 's example , psychoanalysis is well known to have adopted a critical , atheist position towards religion .
The following fact is less known : the atheism of psychoanalysis does not originate in some nihilistic , irrational opposition to religion .
It springs from two important considerations that the present article is going to explain .
From obsessional neurosis to religion
First of all , experience acquired in psychoanalytic therapy - and we mean obsessional - fobic neuroses mainly - has revealed striking similarities between ritual - religious behavior and the conduct of obsessive neurotic persons .
Hence , the widely spread assertion that religion is nothing but obsessional neurosis stretched to collective scale .
The overestimation of mental activity , of wish , more specifically the belief in the power of thoughts to materialize concrete realities can in fact be found in both the obsessive neurotic person and in animist magic practices , expanded in the ritual of prayer .
Neurotic persons are obsessed with the materialization of their hostile wishes and defend themselves against such threats by assuming defensive psychic positions , in fact truly extremely intricate rituals associating the weirdest of superstitions .
We can meet similar in religious practices , with one amend though : with religious ideology , evil is projected outside the individual , personified in satanic , demonic images .
The exteriorisation of the intra-psychic conflict ( 1 ) gives way to the illusion of a life and death struggle between the worshipper and autonomised Evil .
Biblical tales about demonized people and exorcising rituals also present in Christian Church are the practical consequences of this ideology .
It was then shown that belief in an anthropomorphic , almighty God originates in impressions and feelings in the individuals ' childhood that were initially related to their parents ' images .
Children feel vulnerable confronted with surrounding nature and therefore they look for refuge next to their parents , endowed with supernatural powers .
The fact that we can find belief in God with adults too should not come as a surprise .
Adult life is no less exposed to real and imaginary dangers !
Adults ' extended knowledge on nature and society does not shield them from anxiety ; on the contrary : the more they know , the more they can realize the void of their knowledge .
Hence the need for divine protection and the restoration of infantile relationships - endowed with religious significance - with parental imago .
The fact that , at the beginning , the child does not make clear distinction between maternal and paternal protection explain both the equal distribution of religions of the Mother and the ambivalent character of God - Father ( He is merciful , forgiving but also rough , uncompromising , a tyrant and a devastator ) .
Is it no surprise for us that in many religions God is even called " Father " ?
We could add : an idealized father mainly preserving His numinous qualities ( 2 ) .
As already shown in short , experience psychoanalysis acquired in the therapeutic field can pretend some reevaluation of religious conduct .
It is as true , at the same time , that it does not consume all deeds of religious life .
In this sense , Jungian psychoanalysis , seemingly going beyond the " limited " perspective of Freudian psychoanalysis , has identified the archetype of religious life in human soul .
This archetype , ( = pattern of behavior ) is the empirical basis C. G. Jung laid his entire conception of individuation on ( 3 ) .
We conclude that , from the perspective of psychoanalysis , the revision of religious experience has imposed an atheist attitude with regard to religion centered on the deification of parental image .
This has to do with the same complex of ideas , representations and mystic rituals related to the exacerbation of obsessional neurosis .
Scientific Exigency
Secondly , we have to demonstrate that psychoanalysis participates in the so - called scientific mentality .
It lays stress on the investigation of phenomena , on the rational reflection on their nature .
Rejecting the famous saying " Trust and do n't search " , scientific exigency focuses on what we call " research " .
In addition , it includes the possibility to reproduce similar phenomena , according to natural laws derived from studied phenomena .
When the famous French doctor Charcot was able to hypnotically induce certain hysteria symptoms to his patients , he then scientifically proved that hysteria is no organic disturbance ( even if it assumed a certain constitutional bias towards such manifestations ) .
The influence of this demonstration , quite amazing at the time , was also felt in the elaboration of psychoanalytic methods and theories .
Speculating things a little , we could say that psychoanalysis would n't have been born unless Freud the scientist had witnessed these demonstrations himself ( 4 ) .
The psychiatry of the time had been engulfed in materialist conceptions maintaining that neurotic disturbances - that were to be studied of psychoanalysis later on - were due either to patients ' simulations or to symptomatic effects of their " burdened " heredity or to somatic lesions as yet undiscovered .
To conclude , let us formulate things as follows : psychoanalytic practice and experience , scientific exigency are responsible for assuming an atheist position with regard to psychoanalysis .
But we then saw that the atheism of psychoanalysis is no parti pris once and forever .
Psychoanalysis takes no glory in the unconditioned repression of belief in God .
The entire Jungian work , in the field of religious life archetype , of the individuation process show the extremely up - to - date and concrete way in which psychoanalysis understands to creatively approach the problem of religion .
Notes :
1 . The outward projection of Evil is a vivid phenomenon also present in neurotic disturbances , mainly in psychotic ones .
In paranoid delirium , for instance , the patient has the sharp feeling of some prejudice , some evil made to him from the outside .
The patient ascribes his own feelings to characters in their own social sphere .
In religious conduct , the outward projection of Evil spares the human subject an explanation with his / her own moral censorship .
Even more , this procedure offers an extremis solution towards humans ' moral rehabilitation : if Evil is projected , then it can also be symbolically suppressed by means of the scapegoat practice , for instance , or by exorcising and purification rites , so widely spread in religious communities .
Good too is sometimes projected , in instances when we are told that the divine being is the expression of the highest perfection ( it does not participate , in any way , or only transitorily , to our earthly condition ) .
In that case , the exigency of becoming morally perfect ( as in the urge : " Be perfect as your Father in the Heavens ! " ) , imposes on the individual the illusion of some future rehabilitation depending on his / her efforts in belief and prayer .
2 . The term " numinous " refers to those aspects inspiring paroxysmal feelings in the series terror - ecstasy .
3 . The process of individuation refers to the accomplishment of the Self in Jungian understanding .
A process of conjunction of the contraries , of union between conscious and unconscious , in short of unification of the being .
This process is not restricted to moral integration - it also involves emotional integration .
4 . Between 1885 - 1886 , Freud had a stage with Charcot in Paris .
He presents the vivid memories from his scientific evolution in his later writings and autobiographical specifications --

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Money is still pouring into U.S. bond mutual funds after last year ’s record - setting $ 374.6 billion , a classic sign that the fixed - income market -- and the forlorn small investor -- is ripe for a bruising .
Burned by the equity market meltdown in 2008 and awarded record bond performance last year , when numerous funds posted double - digit returns , investors are staying the course and fail to see the rate trap that looms , some analysts say .
Many investors believe subdued inflation , held back by high unemployment and a gap between productivity and demand , will keep interest rates in check .
U.S. consumer prices excluding food and energy fell in January for the first time since 1982 .
But the once - in - a - lifetime performance of bonds in 2009 and unease over stocks has lulled investors to plow more money into fixed income in a misguided flight to perceived safety .
“ These people , they ’re investing in bonds because they wanted yield , ” said Thomas Atteberry , a money manager at First Pacific Advisors Inc in Los Angeles .
“ The money market fund was n’t giving them anything and so they went into corporate , government , mortgage , some high - yield , that whole gamut . ”
High - yield " junk " bonds on average returned 41.15 percent in the 52 weeks ending February 18 , according Lipper , a unit of Thomson Reuters Corp TRI .TO .
But nearly all bonds performed well last year : corporate BBB - rated funds returned an annual 27.26 percent through last week , and general bond funds had returned an annual 14.2 percent , Lipper data show .
Investors pulled $ 536.7 billion from zero-interest paying money market funds last year , according to the Investment Company Institute .
ICI data show a record amount of fresh money flowed to U.S. bond funds in 2009 , more than double than any previous year .
That massive inflow continues in 2010 .
" Our thesis is they probably do n't understand the interest rate risk they took by doing that , " said Atteberry , who manages the $ 3.9 billion FPA New Income Fund FPNIX.O .
Record investment flows are typical signs of market bottoms -- and peaks -- as the average investor is the last to show up for a bull market or become aware that sentiment is about to turn .
Investors added a record $ 309.4 billion to U.S. equity mutual funds in 2000 at the height of the tech bubble ; the only outflows from stocks the past 20 years were in 2002 , 2008 and 2009 , years that marked deep troughs before sharp market rallies , ICI data show .
Steady consumer prices now mask a likely rise in bond rates due to rising inflation expectations -- when businesses and others try to anticipate higher prices -- and market demands for higher returns , some analyst said .
If rates rise , it will crush the return of investors locked into low - yielding debt .
The benchmark U.S. Treasury note yield now trades at about 3.70 percent .
A rise to its average yield over the past half century of about 6.2 percent could prove bumpy for markets and onerous for investors as prices , which move inversely to yield , drop .
Atteberry believes that the return on the 10 - year U.S. Treasury note over the next five years will be about 90 basis points , or less than 1 percent .
U.S. inflation may rise at a faster pace than economic growth , he said .
Short - and intermediate U.S. Treasury - based bond funds have returned less than 5 percent over the past year , but are a minor chunk of U.S. mutual fund assets .
Jane Caron , chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management Co in Burlington , Vermont , which oversees $ 68.8 billion in fixed - income assets , said she would not be surprised to see Treasuries deliver a negative return this year .
“ It ’s potentially a tough environment for bondholders looking ahead , given our trend in where the economy is probably going and our current fiscal and monetary positions .
All this points to a very negative outlook for bond prices , ” she said .
Caron said even if inflation and its trajectory remain subdued , interest rates are likely to rise because demand will lesson after the Federal Reserve stops buying debt in March .
“ Even if inflation trends remain perfectly quiet this year , and there ’s no reason to be concerned about inflation , I still think you ’re going to see an increase in interest rates ... just for simple supply and demand reasons , ” she said .
For investors who must be invested in bonds , keeping their maturity short or buying floating - rate securities , are the best protection against rising rates , said Carl Kaufman , in charge of fixed income strategy at Osterweis Capital Management in San Francisco .
“ A lot of high - yield companies issued a lot of floating - rate paper .
That ’s one way you can play it , ” Kaufman said .
“ The other way you can play it is to buy shorter - duration paper , which has been the mainstay of our strategy .
I ’m starting to buy shorter - paper now , just to get to ready . ”
Equities , however , are a better inflation hedge than bonds , said Bill Hackney , chief investment officer at Atlanta Capital Management Co LLC in Atlanta , where he helps oversee $ 8.5 billion in assets .
Investing boils down to figuring out where inflation is going to crop up when all investment alternatives are considered , Hackney said .
Natural resource stocks in emerging markets provide an inflation hedge , as does energy worldwide .
“ You want to watch the energy stocks .
You also want to watch those areas of the U.S. economy where we help the rest of the world deal with inflation , and that ’s through technology , ” Hackney said .
The folks at the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics offer a novel way to look at the nearly $ 3.5 billion spent to lobby Congress and federal agencies last year : About $ 1.3 million was spent on lobbying for every hour lawmakers met in 2009 .
Lawmakers in both chambers spent a total of 2,668 hours in session last year , the center said , citing congressional records .
That was a busier - than - usual schedule for Congress , which tackled an aggressive agenda that included health - care legislation , climate - change proposals and plans to impose new regulations on banks and Wall Street .
None of those bills has become law yet .
( As our colleague John Fritze recently wrote , lawmakers worked more days in 2009 than any year since 1995 -- the year Republicans took over both chambers and pushed bills to fulfill the party 's Contract with America . )
More detail on the center 's analysis , including the hourly " rates " of lobbying by industry , can be found here .

Personal Quote :
( 1996 , on $ 20 million paydays )
See , the number in the paper is one thing , but then there 's 35 percent off the top for commissions , then there 's taxes , so the $ 20 million check becomes $ 5.5 million .
That 's amazing money , but it 's not $ 20 million .
Believe me , I do n't gloat about the money .
People have lost fortunes that make mine look microscopic .
You can never count on it for sure .
People that do ...
I have a Flash project , and it has many source files .
I have a fairly heavily - used class , call it Jenine .
I recently ( and , perhaps , callously ) relocated Jenine from one namespace to another .
I thought we were ready - I thought it was time .
The new Jenine was better in every way - she had lost some code bloat , she had decoupled herself from a few vestigial class relationships , and she had finally come home to the namespace that she had always secretly known in her heart was the one she truly belonged to .
She was among her own kind .
Unfortunately , Flash would have none of that .
Perhaps it had formed an attachment .
Perhaps it did n't want Jenine to be decoupled .
Either way , it clung to the old , perfect version of Jenine in its memory .
It refused to move on .
It ignored her ( function ) calls .
It tried to forget her new , public interfaces .
Instead , every instance of Jenine that it constructed was always a copy of the old version , down to its classpath :
var jenineInstance : Jenine = new Jenine ( ) ; trace ( getQualifiedClassName( jenineInstance ) ) ; //
Should print : com.newnamespace.subspace::Jenine // Prints : com.oldnamespace.subspace::Jenine //
Ah , young love !
We fought .
I 'm not proud of some of the things I said or did .
In the end , in a towering fit of rage , I deleted all references of Jenine completely .
She was utterly , completely erased from the system .
My cursor fell upon the " Empty Trash " menu option like the cold lid of a casket .
I do n't think Flash ever recovered .
To this day it still clings to the memory of Jenine .
Her old , imperfect definitions still float through my project like abandoned ghosts .
Whenever I force Flash to compile , it still lovingly inserts her into my movie , nestling her definition in amongst the other , living classes , like a small shrine .
I wonder if they can see her .
Flash and I do n't really talk anymore .
I write my code , it compiles it .
There 's a new girl in town named Summer who looks almost identical to Jenine , as if someone had just copied her source - code wholesale into a new class , but Flash has n't shown any interest .
Most days it just mopes around and writes bad poetry in my comments when it thinks I 'm not looking .
I hope no one else has had a similar experience , that this is just a singular , painful ripple in the horrifying dark lagoon that is the Flash code - base .
Does anyone have any idea how to erase whatever cache the compiler is using ?
Police say the man must have sneaked in just before take - off
Japanese officials are trying to identify a body found on a Delta Airlines flight which arrived in Tokyo from New York on Sunday night .
A mechanic found the body inside one of the landing gear compartments of the Boeing aircraft during maintenance .
The man , who was of dark complexion and dressed only in blue jeans and a long - sleeved shirt , was carrying no passport or personal belongings , police say .
He was possibly a stowaway and probably froze to death , they added .
The temperature in that part of the plane falls to about - 50C during flight .
Police official Zenjiro Watanabe told the Associated Press that the man must have sneaked in just before departure .
He said that the man 's body had no visible injuries except for signs of frostbite .
Mr Watanabe said police were investigating the incident both as an accident and a possible crime .
There has been no official comment so far from Delta officials .

Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) says he 's received messages saying , ' You ’re dead ; we know where you live ; we ’ll get you . '
The backlash : Reform turns personal
Reps .
Louise Slaughter and Bart Stupak have received death threats .
A tea party participant published what he thought was Rep. Thomas Perriello ’s home address and urged disgruntled voters to “ drop by ” for a “ good face - to - face chat . ”

Vandals broke windows at Slaughter ’s office in New York and Rep. Gabrielle Giffords ’s office in Arizona .
And angry voters are planning to protest this weekend at the home of Steve Driehaus — who ’s already seen a photograph of his children used in a newspaper ad published by reform opponents .
The vitriolic health care debate has become personal — too personal , say House Democrats who voted for the bill and now find not just themselves but their families in the cross hairs of opponents .
Slaughter , a Democrat who chairs the House Rules Committee , said a caller to her office last week vowed to send snipers to “ kill the children of the members who voted yes . ”
Her office reported the call to police , who were dispatched to provide protection for Slaughter ’s grandchildren .
She has also been in touch with the FBI and U.S. Postal Service inspectors , who intercepted a letter en route to her home in upstate New York .
Stupak , the Michigan Democrat whose last - minute compromise on abortion guaranteed passage of the bill Sunday , said callers have left messages for him saying , “ You ’re dead ; we know where you live ; we ’ll get you . ”
“ My wife still ca n’t answer the phone , ” Stupak told POLITICO on Tuesday .
The messages are “ full of obscenities if she leaves it plugged in .
In my office , we ca n’t get a phone out .
It ’s just bombarded . ”
Stupak , a former police officer , said he ’s not fazed by the threats or by the prospect of protests at his district office this weekend .
“ I ’ve looked down barrels of guns , ” he said .
“ I ’ve talked my way out of it . ”
But Democrats said their political opponents go too far when they bring members ’ families into the fray .
Driehaus , a Democrat from Ohio , was outraged last week when a group called the Committee to Rethink Reform used a photo of him and his two young daughters in a newspaper ad urging him to vote against any health care reform bill that included federal funding for abortion .
Both the group and the newspaper — the Cincinnati Enquirer — apologized for including Driehaus ’s daughters in the ad .
“ I ’m very protective of my family , like most of us , ” Driehaus said Tuesday .
“ There is no reason for my wife and kids to be brought into any of this .
If people want to talk to me , if people want to approach me about an issue , I ’m more than happy to talk about the issue , regardless of what side they ’re on .
But I do believe when you bring in a member ’s family , that you ’ve gone way too far . ”
Driehaus faults Republicans for providing encouragement to the most extreme opponents of reform .
Last week , House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) warned that anti-abortion Democrats would suffer politically if they voted for the health care bill ; he singled out Driehaus , saying he “ may be a dead man ” and “ ca n’t go home to the west side of Cincinnati ” because “ the Catholics will run him out of town . ”
“ Mr. Boehner made comments about me and my predicament when I go home which I felt were wildly out of bounds for his position and very irresponsible , quite frankly .
He ’s from next door .
That ’s not helpful .
That ’s irresponsible , ” Driehaus said .
Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said , “ The leader does not condone violence , and his remark was obviously not meant to be taken literally .
He is urging Americans to take the anger they ’re feeling and focus it on building a new majority that will listen to the people . ”
No one condones death threats against members or their families , but not everyone is apologetic about taking complaints about health care reform straight to the homes of members .
Mike Troxel , an organizer for the Lynchburg Tea Party , posted what he believed to be Perriello ’s home address on his blog this week , sarcastically urging other tea partiers to stop by and “ say hi and express their thanks regarding his vote for health care . ”
The address turned out to be the home of Perriello ’s brother — who has four children — but Troxel told POLITICO he did n’t intend to remove it from his blog .
“ If they would like to provide me with the address of Tom , then I ’d be more than happy to take it down , ” he said .
“ I have no reason to believe it ’s not his house . ”
A fellow tea party blogger said he thought it was fine for Troxel to post Perriello ’s home address .
“ They have our home addresses , ” said Kurt Feigel , who complained that protesters had little choice but to go to Perriello ’s home because Perriello ’s office does n’t “ respond to e-mail ; they do n’t respond to letters ; they do n’t respond to us showing up at his office .
So what am I going to do ? ”
Perriello said his family does n’t want him to be afraid .
But when asked if he was scared anyway , the Virginia Democrat replied : “ Whatever . ”
“ I ’ve lived in Sierra Leone for two years , where the life expectancy is 34 years old .
If the worst thing that happens is that special - interest groups spend millions of dollars against me and my most ardent opponents organize against me , it ’s hardly a ‘ cry me a river ’ moment — as long as people act civil and within the law . ”
Others are less sanguine .
C.J. Karamargin , a spokesman for Giffords , said staffers in the Democrat ’s district office were “ a little bit shaken ” Monday when they arrived at work to find the glass front door shattered and covered in plywood .
Rep. Earl Pomeroy ( D - N.D. ) said he had to change his personal cell phone number after a Republican gave it out to health care opponents .
And Rep. Dennis Cardoza , a Blue Dog Democrat from California , said he ’s gotten physical threats over health care reform .
“ There are some folks that identified themselves as being members of the tea party [ who ] called , [ and ] my staff has gotten to know their names over time , and they have been very loud and very ugly , ” Cardoza said .
With the House vote behind them , Democrats hope to show voters that health care reform wo n’t wreak the devastation opponents predict — and that tempers will cool as a result .
Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger ( D - Md. ) said he ’s already getting 95 percent fewer calls since Sunday ’s vote .
“ The real problem is the people who are calling and talking about a revolution and overthrowing government , ” he said .
“ They can be angry .
We ’re all for that .
But when they talk about taking over the government , the leadership has to do its part to stop that . ”

In last week 's " Batman and Robin " # 10 , Oberon Sexton advanced the theory that the Domino Killer Batman and Robin have been hunting is actually Bruce Wayne , which is somewhat complicated by the fact that Wayne is currently lost in time .
It 's not the first time Batman 's billionaire alter - ego has been accused of murder .
Heck , the 2002 storyline where Lex Luthor decided to frame him for killing an ex-girlfriend by hiring an assassin who just happened to know that Wayne was also Batman and thus created a drum - tight frame was actually called " Bruce Wayne : Murderer . "
But of course , it turns out that Batman was innocent , because as everyone knows , the Batman does n't kill .
Or does he ?
Bats might claim to have a code against killing , but over the past 70 years , there sure have been a lot of people who died in the course of the Caped Crusader 's war on crime .
That 's why today , ComicsAlliance builds its case around the times Batman has crossed the line , compiled by resident Batmanologist Chris Sims !
CASEFILE # 1 : Batman vs. The Golden Age
The earliest version of Batman was less inspired by the wave of super - heroic peers that were rising up in the wake of Superman ( who debuted the previous year ) , and more by hardcore pulp characters like the Shadow .
Like the Shadow , the Batman of 1939 was frequently seen carrying a gun -- as seen above on the splash page for a story that , ironically enough , has no actual gunplay within -- and was n't above using it to put a permanent end to criminals .
In short , during his first year of adventures , Batman straight - up murdered a lot of dudes .
Snapping necks with a kick , throwing crooks out of windows , capping vampires with his .45 , the guy is brutal , and it's a trend that started in his very first appearance in " Detective Comics " # 27 , when he not only punches a crook into a vat of acid ...
... but then offers up a pithy , supremely unconcerned remark about it too :
Within a few months , though , Batman 's casual disregard for life is replaced by him feeling bad about strangling a henchman with his bat - rope , and then with the institution of the code against killing .
There 's a common misconception among readers that this was part of the clean - up imposed by the Comics Code , but as Michael Fleisher points out in " The Original Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes v.1 , " a resource without which no Batmanologist should be ...
... the time that Batman kills lasts less than two years , and ends a good 13 years before the Code was introduced .
Instead , it 's part of the natural evolution of the character and the creators -- notably Bill Finger and Jerry Robinson , who realized early on that killing off villains precluded recurring arch - nemeses -- figuring out what worked and what did n't .
Thus , the code against killing , which drew the line between pulp vigilante and the newly minted super - hero .
And it 's a good thing , too , because punching guys into vats of acid was n't exactly working out too well for Batman .
CASEFILE #2 : THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF DARKSEID
While Batman 's stance against guns has been a long - established part of the character -- a necessity of reducing the violence that 's been worked into a fundamental part of the story by the murder of his parents at the hands of a pistol - packing hoodlum -- there have been a couple of notable exceptions .
There 's " Batman : Year Two , " a polarizing story that straddles the line between hilariously awesome and hilariously awful , which sees Batman claiming that he has no choice but to use the actual gun that killed his parents to fight crime .
It is admittedly ludicrous , especially since it tells us a young Bruce Wayne stole the gun from the crime scene and then kept it in a little drawer under a gigantic portrait of the Waynes for years , and it 's probably the # 1 reason why " Year Two " was retconned out of Batman 's " official " history almost as soon as it came out .
More recently , though , he made an exception during " Final Crisis , " using a space gun to fire a time bullet at Darkseid , because that sentence is totally awesome the actual , literal God of Evil requires certain allowances .
Unfortunately , despite Batman 's best efforts , it was n't a fatal wound -- at least , not immediately .
The Radion poisoning would 've gotten him eventually , but it weakened Darkseid enough that Superman was able to cancel out his evil vibrations by singing a song while Wonder Woman stopped him from possessing everyone on Earth by tying him up .
It makes a little more sense when you actually read it .
CASEFILE # 3 : Batman vs. " Batman "
Every now and then , someone in Gotham City will put on a Batman costume and set about murdering somebody , but unless you 're operating on a very loose definition of " Batman , " it does n't really count as the Dark Knight murdering someone .
The gentleman doing the neck - snapping above , for instance , might be fighting crime and wearing a Batman costume , but he 's not Bruce Wayne , Dick Grayson , or even Terry McGinnis :
It 's actually ex-policeman Tommy Carma , who sports an absolutely incredible head of hair underneath that cowl .
Carma idolized Batman to the point where he even named his daughter Robin , but when she and his wife were killed by criminals , he -- in a move that I 'm almost convinced was writer Max Alan Collins taking a pot - shot at obsessive fans -- moved in with his mom and used his vast collection of Batman memorabilia to wage a one man war on crime that quickly turned murderous .
Batman took him down , but in a second story , Carma killed two orderlies ( hallucinating that they were Two - Face and the Joker ) , and then , in a coincidence that I thought was a stretch even when I was seven , escaped from Arkham Asylum stumbled onto the Batcave , which was right next door .
Batman takes him down again , but it's a little disingenuous of him to lecture a guy on not killing anyone , especially given what else was going on in the ' 80s .
CASEFILE # 4 : Batman vs. The 80s
In what I can only assume was a round of mass hysteria that afflicted the entire comics industry , the late ' 80s saw Batman just flat - out killing guys like it was the summer of ' 39 all over again .
Not only was there Tim Burton 's wildly popular " Batman " movie , where Batman blew up a factory with people in it , fired machine guns mounted on the batmobile , and threw henchmen and super - villains alike to their deaths from a bell tower , there were also the comics themselves .
ComicsAlliance favorite " Ten Nights of the Beast , " for instance , ends with writer Jim Starlin having Batman totally just locking the KGBeast up in a sewer and leaving him to starve to death .
It 's not undeserved -- in four issues , the Beast racks up a body count of well over a hundred Gothamites -- but it creates a pretty big headache for Marv Wolfman a few years later in a story where he " reveals " that it was all just Batman 's idea of Time Out .
In the original story , though ... ... it's pretty clear that Batman meant this to be the Capital - E End of the KGBeast .
The most egregious example , though , comes from writer Mike W. Barr ( who also wrote " Year Two " ) and artist Trevor Von Eden , in 1982's " Batman Annual " # 8 .
Lest you think I 'm just ragging on Barr here , I will point out that I absolutely love the majority of his Batman comics , which include " Fear For Sale , " the greatest Scarecrow story of all time .
But this one , " The Messiah of the Crimson Sun " ... brother , it 's a doozy .
Something about it just does n't feel like a Batman story to me .
The plot centers around a new villain called , fittingly enough , the Messiah of the Crimson Sun , who has a satellite that turns the sun 's rays into dehydrating death beams and who Batman has to go out into space to stop .
It just seems like it comes from the tradition of James Bond more than Batman , but as that 's perfectly in keeping with the O'Neil / Adams world - traveling adventurer stories , that 's more of a semantic debate that does n't really matter here .
What does matter is that when Batman goes out to space to fight the Messiah of the Crimson Sun , who turns out to be Ra 's al - Ghul , he totally murders him .
They have a kung fu fight in space ( which is pretty awesome ) , and then when Ra 's tries to hightail it in an escape pod , Batman uses his bat - spacecraft remote control ( ?! ) to drag him back into the death rays ... ... and then drops what is quite possibly the most dismissive jerk line of his entire crimefighting career :
" But Batman ... You 've KILLED him ! "
" Have I , Robin ? "
As deforestation clears away more and more of the Amazon Jungle , archaeologists are discovering some surprising things hidden beneath the thick green canopy .
Researchers have found a number of ancient geometric shapes , known as geoglyphs , that are believed to have been carved into the earth more than 700 years ago by indigenous tribes living in the region .
According to this story from Treehugger.com , researchers are using Google Earth to examine recently cleared sections of the Amazon Rainforest .
So far , they ’ve been able to identify more than 300 geoglyphs , most of which had previously gone unseen due to being covered by the jungle and in some cases , the enormous size of the carvings .
As of yet , scientists are unsure as to the purpose of the geoglyphs , as they are often completely undetectable from the ground and seem to serve little practical purpose .
To give you a sense of the scale of these geoglyphs , Archaeologists say that they are often as much as 12 meters wide and 4 deep , and can spread out over hundreds of meters in length .
They were apparently constructed while the jungle was at the height of its growth , which makes their existence all the more puzzling and astounding .
While the researchers discovering these carvings continue to be amazed by what they find , it comes with a bit of sadness as well .
These ancient constructs would remain hidden if it was n’t for the massive deforestation that continues in the Amazon , a process that could have an irrevocable impact on the Earth ’s environment .
When near - bankrupt companies are taken over at the 11th hour by fresh management , it is often the case that their numbers are far worse than we had been led to understand .
In desperation , dodgy directors try to hide the full extent of the horror in the vain hope of bluffing their way through .
That is what Labour is doing to UK plc - and very soon its bluff will be called .

Fellow Ames citizens and Board members of the Ames Community School District ,
I am the coordinator of the Educational Administration program at Iowa State University and the director of the nation ’s only center focused on preparing technology - savvy school leaders .
I also am a parent with three children in the school district .
With the pending departure of Dr. Beyea and Mr. McGrory , you have the chance to hire both a superintendent and a high school principal that share a new vision for P - 12 schooling .
I sincerely hope that you will avail yourself of this unique opportunity .
The economic imperative
We currently are living in times of exponential change .
Not only have digital technologies radically transformed how we conduct our professional and personal lives , they also are destroying entire segments of our society .
Non-location - dependent manual labor jobs are increasingly offshored to the developing world , coordinated through technology - suffused global supply chains .
Many service jobs also are increasingly fungible , able to be located anywhere in the world that has an Internet connection .
The next two decades will see many complex service jobs broken up into component parts , much as we did in previous decades for manufacturing work .
Once these tasks are disaggregated , they will be done by lower - skilled workers who can do these discrete components of the overall work , facilitated by software .
In other words , many high - paying service jobs will turn into globalized piece work .
Since the service professions represent 60 % of our nation ’s economy , the impacts of this are going to be quite significant .
Our school system must prepare graduates for our new economic reality .
The educational imperative
We are creating a new information landscape for ourselves , something that we have not done as a society in centuries .
The printing press removed third - party intermediaries ( the king ’s messenger , the priest ) between average citizens and access to information .
This new revolution is disintermediating the creation of information , allowing us all to be content creators , not just recipients .
We no longer live in an information push - out world where we passively receive information that is broadcast out to us by large entities .
We all now can have a voice .
We all now can be publishers .
We all now can find each other ’s thoughts and ideas and share , cooperate , collaborate , and take collective action .
Time and geography are no longer barriers to working together .
This too is destroying entire segments of our society .
Long - existing barriers to learning also are disappearing .
We now have the ability to learn anything from anyone , at any time , anywhere .
Our informal learning is exploding .
Formal learning institutions are scrambling to reinvent themselves for the new digital paradigm .
Our school system must prepare graduates who are masters of our new information landscape .
The status quo no longer suffices
We are blessed to live in a community whose families possess a tremendous amount of intellectual and social capital .
We have a community that understands science , technology , engineering , and math ( STEM ) issues like no other in the state .
Our community is not just globally - aware but globally savvy , with international experience and understanding rarely found outside of large cities .
We have a community that deeply cares about its children ’s education .
These are powerful assets , but we cannot afford to be complacent .
The status quo no longer suffices .
The technological and information revolutions that now are occurring are upending everything .
Our society is being reshaped in significant ways , and the process is just getting started as digital tools and environments continue to advance at a rapid pace .
Every information - oriented societal sector – journalism , banking , medicine , politics , travel agencies , music , higher education , television , and real estate , just to name a few – are finding that transformative reinvention is the cost of survival in our current climate .
Schools should n’t expect that they somehow will be immune from the same changes that are radically altering other information - oriented societal sectors .
We ca n’t continue to pretend that these revolutions are n’t going to affect us too , in compelling and as yet unknown ways .
Dr. Tony Wagner , Harvard University , notes that there are two achievement gaps in this country .
The first is the gap between the educational experiences of middle - class children and those of most poor and minority children .
The second gap is that between what even our very best schools are teaching and testing versus what all students will need to be successful in today ’s globally interconnected , technology - suffused , information economy .
The new educational paradigm requires an emphasis on critical thinking , collaborative problem - solving , creativity and innovation , information fluency and media literacy , data synthesis and analysis , and the applied use of many other higher - level cognitive skills , much more frequently than we currently are doing in our classrooms .
Our students and schools have a tremendous track record of academic success here in Ames .
We have many things of which to be rightfully proud .
But the second global achievement gap that Dr. Wagner so aptly describes will increasingly be an issue for our schools and our community if we do not transition from a system in which student success is judged by mastery of lower - level cognitive work to one that emphasizes to a much greater degree the skills of higher - level thinking and real - world application .
Future - oriented leadership
The Board has an opportunity this year to fill two critical positions with educators who understand the new landscape that I have described above , who may even have a track record of success at preparing students for the demands of the next half century .
The Ames Community Schools already are an exemplar for many of the state ’s school districts .
Given the tremendous assets that we have in this community , with the right leadership we not only could do what ’s right by our kids but also be an exemplar for the nation and the world .
I am hopeful that you will see this hiring opportunity for what it is and act accordingly .
If you are interested , you may view my presentation to the National Education Association Board of Directors on this topic at www.3dwriting.com/mcleod.
My presentation to the Dubuque School Board is available at http://bit.ly/c3NnNt.
I also would be happy to talk further with the Board about this at any time .
Thank you .

DETROIT–The Moroun family seldom steps out of the shadows to show itself to the world .
They may be billionaires .
They may own the most important bridge Canada has ever known .
But they are just shy that way .
Yet when the local media takes to calling you " crabgrass , " when Forbes magazine slams you as " the troll under the bridge , " when you are on the verge of all - out war with Ottawa , exceptions must be made .
So here we are , inside the American family 's astonishingly private corporate headquarters in suburban Detroit , with Matthew Moroun sitting across the table like the proverbial deer in the headlights .
To call the conversation exclusive does n't quite do it justice .
At 37 , the younger Moroun is in the process of taking over the company reins from his rags - to - riches father , 83 - year - old Manuel " Matty " Moroun .
The heir apparent has never given an interview .
Until now .
" If I get slaughtered in your article , I 'm going to regret this .
All I ask is you treat us fairly , " Moroun says .
After years of bruising lower - level skirmishes with the Canadian government , he has a " big ask , " as they say in diplomatic parlance .
The Morouns know they are a bee in Stephen Harper 's bonnet .
Famously , during one of the Three Amigos summits , the Prime Minister pleaded for then - president George W. Bush 's help in getting rid of the billionaire owners of the Ambassador Bridge – the aging link between Windsor and Detroit that accounts for a quarter of all trade between Canada and the U.S .
" Here 's the thing .
We have never had what I would call a real conversation with the Canadian government , " says Moroun .
" All the talk so far has been at a lower level , and it starts with the Canadians saying , ' No matter what , we 're going to build a new bridge and kill you .
Now what did you want to talk about ? '
It 's a pretty tough way to start off .
It puts us in a position of saying , ' No matter what , we 're going to stop you . ' "
The Morouns say it 's time to start anew .
At the highest level .
If they can win an invitation to Ottawa , if the doors of the Prime Minister 's Office will open , they are ready " to agree to what Canada needs to be able to sleep better at night .
We can allay their concerns .
We can be Canada 's best friends . "
Before weighing the sincerity of the Morouns ' message , some necessary background .
First , it may come as a shock to many Canadians that we do not own this crucial economic artery .
Ottawa , after all , holds title to all but one of the other 25 major crossing points on the border .
( The only other exception is a minor rail bridge at Fort Frances . )
But that is just the way history 's cookie crumbled .
Back in the 1920s , a group of U.S. businessmen bankrolled and built the majestic Ambassador in two years flat .
When they cut the ribbon , it was the world 's longest suspension bridge .
Two weeks later the Great Depression hit , forcing the fledgling bridge company into bankruptcy .
Over the years , both Washington and Ottawa missed numerous opportunities to acquire the bridge .
Then , in the late ' 70s , Matty Moroun – owner of a fledgling Detroit trucking firm – outsmarted everyone , including Warren Buffett , to gain outright control .
His timing was perfect .
The age of free trade was about to dawn .
The Big Three automakers were ramping up cross - border integration , with millions of truck crossings to come .
Moroun shrewdly saw the future and it made him a billionaire .
And an aggressive monopolist , in the eyes of many .
The family 's critics – and they are legion – accuse the Morouns of behaving like old - school robber barons .
Using its chokehold on the bridge as leverage , critics say , the family has built a trucking empire with 5,000 employees on both sides of the border .
And an insurance division that operates in 42 states .
Their private empire is now so great it dwarfs the bridge , which at an estimated $ 60 million a year in toll earnings is mere penny ante .
But the main issue today is this : the Ambassador Bridge is dying .
For all its brilliance as the pinnacle of 20th century infrastructure , by 21st century standards it sucks .
Even the Morouns acknowledge this .
They liken their piecemeal repairs to " trying to get a mechanic to fix your car while you are going 70 miles an hour on the 401 . "
Which is why they have quietly amassed land on both sides of the river and already begun work on a second span – without many of the required permissions .
Weird concrete ramps to nowhere , described by one Detroit shipper as " Dukes of Hazzard launch pads , " appear to be part of a larger strategy involving a substantial investment in lobbyists and litigation .
The company says it is ready to do whatever it takes to twin its aging bridge with a new six - lane " cable - stayed " crossing .
With the ramps already built , the Morouns say they can finish the job with less than $ 400 million of their own cash .
And remain the gatekeepers .
Forever .
Canada has another solution .
For 10 years , Ottawa has worked with Washington and with the Ontario and Michigan governments on the DRIC ( Detroit River International Crossing ) , a far more expensive bridge that would rise 3 kilometres downriver from the Ambassador .
Unlike the Morouns , the governments have gone about the job crossing every " t " and dotting every " i " .
Most of the money is already committed for next - century customs plazas and new highway links to the 401 and U.S. interstates .
The lone remaining wild card is the Michigan legislature , which has yet to sign off on its $ 200 million stake .
What Canada and the U.S. backers fear is that the Morouns will employ wolverine business acumen to buy every vote needed in the legislature to stop the public project .
The Moroun firm , already well known for its litigious ways , may simply jam courtrooms with so much paper that nothing can happen until a new and friendlier crop of Michigan politicians takes power to kill the DRIC altogether .
A well - placed Canadian diplomatic source told the Star the recession is the complicating political factor .
Hard times ( and nowhere are things harder than in burnt - out Detroit ) have some people in Michigan looking doubtfully across the border at " Ugly Canadians " – aggressive socialists looking to engineer a government takeover of a successful private operation .
" In Detroit , Moroun supporters have had some success in portraying the Canadians as bullies , " the source told the Star .
" The irony is that the Canadian government is forbidden from hiring lobbyists , so we can't fight back the way the Morouns can .
" It 's like being in the Stanley Cup finals , except Canada 's playing without skates or sticks . "
However , if you ask in Detroit about the Morouns , the family appears to have no shortage of American enemies as well .
Many point to the Gateway Project quagmire – a $ 300 - million collaboration between the Morouns and various U.S. governments to streamline truck flow on the U.S. side of the Ambassador Bridge – as evidence of a company that promises one thing and does another , almost always to its own advantage .
A U.S. court delivered a major blow last week to the Morouns , ordering the family to tear down chunks of the profitable duty - free and filling stations it built improperly under the terms of the Gateway project .
But it is just one in a flurry of court cases still underway .
" I feel like I 'm living in an episode of the Sopranos .
But this latest ruling against the Morouns shows that bullies do n't always win , " said Rashida Tlaib , an elected Michigan state representative who has challenged the Morouns on every front .
" We are dying for jobs right now but the Morouns are crushing everything that hinders their monopoly .
And when they realized they can't buy me , suddenly I was faced with three recall petitions trying to kick me out of office , " said Tlaib .
" I know the Morouns are desperate to change their public perception .
I once met Matty and told him , ` You have a whole generation of people in southwest Detroit who see you as the Big Bad Bridge Company , and that 's what your son will inherit . '
He got so angry .
" But the problem can't be managed away with lobbyists and lawyers .
The answer is to actually be a good corporate citizen : get the permits , abide by the terms , be transparent . "
The Morouns have answers to all this – but they hardly help their cause by what seems an almost obsessive desire to stay completely beneath the public radar .
Billionaire American dynasties tend to want their names in lights with great public endowments – think the Carnegies , the Rockefellers , the Guggenheims .
While the Morouns contribute generously to charitable causes , the efforts are invisible .
Amazingly , even the family 's corporate headquarters bears no sign to announce what it is .
We ask why , and Matt Moroun struggles to answer .
They are simply a down - to - earth family , he says , who do n't put vanity foremost .

" It is disappointing and painful to see the characterizations of my family in the media , " Moroun says .
" But my father is a low - key guy .
He would rather not have his name on things .
I do n't want to bang a cheap drum , but grade us on our performance at the bridge .
That 's what counts . "
The Morouns will refer you to the aftermath of 9/11 , when cross - border trade all but collapsed , threatening tens of thousands of jobs in both countries .
Within hours , the family established a " war room " to keep people working .
Dan Stamper , the Morouns ' right - hand man , said he felt the weight of the Canadian economy on his shoulders that day .
And for the next six months .
" Within an hour of the attacks , there were trucks backed up for miles .
We called GM , Ford and Chrysler and said , ` Your factories are about to close .
Tell us which trucks you need to keep things going , ' " said Stamper .
Once the key trucks were identified , the company quickly escorted them across the border , he said .
" We acted so quickly , so proactively .
With no hesitation we started adding extra inspection booths on our own land , just to short - circuit the seven - year time frame the U.S. government takes to go from idea to ribbon - cutting . "
Stamper said they went from six commercial inspection booths to 10 in two months and are at 13 now .
" That is the kind of effort that should be on our scorecard .
Was this not in Canada 's best interests ? "
Ironically , 9/11 has come back to haunt the Morouns .
One of Ottawa 's arguments against twinning the Ambassador is that locating the two spans side by side could invite a terror attack on key infrastructure clustered close together .
Canada also objects to the location .
What made sense 80 years ago does n't any more , Ottawa argues , because the Ambassador Bridge lands in the heart of Windsor , 9 kilometres from Highway 401 .
The the DRIC bridge would link directly to the 401 , bypassing the traffic lights that infuriate truckers and Windsor residents alike .
Ottawa likes to remind you that when you drive from Toronto to Texas or Florida – the so - called " NAFTA superhighway " – the only traffic lights are found on that stretch through Windsor .
The Morouns ' we - do - it - well argument has some traction , even among those who favour building the DRIC .
Sarah Hubbard , spokesman for the regional business council , which takes in Detroit , said the family 's performance in bridge management should make it a prime candidate to operate the proposed DRIC .
" Love 'em or hate 'em , the Morouns have a history of getting things across .
...
Do n't forget the DRIC is presented as a public - private partnership .
It will be owned by the governments but with a private operator .
So why not have the Morouns involved in that ? "
For now , at least , the Morouns dislike the taste of that option .
Why ?
They say Ottawa and other backers of the DRIC bridge are wildly overestimating traffic projections .
Despite an uptick in traffic in recent months , the Ambassador is likely to see only 7 million crossings this year – a far cry from 12 million in 1999 , prior to 9/11 and the collapse of the Detroit automakers .
Another bridge , the Morouns argue , wo n't simply be one too many : it will saddle both governments with long - term costs , not just for construction but for the staffing of massive customs operations .
Customs brokerage sources the Star spoke with challenged this argument .
While auto sector truck flow remains flat , a range of other industries from information technology to green energy systems are showing new signs of life , with increased truck activity both ways .
" Trade is coming back , " one customs broker told the Star .
" Granted , it has a long way to go .
But you need great crossings to grow it .
The real tragedy is if nothing gets done .
Build one , build both – but the main thing is to build ... .
" Think back to the foresight of those people that built the Ambassador Bridge 80 years ago .
And now look at the mess today . "
Steve Tobocman , a former Michigan legislator well versed in the Great Bridge Debate , agrees .
" Where is the foresight today ?
Eighty years ago , during the Great Depression , there were people saying the Ambassador Bridge was a huge waste of money , " he said .
" Yet it went on to become an economic driver for the wealthiest manufacturing region in the world . "
Tobocman , who often locked horns with the Morouns during his two terms in office , is not ready to predict a winner .
The DRIC project may look strong at the moment .
But that could prove fleeting .
" It is like watching a game of seven - card stud .
The cards are being turned , the odds seem to be going up for Canada and down for the Ambassador Bridge .
...
But anyone who gives you a firm answer is misinformed or pushing an agenda .
" I would never count out the Morouns .
Never . "

The United Nations will host a Haiti donors ’ conference at the end of March .
This conference will be quite different from last year ’s event , of course , coming as it does on the heels of the worst earthquake to strike Haiti in two centuries .
An agenda has already begun to take shape :
It ’s already clear that a future Haiti must be populated with environmentally sustainable , earthquake - resistant buildings , for example , and it ’s also clear that the international community must do something to ease Haiti ’s massive debt burden .
Former President Bill Clinton , currently serving as the UN ’s envoy to Haiti , and economist Paul Collier have another idea that could prove disastrous .
They think Haiti needs to leverage its “ cheap labor . ”
In other words , they think Haiti will solve its problems by opening up more sweatshops .
Of course Clinton and Collier do n’t call them sweatshops .
They talk about “ garment factories ” or “ manufacturing centers ” or simply “ workshops , ” but they are sweatshops and nothing more .
For Haiti to join the ranks of developed nations , they argue , Haitians must first work as many hours as possible for paltry wages so that their economy can grow .
Congress seems to agree .
It has passed several bills that provide Haitian garment - makers preferential access to American consumers .
According to conventional knowledge , Haiti was on the road to economic success — as a result of these legislative reforms — before the earthquake .
Now , the logic goes , Haitians must rebuild their collapsed “ workshops ” and produce as many cheap T - shirts as possible .
All this ignores the most important point : sweatshop labor ’s inherent inhumanity .
Sweatshop labor proponents have never worked in the conditions they so enthusiastically endorse for others .
When advocating such solutions , they often offer compelling numbers as proof of their effectiveness .
But what about the human costs : the extra hours workers spend away from their families , the risk of injury that accompanies repetitive movements , and the loss of morale as some boss demands that you produce even more ?
In Haiti , there are a few plausible alternatives to sweatshop labor .
In the lead - up to last year ’s donors ’ conference , progressive Haitian civil society organizations suggested a development program that focuses on local production and agriculture .
They argued , convincingly , that the benefits from sweatshop labor often end up somewhere else , since the clothes are constructed on - site ; the material for the clothes are shipped in , and the clothes are shipped out upon completion .
A focus on locally produced goods , however , would have the opposite effect .
Haitian entrepreneurs would produce according to Haitian needs , and every part of the manufacturing process–from the development of materials to the production of goods –would take place in Haiti and benefit Haitians .
In addition , building up the capacity of Haitian farmers is crucial in the coming months and years .
Haiti has been dependent on food aid for many years now , and a national program that focused on sustainable agriculture would not only have the effect of providing a livelihood and locally produced food for countless Haitians , it would also allow Haiti to address the environmental degradation that has crippled its economy for generations .
The link between these two suggestions is infrastructure development .
Better roads and better transportation generally mean a much more stable and efficient economy .
All three of these proposals would require funding from the international community and expertise from abroad as well .
All three proposals , if enacted , would benefit Haitians enormously .
The upcoming donors ’ conference is an incredibly important forum .
We have an opportunity to help Haitians rebuild in a manner that simultaneously respects their humanity and enables them to become more productive .
We have an opportunity to heed the voices of concerned and knowledgeable Haitians .
Now is n’t the time to subsidize foreign investors ’ sweatshops .
Absolutely disgusting what this couple went through .

' Prosecutors have dropped sexual abuse charges against a St. George couple after determining pictures of the father kissing his naked infant son were scenes of affection , not abuse .
But the undocumented immigrant couple may yet be deported and their U.S. - born son is still in state custody .
...
The sequence of several photos shows a smiling father posing with the boy , according to a motion to dismiss filed Friday in 5th District Court .
They show him affectionately holding the baby , kissing his head , forehead and ear .
Two of the photos show the father kissing the son's buttocks and genitals .
" These images are consistent with traditional family photos of a proud father with his son , " Deputy Washington County Attorney Ryan Shaum wrote .
...
" Latino people are affectionate .
We kiss the little babies anywhere because they love them , " Coon said .
" It has nothing to do with sexual interaction . "
She was hopeful Saturday that the couple could be released on bail , and possibly allowed to stay in the country . '
A Houston woman who was wrongly arrested in 2008 at the Walmart in Meyer Park has won a $ 9 million jury verdict .
Nitra Gipson , 24 , filed a civil lawsuit against the retailer after store employees accused her of trying to exchange counterfeit Walmart money orders for cash .
She was arrested and spent two days in jail .
The Harris County District Attorney 's Office declined to pursue charges after it was determined that the money orders were genuine .
That meant Gipson had been falsely accused and falsely arrested .
Company lawyers based in Utah later sent her a letter alleging that she owed Walmart money for taking merchandise .
The letter threatened to pursue a shoplifting charge if she did n't pay $ 200 .
“ The jury found that she had been defamed by being accused of forgery , counterfeiting , theft and shoplifting , ” said Houston lawyer Lloyd Kelley , who represented Gipson .
A Harris County court jury on Friday determined that Wal - Mart Stores Texas should pay $ 8.2 million in actual damages and $ 820,000 in punitive damages .
John Ramirez , a Houston lawyer who represents the retailer , directed questions to Walmart media relations .

A company spokesperson did not respond immediately to a request for comment .
Kelley said Walmart lawyers indicated that they would appeal .
That means resolving the case may take another few years , he said .
“ The main problem for Walmart has been the bad publicity , ” Kelley said , adding that the retailer has n't offered an apology , has n't asked that charges against Gipson be expunged and has not revealed any company policy changes resulting from the incident .
Since then , Gipson has graduated from Texas Southern University and wants to become a lawyer , Kelley said .
She sold her car to help raise tuition two years ago , which is why she had $ 4,100 in money orders .
“ She was as innocent as can be , ” her attorney said .

Blood pressure is the force exerted by blood pushing against the walls of one 's arteries .
If the pressure rises significantly and remains there for an extended period of time , it can cause damage to the body .
Lucky for us , one of the most common vegetables we use today - celery - with its stringy stems and crisp texture provides a natural way to lower blood pressure .
It decreases a potentially dangerous situation without the risk of possible side effects that might accompany prescribed medication .
A blood pressure reading is measured by two numbers .
The top number referred to as systolic is the measure of pressure the blood exerts while the heart is beating .
The lower number , diastolic , is the measure of pressure the blood exerts while the heart is relaxed .
The suggested optimal blood pressure is 120/80 .
Just how could celery juice affect this measurement ?
This versatile veggie contains active compounds named phthalides .
These compounds provide health benefits by naturally relaxing the muscles in and around the walls of the arteries which cause those vessels to dilate , creating more space inside the arteries that permits the blood to flow at a lower pressure .
Phthalides also have been reported to lower blood pressure and promote a healthy circulatory system by reducing what are known as stress hormones .
This biennial vegetable also contains high amounts of magnesium , potassium , and calcium .
The beneficial effect of these minerals in celery serves to calm the nervous system , automatically counterbalancing stress levels .
Although Hippocrates ( a Greek physician considered the Father of Medicine , c. 460 BC - c. 377 BC ) prescribed the juice of this leafy - topped stalk to patients suffering from nervous tension and although Chinese medicine has long recognized celery juice to reduce high blood pressure , only recently has it been studied in the Western world .
The University of Chicago Medical Center ( UCMC ) is credited with one of the first studies of celery 's effects on blood pressure .
In one instance , the father of a scientist at UCMC experienced a drop in his blood pressure from 158/96 to 118/82 after just one week of eating about four stalks a day .
To test this theory , a physician at the Whitaker Wellness Center and her father both drank celery juice for thirty days , mixing it with a little orange juice to camouflage the slightly bitter taste of juiced celery .
Their results ?
The father 's systolic level dropped from 148 to 128 , and the physician 's went from 120 to 105 .
Including this most nutritious juice as a part of a healthy diet and lifestyle just may help keep the risks of high blood pressure from ever becoming an issue .

The common painkiller acetaminophen may increase the risk of asthma and other allergies in both children and adults , according to a study conducted by researchers from the University of British Columbia - Vancouver and published in the journal Acetaminophen , also known as paracetamol , is the active ingredient in the painkillers Tylenol , Anacin , Panadol , and others .
Because it does not increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding the way aspirin , ibuprofen or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) do , it has become the favored analgesic and fever - reducer used in young children .
Researchers reviewed 19 prior studies on a total of 425,000 children and adults .
They found that children who had been treated with the drug in the past year were 60 percent more likely to suffer from asthma than children who had not , while adults who had used the drug in the past year were 75 percent more likely to suffer from the condition .
People who had taken higher doses of the drug had a higher risk of asthma than people who had taken lower doses .
The data also showed a connection between acetaminophen use and wheezing , eczema , runny nose and itchy eyes .
The study was not designed to prove cause and effect , however .
Researchers have been looking for causes of the significant increase in asthma rates over the past 20 years .
Suggested culprits have included air pollutants and overly sterile living environments , but the current study points to another potential contributor .
According to co-author Mark FitzGerald , it was roughly 20 years ago that doctors began to recommend acetaminophen rather than aspirin for the treatment of fevers and pain in children .
" There was a change in practice and in the succeeding 20 years or so the prevalence of asthma has increased also , " he said .
Although ibuprofen does not appear to increase the risk of asthma , it may cause liver and brain damage in some children .
" For adults , ibuprofen is probably the safer of the two in terms of asthma risk , " co-author Mahyar Etminan said .
" For kids , pediatric guidelines still point to acetaminophen use -- at least until we have a more definitive study .

Many of those who had ventured from their homes were wearing face masks , and some left footprints in the yellow film that had settled on the city 's streets .
In the mid 1990s , a craze swept Japan and crested its way onto American shores : Kids were going crazy for the Tamagotchi , an egg - shaped digital pet .
Every few hours , users would press a couple buttons to feed their Tamagotchi , play with it , or clean it up .
The game was simple , but intensely rewarding .
Users cried when their Tamagotchis got sick or died ; they were elated when they were able to raise a healthy , happy pet .
More than 70 million have been sold .
Thomas Goetz is the executive editor of Wired magazine and author of the new book * The Decision Tree : Taking Control of Your Health in the New Era of Personalized Medicine .
As part of the reporting for the book , he had his genome scanned , was screened for more than a dozen diseases , and has tracked his sleep , blood pressure , weight , calories and oodles of other metrics .
He holds a masters of public health from UC Berkeley .
* The genius of the device was that it was both simple and rewarding :
It took just a few clicks a few times a day to keep your TamagotchisTamagotchi in good health .
In other words , it rewarded vigilance over neglect , maintenance over obsessiveness ( you could overfeed your Tamagotchi or smother it with too much love ) .
A decade later , there ’s a new kind of Tamagotchi out there .
And it 's us .
New health - monitoring tools let us pay close attention to our state of being , how much exercise we 're getting , how much sleep we 're getting – and they make it easy to set a goal and improve ourselves .
In other words , they turn our health into something of a game .
And the reward is better health and a better life .
These devices are popping up everywhere :
The FitBit is a paper - clip sized device that you can clip onto your belt to monitor cadence , calories and sleep .
A genius little display shows a flower that grows the more you move , offering a brilliant bit of feedback .
The Zeo sleep system uses a rigorous biometric brain analysis to measure overall sleep quality ; you can also drill down into the numbers to ascertain how much time you 're spending in light sleep versus deep sleep ( the deeper the better ) .
The BodyMedia
Fit uses a combination of sensor technology to track cadence and calories , as well as respiration and heartrate .
And the Philips DirectLife gizmo turns your data into a personal coaching kit that helps you adjust targets and meet goals .
In the best of these devices , the hardware is simple and unobtrusive , and the software is clean , engaging and easy to navigate through .
The key here is the feedback loop – making it possible for users to collect their own data , making it easy to understand , and then building that data into better decision making .
Feedback has been recognized as an effective tool for behavior change since the 1960s .
But the challenge is that collecting and organizing data has typically taken a lot of effort , making it something that works for only the most diligent of us .
But the key to these new tools is they make the gathering of personal data – what 's called " data exhaust " – an automatic process that requires very little effort on our part .
With cheaper sensors and better UI , personal data is becoming ubiquitous and malleable , turning this once academic notion of feedback into a business plan .
What 's more , sharing this data in social networks increases the utility of the data ; it makes it easier for us to turn data into insight into action .
This is the premise behind the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation 's Project HealthDesign , which has hit on the idea of " observations of daily life " – or ODLs – as a powerful catalyst for managing our health .
And not just preventive health – Project HealthDesign is funding several projects that let people track ODLs to manage diseases from Crohn 's to depression to underweight babies .
Another important element is play , the fact that tracking can be rewarding in and of itself , even fun .
Clive Thompson has written about how Weight Watchers – which asks its members to turn their diets into a Points system for easier tracking – is in effect a big game .
And HopeLab , an innovative medical research group , has used the principle to create Re-Mission , a videogame for teens with cancer where the kids play by engaging with their disease .
A 2008 study in Pediatrics showed that Re-Mission significantly improved outcomes in kids who played the game .
There are , of course , pioneers in this sort of thing – first and foremost diabetics , who 've been compelled to rigorously self - monitor their blood glucose and insulin levels for decades .
In the past , though , self - monitoring has been seen as a burden for people with diabetes – the tools have been bulky , the interfaces stodgy and medicalized , and the result is lack of engagement .
With millions more people being diagnosed with diabetes each year though , there 's a great incentive to create better , smarter and easier tools for self - monitoring – as well as find ways to make diabetics more at ease with the idea of constant self - monitoring .
Bayer Healthcare recently worked with Nintendo to develop the Didget meter , a game for children with diabetes that rewards them with points for keeping their blood glucose levels within a personalized target range .
The game is designed for kids as young as 5 years old .
The key here seems to be the notion of control ( or to use the academic term , self - efficacy ) – self - monitoring can give us a way to participate in our health .
And turning it into something fun , something that we can play with and improve upon – that can give us not only a role but an authority .
We can take control of our health .
And we can play to win .

By Suzanne Weiss
This speech was given by Suzanne Weiss on March 2 , 2010 , to a meeting of students at the University of Waterloo in Canada , held as part of the Israeli Apartheid Week .
Suzanne Weiss , a holocaust survivor , is a member of Not in Our Name : Jewish Voices Against Zionism and of the Coalition Against Israeli Apartheid in Toronto .

A year after a murderous Israel ’s assault , the war on the people of Gaza continues .
Gaza is still under siege – still surrounded by walls and checkpoints .
Its people are denied the necessities of life and the right to rebuild and shape their future .
For me , as a survivor of the holocaust , the tragic situation in Gaza awakens memories of what I and my family experienced under Hitlerism – the ghetto walls , the killings , the systematic starvation and deprivation , the daily humiliations .
The tragedy of Palestine is , of course , different from the holocaust .
Israel has no gas chambers .
Its government does not strive to kill all the Palestinians .
Israel 's intention is , instead , to take the Palestinians ' homeland and property and to deprive them of civil and human rights .
Every case of oppression is unique , but the struggle for justice is indivisible .
As we then fought for freedom for European Jews , we now call for freedom for the Palestinians .
The holocaust is linked to Palestine in another way .
Many Jewish survivors of Hitler ’s slaughter lost their families , homes and communities and sought a new life .
There was a campaign to convince them that they needed a homeland – in Palestine .
They were told lies that Palestine was an empty land , with few inhabitants .
The Israeli government terrorised , brutalised and expelled Palestinians from their homelands .
Palestine became a colonised settler state .
Thus , the Palestinians were made to pay for Hitler ’s crimes .
Like the Nazis , the Israel government enforces collective punishment .
It aims to kill enough Palestinians , to punish them sufficiently , drive them out of their homeland , so they will disappear as a people .
Israel seeks to remove Palestine from the world 's family of nations .
That too is a form of genocide .
Israel was founded as a militarised state , and a partner of British and US imperialism , of the apartheid regime in South Africa and of murderous dictatorships in Latin America .
The crimes against the Palestinians inspire guilt in the Jewish settlers and breed fear that the Palestinians might carry out a supposed new “ holocaust ” against them .
Once again , holocaust memories are being mobilised to justify maintaining Israel as an exclusively Jewish state .
As a child in France , I survived the holocaust because a strong resistance was organised .
Thousands of people – Christians , Jews and Moslems – joined the fight for freedom against the French fascist Vichy government .
They struck powerful blows against racism , whose impact endures in France today .
They organised a network to save Jewish people .
That 's why I am here today .
For me , as for many Jews today , the memory of the holocaust inspires us not to support war and oppression but to work for solidarity and freedom – in this case , freedom for the Palestinians .
The Israel government claims its wars are waged on our behalf .
That 's a lie .
We say , “ Not in our name ” .
And in increasing numbers , Jewish people join with our Palestinian brothers and sisters to demand justice for Palestine .
Israel – an apartheid state
We raise a simple demand , in the interests of all the peoples of the region : end Israeli apartheid .
The United Nations has defined the crime of apartheid as " inhuman acts committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them " .
The word apartheid , which means “ separation ” , was coined by the racist regime of South Africa , which denied civil and human rights to non-Europeans .
We know apartheid in our colonised country of Canada : the process through which Indigenous peoples were robbed of their lands and deprived of their livelihood , while every attempt was made to destroy their culture .
The architects of South African apartheid studied Canada and took it as a model .
The founders of Israel studied it too .
Today we see an apartheid state in the land of Palestine / Israel .
It is symbolised by the so - called “ separation wall ” that confines Palestinians to segregated ghettos , by the checkpoints , the arbitrary killing and arrests , the systematic material deprivation .
How to fight Israel ’s apartheid
Nelson Mandela , who led the campaign of boycotts , divestment and sanctions against South African apartheid , has said that justice for the Palestinians is " the greatest moral issue of the age " .
He also has stated , " We know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians . "
On July 9 , 2005 , a unified call of Palestinian civil society organisations proposed a campaign for boycotts , divestment and sanctions as a central focus for efforts to end Israeli apartheid .
Boycotts , divestment and sanctions was crucial in the victory over apartheid in South Africa .
Now is the time to apply this method to the catastrophic situation in Palestine .
The Palestinian resistance and freedom struggle has three demands to gain justice : ( 1 ) their right to return to their land ; ( 2 ) their right to equality as citizens in Israel ; ( 3 ) an end to Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory .
Only an end to Israeli apartheid will permit Jews and Palestinians to forge new relations and to resolve the issue of state structures on the basis of equality .
Government threats against free speech
At this very moment , the province of Ontario and the Canadian federal government are working to muzzle and criminalise the movement against Israeli apartheid and the call for boycotts , divestment and sanctions .
The government of Canada is the world ’s staunchest supporter of Israel ’s wars and oppression .
It raised no whisper of concern about the massacre of Gaza .
Instead , it attacks those who protested the slaughter .
In March 2009 , Jason Kenney , Canada ’s minister of citizenship , immigration , and multiculturalism , banned British MP George Galloway from entering Canada because he had led convoy of humanitarian relief to Gaza .
Kenney has cut funding to several religious and ethnic agencies for similar reasons .
Prime Minister Steven Harper and Kenney say we must act against “ a new kind of anti-Semitism ” , namely , criticism of the Israel government .
A year ago , Kenney said that Israeli Apartheid Week did not fall under the protection of Canadians ' right to free expression of political opinion .
He condemned Israeli Apartheid Week as consisting of " efforts to single out and attack the Jewish people and their homeland ” .
It is not we who single out Israel .
The Palestinian solidarity movement merely subjects Israel to the same standards as any other country .
It is Israel that singles itself out , by carrying out crimes , like the siege of Gaza , with no parallel elsewhere in the world .
It is the Canadian government that singles out Israel by declaring it exempt from challenge .
Educational programs such as Israeli Apartheid
Week give voice to Palestine ’s suffering and are free of even the slightest hint of hostility to Jews .
Yet Kenney implies we are in violation of Canada ’s laws against “ hate propaganda ” .
Kenny and Liberal Party member of parliament Irwin Cotler have organised the Canadian Parliamentary Coalition to Combat Anti-Semitism , a privately funded association of 13 members of parliament .
It is currently holding an inquiry into anti-Semitism , which it says is “ at its worst level since the end of the Second World War " .
This is because of what it views as “ accusations of blood libel … against the State of Israel ” .
“ Blood libel ” is a charge that a group engages in ritual human sacrifice , especially of children .
The parliamentary coalition seems to be using this term here to stigmatise criticism of Israel ’s killing of hundreds of innocent Palestinian children .
Another focus of the coalition is Canadian universities where pro-Palestinian educational activity has been intense .
Some university administrators have tried to block this by placing limits on free discussion .
Is criticism of a government out of bounds ?
Criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic , Cotler explains , because Israel embodies the " collective Jew " .
When we call Israel an apartheid state , we are he says , " attacking all Jewish people and their homeland " .
How absurd !
If we criticise the Harper government , is this an attack on the “ collective Canadian ” ?
By this rule , all criticism of governments anywhere could be made illegal .
The Canadian government implies that Jewish people ’s first loyalty is not to Canada but to Israel .
This is defamatory .
This diminishes their Canadian citizenship .
The government echoes a core idea of traditional anti-Semitism , with its false concept of a world Jewish conspiracy .
The Canadian government says that its campaign for the rulers of Israel speaks for the Jewish people of Canada .
In increasing numbers , Jewish people respond , “ Not in our name ! ” .
Jews are strongly represented in the campaign for boycotts , divestment and sanctions .
In demanding freedom for Palestine , we speak for the proud tradition of Jewish universalism , which draws on the strengths of Jewish culture in a quest for justice for all humanity .
The goal of the so - called Canadian Parliamentary Coalition to Combat Anti-Semitism is to have the Canadian government legally define criticisms of the State of Israel as anti-Semitism , and therefore an incitement to hatred .
This could apply to calls for boycotts , divestment and sanctions against Israel ’s mistreatment of Palestinians , as well as to using the term " apartheid " with regard to Israel .
These threats to freedom of expression aim to create a chill on university campuses and civil life .
Professors will be afraid to discuss Israel ’s policies in their classrooms , while Israeli Apartheid Week organisers will find it hard to reserve rooms or put up posters .
Today , there is a united world campaign to secure a Palestinian victory .
It is expressed in the boycott , divestment and sanctions campaign .
If the crimes against the Palestinians prevail , it would mean that Hitler 's spirit had triumphed .
To be true to the memory of the victims of the Jewish Holocaust and of all Hitler 's victims , we must defend the Palestinians .
The united campaign for peace and justice for Palestine aims to secure for all inhabitants of Israel and Palestine , Jews and Palestinians alike , an equal voice and equal rights .
The day will come when the Gaza ghetto wall will fall and we will see liberation of the Palestinians .
It will be a new day for freedom for all of us around the world .
Let us work together for that day of liberation .

When you speak to her , your speech is converted to text , which her internal computers analyze using her unique pattern - recognition software .
She then comes up with an appropriate response from her database of hundreds of prerecorded responses , and her answer is played through a loudspeaker hidden under her wig .
You can actually carry on full conversations with Roxxxy in what her creator believes is a near - perfect simulation of emotional companionship .
This is by far the most interesting development in the field of machines you can put your wiener in .
I 'd always imagined that the popularity of Real Dolls and other competing titles in the doll - pork market was due to lonely guys who enjoyed the act of having sex with a woman but either did n't have time for or could n't navigate around the tricky aspects like " emotional connection " and " human interaction . "
As someone whose study of sex dolls was purely academic , I assumed that the inhumanness of these sex dolls was part of the hook :
There 's no shame for a poor performance , there 's no guilt for infidelity and there 's no struggle with commitment or communication , because she is a silicone - covered robot that you legally own .
But Roxxxy means we 've entered a new world that I do n't quite understand ; one where the goal is to make these things as close to human as possible .
If Roxxxy outsells Real Dolls , it means consumers prefer lifelike dolls , which means a doll even more lifelike than Roxxxy will be even more successful , until we get sex robots that seem to have total autonomy .
Sex robots that form ideas and have opinions and , if my primitive understanding of women is to be believed , judge you relentlessly .
Roxxxy 's AI even comes with different personalities , where " Wild " is on one end of the spectrum and " Frigid " is on the other .
Frigid , as in , cold , as in a sex robot that does n't want you to have sex with it .
This means the market is n't made up of just horny guys .
It 's guys who want to have sex with a robot but also understand that their clumsy pawing and arrhythmic hump techniques repulse their robot into celibacy .
That is a market I hope to never meet under any circumstances whatsoever .
Also , attention guys who are spending a bunch of money on a sex robot that you still have to entertain and convince to have sex with you : that 's just real life .
You have n't found a loophole , and you 're not making anything easier on yourself .
That is exactly what the rest of us do .
But Can I Have Sex With It ?
This story is part of a special series that explores energy issues .
For more , visit The Great Energy Challenge .
It 's the oil rush all over again , except this time it 's not black gold gushing to the surface , but gas : natural gas .
New technologies — or rather , a combination of older technologies — have made it possible to mine huge quantities of natural gas out of the deep , solid rock called shale .
Because these deposits are found all over the United States , which until recently had been bracing for shortages of this key fuel , the implications are staggering .
Natural gas fires the blue flame on stovetops , it heats half the homes in the United States , and is also the fuel that can generate electricity with 50 percent lower carbon dioxide emissions than coal .
However , whether the new natural gas abundance can really help the country to get on track to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions , as the Obama administration , the industry itself , and even some environmentalists are saying , is not so clear .
Nonetheless , insiders at CERAWeek , an annual energy conference in Houston last week , gushed at the potential .
“ Simply the most significant energy innovation so far this century , ” said Daniel Yergin , chairman of the consulting firm , IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates , best known as author of the Pulitzer - winning chronicle of the oil industry ’s history that was re-released last year , The Prize : The Epic Quest for Oil , Money & Power .
A widely watched industry group — the Potential Gas Committee of the Colorado School of Mines — calculated a 40 percent increase in U.S. gas reserves last year , the largest jump in its 44 - year tracking record .
The “ shale gale , ” said an IHS CERA report , could “ cause a paradigm shift in the fueling of North America ’s energy future , ” with 100 years of supply available at today ’s rate of demand .
And U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu , in a speech aimed at prodding energy executives to get on board with the notion that global warming policy was on its way , forecast a key role for the fossil fuel with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions — natural gas .
Jim Mulva , chief executive of ConocoPhillips , dubbed natural gas “ nature ’s gift to the people of the world ” and called those who have doubts “ hydrocarbon deniers . ”
Those deniers , however , turn out to be a diverse crowd .
Although hydraulic fracturing , using blasts of water and chemicals to break up the rock , has been around since the 1940s , some of the shale gas rush is happening in areas that have n’t seen new energy development for decades .
Water pollution incidents have worried local residents from Wyoming to Pennsylvania .
Study is even underway focusing on whether one portion of the shale gas process that is separate from the hydraulic fracturing -- the injection of waste salt water into underground wells -- caused minor earthquakes near Dallas - Fort Worth .
The supposed first - line beneficiaries of this new gas bounty — electric power companies — have their own concerns .
Duke Energy chief executive Jim Rogers , who runs one of the largest utilities in the country , has called natural gas the “ crack cocaine ” of his industry .
It ’s a quick fix to expand electricity output , because the plants are relatively inexpensive , quick to build and raise few of the pollution concerns of coal .
But many of those who have come to rely on this appealing fuel regret the habit when they ’ve seen the dizzying price spikes -- during the California energy crisis , after Hurricane Katrina and in tandem with the Gulf War oil price run-up .
Rogers thinks natural gas will be only part of the climate solution , so in addition to adding two new natural gas facilities to its fleet , Duke is building new coal generation , including a plant that could test carbon capture technology , and it is proposing two new nuclear power stations .
In market impact so far , the shale gale feels more like a light breeze , with U.S. natural gas production up 4 percent and the fuel ’s share of electricity generation up 2 percent from 2008 to 2009 , to just over 23 percent .
Coal electricity generation is down , with its share of the nation ’s power at about 45 percent , but the weak economy and U.S. electricity demand appear to be a greater factor than a deliberate move to natural gas .
Joseph Romm , a former Energy Department official and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress , author of the widely read ClimateProgress blog , believes the power industry wo n’t make the switch without a policy push — a price on carbon that makes coal substantially more expensive .

Memphis ’ application for Google Fiber .
We need your help persuading Google to select Memphis for a project that could transform our city — the Google Networks fiber - to - the - home initiative .
Cities around the country are expending tremendous effort to be selected in Google ’s competition .
This is a highly competitive undertaking .
We need your help .
Google ’s plan .
Google will build super - fast fiber optic broadband networks in a few communities around the U.S. , promising up to a one gigabit per second service — three hundred times faster than typical home broadband over copper wire .
More important , Google plans to take its fiber all the way to every home and business of their partner community regardless of a neighborhood ’s commercial potential .
Imagine a promising inner-city 7th - grader collaborating with classmates around the world while watching a live university lecture .
Think of a Memphis physician treating patients in remote clinics all over the country .
Imagine home viewers downloading a high - definition , full - length feature film in less than five minutes .
Universal , ultra high - speed Internet access will make all this possible — much more .
How YOU can help .
I will make the Google application on behalf of the City of Memphis .
It ’s extremely important that you support the city ’s application by filing Google ’s web questionnaire for community members , stating you are supporting Memphis , Tennessee .
You must have a Google account to access the questionnaire .
If you do n’t have a Google account , click here to sign up .
If you have a Google account , click here to begin the short application .
Follow the “ Nominate Your Community ” button .
When you are finished , press “ submit . ”
As part of the competition , Google allows Memphis to link its application to more detailed , web - based information .
The City of Memphis will mount a special website to explain why Memphis should be selected and offer testimonials from our supporters ( like you ) .
Over the next two weeks , we will be gathering video testimonials , written letters of support , web content about points of interest , and links to the websites of our supporters .
Please start by making a 1 - 2 minute video of you or your friends talking about why you believe Memphis is the best city for Google Fiber .
Email the video file to mcan901@gmail.com and we will post it on our YouTube channel for Google to review .
Our basic message to Google is this : Memphis has made great strides building a framework for its community development ( think Bioworks , the City Schools Teacher Effectiveness Initiative , the Memphis Coalition for Advanced Networking , and Memphis Fast Forward ) .
We believe Google Networks will be nothing less than transformative for Memphians in all walks of life .
In your comments , you might tell Google something about your organization or your interest and then describe how Google ’s bandwidth ( or the applications it inspires ) will benefit your organization and Memphis in general .
Will you help us ?
The House Minority Leader , John Boehner , spoke passionately against President Obama 's healthcare reform bill in his concluding comments .
Mr Boehner criticised the way the bill had been put together , and the last - minute deal restricting the use of federal funds for abortion which ensured the support of some wavering Democrats .
Over the last few weeks and months Lawrence O'Donnell has admirably filled in for Keith Olbermann on Countdown , with Keith dealing with the illness and ultimately death of his father ( RIP ) .
Lawrence O'Donnell has not only kept all of us abreast of the news , but has excellently detailed the inner workings of the Health Care Debate and offered insight into the legislative process that is rarely seen nor discussed .
You see he has that advantage being a former Democratic Chief of Staff in the United States Senate .
His contacts and personal relationships have enabled Senators like Ron Wyden and Jay Rockefeller to routinely appear with him as guests on the many shows that Lawrence O'Donnell guest hosts .
They not only provided insight into backroom dealings but also the overall attitudes of the lawmakers during this health care debate .
So , I say why not Lawrence O'Donnell for host of his own political show ?
Let ’s take step by step some of the criticisms of Lawrence O'Donnell that I have seen lobbied his way as to the reasoning he should not be a permanent host .
He is not a brand name .
Wrong .
As I outlined above not only is he well known in political circles from the lawmakers , but he is routinely asked to be a guest analyst on the Sunday talk shows .
Besides , if you were to argue that ordinary people do n’t know him well enough that has now been shattered with his nightly guest hosting of Countdown .
He most certainly has name and face recognition now , to a much wider audience .
He does n’t know the issues .
Wrong again .
As outlined above being a former Democratic Chief of Staff in the United States Senate I tend to think results in you knowing the issues .
In fact I would make the argument you may not get better knowledge on any particular issue than you would from Lawrence O'Donnell .
He knows the issues inside and out like the back of his hand .
He is not polished enough to be a host .
Certainly wrong now .
I ’m not sure it was ever right , but for argument sake let ’s say it was .
Fine , he was n’t polished enough and did n’t have enough experience as a host .
Okay .
What say you know ?
Not only has he filled in for Ed Shultz , Rachel Maddow , the old 1600 Pennsylvania
Ave show , been a regular contributor on Morning Joe , but has now been the regular host of Countdown for the last few months .
So if your argument was that he did n’t have that experience as a show host , then I suggest you come up with a new argument .
He ’s too fiery and aggressive .
What ?
I mean seriously WTF ?
That ’s a bad thing ?
We need more fire and aggression on political issues .
We need more political hosts willing to hold sell outs and those fighting for corporate interests to the fire .
We need more hosts willing to tell the truth no matte the corporate costs .
Lawrence O'Donnell is willing to do this and his fire and aggression is most definitely NOT a bad thing .
So those are the 4 main arguments I have consistently either heard or seen written in the blogosphere as to why Lawrence O'Donnell may be a good guy ... but not TV show host material .
However , in fact as I have outlined those 4 main issues are now nonexistent issues , so if you do n’t like Lawrence O'Donnell you better come up with a new set of arguments .
If you are still not convinced , I present to you Lawrence O'Donnell 's greatest hits .
First , Lawrence utterly annihilates this clown Phill Musser who claims waterboarding was effective , because you can tell by looking at people that they are guilty .
Lawrence smacks down Liz Cheney 's ridiculous notion that not only waterboarding is an effective method or interrogation , but also that President Obama somehow made us less safe by having his justice department release the interrogation memos .
Lawrence challenges Marc Thiessen on his claim that Barack Obama is inviting a terrorist attack by making America less safe .
Of course a challenge on Morning Joe is not in the realm of acceptability to everyone 's favorite former congressman who quickly attempts to shut Lawrence off .
Not fast enough though Joe. Lawrence made his point .
Next , Lawrence takes on the right winged talking point that Barack Obama and the Democratic Congress are socialist and leading us all to some apocalyptic socialist dystopia .
Finally , Lawrence quiets Lawrence Eagleburger who attempted to say Barack Obama has no foreign policy experience .
Lawrence asked him to provide evidence of the foreign policy experience Governors Bush and Reagan had .
So , there you have it .
If you still believe that Lawrence O'Donnell should not and cannot host his own television show , I ask you please , please tell me why .
I see no reason why he should n't .
So MSNBC if you really are serious about putting together a nightly 10 PM show the time for excuses as to why you can't are gone .
You have your host .
You have your audience .
You have your chance .
Lawrence O'Donnell is your man .
Time to make the move .
British electronics e-tailer Clove has started listing a new £ 53 ( $ 86 ) HD2 accessory that should be of interest to everyone who owns or plans on owning the device .
We always thought that generous 4.3 - inch screen could do with some backside support , and indeed the new kickstand - equipped extended battery will provide just that .
You 'll also get a nice energy bump , as the new accessory is set to double the 1,230 mAh capacity of the default juice pack .
Deliveries are expected by Clove in February , meaning it should n't be too long before this official appendage makes its global debut -- let 's just hope other nations do n't have to suffer as much wallet damage as the UK .
Yelp Hit With Second Extortion Lawsuit , CEO Responds Second extortion lawsuit filed against Yelp , CEO says it is " meritless . "
March 5 , 2010  --
One week after a California animal hospital filed a lawsuit against Yelp alleging extortion , another California business filed a similar suit against the popular online review site .
A San Diego law firm Wednesday filed a class action with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of Christine LaPausky , owner of D'Ames Day Spa in San Diego .
The complaint alleges that the San Francisco review site promises to remove or bury negative reviews if businesses agree to a monthly advertising subscription .
" Yelp thus capitalizes on the presumed integrity of the Yelp.com ratings system to extort business owners to purchase advertising , " the complaint said .
The tech blog The Next Web posted a copy of the entire document on its Web site .
In a blog post Thursday , Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman hit back , calling the extortion claims " meritless . "
Yelp CEO : Lawsuits Borne From Lack of Understanding
" The allegations are false and easily refuted , " he wrote .
" They are borne from a lack of understanding of how Yelp works to provide consumers with useful information about local businesses and protect users from fake , or shill , reviews . "
He also said that he was n't surprised by the second " frivolous " suit .
Referring to a recent round of financing in which Yelp raised $ 25 million , Stoppelman wrote , " These misconceptions are also fueled by lawyers , who may have heard about Yelp 's recent financing round and may be seeking a share . "
" These copy cat suits get filed in what is known as a race to the courthouse , where lawyers jockey to be named the lead lawyer of the case and take the biggest share of legal fees ; being among the first to file a suit increases the chance of being put in charge of the case , " he wrote .
He emphasized that the company would fight both suits aggressively .
" I do want to ensure you that we do n't take any of these allegations or events lightly .
Especially the fact that misunderstandings about Yelp have arisen in the first place , " he wrote .
" We understand some businesses can find us confusing or a source of anxiety .
We are working hard to make our business even clearer . "
Last week , law firms in San Diego and Miami filed a similar class action complaint on behalf of Gregory Perrault , a veterinarian who owns and operates Cats & Dogs Animal Hospital in Long Beach , Calif .
California Animal Hospital Files Extortion Complaint Against Yelp
" I do n't have a problem with negative reviews .
Like probably most business people , you use negative reviews to your advantage , as long as they 're not emotional or making fun of [ people ] , " Perrault told ABCNews.com .
" It 's just that I tried following their rules about the reviews and I 've been [ faced with ] this extortion ever since . "
Perrault said that after contacting the company about a suspicious negative review , a sales person told him that if he paid $ 300 per month , he would have more control over his page on Yelp .
He said he decided to take legal action , because he wants
Yelp to be more transparent about how it ranks and chooses to host the reviews on its site .
Vince Sollitto , vice president of corporate communications for Yelp , last week told ABCNews.com that the allegations " are demonstrably false .
Yelp : Advertisers Pay for Advertising , Not Control Over Reviews
" Yelp treats review content equally for advertisers and non advertisers alike .
And advertisers pay for advertising , not control over reviews on their page , " he said .
" This credibility of review content is critical to Yelp 's value and is precisely why 29 million people used the site last month to find a great local business . "
Though he said that the recency of a review , the credibility of a reviewer and the Yelp community 's response to a review can affect its ranking on a business 's page , he said he could n't elaborate on the algorithm the company uses to rank reviews .
" We see daily attempts to write fake reviews promoting one business or negative reviews attacking a competitor , " he said .
" In order to protect consumers and businesses alike from being victimized by fake or malicious reviews , we employ an automated algorithm that we can't disclose entirely or else people will game the system . "
Though some businesses may wonder why reviews disappear or move around a page , he said the algorithm that drives the rankings is set up to be dynamic and devoid of human bias .
Even before these recent lawsuits , Yelp has faced extortion accusations .
A story published last year by East Bay Express in Oakland , Calif. , featured a number of area business owners who said Yelp offered to bury negative reviews if they signed up for a monthly ad subscription .
At the time , the company 's COO Geoff Donaker said it was n't within advertisers ' and sales representatives ' ability to manipulate rankings .
But in an interview with the local paper , he said Yelp could better train the sales team to be " crystal clear about what you get and do n't get . "
From Chattanoogan.com 's YouTube feed : " A Chattanooga Police officer , while running radar at 1410 Workman Road on Sunday night , had his patrol car attacked by a ferocious bulldog .
Officer Clayton Holmes said he had stopped to work on a report when he felt his car shaking .
He got out to investigate and what he found was a bulldog chewing on his patrol car .
The dog chewed two tires and the entire front bumper off of the car . "

Google has rolled out a YouTube speed - tester that tells you how your ISP stacks up against other ISPs in your town and country , to " give you the ability to compare your speed numbers with other users in your region . "
Translation : Google is giving you the ammo you need to fight back if your ISP sucks , or if it is twiddling the knobs to discriminate against Google .
It 's a brilliant piece of pro-Net Neutrality judo , and I can only hope that they follow it up by figuring out tools that let users speed test all kinds of services and protocols so that we can get a picture of how ISPs are messing with us .

Browser detection has been a hot - button topic in web development for a long time .
This battle pre-dates JavaScript browser detection by a couple of years and begins with the introduction of Netscape Navigator , the first truly popular and widely - used web browser .
Netscape Navigator 2.0 was so far beyond any of the other available web browsers that web sites began looking for its specific user - agent string before returning any useful content .
This forced other browser vendors , notably Microsoft , to include things in their user - agent string to get around this form of browser detection .
A very hairy situation , indeed .
Feature detection
Since that time , web developers repeatedly rant that browser detection , specifically user - agent sniffing , is a horrible practice that should never be considered .
The argument is that the code is n’t “ future proof ” and will have to be changed when newer browsers appear .
The preferred approach , the chorus echoes , is feature detection .
So instead of doing something like this :
if ( navigator.userAgent.indexOf ( " MSIE 7 " ) > - 1 ) { // do something }
You should do something like this :
if(document.all ) { // do something }
There is a distinction between these two approaches .
The first is testing for a specific browser by name and version while the second is testing for a specific feature / capability .
So user - agent sniffing results in knowing the exact browser and version being used ( or at least , the one being reported by the browser ) while feature detection determines if a given object or method is available .
Note that these are two completely different results .
Because feature detection does n’t rely on knowledge of which browser is being used , only on which features are available , it is trivial to ensure support in new browsers .
For instance , when the DOM was young , not all browsers supported getElementById ( ) , and so there was a lot of code that looked like this :
if(document.getElementById ) { //DOM element = document.getElementById( id ) ; } else if ( document.all ) { //IE element = document.all[id ] ; } else if ( document.layers ) { //Netscape < 6 element = document.layers[id ] ; }
This is a good and appropriate use of feature detection because the code tests for a feature and then , if it ’s there , uses it .
The best part about this code is that as other browsers began implementing getElementById ( ) , the code did n’t have to change ; support for the new browsers was baked - in using feature detection .
The mixup
Somewhere along the lines , a lot of web developers grew confused about the distinction between the two approaches .
Code started being written similar to this :
//AVOID !!! if ( document.all ) { //IE id = document.uniqueID ; } else { id = Math.random ( ) ; }
The problem with this code is that a test for document .
all is used as an implicit check for IE .
Once knowing that the browser is IE , the assumption is that it ’s safe to use document .
uniqueID , which is IE - specific .
However , all you tested was whether or not document .
all is present , not whether the browser is IE .
Just because document . all is present does n’t mean that document .
uniqueID is also available .
There ’s a false implication that can cause the code to break .
As a clearer statement of this problem , people started replacing code like this :
var isIE = navigator.userAgent.indexOf ( " MSIE " ) > - 1 ;
With code like this :
var isIE = !!document.all ;
Making this change indicates a misunderstanding of “ do n’t use user - agent sniffing . ”
Instead of looking for a particular browser , you ’re looking for a feature and then trying to infer that it ’s a specific browser , which is just as bad .
This is called feature - based browser detection and is a very bad practice .
Somewhere along the line , developers realized that document .
all was not , in fact , the best way to determine if a browser was Internet Explorer .
Then you started seeing code such as this :
var isIE = !!document.all && document.uniqueID ;
This approach falls into the “ too clever ” category of programming .
You ’re trying too hard to identify something by describing an increasing number of identifying aspects .
What ’s worse , there ’s nothing preventing other browsers from implementing the same capabilities , which will ultimately make this code return unreliable results .
If you think such code is n’t being used widely , think again .
The following snippet comes from MooTools 1.1.2 ( note , the current version is 1.1.4 , so this is from an older version ) :
// from MooTools 1.1.2 if ( window.ActiveXObject ) window.ie = window[window.XMLHttpRequest ? 'ie7 ' : 'ie6 ' ] = true ; else if ( document.childNodes && !document.all && !navigator.taintEnabled ) window.webkit = window[window.xpath ? ' webkit420 ' : ' webkit419 ' ] = true ; else if ( document.getBoxObjectFor != null || window.mozInnerScreenX != null ) window.
gecko = true ;
Note how the code tries to determine which browser is being used based on feature detection .
I can point out any number of problems with this , aside from philosophical , but the most glaring is that window .ie will report IE 8 as IE 7 .
Big problem .
Why does n’t this work ?
To understand why feature - based browser detection does n’t work , you need only look back to high school math class , where logic statements are typically taught as part of geometry .
Logic statements are made up of a hypothesis ( p ) and a conclusion ( q ) in the form “ if p then q ” .
You can try altering the statement form to determine truths .
There are three ways to alter the statement :
Converse : if q then p
Inverse : if not p then not q
Contrapositive : if not q then not p
There are two important relationships among the various forms of the statement .
If the original statement is true , then the contrapositive is also true .
For example , if the original statement was “ If it ’s a car , then it has wheels ” ( which is true ) then the contrapositive , “ if it does n’t have wheels then it ’s not a car , ” is also true .
The second relationship is between the converse and the inverse , so if one is true then the other must also be true .
This logically makes sense because the relationship between converse and inverse is the same as between original and contrapositive .
Perhaps more important than these two relationships are the relationships that do n’t exist .
If the original statement is true , then there is no guarantee that the converse is true .
This is where feature - based browser detection falls apart .
Consider the true statement , “ if it ’s Internet Explorer , then document .
all is implemented . ”
The contrapositive , “ if document . all is not implemented , then it ’s not Internet Explorer ” is also true .
The converse , “ if document . all is implemented , then it ’s Internet Explorer ” is not strictly true ( for example , Opera implements it ) .
Feature - based detection assumes that the converse is always true when , in fact , there is no such relationship .
Adding more parts to the conclusion does n’t help either .
Consider once again the statement , “ if it ’s a car , then it ’s has wheels . ”
The converse is obviously false , “ if it has wheels , then it ’s a car ” .
You could try making it more precise : “ if it ’s a car , then it has wheels and requires fuel . ”
Check the converse : “ if it has wheels and requires fuel , then it ’s a car . ”
Also not true because an airplane fits that description .
So try again : “ if it ’s a car , then it has wheels , requires fuel , and uses two axles . ”
Once again , the converse is n’t going to be true .
The problem is fundamental to human language : it ’s very hard to use a collection of singular aspects to define the whole .
We have the word “ car ” because it implies a lot of aspects that we ’d otherwise have to list to identify that thing in which you drive to work .
Trying to identify a browser by naming more and more features is the exact same problem .
You ’ll get close , but it will never be a reliable categorization .
The fallout
MooTools backed themselves , and their users , into a corner by opting for feature - based browser detection .
Mozilla has warned since Firefox 3 that the getBoxObjectFor ( ) method was deprecated and would be removed in a future release .
Since MooTools relies on this method to determine if the browser is Gecko - based , Mozilla ’s removal of this method in the upcoming Firefox 3.6 release means that anyone running older versions of MooTools may have their code impacted .
This prompted MooTools to issue a call to upgrade to the most recent version , which has the issue “ fixed . ”
The explanation :
We have overhauled our browser detection to be based on the user agent string .
This has become the standard practice among JavaScript libraries because of potential issues as Firefox 3.6 demonstrates .
As browsers grow closer together , looking at â€œfeaturesâ€ to separate them will become more difficult and risky .
From this point forward , browser detection will only be used where it would be impossible not to , in order to give the consistent experience across browsers that one would expect from a world - class JavaScript framework .
Curiously , a quick look at MooTools 1.2.4 still shows feature - based browser detection using getBoxObjectFor ( ) :
// from MooTools 1.2.4 var Browser = $ merge ( { Engine : {name : ' unknown ' , version : 0} , Platform : {name : ( window.orientation != undefined ) ? ' ipod ' : ( navigator.platform.match(/mac|win|linux /i ) || [ ' other ' ] ) [ 0].toLowerCase ( )} , Features : {xpath : !!( document.evaluate ) , air : !!( window.runtime ) , query : !!( document.querySelector )} , Plugins : {} , Engines : { presto : function ( ) { return ( !window.opera ) ?
false : ( ( arguments.callee.caller ) ?
960 : ( ( document.getElementsByClassName ) ? 950 : 925 ) ) ; } , trident : function ( ) { return ( !window.ActiveXObject ) ?
false : ( ( window.XMLHttpRequest ) ? ( ( document.querySelectorAll ) ?
6 : 5 ) : 4 ) ; } , webkit : function ( ) { return ( navigator.taintEnabled ) ?
false : ( ( Browser. Features.xpath ) ? ( ( Browser. Features.query ) ? 525 : 420 ) : 419 ) ; } , gecko : function ( ) { return ( !document.getBoxObjectFor && window.mozInnerScreenX == null ) ?
false : ( ( document.getElementsByClassName ) ? 19 : 18 ) ; } } } , Browser || {} ) ;
The usage of getBoxObjectFor( ) is slightly different .
In effect , the approach has changed from using the converse to using the contrapositive .
The problem with this change is that you can only positively not identify the browser .
And once again , testing for a newly - removed method does n’t really help .
What to do ?
Feature - based browser detection is a very bad practice that should be avoided at all costs .
Straight feature detection is a best practice , and in almost every case , is exactly what you ’ll need .
Typically , you just need to know if a feature is implemented before using it .
Do n’t try to infer relationships between features because you ’ll end up with false positives or false negatives .
I wo n’t go so far as to say never use browser detection based on user - agent sniffing , because I do believe there are valid use cases .
I do n’t believe , however , that there are a lot of valid use cases .
If you ’re thinking about user - agent sniffing , keep this in mind : the only safe way to do so is to target a specific version of a specific browser .
Trying to detect a range of browser versions is dangerous , fragile , and likely to break if the upper bound of the range is the most recent version of the browser .
It ’s also advisable to target a specific version that is not the most recent version .
Why ?
Because you want to identify differences , and the easiest way to do that is to look backwards towards previous versions rather than trying to look forward at non-existent future versions .
This also serves to protect your code from the future .
The goal should always be to write code that wo n’t break when an unknown browser begins running it .
Note : if you ’re considering user - agent sniffing , I would n’t recommend worrying about user - agent spoofs .
You should always honor exactly what the browser is reporting as a user - agent .
My approach has always been that if you tell me you ’re Firefox , I expect that you act like Firefox .
If the browser identifies itself as Firefox and does n’t act like Firefox , that ’s not your fault .
There ’s no point in trying to second - guess the reported user - agent string .
So the recommendation is to always use feature detection whenever possible .
If it ’s not possible , then fallback to user - agent sniffing browser detection .
Never , ever use feature - based browser detection because you ’ll be stuck with code that is n’t maintainable and will constantly require updating and changing as browsers continue to evolve .

I really did n’t mean to pick on MooTools when I first started writing this post .
It just happens to present a really good learning opportunity for other developers .
The MooTools developers are smart folks who I ’m sure are continuing to work to improve their library and actively support their large user base .
We all go through a similar learning curve , and we can all learn from one another .

People ( including myself ) love quick “ takeaway ” ideas that they can apply to whatever they are doing right away .
That ’s the idea with these seven tips .
Hopefully you ’ll find at least one these tips to be something you have n’t tried before , something that you can try out on your next project .
# 1 Cut Bass EQ
When The Bass Is Muddy
I ’ve found that many of the best mixing tips I ’ve come across are also some of the most counter intuitive ones .
This actually makes sense because counter intuitive ideas are the hardest ones to come up with on your own .
This tip is a good example of this concept .
If you ’ve got a muddy bass sound in your mix then your first instinct may be to try to pump the bass instrument up higher .
But you may be better off actually cutting the bass EQ .
Not on the bass or the kick drum but on everything else .
By cutting out the bass on other parts that do n’t necessarily need the bass part of their frequency spectrum you can open up more space for the bass parts you really want to hear .
In a similar way it ’s often a good idea to try to sculpt the EQs of your kick drum and your bass so that they each have their own space .
This should provide more clarity and a stronger , clearer bass sound .
By the way , this tip also works for the high end .
The first instinct when you ’ve got no highs shining through may be to raise them , but you will probably get better results by cutting back some of the highs you do n’t need .
This will leave more space for the highs you want to be heard .
# 2 Panning In Mono
This may be the king of counter intuitive tips .
I ’ve found that I can often get the perfect panning arrangement by actually flipping REAPER over to mono and then moving the panning around until everything sits just right in mono .
When I flip it back to stereo I ’ve got a nice rich stereo spectrum that is n’t too wide and is n’t too narrow .
And of course I already know it works perfectly in mono too .
# 3 You Do n’t Have To Include Everything In The Final Mix
Just because it was recorded does n’t mean it has to be included in the final mix .
You know that old saying “ less is more ” ?
It ’s probably more applicable to mixing than just about anything else .
And do n’t get me wrong , I ’m not saying you need to have spare mixes .
A lot of my favorite music is quite busy .
All I mean is that you do n’t want to be wed to including every single part that was recorded in the mix .
A lot of times the best thing you can do to make a mix come to life is to remove something that may be holding it down .
# 4 Level Matching
When you add effects to a track be sure you adjust the output so the volume is the same as the bypassed version of the track .
This allows you to listen to a good A/ B comparison to make sure that you really like what the effect is doing rather than just getting excited about it being louder .
# 5 Mix At A Normal Listening Volume
Or even a bit lower .
It ’s not a good idea to mix while listening to the music at a very loud volume for a number of reasons .
One of those is that you will fatigue your ear very quickly .
Another is that it ’s much easier to make something sound “ good ” when it ’s loud .
It ’s more of a challenge to make it sound good when it ’s quiet .
If you can do that , it will sound good when it ’s loud too .
# 6 Do n’t “ Perfect ” Soloed Tracks
Nobody ’s going to be listening to the guitar by itself , they are going to be listening to the guitar within the mix .
It does n’t matter how it sounds when it ’s soloed , it only matters how it sounds in the mix .
You can waste a lot of time perfecting a soloed track only to realize that it ’s in the way of everything else when you bring everything else back up .
A few years ago , when I wrote " The Conservative Soul , " the conservative media , insofar as they acknowledged its existence , insisted that its core diagnosis - the the GOP had become a religious , more than a political , organization , was over - wrought .
I regarded the fusion of politics and religion - from the world of Islam to the West Bank in Israel to the core of the GOP - as a neurotic and extremely dangerous reacti0n to confusing modernity .
I believed and believe that the core conservative mission today is to confront and defeat it .
I believe what Barry Goldwater believed in 1994 :
When you say " radical right " today , I think of these moneymaking ventures by fellows like Pat Robertson and others who are trying to take the Republican party and make a religious organization out of it .
If that ever happens , kiss politics goodbye .
I stand with Goldwater when he declared :
" Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass . "
Moreover , I do not believe that Barry Goldwater had become a left - liberal .
I believe he remained a conservative to the end , but the Republican Party slowly became a fundamentalist cult , fueled by Nixonian resentment , neoconservative ideology and fiscal recklessness .
I mention all this because of Tim Pawlenty 's speech to CPAC this past weekend .
Pawlenty , we have been told , was the moderate alternative to Palin as McCain 's possible veep nominee .
He 's from Minnesota , hardly the deep South .
He was about fiscal responsibility , not intolerance .
He was no Santorum or Barbour or Palin .
And yet this is what he said should be the first principle of conservatism in the twenty - first century :
' God ’s in charge . '
' God is in charge . '
There are some people who say ,  Oh , you know , Pawlenty , do n’t bring that up .
You know , it ’s politically incorrect . ’
Hogwash . '
These are enshrined in the founding documents and perspective of our country .
In the Declaration of Independence , it says we are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights .
It does n’t say we ’re endowed by Washington , D.C. , or endowed by the bureaucrats or endowed by state government ; it ’s by our creator that we are given these rights . ”
And so he manages to turn what was at the time one of the most radical declarations of a constitutional system not reliant on Scripture or on the divine right of monarchs , but on self - government and reason , a revolution against a country where the church and state were fused , a country where the vast majority of the Founders were Deists who believed that God 's control of earthly affairs was extremely remote ... into the fundamentalist neurosis that passes for so much religious faith in America today .
And you thought I was exaggerating .

Your landlord got foreclosed .
Do you have to go ?
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Renting a home that is going through foreclosure ?
If so , do n't be fooled : Lenders can't kick you out ; they have to honor the terms of your lease .
Of course , that does n't mean that some lenders ' representatives are n't trying to scare people away .
Sandra Pearson has lived in her rented townhouse in Santa Maria , Calif. , since July 2007 .
But last October , the single mom -- whose 17 - year - old son suffers from epilepsy and autism -- was served with a vacate notice .
The owner of the home had lost it to foreclosure and the servicer , First Federal Bank , wanted Pearson out .
She showed them her lease , which runs through June 2010 , and proof of on - time payments and thought everything was cleared up .
But in December , First Federal failed , and OneWest Bank took over its assets -- including the Santa Maria townhouse .
When Pearson went to pay her rent , the agency managing the property for OneWest refused to accept the check .
They threatened her with court action and claimed her lease was not legitimate .
" They scare the wits out of you , " Pearson said .
OneWest eventually agreed to allow her to finish her lease ; however , a bank spokeswoman said they still believe there were problems with the documents .
Under the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act , which Congress passed last May , tenants like Pearson are usually eligible to stay after the property has been foreclosed as long as they have a valid lease and are paying their rent regularly .
Even renters on a month - to - month lease get 90 days to leave .
But tenant advocacy groups charge that lender representatives , including some unscrupulous real estate agents , have been preying on tenants ' ignorance .
They pressure renters by sending them misleading letters that drive some out .
One letter sent out by a Texas law firm stated , " This letter constitutes formal and final demand that you vacate the premises within three days [ emphasis ours ] of the date this letter is delivered . "
Worse , the message threatens legal costs if tenants do n't comply .
With that facing them , many fold their tents .
" The average person would n't know the law has changed , " said Robert Doggett , an attorney for Texas RioGrande Legal Aid .
" People assume they have to leave . "
There is no official data identifying the number of people who have received such letters , but advocates think it could be quite high considering the number of properties bought for investment and rented out during the boom years .
The attorney general of Connecticut , Richard Blumenthal , has fielded numerous complaints .
" Potentially , it could be affecting thousands of tenants , " he said .
" We 're warning banks and real estate interests : foreclosure is not excuse for illegal eviction . "
Early in February , he sent out cease - and - desist letters to 15 lenders , including such big names as Wells Fargo , HSBC and Citibank , nine law firms and six real estate companies , urging them to comply with the act .
The banks all denied any intentional wrongdoing .
Some did say they have absorbed huge volumes of foreclosed properties with little , if any , infrastructure in place to handle the extraordinary number of repossessions .
In fact , many often contract with outside companies -- law firms and real estate brokers -- to handle the workload .
And in some cases it may be those contractors who are overstepping the bounds , without the banks ' knowledge , according to Gabe Treves , program director at California advocacy group Tenants Together .
" The realtors see tenants as a roadblock to their commission , " he said , " so they bully and mislead them into signing away their rights to say in their homes . "
That almost happened to taxi driver Owen Casper , who found a note on his door from a real estate agent telling him he had 30 days to get out of his San Diego home .
" It gave me two options , " he said .
" Continue in the home on a month - to - month lease or take keys for cash .
But the agent told me because I was already month - to - month , my only option was to move . "
The agent represented Fannie Mae , the government sponsored mortgage giant , which has a strict policy of protecting tenants .
But , apparently , the agent had n't gotten that message .
Casper is thankful he called Tenants Together and fought the eviction .
They advised him to speak directly to the mortgage company since the bank might not be aware of the agent 's bad behavior .
After Casper contacted Fannie Mae , it arranged for him to talk over his situation with a new agent .
" She made it very easy for me to stay in my home , " he said .
" I got a year lease at very affordable rent . "
To Blumenthal , whether or not it 's policy or rogue representatives is not particularly relevant .
" One way or the other , the outside contractors act as the lenders ' agents and so [ the lenders ] are legally responsible , " he said .
Tropics Heating Up ?
For our part of the world , Hurricane Season comes each summer and fall from June 1 to November 30 .
But , tropical cyclones show up in many parts of the world and are called different things .
Tropical cyclones in the eastern Pacific and North Atlantic are known as Hurricanes .
In the Western North Pacific , they gain the moniker of Typhoon .
To become a typhoon or hurricane , a tropical cyclone must reach sustained winds of 64 kts or greater which is 74 mph .
In the South Pacific and Indian Ocean , they are called Cyclones but only need to reach 34 kts which is equivalent to the Tropical Storm designation in the North Atlantic of 40 mph .
If a tropical cyclone forms in the Timor Sea and moves Southeast across Northwest Australia , it is known as a Willy Willy .
Now , tropical cyclones have to form away from the equatorial regions … typically north , or south , of 10 degrees latitude .
That is because you need coriolis forces to produce circulation and the coriolis force becomes more negligible the closer you get to the equator .
Because coriolis parameters are at play and a tropical cyclone is an area of low pressure , the lower levels of the storm flow in a counter - clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and in a clockwise direction in the Southern Hemisphere .
The average number of “ named storms ” in the North Atlantic is about 11 with 5 or 6 becoming Hurricanes .
Americans tend to think that active tropical weather is defined solely on what goes on in the North Atlantic but the truth is that the North Atlantic is not even close to the most popular breeding ground for tropical cyclones .
This tends to come into play these days when people look at tropical activity to determine the effects of Global Warming .
That would be short sighted .
The Eastern North Pacific averages 15 tropical cyclones , The North Indian Ocean averages 6 tropical cyclones annually while the South Indian Ocean comes in with 11 .
The Southwestern Pacific and Australia area checks in with 15 per year but the all time winner every year is the Western North Pacific .
That region of the world experiences more than 25 tropical cyclones per year with 18 becoming Typhoons .
The season in this hot bed of tropical cyclones is April to December but the frequency of off - season tropical cyclones in this region is much higher than any other part of the world .
Until recently , there had never been a tropical cyclone in the South Atlantic until a hurricane ( that ’s what they decided to call it ) showed up off of Brazil in 2004 .
The map at the left shows all tracks of all tropical cyclones from 1985 to 2005 .
Well , we are coming out of winter in the Northern Hemisphere but they winding up the summer in the South .
While it is speculated that the absence of land masses in the Southern Hemisphere is the reason why there are fewer tropical cyclones down South , it stands to reason that , like the Northern Hemisphere , the tail end of the summer months is probably the peak of cyclone season .
Right now , there is Tropical Cyclone Ului which is in the Coral Sea and heading toward the Eastern Australian coast according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center report on Ului .
Authorities in New Zealand are also keeping a close eye on Ului .
High pressure to the east has weakend and so Ului is moving South but is expected to curve it back to the Southwest as high pressure builds back in once a trof moves through .
As long as that happens , it ’s the Aussie ’s problem , not so much the Kiwis but it is uncertain if the storm makes it all the way to Queensland or just brushes the coast and swings back to New Zealand .
By that time , it should be in a weakening stage as it enters colder waters .
Well east of Ului is Tomas .
Now , Cyclone Tomas approached the Fiji Islands over the past 24 hours and has brought havoc .
Fiji has over 300 islands as part of its archpeligo with about 106 inhabited .
Vanua Levu is taking the brunt of the storm with winds with Tomas reported at 105 kts with 130 kt gusts by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center .
Video from Suva shows the rough seas and gusty winds , though though that city is well away from the center of the storm or its projected path .
It serves as testiment to how broad the windfield must be .
A report from the New Zealand Herald say there are reports of deaths and damage associated with Tomas with part of Fiji ’s 1 million residents hunkering down in shelters .
Here is a more complete report that claims that both it and Ului are “ fiercer than Katrina ” and it ’s not too complete because communications are so poor and the storm is moving slowly .
The Fiji Meteorological Service has the latest updates and details .
Now , this report claims winds have increased to 200 km per hour .
That would be 108 kts or 125 mph .
That is about the same maximum winds of Katrina , not stronger .
And Katrina ’s devastation was caused by a storm surge that was enhanced by the local geography .
Further , Katrina had winds of 175 mph , or 281 km per hour , less than 24 hours prior to landfall that created a storm surge consistent with a top flight storm .
The only reason that the winds decreased at landfall was due to its going through an eyewall replacement cycle .
So , that claim is probably an exaggeration .
Nevertheless , it ’s a tough storm and the surge is apparently an issue .
Let us hope that the hyperbole is not the truth and that Fiji escapes .
Weather Bottom Line : I still see that upper low coming down from the north on Wednesday but so far , it appears to be content to move down to our west .
The question will be how much clouds we have in our area .
I still think it will be sufficient to keep us from getting to 60 but , either way , look for a warm up in the coming days .
Low to mid 50 ’s Tuesday with the sun making an appearance .
Filtered sun on Wednesday with highs in mid to upper 50’s .
Low to mid 60’s on Thursday and Friday then mid 60’s , or maybe even higher on Saturday .
Then a cold front brings rain and some t’storms Saturday night and much cooler conditions on Sunday … .
I think it may be colder than most folks think … I say low to mid 40’s .
We ’ll see .
Many Western Saharans live in sprawling refugee camps in the Algerian desert
By Sam Bagnall
BBC News
A human rights campaigner from the disputed territory of Western Sahara says he was beaten by Moroccan police after giving an interview to the BBC .
Rachid Sghir and his colleagues were aware of the risks they ran by being interviewed for our TV documentary series Tropic of Cancer .
But he wanted to be identified speaking to us openly on camera to highlight what he says is the ongoing mistreatment of his fellow Saharawi people .
We had arranged the interview via text message .
We were told to wait at a petrol station on the outskirts of town after dark .
A car pulled up and flashed its lights - the signal to follow them through the back streets to a Saharawi safe - house .
We can't campaign for independence openly .
We can't even raise the Saharawi flag or talk about the history of the Saharawi people
Rachid Sghir
My colleague , presenter of Tropic of Cancer Simon Reeve , was shown into the safe house with the film crew .
" What we have to say about the Moroccans is that they came to this country and occupied it in 1975 , " Sghir told Reeve .
" We 're still asking for our independence , no more , and no less .
There 's a lot of oppression here .
The secret police are everywhere .
There 's no freedom of speech . "
Sghir said he had previously been beaten by the Moroccan police while trying to attend a human rights conference in Laayoune , the main town of Western Sahara .
" We can't campaign for independence openly .
We can't even raise the Saharawi flag or talk about the history of the Saharawi people , " he said .
Police violence
Our team had been followed by plain clothes officers from the Moroccan security services ever since arriving in Western Sahara .
But that night , we believed we had shaken them off .
Despite the precautions , news of the meeting appears to have leaked .
Days after the Tropic of Cancer team had left Western Sahara , Sghir says he was detained by the Moroccan police , questioned about his activities including the interview with the BBC and severely beaten .
Rachid Sghir says his bruises were caused by a Moroccan police beating Pictures he has supplied to the BBC clearly show severe bruising to his backside .
We have repeatedly contacted the Moroccan authorities , and they have failed to respond to the allegation that Rachid Sghir was in effect tortured .
In the past the Moroccan government has denied allegations of widespread abuse and has defended the country 's human rights record .
But it has long faced criticism from human rights groups over its treatment of those who campaign for independence for Western Sahara .
In 2008 , Human Rights Watch accused the Moroccan government of using " a combination of repressive laws , police violence , and unfair trials to punish Saharawis who advocate peacefully in favour of independence or full self - determination for the disputed Western Sahara " .
Historic dispute Western Sahara lies on the north - west coast of Africa and has a population of less than half a million .
The area was ruled by Spain until 1975 , when it was divided with Spain 's agreement between Morocco and Mauritania .
Morocco calls the area Moroccan Sahara and asserts historical ownership .
A war followed between Morocco and an independence movement called the Polisario Front , made up of the indigenous Saharawi people and backed by neighbouring Algeria .
A UN - sponsored ceasefire was negotiated in 1991 to end the Polisario Front 's guerrilla war against Morocco .
A referendum on the status of the territory has been planned but the terms have never been agreed .
Today , more than 100,000 people who fled Western Sahara during the fighting are still living in refugee camps run by the Polisario Front across the border in the Algerian desert near the border town of Tindouf .
Morocco claims these refugees are being held against their will by Polisario , a claim denied by the independence movement .
In October 2009 , some months after his BBC interview , Sghir left Western Sahara with six other human rights activists to visit the camps at Tindouf .
The Moroccan government considers such visits a threat to the integrity of the state , a criminal offence under Moroccan law .
Sghir and his colleagues were arrested on their return from the camps , charged under various offences and now face trial in a military court .
Prisoners of conscience Amnesty International has called on the Moroccan government to respect the men's human rights , calling their continued imprisonment " a serious attack on freedom of expression by the Moroccan Authorities " .
The Moroccan authorities will not tolerate even peaceful criticism of their stance on Western Sahara
Malcolm Smart , Amnesty " They are prisoners of conscience and should be freed without delay , " said Malcolm Smart , the director of Amnesty 's Middle East and North Africa Programme .
" The imprisonment of Rachid Sghir and the others appears intended not only to punish them for their beliefs but also to send a signal to others that the Moroccan authorities will not tolerate even peaceful criticism of their stance on Western Sahara . "
The Moroccan government has proposed a solution to the current impasse over Western Sahara , involving autonomy for the region but maintaining Moroccan sovereignty .
The Polisario Front rejected the autonomy proposal in favour of full independence for the territory .
Western Sahara attracts few headlines and we only visited because it lay on our journey around the world along the Tropic of Cancer , the northern border of Earth 's tropical region - a journey which took us to 18 different countries .
" It 's a beautiful area of the world , but also home to a great deal of injustice , " said presenter Simon Reeve .
" It was humbling to meet Sghir and other democracy campaigners and human rights activists who put their freedom on the line daily to battle for rights that we in Britain can take for granted , " said Reeve .
Simon Reeve 's interview with Rachid Sghir features in Tropic of Cancer on BBC Two at 8 pm on Sunday 21 March .

Posted by John , February 23rd , 2010 - under Israel , Palestine .
Tags : Benjamin Netanyahu , Hamas
Benjamin Netanyahu is the Israeli prime Minister .
He is a murderer .
Interpol has issued arrest warrants for the 11 Israeli secret service agents who killed Hamas commander Mahmoud al - Mabhouh .
It is also possible Fatah supporters from the Palestinian Authority helped the agency , Mossad .
According to The Australian newspaper Netanyahu ‘… authorised the mission , which was not seen as complicated or risky . ’
Drawing on a report from the Sunday Times The Australian also says that the Israeli Prime Minister met with the assassins shortly before the hit .
Where I come from such action would lead to murder charges against Netanyahu .
Has Interpol issued a warrant for the arrest of the Israeli Prime Minister ?
Of course not .
This murderer is allowed to roam free in occupied Palestine because he serves the interests of US capitalism in the region .
Israel is America ’s armed wing and helps control the most strategic oil region in the world and prevent China from getting any foothold there .
Remember the Goldstone report ?
The UN commissioned Goldstone and other eminent jurists to investigate possible war crimes by all sides during Israel ’s invasion of Gaza just over a year ago .
The Goldstone Report is unequivocal .
It concluded :
[ T ] here is evidence indicating serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law were committed by Israel during the Gaza conflict , and that Israel committed actions amounting to war crimes , and possibly crimes against humanity .
The report goes on to detail the evidence that leads to that conclusion .
The blockade of Gaza is itself a possible war crime .
The invasion is too .
As the UN Press Release on the report says :
[ T ]he Israeli military operation was directed at the people of Gaza as a whole , in furtherance of an overall and continuing policy aimed at punishing the Gaza population , and in a deliberate policy of disproportionate force aimed at the civilian population .
The destruction of food supply installations , water sanitation systems , concrete factories and residential houses was the result of a deliberate and systematic policy which has made the daily process of living , and dignified living , more difficult for the civilian population .
These are , in the measured tones of the report , possible war crimes or even crimes against humanity .
Nothing has happened about the report , other than that the US Congress has passed a motion condemning it and supporting Israel .
They did this , not because the US serves Israel ’s interests , but because Israel serves America ’s global interests .
Justice in international law is the ’ justice ’ of the powerful , of those who have won the battle of history and dominate the world .
Australia is no innocent in this .
Our troops in Afghanistan assassinate villagers who may be sympathetic to the resistance against the invaders .
Operation Phoenix has risen from the ashes .
Netanyahu and Obama , Bush and Blair , Howard and Rudd deserve to be in leg irons at The International Court in The Hague .
Justice wo n’t happen unless and until workers across the globe democratically run society in the interests of humanity , not profit .
France must bring back the brothel to protect its prostitutes from exploitation , trafficking and aggression in the street , an MP from Nicolas Sarkozy 's rightwing party has said .
Chantal Brunel , a member of the ruling UMP , called on French authorities to study the possibility of legalising centres where sex workers could serve clients within a regulated and protected framework .
It was time , she said , to move away from attempts to stamp out prostitution and instead focus on making the sex trade more safe and transparent .
According to a CSA opinion poll , Brunel 's stance is supported by a majority of French people : 59 % of respondents supported the reopening of so - called maisons closes ( literally , closed houses ) .
While that number has fallen slightly in recent years , the number opposed to the reintroduction of brothels has dropped from 26 % seven years ago to just 10 % now .
Women remain markedly more against the idea than men .
In 2003 , Sarkozy , then interior minister , made passive solicitation a crime punishable by a jail term or hefty fine .
Brunel voted for the law at the time , but now says the crackdown failed .
She is urging the government to look at other countries , such as the Netherlands and Switzerland , in which licensed brothels are legal .
" Prostitutes are finding themselves even more badly treated and damaged than before , " she said .
" We have to stop their exploitation . "
Amid the shame of wartime " horizontal " Nazi collaboration and growing concern for women 's rights , 1,400 maisons closes were shut in 1946 under what is known as the Marthe Richard law .
Richard , a prostitute turned politician , fought to have brothels outlawed out of a desire to kill off the sex trade for good .
Accused by some activists of encouraging a return to the bad old days , Brunel , author of a new book entitled Putting an End to Violence against Women , insists she is not calling for the resurrection of brothels as they were once known , but envisages maisons ouvertes in which shelter and medical care would be provided .
" The idea is not to return to the situation before 1946 , " she said .
She would like to see prostitutes working in groups " like in professional offices , like accountants " .
A boss figure or " landlord " to whom the workers would give part of their earnings would not be " essential " , she added .
Françoise Gil , a sociologist and member of a women 's rights association , agreed the distinction was crucial .
She said she would be against the return of maisons closes , but would be in favour of reopening maisons ouvertes in which sex workers could gather without a boss or a pimp .
Other activists , however , are outraged at the proposals irrespective of caveats .
" What kind of a society is it that shuts up its women for the pleasure of its men ? " said Bruno Lemettre , president of the Mouvement du Nid anti-prostitution association .
" Allowing such a thing in the country of human rights would be unacceptable , " he said .
There are thought to be between 20,000 and 30,000 full - time sex workers – male and female – in France , 80 % from abroad .
A working group , of which Brunel is part , is due to meet next week to discuss the country 's approach to prostitution .
EDS 's key witness during the firm 's court case against BSkyB was shown to have bought his degree online – but still managed to get a worse mark than a dog .
The witness - Joe Galloway , former Managing Director for CRM Solutions at EDS – was responsible for providing BSkyB with the time period he thought it would take to install a CRM IT system .
The delivery then took much longer than he had claimed .
The judge 's ruling said : " That representation was false … it was made dishonestly by Joe Galloway who knew it to be false . "
Of the five accusations of misrepresentation brought by BSkyB in the case , this was the only one that was upheld by the judge and effectively led to EDS losing the case .
One of the reasons the accusation was upheld was that Joe Galloway made another representation that was proven false by BSkyB 's lawyers – that he had a degree from Concordia College in the US Virgin Islands .
Galloway gave detailed evidence on how he took plane journeys between the islands and attended a college there .
But while questioning Galloway in court , Mark Howard QC managed to obtain exactly the same degree as Galloway from Concordia College for his dog " Lulu " with one key difference – the dog got a higher mark .
Both Galloway and the dog received a letter from the vice - chancellor of Concordia College saying :
“ Mr Galloway / Lulu demonstrated that he / she is prepared and fully equipped to add valuable apprenticeship to our institution ’s activities by means of talented and profoundly investigated subject treatment . "
Galloway 's credibility as a witness was shredded , according to one lawyer who witnessed proceedings .
" He gave his evidence [ on going to the college ] in the same confident , secure manner as he gave his evidence about the EDS representations .
Make no mistake , this was a key factor in EDS losing this case , " said the lawyer .
Galloway left EDS in December 2000 to form a CRM consultancy , ITIVITI .
He was later employed by EDSC in the US as an IT consultant but was dismissed from that role during the course of the trial after the true nature of his degree was revealed .
Both Galloway and Lulu were unavailable for comment at the time of writing .
Sokal hoax
But why did I do it ?
I confess that I 'm an unabashed Old Leftist who never quite understood how deconstruction was supposed to help the working class .
And I 'm a stodgy old scientist who believes , naively , that there exists an external world , that there exist objective truths about that world , and that my job is to discover some of them .
-- Alan Sokal
In its 1996 Spring / Summer issue ( pp. 217-252 ) , Social Text journal published an article by Alan Sokal , Professor of Physics at New York University , entitled " Transgressing the Boundaries : Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity . "
The article was a hoax submitted , according to Sokal , to see " would a leading journal of cultural studies publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if ( a ) it sounded good and ( b ) it flattered the editors ' ideological preconceptions ? "
It would .
Needless to say , the editors of Social Text were not pleased .
Sokal claims that the editors , had they been scrupulous and intellectually competent , would have recognized from the first paragraph of his essay that it was a parody .
The physicist says he was " troubled by an apparent decline in the standards of intellectual rigor in certain precincts of the American academic humanities . "
The hoax was his way of calling attention to this decline .
In his article , Sokal attacks " the dogma imposed by the long post - Enlightenment hegemony over the Western intellectual outlook " that there is an external world governed by laws of nature which we can understand imperfectly using the scientific method .
He also claims that " physical ' reality ' ... is at bottom a social and linguistic construct . "
Furthermore , he says ,
Throughout the article , I employ scientific and mathematical concepts in ways that few scientists or mathematicians could possibly take seriously .
For example , I suggest that the " morphogenetic field ' ' -- a bizarre New Age idea due to Rupert Sheldrake -- constitutes a cutting - edge theory of quantum gravity .
This connection is pure invention ; even Sheldrake makes no such claim .
I assert that Lacan 's psychoanalytic speculations have been confirmed by recent work in quantum field theory .
Even nonscientist readers might well wonder what in heavens ' name quantum field theory has to do with psychoanalysis ; certainly my article gives no reasoned argument to support such a link .
In sum , I intentionally wrote the article so that any competent physicist or mathematician ( or undergraduate physics or math major ) would realize that it is a spoof .
Evidently the editors of Social
Text felt comfortable publishing an article on quantum physics without bothering to consult anyone knowledgeable in the subject .
Such lax editing might be expected in a New Age magazine , where preposterous and unfounded claims about paranormal " energies " being validated by quantum mechanics are commonplace .
But Sokal thinks we should expect more of a prestigious journal edited by distinguished scholars in the humanities .
But why did he pick on this particular journal ?
Sokal hoaxed Social Text for political reasons .
Both are " leftist " politically , but Sokal considers the New Left to be guilty of " epistemic relativism . "
( Is this another hoax ? )
He seems particularly peeved that the New Left promotes the notion that reality is a social construction .
Furthermore , the New Left has created " a self - perpetuating academic subculture that typically ignores ( or disdains ) reasoned criticism from the outside . "
So , apparently Sokal wanted to criticize the " epistemic relativism " and " social constructivism " of the New Left in a New Left journal but felt the only way they would let him do so would be if he pretended to share their ideology .
Many have pointed out the profound implications of this hoax .
At the very least , articles should be reviewed by experts in the field covered by the article .
Sources and references named in the article should be checked by the editors .
Above all , however , the Sokal hoax demonstrates how willing we are to be deceived about matters we believe strongly in .
We are likely to be more critical of articles which attack our position than we are of those which we think supports it ( Gilovich ) .
This tendency to confirmation bias affects physicists as well as professors in the social sciences and the humanities .

The Sokal Incident - Everything on the Internet relating to this hoax
I have recently come to the conclusion that leftists reveal their innermost thoughts when attacking those with whom they disagree .
For example , in President Obama 's recently televised meeting with Republicans , he chastised critics who believe his policies are part of some " Bolshevik plot . "
My first thought was , " Huh ? " I frequently listen to and read conservative media , and I had never heard this analysis .
So it seemed that Obama was responding to an argument no one had made .
Why would he do this ?
The answer may lie in my second thought , which was that Mr. Obama had just provided the most brilliant and succinct analysis I have heard for the motivation behind his administration 's agenda .
Why all these czars ?
Bolshevik plot .
Why take over General Motors ?
Bolshevik plot .
Why attack the banks ?
Bolshevik plot .
Why force nationalized health care down our throats ?
Bolshevik plot .
Why attempt to turn the National Endowment for the Arts into a propaganda ministry ?
Bolshevik plot .
And so on and so on .
Thank you , Mr. President .
The previously nonexistent argument you responded to now exists , and it is a powerful one .
Another example is the charge of racism leveled against anyone who disagrees with President Obama 's way of thinking .
( The most recent declaration is that anyone who calls Mr. Obama a " professor " is probably a racist . )
This has given conservatives a prolonged and collective " Huh ? " moment .
As conservatives , we are surprised to hear that our opposition to policies connected with Caucasians like Marx , Lenin , and Stalin would suddenly be a manifestation of white hostility toward blacks .
This idea is so far from our minds that we wonder how anyone could even conceive of such an accusation .
The reason , as with President Obama and his Bolshevik plot , is that rather than accurately describing the opposition , the left is actually revealing something about itself .
This was perhaps illustrated most clearly when after President Obama 's recent State of the Union address , MS - NBC anchor Chris Matthews revealed that for an hour he forgot that the president is black .
As Jonah Goldberg pointed out , this comment is instructive because it speaks to the left 's own racism and to the reason why they try to transfer their shortcomings onto us .
In other words , since the left is racist , conservatives must be racist , too .
A recent " Huh ? " moment for me came in researching so - called anti-racist writer and speaker Tim Wise , who is unfortunately coming to the campus where I teach later this semester .
During a recorded speech I was listening to , Wise put forth a theory that I had never heard before on the origin of white racism against blacks .
According to Wise , Europeans did n't consider themselves white before the founding of the American colonies .
This idea was introduced by wealthy colonists who noticed that their white and black servants were unhappy with the current state of affairs .
Fearing a revolt , the rich , greedy imperialists convinced the white servants they were better than the black servants because of the color of their skin .
As a result , the white servants were distracted from their desire for freedom and began to help the wealthy colonists oppress the black servants .
This myth of " white privilege " has been passed down through generations , where it continues to allow rich whites to enslave poor whites .
That is , the myth of white privilege causes poor whites to think they are superior to poor blacks .
This in turn ensures a compliant peasantry which will not unite to overthrow its capitalist oppressors .
Like the charge of racism , Wise 's account of history is so bizarre that it caught me completely off - guard when I first heard it .
How does someone even come up with stuff like this ?
An answer dawned on me as I was reading Norman Davies ' book Heart of Europe : A Short History of Poland .
In the book , Davies explains that one of the reasons the communist regime in Poland enjoyed little support among the people was because Poles were oppressing Poles .
He contrasts this with the Soviet Union , where the regime did enjoy some measure of popular support .
Now , within the Soviet Union were many ethnic groups , but the ruling communist party was almost exclusively populated by ethnic Russians .
Of course , Russians were oppressed by their fellow Russians , but many supported the regime because it kept the other ethnic groups in check .
The history of the Soviet Union is a plausible source for the account of American history as told by Tim Wise .
The motives that he claims are possessed by his opponents are most likely his own , given the tendency of leftists to project onto conservatives their own failings .
The left are trying to bring about class warfare by fomenting hatred and fear among different groups of people .
If this class warfare ever is successful in establishing a communist dictatorship , then the ruling class -- which would most likely consist of privileged white leftists -- would rely on continued racial and class hatred to maintain their power .
People of color , women , gays , animals , and the environment would be oppressed under this regime ; only this time the oppression will be real .
However , as was the case in the USSR , the regime may enjoy a measure of support for its efforts at keeping the hated class -- white people who do not give their allegiance to the party -- in check .
In the left 's new world order , the idea of white privilege would be used to enslave the very people they currently claim to liberate .

Israel has announced the building of 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem , in a move that threatens to overshadow US Vice - President Joe Biden 's visit .
The move has angered Palestinians , whose leaders have only recently agreed to resume indirect contacts with Israel - at Mr Biden 's urging .
For his part , Mr Biden has condemned it as " the kind of step that undermines the trust we need right now " .
The international community considers East Jerusalem occupied territory .
Building on occupied land is illegal under international law , but Israel regards East Jerusalem - which it annexed in 1967 - as its territory .
In a strongly worded statement , Mr Biden said : " I condemn the decision by the government of Israel to advance planning for new housing units in east Jerusalem .
" The substance and timing of the announcement , particularly with the launching of proximity talks , is precisely the kind of step that undermines the trust we need right now and runs counter to the constructive discussions that I 've had here in Israel . "
He said the Israelis and Palestinians needed to build an atmosphere to support negotiations , not complicate them , adding : " This announcement underscores the need to get negotiations under way that can resolve all the outstanding issues of the conflict . "
Mr Biden said the US recognised that Jerusalem was a deeply important issue for Israelis and Palestinians , and for Jews , Muslims and Christians .
" We believe that through good faith negotiations , the parties can mutually agree on an outcome that realises the aspirations of both parties for Jerusalem and safeguards its status for people around the world , " he said .
Palestinian Authority spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina told AFP news agency : " This is a dangerous decision and will hinder the negotiations .
" We consider the decision to build in East Jerusalem to be a judgment that the American efforts have failed before the negotiations have even begun . "
A spokesman for the Israeli interior ministry said : " This is a procedural stage in the framework of a long process that will yet continue for some time ... there is no connection to US Vice - President Joe Biden 's visit to Israel . "
Under US pressure , Israel has announced a 10 - month suspension of new building in the West Bank .
But the suspension excludes East Jerusalem , where the Palestinians want their capital .
There are still various planning hurdles for the East Jerusalem project to clear , and work is not thought likely to start for at least two years .
' Moment of opportunity '
Mr Biden is the most senior member of President Barack Obama 's administration to visit Jerusalem .
Earlier , at a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , he said there was a " moment of real opportunity " for peace between the Palestinians and Israel .
Israel says the building in Beitar Illit is " an exception "
In the shadow of a settlement An Israeli settlement in close - up Middle East ' haunted by the past '
Mr Biden welcomed the two sides ' recent agreement to start indirect " proximity " talks , saying the US would back those who " took risks for peace " .
Mr Biden said he hoped the indirect talks would lead to direct talks , through which a two - state solution with " Israel and Palestine side - by - side " could be reached .
The Palestinians refuse to hold face - to - face negotiations with the Israelis unless they halt all settlement building in the occupied West Bank , where the Palestinians want their future state .
US Middle East envoy George Mitchell is expected to shuttle between the Palestinians in Ramallah and the Israelis in Jerusalem .
Mr Biden also said the US was committed to Israeli security and determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons .
He added that the best long - term guarantee for Israel 's security was a comprehensive peace between Israel and its neighbours .
Mr Netanyahu said Israel would continue to support the US push for stronger sanctions against Iran , and that he was pleased its efforts to restart Israeli - Palestinian peace talks were " beginning to bear fruit " .
He said the goal of negotiations was a peace deal that included Palestinian recognition of the " permanence and legitimacy of the Jewish state of Israel " .
West Bank building Hours before Mr Biden 's arrival on Monday , Israel enraged Palestinians by approving 112 new homes in Beitar Illit in the West Bank .
Israeli officials said the move was " an exception " , and necessary to improve the settlement 's security .
Palestinian leaders told Mr Mitchell that the move put the indirect talks at risk .
Close to 500,000 Jews live in more than 100 settlements built since Israel 's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
Correspondents say there is little optimism in the region about what the indirect Israeli - Palestinian talks might achieve .
Periods of direct negotiations over the last two decades have failed to reach agreement .
Mr Netanyahu 's right - leaning government has taken a harder line stance on final status issues than that of the previous administration .
He has ruled out dividing Jerusalem , wants the Palestinians to recognise Israel as a Jewish state , and said he intends to maintain a presence along the eastern border of a future Palestinian state .
On Wednesday , Mr Biden will meet Palestinian leaders in the West Bank before travelling to Jordan for talks with King Abdullah .

La France , qui passe souvent pour un pays où l'on travaille peu , n'a pas totalement usurpé sa réputation : selon une étude de l'Insee , intitulée " Soixante ans de réduction du temps de travail dans le monde " , rendue publique mercredi 13 janvier , elle affichait , en 2007 , une durée moyenne de travail de 1 559 heures par an , ce qui la place au huitième rang d'un panel regroupant dix pays développés – le Japon , les Etats - Unis , la République de Corée , les Pays - Bas , l'Allemagne , l'Italie , la Suède , le Royaume - Uni et l'Espagne .
Les Français travaillent un peu plus que les Néerlandais ou les Allemands , mais nettement moins que les Espagnols , les Japonais , les Coréens ou les Américains , qui détiennent les records de durée du travail .
En France comme dans la plupart des pays développés , le temps de travail a fortement baissé depuis la fin de la seconde guerre mondiale .
De 1950 à 2007 , la durée moyenne annuelle est ainsi passée de 2 230 à 1 559 heures , ce qui représente un recul de 30 % .
Selon les auteurs de l'étude , Gérard Bouvier et Fatoumata Diallo , cette baisse est liée à la fois au développement du salariat , à la diminution de la durée hebdomadaire collective du travail , à l'augmentation des jours de congés et à la progression du temps partiel .
GAIN DE PRODUCTIVITÉ
Dans les années qui suivent la Libération , le déclin de l'agriculture , qui impose des emplois du temps très chargés , est , en France , le principal facteur de la baisse du temps de travail .
De 1950 à 1966 , la part des salariés passe ainsi de 65 % à 76 % , expliquant pour l'essentiel le recul de la durée moyenne du travail .
" Dans quasiment tous les pays , le déclin de l'emploi agricole a déterminé le rythme et l'ampleur de la salarisation , qui atteint aujourd ' hui un taux proche de 90 % , comme en France " , souligne l'étude de l'Insee .
Dans les années 1960 et 1970 , les gains de productivité permettent de relâcher la pression sur le marché du travail : le recours aux heures supplémentaires est moins fréquent et une troisième semaine de congés payés est négociée en 1968 .
L'effet sur la durée moyenne de travail est sensible : de 1958 à 1974 , elle continue à baisser , passant de 1920 à 1 763 heures de travail par an .
Cette tendance se renforce dans les années 1970 sous l'effet du premier choc pétrolier , qui provoque un ralentissement de la croissance .
A partir des années 1980 , les mesures sur le temps de travail se succèdent pour tenter de freiner la hausse du chômage : baisse de la durée hebdomadaire à 39 heures en 1982 , cinquième semaine de congés payés la même année , nouvelle baisse de la durée légale du travail en 1998 et en 2000 .
" Les mutations de la composition de l'emploi ( déclin de l'emploi industriel , croissance des emplois de services , plus souvent à temps partiel ) ont également contribué à cette baisse de la durée " , soulignent M. Bouvier et Mme Diallo .
Car le développement du travail partiel devient , à partir des années 1990 , le moteur essentiel de la baisse du temps de travail .
En France , de 1990 à 1998 , la part des salariés à temps partiel explose , passant de 9,5 % à 15 % .
Très répandu dans le secteur des services , le temps partiel , qui concerne principalement les femmes , est souvent subi dans les professions peu qualifiées .
Il se développe cependant dans tous les pays développés : en 2007 , il représentait 13 % des emplois aux Etats - Unis , 17 en France , 19 % au Japon , 25 % en Allemagne , au Royaume - Uni et en Suède , 47 % aux Pays - Bas .
La France n'a pas été épargnée par cette forte augmentation du temps partiel mais elle semble moins touchée que certains de ses voisins .
Dans l'Hexagone , la baisse récente de la durée moyenne annuelle du travail est donc liée à un autre phénomène : la réduction collective du temps de travail .
" Avec les lois Robien ( 1996 ) puis Aubry ( 1998 , 2000 ) , la durée du travail hebdomadaire théorique a de nouveau nettement baissé , passant de 38,4 en 1998 à 35,9 heures en 2006 " , conclut l'étude .

Crazy Senator Jim Bunning is retiring .
The Republicans selected normal Republican guy Trey Grayson to replace him .
But crazy Ron Paul 's son Rand ( yes , Rand ) Paul is also running , and he 's kicking Grayson 's ass .
Time to call in Cheney .
Rand Paul is taking advantage of his dad 's crazy internet comment troll machine to clean up in fundraising , and he 's ahead in every poll taken since last November .
He 's won the coveted Sarah Palin endorsement .
Ron Paul is crazy , but he is at least anti-war , anti-drug war , pro-habeas corpus , anti-death penalty , and anti-PATRIOT Act .
His wonderful son Rand combines the worst of libertarian philosophy ( no social safety net , progressive taxation , Welfare state , or , whatever , public infrastructure for anyone ) with more " conventional " Republican views on foreign policy and social issues .
( Always being pro-killing - everyone everywhere with bombs all of the time and being pro-locking up young people for ten years for smoking the demon weed are the " more conventional " political opinions . )
But Dr. Paul the Younger 's still got that Tea Party Patrick Henry marching - around - with - funny - signs mojo working for him .
And we 're pulling for him !
Because it would be hilarious to watch the GOP mainstream lose at the hands of the populist anger - junkies they 're all riling up all the time .
The establishment Republicans do not want someone who is even slightly aligned with the Ron Paul wing to actually hold a precious Senate seat , because he might not be a reliable vote to support future President Mitt Romney 's war on Scandinavia .
Ron Paul wrote his list warning them that the dreaded " neo-conservatives " are fundraising against poor Rand .
Which is true !
This other guy , Grayson , he 's a nonentity .
Kentucky 's Senior Senator and fellow nonentity , Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , is hosting fundraisers for Grayson .
And to combat the power of the Tea Parties and Queen Sarah Palin , they 've brought in ..
Dick Cheney .
Grayson 's entire campaign is organized around calling Rand Paul 's ideas " strange " and strongly implying that he is crazy .
( Libertarians get no respect from anyone !
This is why they all wear leather jackets and smoke cigarettes and complain about Che t- shirts while they ride around on the public transit in the major metropolitan cities they live in . )
One of Dick Cheney 's scary henchmen elaborates on the Cheney endorsement in The Corner , writing that Rand Paul has " strange and troubling positions " on things like our having invaded Iraq for no fucking reason .
What 's fun is that this is Kentucky .
Being an actual crazy person is hardly a bar to holding public office .
If the Republicans had n't basically forced him out , Jim Bunning probably woulda gotten reelected this year , and that man has pretty much lost his mind .
A rabid dog , fresh from biting an adorable little girl in a princess dress , could probably win a state - wide election in Kentucky , as long as it was pro-life .
But Rand Paul 's occasional statments about " closing Guantanamo " might actually put him outside the mainstream there .
So for the good of America we should hope that the Tea Partiers push Rand over the top — because then either the GOP loses the safest Senate seat they have or they end up keeping it with a guy who they can't fucking stand .
NetDevil has nailed the LEGO feeling in its upcoming MMO LEGO Universe — you can tell from the character creation screen .
You start with a minifig , and you get to choose the eyes , the mouth , different arms , and illustrations on the chest .
As you move the pieces around , the arms and legs flail .
In the screen where you choose which character to play , the other minifigs look hopeful , although they sometimes swat at the cursor .
When you choose one to play , he or she celebrates , and the rest kick the ground , dejected .
" Everything is moderated , " I 'm told as we put our name in .
We 'll have a generic name until the name is given the thumbs up .
The game is aimed at young boys , " but like LEGO itself , we 're really shooting for kids of all ages , " the representative outside the booth tells me .
I begin to lope around the world with my newly created character , building things .
In a game about Lego bricks , who exactly is the bad guy ?
It 's all a matter of imagination
Each character is filled with a " creative spark , " and enemies that are fought and defeated break down into their parts .
There is no blood , and certainly no death .
The LEGO body is just a vessel for that spark ... it 's all oddly spiritual .
The world is being taken over by chaos , and it's your job to fight this dark force back by using your imagination .
By defeating enemies and creating things throughout the in - game world , you increase the power of your imagination and fight the chaos .
The more you work together with other people , the more imagination you spread .
It sounds very similar to The Neverending Story , but there are certainly worse stories to take your cues from .
You 'll see the major themes from LEGO in the game .
Space , Pirates , Medieval , and of course parrots .
Your minifig character gains powers by picking up accessories such as swords .
The land is filled with charming details : LEGO animals roam the terrain , you can unlock more imagination by exploring .
Shoot one of the torches with a squirt gun and see what happens .
Bring the banana to a monkey .
Build a bridge and get to a new level .
Build a race car and challenge others to a race .
The idea of freedom and character absolutely fills the game .
You can do a quick - create sort of thing to build bridges and other small details , while larger models such as cars and spaceships are modular — you can pick from different choices for each section to make it feel like your own .
Then , as you earn bricks in your travels , you can also build things from scratch and put them into your own little world .
The game is filled with tens of thousands of different types of bricks , spanning every theme and offshoot of the world .
In fact , before an object could be included in the game , it had to be built , in the real world , using actual bricks .
The original models from the game were on display in the booth , to show the early stage of design .
The devil is in the details
The LEGO MMO is clearly aimed at children , but it 's impossible not to want to play this .
The other minifigs wave , dance , and fight .
The game is filled with minigames , and you 'll be rewarded by solving puzzles and taking quests given by the NPCs with a group of friends .
The ability to build anything out of the bricks you collect means you can make the LEGO world you always wanted but never had the space for .
What drew me in was the different approaches you can take while playing .
You can focus on earning bricks and building objects to play with , and in fact there is a programming language built into the game so that you can build an animal and tell it how to react .
One of the developers had a mushroom garden on a hill , and with a few clicks made them hop when players walked through .
An elephant was built and taught to patrol a spire .
You can focus on the minigames , such as the racing or the shooting challenges .
Or , you can play the game as a straight platformer , taking challenges and fighting the chaos .
The sweet spot is probably a combination of all three , and the game makes you feel like you 're putting your mark on the world .
It was fun to add a flintlock pistol and parrot to a character , and then watch everyone else dance a pirate jig .
You 'll also deal with pirate 's worst enemy : the ninja .
New areas and pets will be added , and we asked if any of the licensed sets will be seen in the game .
" Not at launch , " was the answer , but that leaves a lot of room for the future .
The game we saw already looked amazing , but the ability to travel to a Star Wars world and fly an X - Wing would make a great paid expansion .
The game is a boxed product with a subscription fee , although you 'll also be able to buy it online and download the client directly .
The pricing information is still in the air , as is the release date , although we 're told it 's coming this year .
Play feels like the current LEGO video games , simply taking place in the online world .
So far though , NetDevil has nailed the feel and the charm of LEGO with a game that gives players as much freedom as they 'd like , while also delivering a " game " inside the experience .
We can't wait .

It ’s just that Catholicism has been syncretized with African beliefs , customs and rituals .
Well ,
Pat will have none of it –that African stuff is all devil worship to him and to hell with ya .
Cursed forever for Toussaint L’Ouverture ’s effrontery of being a black general who defeated white European armies , which he obviously could never have done if he had n’t sold his soul to the devil .
Why else would Haiti be so poor when the other half of the island of Hispaniola , the Dominican Republic , is so prosperous and stable –we ’ll never mind the century or so of political upheavals the Dominican Republic suffered before the present calm .
It ’s obviously the fault of all that Voodoo–and dancing –which makes their misfortunes their own fault .
God is merely punishing them like a father a naughty child , because a father loves his children , even when giving them the buckle end of the belt .
After all , as St. John said , God is love .
And in Pat Robertson ’s view , God just loved those Haitians to death !
I ’m so glad Pat Robertson is n’t God… ANNOY YOUR FRIENDS !
CONFOUND YOUR ENEMIES !

You can depend on Pat Robertson –he ALWAYS gives Christianity a bad name .
Every time there ’s a terrible catastrophe somewhere in the world , he can find a reason to blame it on somebody else ’s sinfulness .
And gloats over his own good fortune and religious superiority .
Now take this earthquake in Haiti .
Terrible tragedy , death and destruction everywhere , at least 100,000 dead .
You ’d think a catastrophe of this magnitude would call for a little Christian kindness .
Not from Pat !
He hauls out this story –which as far as I know , he made up–about some Haitian selling his soul to the devil for independence–and that ’s why they ’ve suffered poverty and famine and unstable governments and now this devastation .
Well , Pat , the guy you ’re thinking about had a name , Toussaint L’Ouverture .
He led a rebellion for Haitian independence and managed to defeat every army sent at him .
He was also black .
Now , I do n’t want to accuse Pat of racism , I think he ’s more of a religious bigot .
You see , Haiti is the homeplace of Vodou , or as we more commonly spell it , Voodoo .
Pat has this Hollywood idea of Voodoo consisting of zombies , dolls with pins in them , devil worshipping and worst of all , dancing .
If Toussaint L’Ouverture had not sold his soul to the devil , there ’d be none of that deviltry going on !
Haitians would all go to church on Sunday , sing hymns , listen to some preacher for about 4 hours and become prosperous and Protestant .
As it is , most Haitians are Catholic–they ’re also devotees of Vodou and do n’t see a contradiction in this .
After all , they both worship

Figure skating presents it own challenges when shooting the event .
Preparation when the skaters take to the ice to warm up is valuable to us " learning " the routine , it gives us the insight to where the major jumps are .
The rule of thumb is that where there is a jump there will be a , how to put this in a way not to offend all the skating fans , well , a goofy face , that rule also applies to spins .
Canadian Vaughn Chipeur competes during the Men's Free Skating long program at the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games
The skaters cannot help it , we all remember that black and white NASA footage of astronauts in that big centrifuge , the face can do some weird things .
I would love to get into the physics of skating spins and jumps , but inertia , gravitational pull , velocity , etc , are all things that I do n't really understand .
What I do understand is that these guys can jump !
These guys can spin !
There was controversy when Torino Gold Medalist Evgeni Plushenko said that Evan Lysacek could not be considered " a true men 's champion without a quad . "
A friend of mine , Ken Mueller , a former skater and teaches now says that he recalls reading about Kurt Browning 's quad , the first ever in competition , that his quad lasts about seven tenths of a second , which translates to almost 350 rpm .
Wow !
It is also estimated that a skaters arms may experience 4
Gs of force in a spin or jump .
Some skaters might get almost a metre off of the ice !
No wonder their faces get a little goofy , the effort of the jump with battling the G - forces and effects of the spin , there is no way they can control it .
Italian Paolo Bacchini performs a hair raising spin
Hair and chains flying Artem Borodulin from Russia spins
Takahiko Kozuka of Japan has the Thriller look
Denis Ten of Kazakhstan shows amazing flexibility .

Evan Lysacek 's hair product cannot contain the G - forces of his spin to win gold .
How Oba Nobunari of Japan can do this is just incredible .
Swiss Stephane Lanbiel has another hair raising spin !
Spins give Johnny Weir an Edward Scissor Hands look .
Maybe because he does so many jumps , Evgeni Plushenko's face shows little effort or effects .

It can get unnerving when you keep getting phone calls from numbers that do not register on your phone .
Sometimes these calls come at regular intervals ; at other times they disturb your restful sleep or jar you at odd hours of the day .
Most of these are prank calls and it would put your mind at ease if you had some information on the origin of the calls .
Now , find out exactly who is calling you , with the use of reverse lookup technology .
At FindWithPhoneNumber .
com , all you need to do is type in the complete phone number , including the area code , and you can get a phone number name , address , public records ( if any ) and the phone 's carrier ( Alltel , AT&T , T - Mobile , Sprint or Verizon ) .
I was a bit skeptical about this service at first but when I kept getting calls from this one particular number , I decided to try out the service of FindWithPhoneNumber.com .
I just typed in the area code and the number and in a matter of seconds , a screen showed me the name , address , type of phone ( it was a landline ) , and phone carrier of the number calling me .
It even showed me a close - up street map identifying the general area where the phone number was registered .
I called back the number and told the guy who answered that I knew exactly where he was .

Jewish World Review March 24 , 2010 / 9 Nissan 5770 Constitutional awakening By Walter Williams
http://www.JewishWorldReview.com |
If there is anything good to say about Democrat control of the White House , Senate and House of Representatives , it 's that their extraordinarily brazen , heavy - handed acts have aroused a level of constitutional interest among the American people that has been dormant for far too long .
Part of this heightened interest is seen in the strength of the tea party movement around the nation .
Another is the angry reception that many congressmen received at their district town hall meetings .
Yet another is seen by the exchanges on the nation 's most popular radio talk shows such as Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity , Mark Levin and others .
Then there 's the rising popularity of conservative / libertarian television shows such as Glenn Beck , John Stossel and Fox News .
While the odds on favorite is that the Republicans will do well in the fall elections , Americans who want constitutional government should not see Republican control as a solution to what our founders would have called " a long train of abuses and usurpations . "
Solutions to our nation 's problems require correct diagnostics and answers to questions like :
Why did 2008 presidential and congressional candidates spend over $ 5 billion campaigning for office ?
Why did special interests pay Washington lobbyists over $ 3 billion that same year ?
What are reasons why corporations , unions and other interest groups fork over these billions of dollars to lobbyists and into the campaign coffers of politicians ?
One might say that these groups are simply extraordinarily civic - minded Americans who have a deep and abiding interest in elected officials living up to their oath of office to uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution .
Another response is these politicians , and the people who spend billions of dollars on them , just love participating in the political process .
If you believe either of these explanations , you 're probably a candidate for some medicine , a straitjacket and a padded cell .
A far better explanation for the billions going to the campaign coffers of Washington politicians and lobbyist lies in the awesome government power and control over business , property , employment and other areas of our lives .
Having such power , Washington politicians are in the position to grant favors and commit acts that if committed by a private person would land him in jail .
Here 's one among thousands of examples : Incandescent light bulbs are far more convenient and less expensive than compact fluorescent bulbs ( CFL ) that General Electric now produces .
So how can General Electric sell its costly CFLs ?
They know that Congress has the power to outlaw incandescent light bulbs .
General Electric was the prominent lobbyist for outlawing incandescent light bulbs and in 2008 had a $ 20 million lobbying budget .
Also , it should come as no surprise that General Electric is a contributor to global warmers who help convince Congress that incandescent bulbs were destroying the planet .
The greater Congress ' ability to grant favors and take one American 's earnings to give to another American , the greater the value of influencing congressional decision - making .
There 's no better influence than money .
The generic favor sought is to get Congress , under one ruse or another , to grant a privilege or right to one group of Americans that will be denied another group of Americans .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi covering up for a corrupt Ways and Means Committee Chairman , Charles Rangel , said that while his behavior " was a violation of the rules of the House .
It was not something that jeopardized our country in any way . "
Pelosi is right in minimizing Rangel 's corruption .
It pales in comparison , in terms of harm to our nation , to the legalized corruption that 's a part of Washington 's daily dealing .
Hopefully , our nation 's constitutional reawaking will begin to deliver us from the precipice .
There is no constitutional authority for two - thirds to three - quarters of what Congress does .
Our constitution 's father , James Madison , explained , " The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government , are few and defined … ( to be ) exercised principally on external objects , as war , peace , negotiation , and foreign commerce . "

March 25 , 2010  --
They battle with bulky baggage every day and now flight attendants are fighting back against what they 're calling the " carry - on crunch . "
Passengers are hauling bigger bags into airplane cabins and trying to stuff them into overhead bins .
The Association of Flight Attendants says the carry - on bag binge is out of control .
The group surveyed its members and found that 80 percent of flight attendants have reported cuts , bruises , sprains and strains as a result of dealing with items in the overhead bins .
They say it 's a safety threat to both flight attendants and passengers .
Just over the past two months , the survey found that half of all flight attendants witnessed a carry - on item fall out of the bins , sometimes injuring passengers .
" As the plane was taking off the bin opened up and out of the bin a bottle of liquor fell , landed , and hit an unsuspecting man in the head , " Rene Foss , spokesperson for the AFA told " Good Morning America . "
" He was injured and we had to give him first aid . "
Foss and fellow flight attendant Bill McGlashen said they 've seen it all , from a carry - on toilet to a home brewing kit for beer .
" We 've had stories from senators , U.S. senators who have been traveling , who have been hit on the head , " McGlashen said .
AFA President : Establish Reasonable Carry - On Limits
The AFA is lobbying the government to pass a bill before Congress that would make a universal maximum size for all carry - on bags .
" We now have compelling evidence that flight attendants and passengers are being injured by excess amounts of oversized carry - on items , " Patricia Friend , AFA - CWA International President said on the group 's Web site .
" AFA - CWA has been urging Congress , government agencies , and carriers to establish reasonable carry - on limitations that will improve the overall safety , health and security of crew and passengers inside the aircraft cabin . "
The group also launched a Web site called End Carry - On Crunch to encourage passengers to support the legislation .
According to Travelocity senior editor Genevieve Shaw Brown , it may take some time for travelers to adjust to such a restriction .
" I think it would benefit the flight attendant and passengers in the long run if there was one uniform size limit , " Brown said .
" The trouble is , in the short run , a lot of travelers are going to find themselves with carry ons that are too big , and they 'll have to get smaller ones . "

In the 1930s , with property tax revenues shrinking because of the Great Depression , states began taxing the sales of items .
It was simple , and at the time , the tax matched an economy largely based on goods .
But as the nation ’s economy shifted to one focused more on services , the tax system mostly did not budge .
And so , in 2009 , states raised $ 230 billion in sales taxes ; had they taxed all services , too , according to Joseph Henchman of the Tax Foundation , a nonpartisan research group , they might have raised twice that .
Advocates say taxing services is simply a matter of fairness and good sense , and of spreading out the tax burden as widely as imaginable .
If you pay tax for a ring , why should you be exempt from paying it for a manicure ?
But even those who agree in principle wrestle with the details .
Should a bakery be taxed for the accounting work or lawn care it gets , only to pass along that cost to its customers in the price of cookies ?
Some in the world of taxes would describe that as pyramiding .
And what to do about all the industries that would , naturally , line up for exemptions ?
“ In truth , a lot of people like this concept of being taxed on what they use , ” said Bill Farmer , a Republican state representative in Kentucky , who has suggested a tax on services if it was wed to the demise of the state ’s income tax .
“ Then they say , ‘ But please do n’t tax me because I ’m a lawyer . ’
Or ‘ But please do n’t tax me because I ’m a grass cutter , an accountant , anything . ’ ” ( Mr. Farmer , for the record , is a tax accountant . )
In years past , large plans to tax services have become law , only to face sudden , sometimes embarrassing repeals in places like Florida and Maryland .
In Michigan , lawmakers agreed in 2007 to a tax on services ( in an episode Mr. Fowler recalls as “ a last minute , midnight deal ” ) , only to repeal it amid widespread public opposition the very day it went into effect .
Supporters say the new plan in Michigan , put forth by Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm , a Democrat , would solve some of the earlier complaints .
In addition to adding more than 100 types of services to the 26 the state already taxes , she says she wants to lower the sales tax rate to 5.5 percent from the current 6 percent , phase out a surcharge on a business tax and direct savings to education .
Ultimately , says Robert J. Kleine , the Michigan treasurer , the tax on services would mean $ 1.8 billion a year in new revenue .

In some places , marriage to the first cousin is illegal – in others it is advised !
Through history there have been many famous people who , for reasons known only to them , have married within the family .
This is a list of 10 of the most famous people who have done this .
10 Jesse James

Hundreds of thousands of revelers welcomed the new year in New York City ’s Times Square , despite the rain , slushy streets and heightened security , capping worldwide celebrations that often emphasized the hopes for a more peaceful tomorrow .
The poor weather and tight security could not dampen the otherwise festive mood in midtown Manhattan , where the cast of the Broadway show “ Hair ” was among the acts to perform .
People wearing oversized 2010 glasses rushed to grab hats proclaiming “ Happy New Year ” that were tossed into the crowd .
But the mood of the times was perhaps best embodied by the famous ball that dropped at midnight in Times Square - which was “ more energy efficient than ever before , ” organizers boasted , with its 32,256 Philips Luxeon Rebel LEDs and covered in 2,688 Waterford crystals .
The celebration followed spirited festivities elsewhere .
In Rio De Janeiro , Brazil , about 2 million people , most of them dressed in traditional white , gathered at Copacabana Beach .
In Hyderabad , Pakistan , the street was dotted with little white lights , emanating from candles that peace marchers were holding .
In Venice , a high tide that flooded low - lying parts of the city , including St. Mark ’s Square , coincided with the midnight celebration .

And in the United States , the attention naturally was focused on Times Square .
" Coming here is a dream that many people have , " said Francisca Lopez , 47 , a tourist from Mexico , as she waved a noisemaker in the air .
She had staked out a coveted spot on Broadway between 46th and 47th streets with her teenage son and daughter .
" This is the first year that we ’re living it . "
Tuttosport made its point loud and clear .
" You should be ashamed , " read the oversized banner stretched across the front of the Turin - based newspaper 's website this morning and the paper and ink version was no more forgiving in the wake of last night 's 4 - 1 defeat at Fulham .
" A total flop , " read the front - page headline .
Just below that was a leader piece written by the editor , Paolo de Paola , titled " Those who have failed must pay " .
" This is the last station .
The end of the line , " writes De Paola .
" Juventus 's year has been a total flop in which the ownership , club and team are all implicated .
All of them .
Reacting to the situation and working to find the solution is now obligatory .
The ship is full of leaks : every sector needs to be looked at because in every one there is disfunction and holes . "
De Paola 's list of grievances is long – from the club 's failure to appoint a permanent president ( " because we all know very well that the role is only temporarily being filled by Jean - Claude Blanc ) to the appointment of such an inexperienced manager as Ciro Ferrara at the beginning of the season .
Either way his focus was squarely on Juventus 's failings rather than Fulham 's achievements .
As , indeed , were most of the rest of the Italian press .
" Europa League nightmare , Juve choose suicide , " was the headline in Il Giornale and the universal sentiment was that the Italian side 's wounds were entirely self - inflicted .
There was universal agreement that the penalty award had been harsh but even then many pointed out that Fabio Cannavaro might have given away another before he saw red .
" Juve did everything they could to throw away qualification to the quarter - finals and , in the end , they managed it , " wrote Riccardo Signori in Il Giornale .
In La Repubblica Fabrizio Bocca took up a common theme by insisting that Fulham were " certainly not a club of the very top level " , while La Gazzetta dello Sport 's writers described Roy Hodgson 's side on numerous occasions as " modest " .
Just as Inter 's win over Chelsea had been held up as a triumph for all of Italy to celebrate , so this defeat was seen as a savage blow to the whole country 's pride .
" Slapped down by Fulham , a result that hurts very , very much , " wrote Bocca in La Repubblica .
" Not only for Juventus , but for all of Italian football : which not only loses precious Uefa coefficient points , but is quite simply humiliated .
This was a worse showing even than the 4 - 0 defeat of Milan at Old Trafford .
There , at least , the opponent was a great Manchester United . "
Gazzetta 's Alessandro de Calò , meanwhile , was keen to consider the implications for the national side this summer in South Africa .
" The unknown Bobby Zamora provoked [ Fabio Cannavaro ] with his words before the game , causing the Italy captain 's blood to boil .
We were expecting a reaction filled with pride , a great match worthy of a Ballon d'Or winner and at the levels of the last World Cup .
Sadly , Cannavaro opened the way for the English with first a slip to gift Fulham 's first to Zamora , then his red card .
" The question becomes a national one because Cannavaro 's flop looks like a metaphor for what could happen in South Africa to the glorious " old- fashioned " group which remains tied to [ the Italy coach ] Marcello Lippi . "
Only in the player ratings was there any real discussion of Fulham 's players , with Gazzetta 's Francesco Bramardo naming Zoltan Gera as man of the match , but saving his kindest words for Zamora .
" He tried everything he could think of , he turned defenders ' heads and he found the equaliser , " says Bramardo .
" He also had a hand in Gera 's first .
Not by chance is he the team 's top scorer . "
One of my pet peeves in the climate debate is how some folks will immediately describe differences in opinion or interpretation to the fact that someone is lying .
I wanted to show an example of how reasonable people can disagree from the same data set .
This is from a paper written by Vincent Gray ( spsl3 ) in response to an analysis of South Seas sea levels in a series of SEAFRAME reports here .
Mr. Gray believes the authors of the reports have exaggerated sea level rise , and I am sympathetic to his analysis , but I really wanted to show how multiple people can draw different conclusions from the same data .
To begin , lets take the sea level data for Tuvalu from here .
We will graph the raw data , and use Excel to plot a least squares linear fit ( the scale on the left is in meters )
The trend we get is about 5.2 mm per year of sea level rise — the actual study Gray is commenting on shows 6 mm per year , but its data only went through 2008 .
The most noticeable feature on this chart is the depression in 1998 , which Gray attributes to the super strong el Nino of that year .
So , I first took this anomalous data out by pasting in data for that period from a previous period ( with the months synchronized )
OK , this cut the sea level trend in half , to 2.7 mm a year .
Of course , this kind of data fill - in leaves much to be desired .
It was simply an experiment on my part .
I think a better test is to look at the trend since this anomalous event
The trend since the 1998 el Nino has been 0.6 mm a year .
So , from the same data , we can reach trends that are an order of magnitude different , from 0.6 mm to 5.4 mm .
I think the original authors of the study were remiss in not doing more sensitivity analysis , and it would be an interesting test to see if presented with such an anomaly that reduced rather than increased the trend , whether they would have handled it the same way .
Never - the - less , I hope you can see why even reasonable people can draw different conclusions from the same data set .
Thanks to a reader for sending me the original link .
To observe the moribund Democrats and gleeful Republicans last week in the wake of Scott Brown 's Massachusetts miracle , one would think that the number of Democrats in the Senate had already dipped to 49 , rather than 59 .
And that 's actually not too far off base .
As the Village Voice put it : " Scott Brown Wins Mass .
Race , Giving GOP 41 - 59 Majority in the Senate . "
Or as a friend quipped , 60 is the new 50 .
That 's because of the filibuster , which allows 41 members to prevent a final vote on almost any piece of legislation .
Mere majority support is insufficient to pass a bill ; you must have a supermajority .
Contemporary politics and recollections of famous past filibusters — whether the heroic Jimmy Stewart in 1939's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington or the villainous Strom Thurmond in 1957 's civil rights debate — would lead one to believe that this was always the case .
But that is not so .
In fact , the use of the filibuster has undergone a radical shift , from protecting the party out of power to creating a tyranny of the minority .
According to Barbara Sinclair , a political scientist at UCLA who has tabulated such statistics , there was an average of one filibuster per Congress during the 1950s .
These were the Mr. Smith - and Strom - style filibusters of popular imagination : a lone senator or small group tying up the floor , talking endlessly .
And they bear little resemblance to the modern filibuster , which is all talk or no talk at all , depending upon how you view it .
That 's because in 1964 , the Senate adopted a two - track method of debating legislation .
Instead of the chamber grinding to a halt during a filibuster , other work could go on .
And then in 1975 , the threshold for breaking a filibuster was lowered from 67 to 60 votes .
Filibusters became both less disruptive and more easily managed , and by the mid-1980s , there were almost 17 per Congress .
Filibustering took on a new definition .
No longer was it talking a bill to death ; it was merely an inability to muster 60 votes to end debate .
Then the practice really took off .
By the time Bill Clinton entered office , party leaders had realized that it could be used as a partisan political tool , and filibustering legislation became commonplace .
" Republicans kind of realized that they can make a really concerted use of extended debate to deprive Democrats of victories , " Sinclair says .
The election of 1994 only reinforced the strategy of no .
Why help the majority pass legislation when you can stall until voters , frustrated with gridlock , throw the other side out ?
Once out of power , Democrats went to school on the GOP delaying tactics .
The parties themselves were becoming ideologically homogenous as liberal GOPers and conservative Democrats disappeared .
Historically , the filibuster " was liberals versus conservatives , but never Democrats versus Republicans , " explains Donald Ritchie , the Senate historian .
By the end of George W. Bush 's second term , there were an astonishing 52 filibusters per Congress .
That 's a 52 - fold increase .
Or to slice the data a different way , 8 percent of major legislation in the 1960s was subjected to delaying tactics like filibusters , according to Sinclair .
By the last two years of Bush 's term , a mind - boggling 70 percent of major bills were subjected to such tactics .
The filibuster is out of control .
And it 's dangerous .
As President Obama argued in a year - end interview with PBS , " If used prudently , then I do n't think it 's harmful for democracy .
It 's not being used prudently right now . "
What to do about it ?
The options are unhappily slim .
Democrats could exercise the so - called nuclear option , changing the Senate rules to essentially ban the filibuster .
This is a non-starter .
Few senators would agree to such a diminishment of their individual power , and it would also be shortsighted .
Democrats will be out of power again and would miss the filibuster were it gone .
But perhaps the time has come to consider a shift from 60 votes to , say , 55 .
Another option is to take the filibuster old school .
Kill the two - track method , and force all - night talkathons again .
The problem , according to Ritchie , is that it 's self - defeating .
A small group of senators can sustain a filibuster in shifts , but because of parliamentary rules , all those trying to break it have to be on hand .
" Jimmy Stewart made it romantic , " Ritchie says , " but it actually does n't wear down Jimmy Stewart as much as all the other senators who have to be there . "
Maybe he 's right .
But maybe in a 24 - hour media environment , the spectacle of watching a GOP minority talking a popular piece of legislation to death would generate a public backlash .
The first step to reining back in the filibuster might just be public education :
Make people understand that it has gotten out of hand and is being abused .
" If this pattern continues , " the president told PBS , " you 're going to see an inability on the part of America to deal with big problems in a very competitive world .
...
We 're going to have to return to some sense that governance is more important than politics inside the Senate . "
He could repeat that message , beginning with the State of the Union address .
It may not be enough , but it 's a start .

House officials yesterday met with leaders of the atheist community to discuss their concerns about privileges given to religious groups by the government .
According to the Secular Coalition of America , the meeting was :
The first time in history that a presidential administration has met for a policy briefing with the American non-theist community .
The Â issues addressed , according to this report , included religiously based child abuse ; so - called faith - healing and religious child care being exempt from some health and safety laws ; the “ pervasive ” religious atmosphere in the military and ways in which troops “ with non-theistic views are made to feel unwelcome ” ; and faith - based initiatives .
Predictably , the meeting generated howls of fury from the fundie camp – even before it took place .
One ridiculous outfit , In God We Trust , issuedÂ a statement saying :
It is one thing for Administration to meet with groups of varying viewpoints , but it is quite another for a senior official to sit down with activists representing some of the most hate - filled , anti-religious groups in the nation .
IFWT chairman Bishop Council Nedd fulminated :
Tina Tchen , the director of the White House Office of Public Engagement , will meet with representatives from groups that comprise the Coalition .
The Coalition ’s sponsoring organization ’s include American Atheists , founded by Madalyn Murray O’Hair and the Freedom from Religion Foundation which is campaigning to stop the post office from issuing a stamp honoring Mother Teresa .
The posturing ninny with the improbable gnashers added :
President Obama seems to believe that it is a good idea to have a key senior aide plan political strategy with people who believe faith in God is a disease .
Some of the people in this coalition believe the world would be better off with no Christians and no Jews and they are n’t shy about it .
The fact that this meeting is happening at all is an affront to the vast majority of people of all faiths who believe in God .
And he quoted the Freedom from Religion Foundation ’s President Dan Barker as saying :
Christianity is an enemy to humanity , and the antithesis of freedom .
He also repeated Barker ’s claim that :
Religion also poses a danger to mental health , damaging self - respect , personal responsibility , and clarity of thought . ” ( Losing Faith in Faith Page 217 . )
Nedd added :
The President should tell the American people whether he believes these groups ’ hate - filled views to be â€˜mainstream ’ and worthy of his supposedly inclusive administration .
The White House has sought to downplay the meeting , with spokesman Shin Inouye saying :
The White House office of Public Engagement regularly meets with a wide - range of organizations and individuals on a diverse set of issues .
In God We Trust , by the way , is running a poll which asks “ Should Military Chaplains Be Allowed to Pray As They See Fit ? ”
It ’s not going the they way they would like , with over 74 percent saying they believe that the prayers of military chaplains should regulated by the government .

My terror at being shunted sideways along motorway at 60 mph by ' oblivious ' tanker driver
One moment , Rona Williams was driving along the motorway thinking about her forthcoming day at work as a vet .
The next , she was being shunted sideways at 60 mph , trapped beneath the front bumper of a tanker whose driver did not even notice she was there .
Her terrifying ordeal was captured on film by a passenger in another car on the A1 ( M ) near Leeds and has been viewed millions of times since it was posted on YouTube last week .
The terrifying ordeal was captured on film by a passenger in another car on the A1 ( M ) , near Leeds
The Mail has tracked down 31 - year - old Mrs Williams to her home in York , and she revealed her ordeal was just as terrifying as it looked .
As her Renault Clio was pushed along , she screamed : ' I 'm going to die , I 'm going to die . '
Mrs Williams had just joined the motorway ten minutes away from her surgery in Garforth when her car was apparently clipped by the lorry and ended up under its bumper .
' I just felt a knock and then I was travelling sideways – twisted 90 degrees clockwise , ' she said .
Rona Williams : ' I just felt a knock and then I was travelling sideways '
She yanked on her handbrake , sounded her horn and flashed her hazard lights , but to no avail .
' I kept thinking , " Nobody knows I 'm here .
Nobody has seen me " , ' she said .
' I tried everything .
I was watching other cars , thinking , " Help me , just help me " – but they did n't seem to be doing very much . '
Terrified the lorry was going to ram her into the crash barrier , Mrs Williams grabbed her mobile phone from her handbag .
' I was n't on hands - free , but I figured I was n't really driving the car , ' she said .
' I just screamed at the operator , " I 'm going to die , I 'm going to die !
Can you do something ? "
' She tried to calm me down but there was n't really anything she could do at the end of the phone . '
Mercifully , almost a minute after her ordeal had begun , the lorry driver apparently spotted her .
' Suddenly he was all over the road , ' she said .
' Finally he managed to manoeuvre us safely on to the hard shoulder . '
After she came to a stop she immediately phoned her husband Rob , 32 – also a vet – to tell him : ' You 're not going to believe what 's just happened . '
The footage has been viewed millions of times since it was posted on YouTube last week
The lorry driver opened her door and asked if she was all right .
' He did n't seem overly concerned , ' she said .
' He even asked if I thought he needed to hang around ! '
Mrs Williams said she politely suggested he did , and within minutes police had arrived and they swapped insurance details .

With the Mobile World Congress event making its way around the corner , we can all be for certain that it is inevitable for Windows Phone 7 to make its long awaited debut .
That being said , there have been rumours floating about on what Windows Phone 7 might actually be ?
For months , almost a year we have seen images being leaked all over the interwebs and although we can all admit we were quite excited , the chances of it looking so or even being real for that matter were highly unlikely .
Wait no more !
PPCGeeks has some truly amazing information on what the Windows Phone 7 platform will deliver to our beloved handheld devices .
All information detailed within may not be entirely official , although it is definitely the closest information we have heard on actually being real .
Without wasting anymore time , lets jump into the nitty gritty .
- At the Mobile World Congress event on February 15th , 2010 , Windows Phone 7 will be unveilved , although at this time plans are only to unveil the user interface of the new platform .
Specific indepth functionality of the device will most likely not be shown .
- The User Interface is based upon codename “ METRO ” .
It will be very similar to the Zune HD User Interface with a complete revamp of the “ Start ” screen .
The UI is “ Very Clean ” , “ Soulful ” and “ Alive ”
- Unfortunately there will be no Flash support at the get go as there was not enough time to implement these features .
- Windows Phone 7 will only support application installation through service based delivery .
( i.e Marketplace ) .
Application installation via storage card will not be possible .
– No Multi-Task support .
Applications will “ Pause ” when in the background , however will support notifications via push notifications .
- Marketplace will now support “ try before you buy ” as well as an API
- No NETCF backwards compatibility .
This means the original rumor of no backward compatibility for applications holds to be true .
That being said , there are high hopes of porting the NetCF to the newer platform easily .
- Microsoft is confident that devices will be ready by September 2010
- Full Zune Integration
- Windows Mobile Device Center will no longer be used .
Zune software to take over syncing via PC .
-OEM Interfaces will not be allowed to run on the device .

- Full support for social networking
There is a plethora of details to go through , although listed above are the biggest impact points of Windows Phone 7 .
Throughout the day we will be emerging more information as we delve deep into the depths of what might possibly be Windows Phone 7 .
This is a lot of information to consume in one shot and there could very well be the possibility of it being once again another rumor , although one thing stands true .
This is the most detailed promising information we ’ve seen to date in a while .
We will continue to update you as we find out more information .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
A new scientific study has found that at least some of the stereotypes associated with older siblings are true : the oldest sibling is often less trusting , less cooperative , and less reciprocating than younger siblings .
There has been a debate about the importance or otherwise of birth order for many decades , with some psychologists arguing youngest and oldest siblings receive more attention from parents than a middle - born child , leaving the one in the middle to seek attention outside the family , and hence becoming more social .
These speculations have been based largely on self - questionnaires and surveys of family and friends of the siblings , but researcher Alexandre Courtiol , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Montpellier 2 in France , wanted a more objective method of testing the hypothesis .
So Courtiol and colleagues invented an investment game .
The two - player game was played by 510 unrelated students .
Each player began with a pool of three Euros , with player A taking on the role of investor , and B playing the banker .
Player A could give any portion of the pool to the banker , who would then triple it .
Player B could then return any portion of the now much larger pool to the investor .
Since the banker was free to return little or nothing to the investor if he wished , the amount A gives to B is a measure of trust , and the amount B returns to A is a measure of reciprocity .
Each of the student volunteers was randomly assigned the part of player A or B and told they would not meet the other player .
To remove any influence of the random behavior of a real person , each of the players was actually unknowingly playing a fictitious opponent .
The results , which are published in the December issue of Animal Behavior , were analyzed in relation of the birth order of the student players , and the researchers found that for player A ( investor ) , the firstborns were less trusting than laterborns , and sent 25 % less money to the banker .
Firstborns who played the banker also reciprocated less , returning 22 - 29 % less to player A .
The results were also analyzed in relation to gender , income , and religious beliefs , but the research team found that birth order was the stronger factor .
One possible reason for firstborns being less trusting and less reciprocating than their younger siblings is that as new siblings arrive , they demand and receive more attention from the parents , and the firstborn has to compete for attention and may become less cooperative .
This explains the study 's other finding , that students who had no siblings behaved like laterborns , suggesting the behavior is a result of the arrival of later siblings rather than of being the firstborn .
Courtiol said the results must be regarded with caution since although birth order was found to be the stronger factor , it still explained less than 10 % of the variance in the behavior in the game .
The finding that laterborn siblings cooperate more than firstborns may explain why they tend to be bigger risk - takers , according to the University of California 's Frank Sulloway , an evolutionary psychologist .
Sulloway said that cooperation is often risky because it is not always reciprocated .
The study presents some of the first experimental evidence that birth order can continue to influence adult behavior , and is an important step in understanding the evolution of human cooperation and trust .

It is believed by some people that centuries old traditional Chinese medicine made from rhino horns have curative properties .
This demand , evidently , has caused the demise of thousands of Rhinos across the globe .
It has caused organized crime syndicates to become directly involved in poaching and created a billion dollar underground market .
However a team of scientist led by Dr. Raj Amin of the Zoological Society of London has scientifically proven via analysis , that rhino horn contains no medicinal value what so ever .
The video below explains his conclusions more in depth and how he also discovers identitive properties of rhino horn , which can trace the origins of where it came from .

BBC News , Mexico City
A Mexican church in the central city of Queretaro has opened a chapel in which exorcisms can take place .
There are no accurate figures for the number of exorcisms in Mexico .
But the Roman Catholic Church says that in Mexico City alone there are about 10 cases a month - and the phenomenon is on the rise .
Critics say that priests often mistake mental illness or epilepsy for signs of possession .
The new church will only treat people already seen by doctors .
Old traditions
Belief in possession and exorcism is common in a country where more than 90 % of the population is Catholic .
Nevertheless , Mexico now has a church where exorcisms can be performed : La Capilla de las Benditas Animas del Purgatorio .
Exorcism predates the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th Century .
Aztec healers burned herbs and prayed to eliminate the influence of bad spirits .
Nowadays the Roman Catholic Church follows the guidelines contained in a book published by the Vatican .
Signs of possession could be , for example , speaking in a foreign language that the person does not know , or being familiar with events that happened in far away places or in other times .
In a common exorcism , a priest performs a ceremony that includes sprinkling holy water over the possessed person and reciting prayers ordering the devil to depart .
Critics argue that priests commonly mistake mental illness such as schizophrenia or epilepsy and think instead they are confronting a demonic possession .
But one priest , Rogelio Cano , told the BBC that the new church will only accept cases that have been already been treated by doctors and psychiatrists .

Due to customer demand , IQ Option has recently introduced ADV Cash and AstroPay as accepted payment methods .
This further facilitates the incorporation of new operators to the platform .
How long do you want to maintain your trading position ?

Well , IQ Option offers various trading expiration periods that are highly dependent on the asset you are trading .
For example , binary options positions can be held for 1 minute or 5 minutes .

The company was founded in 2013 and is regulated by CySEC in Europe .
IQ Option is also licensed by the EEA .

Let ’s talk more about the account options at IQ Option .
The minimum deposit is $ 10 , which is great if you want to test the platform out before depositing more money .
Additionally , you can withdraw your money before investing a larger amount .
The minimum investment amount is $ 1 per trade while the maximum is $ 20,000 .
Deposits range from $ 10 , up to a maximum of $ 5,000 .
The deposit options offered are bank cards , MasterCard or Visa , e-wallet solutions , ADV Cash , AstroPay , and Skrill .
Deposits take a short time to process and will be reflected in your trading account .
In most cases , it will be instantaneous .
IQ Option introduced instant withdrawals in 2016 .

Withdrawals can only be made to the account you used for the deposit .
For withdrawals to be successful and quick , proof of identity will be required .
Therefore , make sure you have a fully verified account before making a withdrawal request .
Trading while on the go using your Smartphone is one thing that makes IQ Option stand out .
You can download their iOS or Android app for free and start trading instantly .
A great thing about these applications is that they continue to offer the same features that you will find in the browser - based or desktop application .
We recommend that you at least test the platform out with a free demo account .
Click on the link below , and try the free demo account to see the platform for yourself .
General Warning : your capital may be at risk .
IQ Option has done a lot to stand out from its competitors .
Its platform is very easy to use and interface navigation is very intuitive .
Accessibility is also a great advantage since the platform can be accessed through a web browser or a desktop / mobile application .
In an attempt to ensure user satisfaction , IQ Option has invested heavily in a rich collection of educational resources .
There are over 200 educational videos , real - time financial news , and detailed articles to help traders stay informed on the latest market trends .
We also liked the fact that you do not need to provide any personal information to open up a demo account .
Additionally , their selection of negotiable assets is enormous .
These include not only binaries , but also cryptocurrencies , ETFs , stocks , and commodities .
EEA retail traders cannot trade binary options on the platform .
However , they can still trade forex options that offer returns as high as binary options .
We find that this broker is primarily focused on investors who prefer short term trading .
The expiration terms on a trade normally expire at the end of the day , unless you establish a shorter term .
However , there is an end - of - month option , which is the longest that a trading position can hold .
This makes IQ Option an unattractive option for traders who want to hold long positions that span several months .
We have collected the information below to help you decide if IQ Option is for you .
The IQ Option website is well designed without much marketing clutter .
Opening an account is an easy process .
For the demo account , all you need to do is provide your name and your email account to gain access .
The real cash account requires that you send copies of identification documents .
After this is done , verification can take between 4 to 7 business days .
IQ Option has gone the extra mile to provide useful learning resources for traders .
More than 130 high - quality videos are hosted on the site .
These range from beginner training to more advanced trading topics .
Additionally , they provide a blog that provides real - time updated information about the markers .
There is also a detailed FAQ section where you can get answers to the most frequently asked questions .
Depositing money into your account is easy and IQ Option accepts various payment methods , including electronic wallet , credit card , and bank transfer .
New payment methods are always being considered and added to the platform .
Recently , they have added ADV Cash and AstroPay cards to their growing list of accepted payment methods .
The amount of time it will take your trading account to be credited will depend on the payment method you choose .
The minimum amount you can deposit is $ 10 , which is quite fair compared to competing brokers that require a minimum of $ 250 .
Depending on the instrument you are trading you may invest as little as $ 10 .
Withdrawing winnings is easy and you can request withdrawal to one of the payment methods mentioned above .
However , IQ Option will normally send withdrawals to the payment option you used when you deposited the money .
Card withdrawals have a higher priority , so it ’s worth considering using this option before opening a trading account .
The trading interface is well designed and you can access a variety of functions with a single click on the interface .
Speaking of charts and indicators , IQ Option continually updates them to suit different trading styles .
For example , the platform has recently introduced the Ichimoku Cloud , Belkhayate Timing , DPO and KDJ indicators .
Excellent customer service is a must for any decent broker .
IQ Option offers support through various ways , including phone , email , and recently they have added live chat which is the fastest way to get your questions answered .
You can also easily interact with other traders through the chat function which can be accessed directly from your trading account .
This is very useful when you are looking for useful tips that can lead to successful trades .
What about the effective returns on trades ?
IQ Option offers up to 92 % effective return on successful trades .
This is significantly higher than what many other brokers currently offer .
Trade expiration times are short - term , with quick trade options starting in 60 seconds and ending in 1 hour .
The maximum time a trade can maintain is 1 month .
Many of the complaints focused on price differences between actual market prices and strike prices on the platform .
Some traders have noted that what they received from a successful trade was significantly less than what they expected .
Such complaints could have motivated CySEC ’s action , as the regulator recently withdrew a fine it had imposed on the broker for “ not executing orders in the best possible way for its clients . ”
Another reason many traders complained is because of IQ Option withdrawals .
Most said their money was taking too long to reach their accounts .
However , IQ Option states that it may take up to 45 days for bank transfer withdrawals to reach your account .
Fortunately , they introduced instant withdrawals , which means merchants can now receive their money faster .
Instant withdrawals are not bank transfers and are available for all countries .
The site claims that 68 % of withdrawal requests are processed within 24 hours , which is higher than the industry average .
As previously recommended , you should carefully choose the payment method you use , as it will affect deposit and withdrawal times .
Many traders also praised the platform for its low $ 10 minimum deposit and other useful features .
Since CySEC withdrew the aforementioned fine , complaints seem to have decreased , which we consider a good sign that IQ Option is doing things right .
IQ Option excels when it comes to providing world - class customer service .
Their support team can be contacted in various ways , including Skype , phone , email , and chat .
They are very quick to answer customer questions .
There is also a chat feature on your account interface .
This allows you to chat with other traders and can be useful when you have a particular question that can be answered by a more experienced trader .
from December 9 , 2019 and onward , .
The calendar month is calculated from the first day of the month .
Each subsequent withdrawal will incur a commission .
The commission will be deducted from the balance of the commercial account and will be reflected at the time of withdrawal .
If the withdrawal is not successful , the commission amount will be credited to the account balance .
Depositing money into your real money account is very easy with the accepted payment methods .
These include electronic wallets , bank transfers , and credit cards .
The verification process below could be a bit shorter as it sometimes takes weeks for your account to be verified .
The minimum accepted deposit amount of $ 10 is also quite fair since some brokers require a minimum of more than $ 250 .
Withdrawing your winnings is also very easy .
However , IQ Option will only accept withdrawals made through the payment method you used to deposit money into your account .
( IQ Option does not offer any sign - up bonus .
It is a requirement of CySEC Europe . )
IQ Option has made great progress in offering many useful features to make trading easier for their customers .
Their collection of more than 200 different video tutorials makes it easy to start on the platform .
The demo account is also a nice addition and we like the fact that there is no time limit to use it .
Your merchant account gives you access to a variety of tools and features that make trading using your preferred pattern easy .
These tools include charts and indicators , most of which are not offered by many brokers .
Since launching in 2013 , IQ Option has become one of the fastest growing online binary options brokers .
Its huge selection of tradable assets , learning resources , and merchant - friendly features are just a few of the reasons its growth has been so rapid .
When we did our first IQ Option review , long withdrawal processing times , especially through wire transfers , was a major issue .
This was handled by introducing instant withdrawals where merchants now get their money faster .
The broker has also endeavored to introduce new financial instruments ( digital and currency options ) , higher leverage , more indicators , and other cool features to make your trading experience as smooth as possible .
These efforts have not been in vain , as the broker now monitors transactions of more than $ 380 million per month and average trader withdrawals of $ 10.8 million per month .
This shows that there are a good number of traders on this platform .
In general , if you are a beginner or experienced financial instrument trader looking for a trustworthy and fully regulated broker , IQ Option is worth considering .
General Warning : your capital may be at risk .
Yes , the company is regulated by CySEC .
( Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission ) in Europe , with the license number : 247/14 and is also authorized by the EEA ( Authorized Payment Institution ) .
IQ Option Europe is headquartered in Chipre and Yiannis Nicolaides Business Center , Agiou Athanasiou Avenue 33 , 4102 , Agios Athanasios , Limassol .
For both the demo account and the real money account , the maximum investment you can make in one trade is $ 20,000 .
In addition to complying with all regulatory requirements , IQ Option takes vigorous steps to ensure the security of their clients ’ personal and financial data .
All web traffic between the merchant ’s computer system and the IQ Option servers is encrypted using SSL technology to prevent any unauthorized access to your account .
No .
IQ option has its own designed platform and is not connected to the Meta Trader platform .
I have had a very good experience with “ Skrill Wallet ” .
With this deposit method , IQ option does not charge you any extra deposit or withdrawal fee .
Besides , signup and money transfer are done quickly and painlessly .
Click on the link below to “ Skrill Wallet ” and see for yourself 😉 Skrill Wallet is the best way to do it since IQ option does not charge you any extra deposit or withdrawal fee .
Also , this makes withdrawal possible in any quantity and goes very fast .
The last time I withdrew cash through skrill , the money was in my account within 12 to 24 hours .
( On working days ) Yes , the broker has built a great reputation over the years , has regulated status , and has won a large number of awards .
Also , IQ Option has been growing steadily judging by the number of withdrawals made each month .
In 2015 , merchants withdrew an average of $ 1.5 million a month .
This increased to over $ 10.8 million per month .
Additionally , they have been the official partner of Aston Martin Racing since 2017 .
IQ Option has truly shown that they can be trusted in the online trading world .
Unfortunately , the IQ Option platform cannot be used in the United States .
The reason for this is that they are not regulated by any authorities based out of the United States .
You can only change the currency of your account when making your initial deposit .
To do this , click on the “ Deposit ” button of your demo account .
Next , in the deposit window that appears , choose your preferred payment method .
Next , enter the amount .
Just to the left of the ‘ Amount ’ field is the ‘ Currency ’ field .
Click on it and choose the currency you want your account to feature .
According to a phone call with IQ Option : “ VIP accounts are no longer called that and their benefits are only available to a very limited number of merchants who meet certain conditions ” Opening a real IQ Option account is quite simple .
Just visit their main website – iqoption.com and open a demo account .
Next , click on the ‘ Deposit ’ button at the top right of your interface .
This will take you to the deposit window where you can choose the payment method and the amount to deposit .
Once you have made your deposit , it will take a few seconds to hours for your deposit to appear in your account .
You can now start trading with real money .
We recommend that you verify your account immediately after making your initial deposit .
This will make it easier to withdraw your earnings later on .
This broker is regulated by CySEC and can offer its services to citizens in most European countries .
They are also allowed in unregulated countries , mainly in Asia , Latin America , Africa , the Middle East , and New Zealand .
However , it is worth noting that some financial instruments are only available to traders in specific regions .
There are two main reasons why IQ Option does not allow you to deposit .
The first reason is that the payment method you chose is not compatible with the platform .
The easiest way to remedy this is to choose a supported payment method .
The second reason could be that you are opening an account from an unsupported country like the United States .
We recommend contacting customer service for further assistance .
IQ option CFDs allow you to speculate and trade based on the price movements of specific assets ( indexes , cryptocurrencies , and stocks ) .
Therefore , you are simply predicting whether the price of the underlying asset will rise or fall in a specific period .
Your goal is to capitalize on the difference between current and future prices .
With this in mind , there is no predetermined return like you ’ll find in binary options .
To trade currencies on the IQ Option platform , you will first need to choose the ‘ forex ’ option from the asset list .
Select the currency pair in which you want to trade .
Then choose the amount to invest , as well as the multiplier ( optional ) .
Next , apply your trading limits ( stop loss and take profit ) .
These allow you to limit losses and also lock in profits in the case that the markets reverse against you .
Next , select the direction in which you think the price of the currency pair will move to enter the position .
The only way to buy and sell Bitcoin on the IQ Option platform is through cryptocurrency CFDs .
You do not need to own Bitcoin here , rather , you will profit by speculating the token ’s price movements .
Your profits will be generated by calculating the price difference at the entry and exit of the operation .
To get started , follow these steps : IQ Option digital options are a relatively new instrument .
They allow you to obtain greater profits compared to binary options .
How ?
You can simply choose the strike price ( the price you expect the asset to reach ) and the period ( over which you will hold the previous position ) .
Once this is done , the platform automatically calculates your expected profit .
You can also exit a trade before maturity to secure profits or minimize losses .
IQ Option accepts various eWallets such as Neteller , Skrill , and WebMoney .
I would recommend Skrill due to the zero fees and fast processing times .
The IQ Option broker app is a specially designed software that runs on your smartphone or desktop computer .
It makes logging into your business account easier , faster , and more secure .
The application runs on Android , macOS , Windows , and iOS devices .
The IQ Option multiplier is a special feature that allows you to trade with “ borrowed ” money .
For example , if you are entering a trade by investing $ 100 , you can apply an X50 multiplier , which means that your investment is now $ 5000 .
If your trade is successful , you will earn 50 times more than if you simply traded at $ 100 .
This is simply a short form for cryptocurrency .
Cryptocurrencies are a form of virtual currency that is supported by blockchain technology .
Lately , they have become one of the most popular financial instruments among traders worldwide .
IQ Option currently offers 11 different cryptocurrencies available to trade .

And I 've never stopped being a cheerleader , " said Pat Blank , who lives in Shell Rock , according to the Des Moines Register .
" Even at 1:30 in the morning , someone needs to be here to welcome them home . "
The players ate it up .
Several signed autographs .
Others chatted with fans and joined in the " UNI , UNI " chants that rang throughout .
" This is awesome , " Northern Iowa coach Ben Jacobson said .
" It 's been a thrill . "
The Register reported that fans -- including one baby in a stroller -- started gathering at the airport around midnight .
" This is awesome , " Ali Farokhmanesh , who hit the game - clinching three - pointer in the final minute vs. Kansas , said .
" We talked on the plane that there might be a few people here , but we thought it might be a little too late and a little too cold . "
" They shocked the world , " said 12 - year - old Jack McDonough , a sixth grader at Sacred Heart school in Oelwein , Iowa .
" It was unbelievable . "

Scientists at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) , in Pasadena , California , announce that work has begun on repairing an iconic antenna of the American space agency .
Used for the past 40 years for keeping in touch , and keeping track with deep - space missions , including those on Mars , the famous equipment now needs to have some of its parts changed .
The modifications are not done willingly , but wear is beginning to hinder the good operation of the instrument , which is something that officials would have none of .
The scientific payload is situated at the Goldstone , California - based NASA Deep Space Network .
The Mars antenna is gigantic , featuring a 70 - meter ( 230 - foot ) dish .
It is used primarily for sending and receiving signals to and from orbiters , landers and weather stations on Mars , but it can contact other spacecrafts as well , if the need arises .
Now , a small portion of its hydrostatic bearing assembly needs fixing , and the task is a lot more expensive and complex than it would appear at first glance .
The assembly is absolutely crucial for the antenna 's ability to rotate horizontally .
“ This antenna has been a workhorse for NASA / JPL for over 40 years .
It has provided a critical lifeline to dozens of missions , while enabling scientific results that have enriched the hearts and minds of generations .
We want it to continue doing so , ” says JPL Deep Space Network Project Manager , Alaudin Bhanji .
He adds that the new repairs will last for about 20 years , and that they will cost abut $ 1.25 million .
There is some pretty tricky engineering in raising a weight of 4 million kilograms ( 9 million pounds ) by about 0.2 inches ( 5 centimeters ) , so that experts can change the necessary pieces .
“ As with any large , rotating structure that has operated almost 24 hours per day , seven days per week for over 40 years , we eventually have to replace major elements .
We need to replace those worn parts so we can get another 20 years of valuable service from this national treasure , ” says the JPL Deputy Project Manager for the network , Wayne Sible .
He highlights the fact that it was this antenna that captured Neil Armstrong 's famous message sent from the Moon , and which kept an eye on missions such as Pioneer , Cassini and the Mars Exploration Rovers ( MER ) .
All that stands in the way of accurate studies now is a degrading thin film of oil , which needs to be changed .
“ The runner replacement task has been in development for close to two years .
We 've been testing and evaluating modern epoxy grouts , which were unavailable when the antenna was built , updating the design of the runner and designing a replacement process that has to be performed without completely disassembling the antenna .
We 've had to make sure we 've reviewed it for practicality and safety , ” concludes antenna maintenance expert Peter Hames , also from the JPL .
" The world 's best footballer is an Argentinian who , in his own country , has less fans than a referee " says Claudio Mauri in La Nación .
The player is Lionel Messi and the article highlights issues raised by poor performances for his country , and his relationship with fans and national manager Diego Maradona .
Referencing other foreign - based players such as Carlos Tevez , Mauri points out that they have a domestic fan base : " All the players have fans in Argentina , except Messi , who left when he was 13 to pursue the footballing dream which he could not fulfil in his country .
" Gonzalo Higuaín was born in Brest , but no Argentinian fan would think of calling him ' The Frenchman ' , as they do with Messi when they provocatively call him ' The Catalan ' . "
It 's an antipathy that will not be overcome by merely performing better for the national side , says Mauri : " Messi could pay off this supposed debt if he comes to play for six months in this country ... proclaiming his happiness and refinding his roots . "
Messi's father , Jorge , responded , telling the channel TyC Sports : " What happens to him in the national team could happen to anyone .
It can be solved with work .
Maybe they treat him differently in Europe .
Here , we maltreat him and we batter him . "
Hernán Claus , of sports daily Olé , agrees : " Messi is right to feel maltreated because the criticism is not just about the way he plays for his national team .
Instead , they 've accused him of not knowing the national anthem , that he feels Spanish , that he does n't love the shirt ...
Instead of trying to help build a new idol , what we do is demolish him . "
But his colleague Adrian Piedrabuena believes it 's a problem that comes with the team and their manager : " Lionel has played for Argentina for four years and only shone when Juan Riquelme was playing .
It 's not his fault they compare him to Diego or that Argentina is not a team which plays to its potential . "
And it is misuse of potential that really matters ahead of the World Cup , as Maradona 's use of , and relationship with , Messi remains in doubt ( conspiracy theorists suggest he is sabotaging Messi 's career to maintain his position as the greatest ever Argentinian player ) .
The former Real manager Bernd Schuster tells Spain 's Marca : " Argentina have a problem if they can't make Messi play .
You can't afford the luxury of Messi not performing in a World Cup .
You have to adapt to him .
Argentina do n't know what to do with Messi .
They can still change but it 's going to be difficult for them . "

When John T. Flynn has put the Roosevelt myth through his terrible wringer and thrown aside the empty sack , all that remains of it is — the myth .
His book will not be challenged on grounds of fact .
He has a special way with facts .
He brings them together in piles like fissionable material , and then suddenly a pile explodes with atomic effect , even though there had been nothing new in the facts .
Many of them you already knew and had forgotten .
But the secret of a myth is no more explained by facts than the secret of life is explained by anatomy .
It may be that for good or bad the man of myth is an instrument , and if that is so , he would be unable to account for himself , or , trying to give reasons , would give wrong or puerile reasons , not knowing any better .
You get this idea as you read Flynn 's history of the thirteen Roosevelt years .
From backstage , the New Deal was an incredible confusion , unable , as Mr. Flynn thinks , to make sense even to itself ; and the man least competent to make sense of it was the president .
He was the juggler who made fascinating patterns in the air with glittering objects handed out to him from behind the scenes by visionaries , monomaniacs of economic theory , social reformers who found themselves suddenly in the land of a dream come true , disaffected intellectuals , sinister aliens , petted communists , and crackpots ; Henry Wallace , under whose evangel of abundance cotton was plowed under and little pigs were slaughtered ; Milo Perkins , who wanted a world he could lift and whose slogan was " Grab the Torch , " and Dr. Maurice Parmalee , who
had spent years drinking deep of the " new learning " in Europe and wrote a book called " Farewell to Poverty . "
Wallace and Perkins and Parmalee made a marvelous trio of musketeers as they figuratively strutted over this hemisphere arm - in - arm singing " Hello Plenty !
Here We Come ! " Parmalee wrote another book labeled Bolshevism , Fascism and the Liberal Democratic State .
In this he said : " The high technological development in the United States renders it feasible to introduce a planned social economy much more rapidly than has been the case in the U.S.S.R. ….
The superficial paraphernalia of capitalism can be dispensed with more quickly than in the Soviet Union . "
But the Doctor had strayed into much lighter fields of literature .
He had also written a book called Nudism in Modern Life which is secluded in the obscene section of the Library of Congress .
They were willing to try anything , and did try everything they could think of , but nothing really worked .
After five years , the bad - wolf depression was back again , deficit spending was no longer a magic solution because , for one reason , nobody could think of anything big enough to spend money for , and the New Deal was on the rocks .
On January 1 , 1938 , says Flynn , the president and Henry Morgenthau
sat down to a sad repast .
Roosevelt told him " the next two years do n't count — they are already water over the dam . "
Then he revealed the extent of his plans — they would have to step up spending , forget about balancing the budget and get along with a two or three billion dollar a year deficit for two years .
Then a conservative would come into office .
That administration would do what Roosevelt had been promising he would do — quit government spending .
And then the whole thing would go down in a big crash .
At that point they would have to yell for Roosevelt and Morgenthau to come back and get them out of the hole .
The amazing feature of this strange confidence , which Morgenthau has reported , is this : Roosevelt and Morgenthau were already in a hole — the kind of hole the next administration would be in .
Nobody had to call them in now — they were in .
And they had not the foggiest idea what to do about getting out of the hole they were in , except to spend .
Morgenthau concluded from this that Roosevelt had put out of his mind any thought of a third term .
It is possible that he had .
What saved the New Deal from confession of failure was first the defense program and then the war .
There was then something big enough to absorb astronomical deficit spending .
The attitude of the New Deal economists toward the defense program was upside down .
Their question was not " How much will it cost to create an adequate national defense ? "
The question they asked themselves was " What expenditure for national defense will increase the national income to $ 100 billions ? "
It was , therefore , inflation of the national income they were thinking of — not how to buy a maximum of defense at a minimum of cost .
But many of those who lived through the early years of the New Deal , especially the period known as " the one hundred days , " without surrendering control of their rational faculties , will feel that Mr. Flynn leaves something out , and that what is missing from his history is the key .
To this Mr. Flynn would undoubtedly say yes , and then explain that the key , it was a fact , could not be documented .
Even those who believe there was a key were never sure that Mr. Roosevelt was aware of its existence .
From the facts alone , as Mr. Flynn relates them , you might suppose that everything just happened ; that when Mr. Roosevelt was elected he had no idea what he was going to do , never thought through any of the things he did do , and that the story of the New Deal made itself up as it went along .
Events of revolutionary meaning took place , but they were happy and reckless inventions , launched in a spirit of experimental adventure , with no preconceived design and no thread of purpose at all .
Mr. Flynn says , for example , and it is undoubtedly true , that Mr. Roosevelt 's understanding of economics was immature and that monetary questions confused and bored him .
Everyone knew that .
Nevertheless a study of the New Deal 's monetary measures may lead one to a startling conclusion .
That conclusion may be stated as follows : if there had been a definite revolutionary purpose and if the way of bringing that purpose to pass had been thought out beforehand with extreme intelligence , everything would have happened just as it did .
Try putting down first the conditions .
The country was on a gold standard , banking was free , exchange was free , every man was free to do what he pleased with his gold to hoard it or to sell it or to take it out of the country .
All the gates stood open .
Then imagine the problem to be this : under these conditions given , how are you going to get control of all money , banking , and credit , in order not only to get your hands on the public purse , but to be able to use inflation as an instrument of social or revolutionary policy ?
The solution of that problem can be worked out with chesslike precision , provided you can get control of both the executive and legislative functions of government .
You will need this power for only a little while , because the edicts and laws you are going to use , if you know what they are , will be short and few .
In the name of emergency , the New Deal did get such control of government .
Edicts issued from the White House were validated by Congress afterward ; and Congress was willing to enact any law sent to it by the president , sometimes even without reading it .
But with all this political power you still cannot solve the problem unless you know how .
The solution requires certain definite steps in a certain sequence , as , for example , first to get physical possession of all the gold by a plausible pretext , then with the gold in your possession to confiscate it ; next to take control of foreign exchange and slam the gates , then to repudiate the gold standard , declare all gold contracts void on grounds of public policy , even the gold - redemption clause engraved on government bonds , and finally to introduce an unlimited , irredeemable paper currency and pass a law making any other kind of money illegal .
The sequence must be right .
That is imperative .
One step in the wrong order might be ruinous and certainly the wrong step first would be fatal .
Now the point is that each of these steps was taken in the right order , unerringly .
Could that have been accidental ?
Or was it easier to imagine that behind the facade of innocent trial and error a keen and purposeful intelligence was all the time acting ?
This was the clearest example that could be isolated .
Nevertheless it soon became evident to thoughtful observers that all the New Deal 's experiments , no matter how artless they might seem , had a certain bent .
The tendency was to change the philosophy of American government , within the law if possible , in contempt of law when necessary , as when the president wrote to the chairman of a House committee saying that a little thing like the Constitution ought not to stand in the way of a good intention for the public welfare .
The executive principle of government was daringly exalted .
Much lawmaking power was delegated to the executive power by a pliant Congress , and thus the rise of administrative law , controlled by administrative commissions , who acted as prosecutor , jury , and judge to enforce their own laws .
By this means , the hand of government began to be laid upon every economic activity of life .
The NRA was a failure ; the Blue Eagle was already sick before the Supreme Court had chopped off its head .
Yet the purpose was clear : the purpose was to create a kind of corporate state , not very unlike the Mussolini state , with all business in obedient submission to the paternal wisdom of government .
In a little while men who had been able to associate themselves with the New Deal by thinking of it not as a philosophy but as a dispensation for the emergency only , began to perceive through all its confusions the elements of design and became very uneasy about it .
One of these was Lewis W. Douglas , the first director of the budget , who visited Mr. Roosevelt in his bedroom one morning and said , " Mr. President , I do urge you to open your mind to the possibility that among the people surrounding you there is a kind of purpose you are not aware of . "
To this the president said , " Now you , too , Lew .
Are you beginning to see things ?
Who are they ?
Where do they hide ?
Do you want to look under the bed ? "
Another one was Senator Carter Glass who had been secretary of the Treasury and knew his monetary book .
He , too , began to believe there was a controlling design , audaciously conceived and moved by unusual intelligence , but neither he nor anyone else was ever able to identify the intelligence or say where it was seated .
The curious fact is that nobody imputed it to the president .
The latter part of Mr. Flynn 's book is the kind of history that induces postdated shudders .
The idol of a great myth in such a state of physical and mental decline that he had moments of blackout , bearing on paralyzed legs the weight of a world at war , is a figure of supreme tragedy ; and it was much more than personal tragedy because it involved the country in the unpredictable perils of a new and strange destiny .
Although people were dimly aware of the truth , its more painful aspects were concealed , and this , Mr. Flynn thinks , was wrong .
That has happened twice in our history , and each time with a world hero .
Mr. Flynn leaves one singular episode in a state of mystery .
When he was nominated for the last time , Mr. Roosevelt , by all intimate testimony , was aware that he might not live through another term .
Then why did he put Henry Wallace down the well ?
Wallace was the natural candidate for second place on the ticket .
All that weird and powerful motley on the Left , led by Sidney Hillman and including Browder 's demobilized communists , were for Wallace , and for him to the point of saying that there was no second choice .
Nevertheless , at the eleventh hour , still saying , " Clear everything with Sidney , " Mr. Roosevelt turned from Wallace to Truman .
That was perhaps the last of his unexplained acts on the domestic political scene ; and in view of the astonishing Truman performance in 1948 — that is , in the first election of post - Roosevelt time — it was what some might call a sign of premonition .
Otherwise the country would have had three and one half years of Wallace .
Mr. Flynn is no academic historian .
He is a reporter .
Reporting is history in the raw .
This is excellent reporting , by one who , besides penetrating insight , has a gift for dramatizing facts , not to omit a sense of humor .
One of Mr. Roosevelt 's " dainty intellectual pets , " he says , was Archibald MacLeish , the poet , who was made head of the Office of Facts and Figures .
He quotes from a MacLeish poem :
Who is the voyager on these coasts ?
Who is the traveler in these waters Expects the future as a shore ; foresees Like Indies to the west the ending — he The rumor of the surf intends .
Flynn then adds , " A man who writes poetry like that inevitably becomes a New Dealer , if not worse . "
Those who may allow for the fact that Mr. Flynn was born with a psychic mechanism guaranteed to protect him from all spells of human origin .
The Roosevelt spell repelled him violently .
FORT SILL — A Comanche County woman who prosecutors said used a 12 - year - old girl to lure Marines to sex parties has been sentenced to 10 years in prison .
Amy Marie Rivera , 34 , of Fletcher , was sentenced Thursday after she pleaded guilty to procuring a child for lewdness or other indecent acts , records show .
The victim lived with Rivera for two months before her June arrest .
Lance Cpl. Logan Bryan Combs , 20 , of Lawton ; Jordan Patrick Kinshella , 19 , of Maple Valley , Wash. , and Curtis Grant Dorton , 20 , of Twentynine Palms , Calif. , are charged with first - degree rape in connection with the case .
The Marines were stationed at Fort Sill .
Combs and Dorton are in jail on $ 30,000 and $ 25,000 bail , respectively , a Comanche County sheriff ’s office spokesman said Monday .
Kinshella is free on $ 25,000 bail .
The men are accused of assaulting the sixth - grade girl who accompanied Rivera to hotel parties where they participated in sex games and used alcohol and drugs , according to court records .
Combs told authorities at the time of his arrest he thought the girl was 17 and that " he did n’t even know her last name . ”
Rivera and the girl also engaged in " lesbian play acts ” for the Marines , kissing and slapping each other , county prosecutors said .
Rivera and the victim attended six to eight parties at Lawton hotels between March and June 2009 , court records state .
During that time the victim claimed to have engaged in sex with three Marines and kissed and touched others , all with Rivera ’s knowledge , records state .
Kinshella ’s preliminary hearing is set for Friday .
Dorton and Combs waived their rights to a jury trial and are waiting for a trial date , according to a spokeswoman in the district attorney ’s office .
The victim was placed in a shelter after Rivera was arrested .
In a statement released last year , authorities at Marine Corps headquarters in Quantico , Va. , said they were cooperating with law enforcement authorities .
This is a tried and tested , cheap as chips scrogging box that has n't failed me yet .
It also incorporates a simple hydroponics system .
Perfect for first time growers , growers on a budget and those who have little or no space to grow .
All of the materials are very cheap can be found in most decent hardware stores .
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Things you 'll need :
- Enough decent wood to build a very simple box to your space requirements .
- Heatproof Paint
- Reflective foil
- Plastic mesh ( not too narrow )
- 1 x 4 way power block ( small )
- 1 x 2 way power block ( small )
- 2 x mains plug timers ( 24 hr )
- 2 x Flourescent lighting tubes ( length as required )
- Flourescent light fitting for 2 tubes + Power supply ( ies ) and reflector
- 4 x 12 volt power supplies
- 8 x wire connectors
- 4 x large 12 v computer fans
- Various guttering ( see method )
- Plant pots with drainage holes
- Thermometer and Humidity dial
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
First of all , you 'll need to build this very simple box using wood and pannel pins , preferably with no
glue .
I have n't included dimensions in the diagrams as these can be built to your own space requirements .
The box is in 3 parts which fit together like this :
As you can see , the box is split round lower than the middle , and the front comes right off .
Screw or pin planks of wood round the inside rim of the LOWER part so that the top part fits
on snugly .
When doing the sides of this , make sure you do n't bring it all the way to the front of
the box .
When making the removable front " lid , " have a layer of wood on the inside of it with a smaller diameter ,
so the front part can fit snugly into the closed box .
To ensure further security of the front part , attach hook latches to the top and sides of the box ,
the kind that click in place .
alternatively you could use any latch or catch that would be suitable .
Roughly halfway up the top part of the box , use a hole drilling bit to drill 2 holes on each side , that
are the same diameter as the ducts of the computer fans .
Also drill 1 - 2 small holes on one side for the
lighting wires .
Next , paint all of the inside parts of the box with heatproof paint , and line with a layer of reflective
foil .
This includes the inside part of the front " lid . "
Construct a simple wooden frame that slides inside the box and rests on the inner pieces
of wood .
remember to make it a few inches shallower than the box so that the front can still fit on .
Cut a rectangle of plastic mesh the same size as the frame , and staple it to one side .
Now for the electronics !
The basic circuit I 'm using is shown below .
From one outlet , I have the 24hr timer , going to a 2 - way power block , with the flourescent tube fitting ( s )
plugged in .
From the other , I have the other 24 hr timer , going to a 4 - way power block .
in each plug is a 12 volt
power supply .
To power the fans , remove the tips of the 12v power supplies and strip a centimeter or so
of the wire covers .
Do the same with the computer fans , then for 2 of the fans , connect RED to POSITIVE ,
and BLACK to NEGATIVE using wire connectors like the ones shown .
for the other 2 , connect RED to NEGATIVE
and BLACK to POSITIVE .
If the polarities of the power supplies are unclear , make sure 2 of the fans are
rotating clockwise , and the other 2 anti - clockwise .
( check this with all the fans the same way up !)
* You could even use individual wire connectors .
Screw the fans over the holes you drilled for them , making sure that those of the same polarity are on the
same side .
This ensures unidirectional airflow and efficient ventilation .
Use rubber cement if needed to seal the rims of the fan ducts onto the box .
To keep things tidy , I like to screw the power blocks and any external power supplies etc. to the back of
the box .
wires can also be shortened and stapled to the outside of the box .
Make sure your screws are n't
going right through into the inside !
Now to attach the lights and fittings .
Depending on the lights and fittings you have , this will be done
differently .
I was lucky enough to find a reflector fitting with ceiling brackets , and 2 independently
powered tube fittings that fitted my box perfectly .
If you can't find one of these , attach your reflector
to the ceiling of the box with a little space in between for heat to dissipate , and fasion a block of
heatproof painted wood to fix the light fitting onto .
you 'll need to cut the wires leading to the tubes , leaving some length on the fitting side .
feed the wire (s )
through the small holes from the inside of the box to the outside .
reconnect the wires and tidy it all up .
* I 'm assuming you 're not an idiot and that you 're aware of the safety measures involved in this .
Be completely sure your electronics are safe before testing , and make sure no wires etc. are exposed .
Any exposed wire can be wrapped in electrical tape .
Coiled up power cables can generate alot of heat so avoid this .
I 've used this type of very basic hydroponics aparatus for years and it's always worked a treat .
As you can see in the diagram , all you need is some type of reservoir that 's deep enough to house
the rooting system of your plants , and can also have liquids easily added at one end and drained at the
other .
I 've used my hardware store 's own brand of guttering that 's literally as easy to assemble as lego .
In the diagram , there 's 2 T junctions joined with a connector , and capped at each end .
At one end , I 've attached an upward facing funnel with a cap .
this must rise above the water level .
At the other , a valve that allows me to drain all the water from the device .
* Anything you can build with the same theory , should , in theory , work .
You could even buy a home
hydroponics kit , or grow using more traditional methods .
More info can be found at the bottom .
If building your own hydroponics system , be sure to clean and rinse all the parts thoroughly , during
construction , and also between changing plants .
Make sure the method you choose does n't overly exceed the height of the bottom part of the box .
Use plant pots with alot of very small drainage holes .
The holes have to be small enough to house a
50/50 mixture of perlite and vermiculite ( available at garden centers ) without it escaping .
It also
helps if the pots can be housed nice and securely in the reservoir .
Now attach your growing apparatus to the bottom of the box .
I 've used the wall brackets included in
that specific range of guttering .
The inside of the finished article should look something like this :
If you need to raise the height of your mesh screen ( you 'll find out why in a bit ) , pieces of wood can
be attached with pins as shown , to the sides and back of the frame .
Once you find the right height , it has to be fixed into place , preferably temporarily , to the bottom part of the box .
You can
use more of the hook latches to do this .
Now affix a thermometer and a humidity dial to the inside of the box ( top part . )
Voila !
A quick , affordable scrogging solution .
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Theory :
The basic theory of scrogging ( Screen of Green ) is to force the plant to sprout more branches than usual from an early age ,
and train these soft young branches around the wire screen so they all grow horizontally .
( you might have to change the height of your screen to accomodate this . )
Then , when you start the flowering stage , you have a lush bed from which your buds can grow upward , utilising
horizontal aswel as vertical growing space .
The basic theory of hydroponics is growing your plant in mediums other than soil .
I use a 50/50 mixture
of perlite and vermiculite in my pots , with the water and nutrients flowing freely through the roots
and mixture .
I also use room temperature , sterilised water ( not cold , as this can shock the roots ) , and
specialised organic liquid fertilisers for hydroponics .
Be sure to drain and replace your water and
nutrients regularly .

Dati :
' The burka does not correspond to our values '
The former French justice minister , Rachida Dati , has condemned the wearing of the burka , saying that it " does not correspond " to European values .
Ms Dati , the first person of North African descent to serve in the French cabinet , is in the UK to visit the Justice Secretary Jack Straw 's Blackburn constituency .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
In a rare interview , she told Today programme reporter Zubeida Malik that " it 's important to remind what helps citizens live together and have a common destiny and living together and having a common destiny means having principles and values in common .
" And it 's true that the burka " - the wearing of which is now the subject of heated debate in France - " does not correspond neither to our values nor to our principles whether French or British and not even European .
So it is important to say no to this expression that is not a religious expression . "
President Sarkozy brought Dati into his cabinet in 2002 Ms Dati rejected suggestions that banning the burka and other face veils would make them more popular .
" We have to remember that often women who wear the burka are either doing it out of ignorance or others are motivated by an activism linked to the creation of a new identity , " she said .
" And to those for whom it represents the expression of an identity , it is important to say that in our countries there can't be any confrontation of identities .
There is one single identity based upon common values and principles shared by our countries . "
Rachida Dati was a lawyer when she was named as French justice minister by President Sarkozy in 2007 .
She was the first person of North African origin to hold a top government post in Paris .
Born in 1965 to a Moroccan mason father and an Algerian mother , Ms Dati was one of 12 children raised in humble circumstances .
Aged 16 , she started working as a carer in a private clinic , looking after her younger sisters and brothers after her mother 's death .
' Complicated private life '
But , working by day , learning by night , she gained degrees in both economics and law , and went on to work for various public and private companies - including a spell working as an accountant for French oil giant Elf .
In 1997 , Rachida Dati enrolled in the prestigious National College of Magistrates , where she studied for two years .
The ties with Nicolas Sarkozy that would eventually take her to the cabinet began in 2002 .
She wrote to the then freshly - appointed interior minister , expressing her desire to advise him on immigration - Mr Sarkozy accepted .
She went on to become a constant figure at his side , taking on the tough job of spokeswoman during his presidential campaign .
As his adviser , she played an important role in dealing with the delicate issue of integration .
Rachida Dati at work in the EU Parliament After the 2005 riots in the French suburbs , when Nicolas Sarkozy called the rioters - some of whom were of North African origin - " scum " , Ms Dati worked behind the scenes to limit the damage , as her boss stood accused of racism .
After becoming justice minister , she became a controversial figure , being accused of pushing legislation through without proper consultation .
Ms Dati defends Sarkozy 's " rainbow " government .
" He wanted gender parity in his government , with women at responsibility roles , which never happened before , and also with different backgrounds , different social conditions , and also different ages as he is very young also , " she says .
But , in 2009 , she quit the Sarkozy cabinet and successfully ran for the European Parliament .
Ms Dati had previously come under fire for returning to work just five days after giving birth .
A first - time mother , and single , she has kept the father 's identity under wraps , telling reporters she had " a complicated private life " and sparking an intense guessing game in the French press .

Abstract
Although humans usually prefer mates that resemble themselves , mating preferences can vary with context .
Stress has been shown to alter mating preferences in animals , but the effects of stress on human mating preferences are unknown .
Here , we investigated whether stress alters men's preference for self - resembling mates .
Participants first underwent a cold - pressor test ( stress induction ) or a control procedure .
Then , participants viewed either neutral pictures or pictures of erotic female nudes whose facial characteristics were computer - modified to resemble either the participant or another participant , or were not modified , while startle eyeblink responses were elicited by noise probes .
Erotic pictures were rated as being pleasant , and reduced startle magnitude compared with neutral pictures .
In the control group , startle magnitude was smaller during foreground presentation of photographs of self - resembling female nudes compared with other - resembling female nudes and non-manipulated female nudes , indicating a higher approach motivation to self - resembling mates .
In the stress group , startle magnitude was larger during foreground presentation of self - resembling female nudes compared with other - resembling female nudes and non-manipulated female nudes , indicating a higher approach motivation to dissimilar mates .
Our findings show that stress affects human mating preferences : unstressed individuals showed the expected preference for similar mates , but stressed individuals seem to prefer dissimilar mates .

Baboons , it seems , prefer pinot noir .
They also like a nice chardonnay .
Largely undeterred by electric fences , hundreds of wild baboons in South Africa ’s prized wine country are finding the vineyards of ripe , succulent grapes to be an “ absolute bonanza , ” said Justin O’Riain of the University of Cape Town .
Winemakers have resorted to using noisemakers and rubber snakes to try to drive the baboons off during harvest season .
“ The poor baboons are driven to distraction , ” said O’Riain , who works in the university ’s Baboon Research Unit .
“ As far as baboons are concerned , the combination of starch and sugar is very attractive — and that ’s your basic grape , ” he said .
‘ They choose the nicest bunches ’
Growers say the picky primates are partial to sweet pinot noir grapes , adding to the winemakers ’ woe : Pinot noir sells for more than the average merlot or cabernet sauvignon .
“ They choose the nicest bunches , and you will see the ones they leave on the ground .
If you taste them , they are sour , ” said Francois van Vuuren , farm manager at La Terra de Luc vineyards , 80 km east of Cape Town .
“ They eat the sweetest ones and leave the rest . ”
Baboons have raided South Africa ’s vineyards in the past , but farmers say this year is worse than previous ones because the primates have lost their usual foraging areas due to wildfires and ongoing expansion of grape - growing areas .
Out of a 12 - tonne harvest , 500 to 600 kg go to waste at La Terra de Luc because of the baboons .
In the Constantia wine - producing area alone , up to R255 000 worth of the crop has been lost annually in previous years , according to the Baboon Research Unit .
One farm , La Petite Ferme , was hit particularly hard after fires in the Franschhoek wine - producing region devastated large swaths of land , burning up the baboons ’ normal foraging areas .
The primates then descended on its chardonnay crop , eating or destroying up to three tonnes of grapes .
La Petite Ferme usually produces 12 to 15 barrels of chardonnay a year , but this season only managed to produce three , said farm manager Mark Dendy - Young .
“ It was bad timing , ” Dendy - Young said .
‘ Front - line defences ’
Sometimes the baboons even get an alcohol kick – by feasting on discarded grape skins that have fermented in the sun .
After gobbling up the skins , the animals stumble around before sleeping it off in a shady spot .
During harvest season from January to March , winemakers put up serious front - line defences .
Some try to scare off the baboons by blowing into vuvuzelas .
Electric fencing often does n’t work because baboons can dig underneath it or swing above it from trees to get to the vineyards , O’Riain said .
They also test the fence for weak spots .
If they ’re shocked , they ’ll scream , but they ’ll likely return the next day , he said .
Like other farm managers , Van Vuuren has noticed that the baboons follow a pattern , usually arriving about 10am .
“ Every day , they come at the same time . …
The guys chase the baboons , blowing vuvuzelas , and they chase them back up the mountain .
But sometimes they only move a few metres and then they sit there , looking at you . ”
Sakkie Lourens , manager of Cabriere farm , uses rubber snakes to scare the baboons away .
“ I put them all over where the vines are , and since then , I have n’t seen a single baboon , ” he said .
‘ Incoming baboon ’
Ryno Reyneke of the Cape Chamonix farm said the attacks peak at harvest time .
He hires baboon monitors to scare the animals away with noise .
Some farmers also plant grapes outside their fence line , a sacrificial offering that reduces the number of primate trespassers .
The Baboon Research Unit is pioneering a high - tech approach in which a collar with a sensor is placed on a member of a baboon troop .
When the collar passes a particular point , an “ incoming baboon ” SMS is sent to a cellphone , prompting someone to race to the fence and defend the vineyard from the troop .
O’Riain does n’t think the problem will go away because vineyards are expanding into the lower slopes of the mountains , the baboons ’ traditional foraging grounds .
“ Where there ’s a mountain , there ’s a baboon , ” O’Riain said .
“ As we take up more and more of their land , the conflict increases . ” – Sapa-AP

On Tuesday , Hirelite hosted its first event , Speed Dating for the Hiring Process , to connect software engineers with companies looking for technical talent .
In short , we learned that companies and job seekers like the speed interviewing format because they can quickly evaluate many possible matches on what 's most important to them - cultural fit .
Also , speed dating for hiring is way less awkward than speed dating for romance .
How did the event work ?
Each job seeker interviewed with each company for 5 minutes then rotated to the next company .
At the end of each interview , both the job seeker and the company indicated if they would like to contact each other on a form they received at the event .
After the event , Hirelite sent job seekers and companies their matches ' contact information .
Hirelite requires job seekers to pass a brief programming test in the language of their choice to register for the event .
Most applicants had no trouble with the programming test , but we did get some responses from job seekers who clearly could not code .
One response completely ignored the question , " I do n't program but I have a lot of technical experience and would really like to come . "
Simple , to the point , and not suited to this event .
Job seekers in attendance were primarily Hacker News readers or their friends .
They showed substantial technical ability , especially with web and mobile development .
The developers that came generally had a broad base of skills spanning multiple programming languages for both back - end and front - end development .
Companies including single founders looking for technical cofounders ; angel - funded startups ; VC - funded startups ; and larger , established companies attended .
Most companies were very comfortable with just finding great developers and letting those developers learn ( or create ) their company 's tech stack .
From feedback on the event , both job seekers and companies primarily made decisions based on cultural fit because the overall quality of the attendees was so high .
The event 's language - agnostic approach provided optimum value to both job seekers and companies : many developers did n't want to work for a company that would pigeonhole them , and many companies believed that the best developers would be able to pick up whatever technology they used .
However , some larger companies sought separate events for different languages ( ex : one Java event , one Ruby event , etc ) .
We 'd love to hear what you think about both scenarios : specific language - focused events vs. language - agnostic events .
When both a company and a job seeker wanted to contact each other , Hirelite alerted both parties of the match after the event .
Companies and job seekers were free to share business cards and resumes at the event .
This matching step ensured that companies and job seekers did n't waste time with parties that were not interested ( in addition to ensuring that job seekers and companies had each other 's contact information ) .
Companies wanted to connect with 46 % of the job seekers they interviewed .
Job seekers wanted to connect with 57 % of the companies they interviewed with .
Though the quality of both the job seekers and the companies was very high , not everyone got matched with everyone else due to the importance of cultural fit we mentioned above .
Now for the data :
However , this difference in selectivity was not statistically significant .
Additionally , it 's important to note that the job seekers approached the companies ( companies stayed and job seekers rotated ) , and speed dating research has shown the party being approached to be more selective .
Companies received a match for 73 % of the job seekers they wanted to connect with .
Job seekers received a match for 59 % of the companies they wanted to connect with .
Of all the interviews , 34 % resulted in a match .
These wishes to connect translated into the following matching profile :
After attendees receive their matches , it 's their responsibility to follow up with each other as Hirelite is not meant to replace the entire hiring process .
Hirelite is a quick way to get people with technical talent directly in contact with companies that have a strong interest in hiring them .
In our next post , we 'll feature tips for both " speed interviewing " and traditional interviewing based on what we 've seen .
Follow us or sign up for email updates to be alerted when we post .
Our next event is on Tuesday , April 27 .
As with our previous event , we 're capping attendance to 20 companies and 20 job seekers , so register to reserve your spot .
Angie Baker called Raiya her ' little miracle '
A Sussex mother who suffered 18 miscarriages has spoken of her " little miracle " after giving birth following specialist treatment in Epsom .
Angie Baker , 33 , from Peacehaven , gave birth to daughter Raiya on 9 December .
She received treatment for a high number of subtype white blood cells , which attacked the foetus believing it to be a foreign body .
Ms Baker said : " I 'm overwhelmed , it seems like a dream .
She 's perfect in every way . "
From the age of 20 , Ms Baker 's miscarriages took place one after another , between five and eight weeks after conception .
She said : " Emotionally it was a rollercoaster .
Every time I got pregnant I was hoping this was the one and it was n't going to end in a miscarriage .
" Deep down I always thought it would be a little problem that could be cured . "
Ms Baker was treated by Dr Hassan Shehata , a specialist in recurring miscarriages at Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust .
Angie Baker gave birth to Raiya after 18 miscarriages
She was found to be suffering from high levels of Natural Killer ( NK ) cells following tests only available in Epsom , Liverpool and Chicago .
Dr Shehata prescribed Ms Baker treatment which involved taking a high dose of steroids two weeks prior to conception and 12 weeks after .
Dr Shehata , who sees patients from all over the world , said he had only read about one other case where a woman had had as many as 18 miscarriages before a successful birth .
He said : " Eighteen miscarriages is a huge number .
You 're more likely to win the lottery than have 18 miscarriages through bad luck . "
Dr Shehata said one in five women will have a miscarriage , one in 25 will have two and one in 15,000 will have five .
Following the birth of Raiya , Ms Baker said : " I absolutely love it .
I enjoy every moment .
It 's so precious .
" I can't believe she 's here and she 's mine . "

Those impish Chinese government cyber - saboteurs we last saw posing as 20 - foot high trees to trigger the 2003 northeast power outage have returned in an all new adventure , this time in the pages of the Wall Street Journal .
In this episode , the clever hackers have teamed with the Russians to penetrate the U.S. electrical grid from coast - to - coast , planting diabolical malware designed to let them plunge portions of America into darkness with a few keystrokes , the paper reports .
The real authors of this tale are unnamed " U.S. intelligence officials , " perhaps the same ones who claimed last year that the Chinese government may have caused the 2003 blackout that cut off electricity to 50 million people in eight states and a Canadian province .
Sadly , this new installment does n't contain the kind of juicy details that made the previous one so easy to debunk .
In fact , it contains almost no details at all .
The attacks are " pervasive , " and yet not a single utility company is named as a victim .
Even better , the blackout - triggering malware has n't been spotted by the companies – which explains perfectly why this is the first we 've heard of it .
Only America 's intelligence community has seen the code .
They could show us , but then they'd have to kill us .
The unspoken lesson here is obvious : Chinese Superhackers Are Our Superiors .
No , wait .
That 's not it .
I know ...
Only the intelligence agencies are equipped to protect us from foreign cyber attacks .
It 's an unusually opportune time for this revelation , since the NSA is at this very moment jockeying to take over cyber security from DHS , which lacks the wholesale warrantless - wiretapping capabilities needed to detect Chinese hackers .
What a lucky coincidence of timing that this exciting , if uncheckable , story should emerge now .

Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago .
Unemployment benefits provide a small amount of help to a number of people who desperately need it .
But some economists have gone too far by claiming that unemployment insurance is stimulating the economy .
Unemployment insurance is jointly administered and financed by the federal and state governments , offering funds to “ covered ” people who lost their jobs and have as yet been unable to find and start a new job .
The program has been around for decades , but this recession has created an especially large group of laid - off workers who , despite an extensive search , genuinely cannot find another job .
With no new job in sight , a large group of people are under considerable personal and financial stress .
In recognition of these facts , the stimulus law of 2009 extended the eligibility period for unemployment benefits , and provided additional funds for the program .
Before this recession , most economists probably thought that some amount of unemployment benefits were just and compassionate , and offered a sense of security even to people who were lucky enough to retain their jobs , despite the fact that the program would raise unemployment rates and reduce both employment and economic output .
In other words , unemployment benefits shrink the economy to some degree , but shrinking the economy a bit may be a price worth paying .
Unemployment benefits were thought to reduce employment and output because , by definition , working people were ineligible for the benefits .
In particular , an unemployed person who finds and starts a new job , or returns to working at his previous job , is supposed to give up his unemployment benefits .
Economists had found that a large fraction of unemployed people delay going back to work solely because the unemployment insurance program was paying them for not working .
Fewer people working means a lower employment rate , and less output because unemployed people are not yet contributing to production .
The recession has seen a number of economists ignore prior findings on unemployment insurance , at least as long as this recession continues .
For example , in evaluating the stimulus law economists at the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office assumed that the law would raise gross domestic product , and took no account of the fact that the unemployment insurance and other provisions of the stimulus law give people incentives to work less .
Paul Krugman recently summarized the incentives - do - not - matter point of view in his blog ( see also Lawrence Katz , a leading labor economist at Harvard , quoted here ) :
Everyone agrees that really generous unemployment benefits , by reducing the incentive to seek jobs , can raise the [ normal unemployment rate ] …
But in case you have n’t noticed …
What ’s limiting employment now is lack of demand for the things workers produce .
Their incentives to seek work are , for now , irrelevant .
[ emphasis added ]
I have not seen any evidence to support this claim that , in essence , the laws of economics are suspended as long as a recession continues .
Rather , the available evidence suggests the opposite .
One feature of the unemployment insurance program is that it specifies an exhaustion date : a person stops receiving benefits when he or she starts working again , or reaches the exhaustion date ( often a fixed number of weeks after being laid off ) , whichever comes first .
In the past , economists observed that a large fraction of unemployed people suddenly started working again within a week or so of their exhaustion date , despite having been without work for so many weeks prior : evidence that the benefits themselves were sustaining unemployment .
If the Congressional Budget Office , Professor Krugman and others were correct , this pattern would be absent during a recession , because the demand just is n’t there , and demand will not miraculously appear merely because of the arrival of the benefit exhaustion date .
A study published by two labor economists , Stepan Jurajda and Frederick J. Tannery , looked at employment histories for unemployment insurance recipients in Pittsburgh in the early 1980s .
Unemployment rates got quite high in Pittsburgh in those days , reaching 16 percent at one point , and staying over 10 percent for two and a half years .
The chart below summarizes their findings for Pittsburgh .
The chart displays the fraction of persons ( in Pittsburgh ) receiving unemployment benefits who began working again , as a function of the number of weeks until their unemployment benefits were scheduled to be exhausted .
For example , a “ hazard ” value of “ 0.04 ” for week “ - 14 ″ means that , among unemployed persons with 14 weeks remaining until their benefit exhaustion date , 4 percent of them either began working a new job or returned to their previous job .
Very few people started working during the two to three weeks prior to the exhaustion of their unemployment benefits ( weeks “ - 3 ″ and “ - 2 ″ in the chart ) .
But almost 30 percent started work just a week later ( 19 percent started a new job , 10 percent returned to a previous job ) .
“ Demand ” may have been lacking in Pittsburgh in the early 1980s , but that did not stop unemployed people from responding to the work incentives presented to them by the unemployment insurance program ( economists also looked for this pattern during a Swedish recession , and found it there too ) .
Unemployment insurance is only a small part of the reason why the labor market has so far failed to restore employment to pre-recession levels .
But unemployment insurance is not free :
It results in less employment and less output , not more .
The real question is whether , and for how long , this price is worth paying to continue a just and compassionate program .
It has featured naked women on the cover and even actresses without makeup .
But now a leading fashion magazine has created a real shock for France 's fashionistas by tackling the last taboo : plus - size models .
The latest edition of French Elle is arriving on newsstands this weekend with a picture of model Tara Lynn wearing a white jumpsuit on the cover .
Lynn is a plus - size model who sports , it says , " adorable belly fat " and inside appears with three other larger models for 32 pages of a " special edition " dedicated to plus - size fashion .
It comes a month after Italian Vogue launched an online section called " Vogue Curvy " dedicated to fashion and beauty for larger women .
In January US glossy magazine V ran a plus - size - themed edition featuring Lynn and other models under the headline " Curves ahead " .
And last September the issue was again in the spotlight after British designer Mark Fast 's London show caused a storm when his stylist allegedly walked out over a decision to use larger models .
Some see French Elle 's decision to challenge the national stereotype of slender , chic Parisian women as breaking down the last bastion of a super - slim aesthetic that has gripped the fashion world .
However , many doubt that the French will ever accept a larger body as an acceptable look and several fashion insiders told the Observer that the French Elle shoot was simply a " gimmick " , not a trend .
Others disagree .
Velvet d'Amour , a US model who lives in Paris , has conquered both fashion and TV at size 28 .
She has been a catwalk model for Gaultier and Galliano and is now a popular TV commentator .
Shops and websites for larger women are becoming highly visible .
Parisian fashion writer Sakina , whose blog Saks and the City is widely read , told the Observer that the Elle cover was a " wonderful initiative " .
" It 's almost unbelievable to see such a huge magazine cover a real plus - size woman .
Along with Vogue dedicating a section to curvy women , it 's the most shaking news I 've seen , " she said .
" Fashion has created a gap between itself and real women .
From skinny , to curvy , to fat , the population is made of very different bodies and the contrast between the women represented in fashion or advertising has been so important that most women do n't feel good about themselves .
I , too , have had body issues : I tried to fight what I genetically am because I always thought that being beautiful could never mean being curvy . "
She added : " The fashion industry is evolving , but slowly .
Elle is considered as a magazine that steps out for women , so I want to believe this is not only a one - off .
The famously Parisian chic is a fashion spirit , certainly not a weight or a body shape . "
Although far behind the US and the UK , the French are getting significantly bigger .
Statistics show that 42 % of French women are now classified as overweight or obese , while more than half the male population – 51 % of French men – are officially overweight or obese .
But one Parisian fashion industry insider , who did not want to be named , said French Elle was acting less out of desire for change than " to respond to the criticisms directed at them for showing only thin models " .
He told the Observer : " It 's a gimmick .
Having one edition that you fill with big girls is like world women 's day : one day a year is reserved for them and the rest of the time you go back to normal . "
The capital 's fashion elite was far from changing its mind about bigger models , added the insider .
" You know why ?
Because clothes do n't look as good on bigger people . "
Size is now a hugely contentious issue across the developed world .
This month a row erupted in Australia when designer Rosemary Masic said she would cap her clothes range at size 14 , as anything bigger " endorses an unhealthy lifestyle " .
" I am very passionate about life and serious about health , " said Masic .
" Size 16 and size 18 are not healthy sizes to be . "
But she was criticised for stocking clothes at the other end of the spectrum , size 6 , which some see as equally unhealthy .
The German magazine Brigitte this year said it would no longer hire professional models because staff were tired of retouching photographs of bone - thin models to make them look bigger .
German designer Karl Lagerfeld , 76 , who attacked chainstore H&M for producing his designs in all sizes instead of just for the " slim and slender " , stepped into the row , saying what many in fashion believe – that no one wants to watch larger catwalk models .
" Fat mummies sit there in front of the television with their chip packets and say skinny models are ugly , " Lagerfeld told Focus magazine .
He said fashion was about " dreams and illusions " , not reality .
Critics , however , say it is also about eating disorders and pressured young women , but he is not alone in that view .
Others feel Elle has dragged behind the curve .
Glamour magazine published a small photograph of model Lizzie Miller , showing a natural - looking stomach , last September .
A deluge of responses declaring it " the most amazing photograph I 've ever seen in any women 's magazine " led the magazine to commission Dutch fashion photographer Matthias Vriens - McGrath to shoot plus - size models Miller , Crystal Renn and Kate Dillon , among others , in a style similar to that made famous by US photographer Herb Ritts with nude supermodels in the 1980s .
This month designer Michael Kors , US Vogue editor - in - chief Anna Wintour and model Natalia Vodianova were at a Harvard forum to discuss changing body types in fashion .
Vodianova talked about her postnatal anorexia , and Kors called waif - like models an " army of children " and announced he would no longer book models aged under 16 .
" The fashion industry is starting to address real women again , " Kors said .
" The emphasis in fashion is shifting toward an emphasis on real women who are women , not girls . ''
If the fashion magazines do not lose readers by using a diversity of models in all shapes and sizes , then the designers could find that change makes commercial sense , even if some steadfastly refuse to accept the aesthetics .
Absolute Number of Escorts Listed in the Google Maps Directory
Relative Number of Escorts Listed in the Google Maps Directory
The role of sex in the American economy ( let alone , culture ) is complex and exceedingly contradictory .
While sex is used extensively to sell to the consumer - citizens of the U.S. ( see any TV ad ) it is also the focus of efforts to control it ( who is allowed to marry ) and regulate its sale ( the illegal status of prostitution in most of the U.S. ) .
This latter issue is particularly convoluted as leafing through the back of many a local newspaper or postings at Craigslist ( or other websites ) will aptly demonstrate .
There is any number of " escort services " for sale , with the majority presumably being a thinly veiled offer to exchange sex for money .
The wide spread availability of these listings led to today 's maps which visualize the distribution of directory listings for " escorts " within Google Maps .
The map of the absolute numbers of escorts identifies major urban centers as key sites for this activity , with Denver , Dallas , New York and Miami representing particularly large clusters .
It is only through the analysis of the relative number of escort listings ( see the map below ) that more surprising patterns emerge .
Most large urban centers are still present although some such as Detroit or Salt Lake City are very small .
Additionally , smaller cities such as Tampa , FL , Knoxville , TN , Tulsa , OK and Lexington , KY appear to have a much higher number of escort listings than their mere size would suggest .
As Lexington is the U.S. home for floatingsheep.org we are somewhat nonplussed at this result .
Who knew ?
Particularly since " Sin City " aka Las Vegas is completely absent in this map .
Not really the category that Lexington 's city council has been trying to get the city highly ranked on .
But the clear front - runner in this category is Texas in general and Dallas in particular which appears as the most specialized metropolitan area in escort services in the U.S .
The nearby city / suburb of Plano contains the highest rank which leads inexorably to our final observation ( apologies in advance ) that …... Debbie does Dallas , but prefers Plano .

Pete 's story
If someone had said to me in the 80s that I ’d marry a black woman , I ’d have said “ Never in a million years ! ”
You see , I dread to think how many years I ’d been active with the BNP .
I was in my late teens when it all started .
Growing up I did n’t really have black friends or know any other cultures apart from my own .
I was always looking back to the “ good old days ” of England .
I was worried about immigration and I could n’t see where it would all end .
Then I read a BNP magazine called Identity , and I thought , “ I agree with that all the way . ”
That ’s when I got active doing leafleting for them , and eventually I progressed to regional organiser .
I was blinded by it .
They said what I wanted to hear .
I was involved right through the 80s , when BNP founder John Tyndall was in charge before Nick Griffin , who I also became friendly with .
I would n’t go on marches , I could n’t see the point .
But I ’d go to Red White and Blue conventions .
Then in the summer of 2005 I was working as a manager for Royal Mail in the Northampton depot when I met Kaye .
She ’d just taken a part - time job and I thought she was beautiful .
We got talking and we just clicked .
She dressed beautifully , she was just incredible .
I could n’t believe she had n’t been snapped up .
I was attracted to her immediately and I was surprised at my ­feelings towards her .
It was scary , too .
People knew me as “ BNP Pete ” – they still do .
And I thought about what people might think and say because of what I ’d been involved in , to suddenly go the other way .
I knew something had to give .
I could n’t carry on being involved with the BNP and be with Kaye .
It took about six months before I realised I wanted to be with Kaye full - time , and then I did n’t renew my BNP membership .
People asked me why and I told them it was because I was with Kaye .
They might have thought things if they ’d seen us walking down the street together , but only one person ever said anything negative to my face .
This guy I used to work with , an original skinhead , asked if I was still “ sh*** ing that black b**** ” .
I told him we were a couple and to refrain from calling her that .
He apologised , and then sent a Christmas card to us , which was a surprise .
Kaye moved in with me in October 2006 and we had our daughter Ruby in May 2008 .
I ’ve got a 20 - year - old daughter Elizabeth from my first marriage who knew about my BNP days and is glad I ’m out of it .
She used to tell me , “ You do n’t like anything ” – I was anti-this and anti-that .
The only thing I was n’t anti was myself .
Kaye ’s daughter Dahlia , 11 , lives with us too and we ’re bringing her other daughter Jaysia , 16 , over once she ’s finished her exams .
I ca n’t wait for us all to be a family .
I was at the immigration court the other day , putting in our application for her to come over .
Before , that would ’ve been unheard of – me trying to bring someone from Jamaica here .
In a way , I ’m clearing my conscience about my past .
When I look back on my time with the BNP , I just think I was blowing a lot of hot air about nothing .
I find it sad reflecting on what people must have thought about me back then .
There are some beautiful black women but I ’d never have even thought about getting married to one , it would never have occurred to me .
No one agreed with mixed - race relationships in my BNP days .
They ’d be horrified about it – the older ones more than the younger members .
The BNP ’s perception of Jamaicans ?
Selling drugs .
And if a mugging happened they ’d blow it all up .
Being with Kaye has educated me about what Jamaicans are really like and it also puts closure on my past .
It ’s a whole new world to me .
I ’ve now got friends from Nigeria , Somalia , Pakistan which people would ’ve said was n’t possible before .
And they ’ll all be coming to our wedding on May 29 .
I ’m glad I ’m out of the BNP .
I ’d tell any people who are thinking about voting for them to think very carefully .
I wo n’t be voting for them again .
And I ’d say to them , “ Look at me and my family – would you vote against this ? ”
Everything ’s rosy for me now .
And it ’s all down to Kaye .
Kaye 's story
Although I liked Pete deep down when we first began working together , I ’ve always been very shy .
But we got close and then in July 2006 we went for a drink and I realised I had fallen head over heels for him .
As we got closer , people at work started gossiping .
Then one day someone came up to me and asked me if I knew that Pete was in the BNP .
At the time , I did n’t even know what the BNP was – so she told me it was a racist party .
I came to England in 2000 from Jamaica to be my uncle ’s carer .
I ’d been brought up to respect people no matter who they are or whatever their skin colour .
So I was n’t used to anything like the BNP .
At first I just thought it was another political party .
But as I did find out more about it , I was n’t worried it would stop me and Pete getting together because I felt we ’d had a connection straight away .
I ’ve always followed horoscopes and we were a perfect match .
Once I realised how compatible we were , I thought , “ That ’s it , I ’m not searching any more .
I ’ve found him ,
The One . ”
As time went by I saw more about the BNP on television and I thought , “ Are they really like that ? ”
I ’d like them to realise that it does n’t matter what colour or culture you are , we ’re all one .
If we ’re cut , we all bleed the same .
But at the end of the day that ’s their beliefs , and I ca n’t change it .
The only problem we ’ve had is when someone Pete used to work with asked him if he was still going out with that “ black b**** ” .
Pete was really upset when he came home and told me about it .
I could ’ve put a complaint in but I thought about the man ’s wife and children – they did n’t deserve to suffer for what their dad had said .
Knowing the Pete I know , I ca n’t believe he has ever been racist .
To me , he ’s just lovely Pete .
He ’s my world – he ’s loving , gorgeous and generous .
He means the world to me .
I ’ve never been as happy in a relationship as I am with Pete .
All my family love him to bits , too .
I get on really well with Pete ’s mum and he loves spending time with my auntie in London .
The first time my auntie met him she told me , “ He ’s the man for you , look after him ” .
Most importantly , he treats my children from my first relationship as though they ’re his own .
Our wedding in May is going to be amazing – a real mix of English and Jamaican culture .
It will reflect both of us .
Behind the main table Pete will have two flags , a British and a Jamaican one , and to eat we ’ll have curry goat , rice and peas as well as roast salmon .
Pete ’s got really into his spicy food now , he puts spice on pretty much everything !
My family will be coming over from Jamaica for the wedding and it will be a real mix of cultures as we ’ll have guests from all over the world .
It will be the start of a new life together , united .
I know what people say about the BNP , but I do n’t care .
They can get on with their life and I ’ll get on with mine .
Still , I ’d like to think our relationship sends out a message and lets people realise that being in a mixed relationship does n’t matter – it can work and you can be happy .
There ’s no room for racism and small - minded views in this country .
Kevin Smith May Try Crowdfunding Horror Film , Red State , After Fans Offer To Do So
from the i'm - the - cellist - now !
dept
" I think an interesting thing that may happen with it is -- I was on Twitter and people are asking about Red State , and then a dude tweeted ' hey man , what if we pay for it ? '
And all of a sudden , a bunch of people were like ' Seriously , why not ? ' "
" We 're kind of creating this website .
We 're seeing if it works to set up and collect donations .
It becomes a weird tax nightmare , though ...
It sounded like such an easy thing online ... but now there 's lots of checks and balances to make sure we can do it , but if that 's the case , I would be into it , and I 'll match it .
Whatever you raise on line , like fuck it , you put it up , I 'll put it up . "
Our plan is to put anything we make into a fund that would , in turn , finance other ( cost - sensible ) flicks fans want to see .
And from that ?
Build a People 's Studio .
Simply have any interested / frustrated / desperate party put their script on our website , open for all to read , during a " pilot season " of sorts .
Script that gets the most votes , gets the loot .
That flick gets made and sold , all the loot goes back into fund for next round .
If there 's enough loot from RED STATE sale to do so , idea would be to fund two low budget flicks a year .

We 've already pointed out how director / writer / filmmaker / entertainer Kevin Smith is a great example of a filmmaker embracing the model of connecting with fans and giving them a reason to buy , even to the point of saying that unauthorized file sharing is just a way to get more fans he can " convert . "
Apparently , he may take things to another level , by following a crowdfunding effort similar to what we 've seen with some musicians and authors
The twist here is that it was n't his idea .
The fans came to him and made it clear they wanted to fund the project .
If you are a fan of Smith ( as I am ) , you know he 's been talking about various projects he 's been thinking about , and last year talked a lot about a rather different kind of movie , a " political horror film " called .
Of course , that 's definitely a big step away from Smith 's usual comic - fare , and finding financing for it was initially proving difficult .
But , the fans stepped up : Smith has said that if he does this , he 'd match every dollar donated .
They 're working on a website for it , but there have been some logistical issues :
Of course , doing it from scratch may raise some issues , and I 'd imagine he'd be better off if he were n't trying to sell " shares " in the film , since that 's where things get really tricky , but focusing on selling something else ( credit in the film , access to screenings , meet & greet with Kevin , etc. ) , with the proceeds going to fund the film .
But there are lots of platforms like Kickstarter or Biracy that he might want to look into , since they 've worked out a lot of the legal issues .
Still , it highlights , yet again , what a lie it is to claim that " fans just want everything for free . "
And it shows that content not yet created is a scarcity people will pay for .
It 's still early ( and Smith is focused on another movie first ) , but it could be one of the most high profile movies made using this technique .
But the further this moves along , the more interesting it gets .
After a bunch of people misinterpreted the original interview Smith gave , he wrote out a more detailed explanation of his thinking , which is clearly still in the very initial planning stage ( i.e. , they do n't even know if it 's possible ) , but it looks to be about more than just fan funding this one film :
Even though a lot of the talk around these parts has been about music industry business models , in the last year or so , I 've really been amazed at the number of indie filmmakers who have been really digging in on new business models , with a strong willingness to experiment and adapt .
It 's very encouraging to see .

Domestic populations of cats and dogs have increased by eight million in 20 years
Clever people are more likely to own cats than dogs , a study has revealed as it emerged that domestic populations of both animals may have risen by eight million in 20 years .
The researchers explained the disparity by suggesting that professionals worked longer hours and had less time to devote to dogs .
Cats and dogs are among the most popular pets in the UK , but their population estimates were last published in 1989 .
At that time there were found to be 6.2 million cats and 6.4 million dogs in the UK - a figure that has leaped to an estimated 10.3 million cats and 10.5 millions dogs , according to the University of Bristol .
The research was based on three sources - a telephone survey of nearly 3,000 households in 2007 , the latest census of 2001 and the most recent figures on numbers and sizes of households .
Cats were more likely to be owned by households with gardens , households with someone qualified to degree level , respondents who were female and those less than 65 years old .
Women and people aged under 55 were more likely to report dog ownership .
Dogs were less likely to be owned by households with one or more cats .
Dr Jane Murray , Cats Protection Lecturer in Feline Epidemiology , said the increase was mainly due to a rise in the UK population as a whole .
She said : " The study has shown many common factors relating to cat and dog ownership , such as a garden and rural location , but it has also identified some notable differences .
In particular , the difference in the level of education achieved by a household owning cats and dogs .
" The reason for this association is unclear .
It is unlikely to be related to household income as this variable was not shown to be significant but it could be related to household members with longer working hours having less time available to care for a dog .
Past reports have suggested that the number of pet cats exceeds the number of pet dogs in the UK .
However , results from our study suggest that there are similar numbers of pet cats and dogs . "

Ray tracing is a widespread technique in computer graphics .
You ’ve probably seen stills and movies that involved ray tracing , whether in the graphics community or in movie theaters or on TV .
The distinguishing feature of ray tracing is that it is one of the most photorealistic ways of rendering computer images .
A trade off when using ray tracing is an increase in rendering time , so ray tracing is not used as often in real time situations .
Subsequently , the traditional way of rendering in some 3D programs and most games is not raytracing , but a process called “ rasterization ” that attempts to do the same thing , but much faster , though slightly less accurately .
Ray tracing ’s advantage over rasterization is that it ’s capable of many more phenomena by default than rasterization , due to its property of being modeled on the real world .
It ’s this property , and the basic process of raytracing , that will be discussed in this article .
To understand ray tracing , we must first understand what the “ ray ” in ray tracing stands for .
You may recall from geometry that a ray has an origin and a line part that extends infinitely into space towards some direction .
An optical ray is very similar in this regard , although the light “ carried ” by the ray does not remain constantly bright .
This property of a ray allows us to model complex phenomena like shadows and surface scattering .
So what happens to a ray when it hits a surface , such as the wall of a house ?
Usually , the ray bounces off of the surface and continues on its path .
This phenomena is called reflection .
Whenever a ray strikes a surface , several facts can be derived from the event .
First , we must establish the normal of the surface .
This is an imaginary line we draw that is perpendicular to the surface .
You ’ll hear about the normals of geometry in 3D a great deal , especially in modeling .
Once we ’ve established the normal of the surface , we can find the angle of incidence or the incident ray .
This is a measure of the distance , in degrees , between the normal and the ray .
Knowing this quantity allows us to understand if the ray is hitting the surface dead on or , alternately , at a very extreme angle .
The various possibilities affect how the light is reflected .
After we ’ve figured out the angle of incidence , we can then find the angle of reflection .
This is very easy , as the law of reflection states that the angle of reflection is always equal to the angle of incidence .
The reflection of light from a surface defines what we see when we look at the surface .
Sometimes the amount of light that comes back from a surface is n’t the same amount that was sent to the surface .
The ratio between these two quantities is known as the albedo of a surface , but this term is n’t very often used in computer graphics as there are other variables that produce this effect , particularly the “ Diffuse ” component of a material in a CG program .
When talking about reflection in regards to surfaces , it helps to make a distinction between specular reflection and diffuse reflection .
In short , specular reflection looks more like the reflection of a mirror and diffuse reflection looks more like the reflection of a sheet of paper .
Both surfaces reflect light , but they reflect it slightly differently .
You can understand why this is so more clearly when you see the differences at a microscopic level between the two surfaces .
When a somewhat unpolished surface reflects light , what really happens is that the rays bounce off all the nooks and crannies on the surface , distributing the light all over the place .
The result is a smoother , less shiny surface .
You can observe this effect if you take a soft , reflective metal object , like a spoon , and record the nature of its reflectivity as you add scratches to it .
When the entire surface is covered in scratches , the object will lose most of its specular reflection and instead appear to have a dull finish , although the fundamental matter that composes the object has n’t changed , merely its surface .
Getting back to the distinction between specular and diffuse reflection , what we colloquially mean when we say “ the water reflects the scenery ” is really that the water surface ’s reflections are specular , rather than diffuse , in nature .
Whenever we see other objects reflected on an object ’s surface , we see a specular reflection in action .
In computer graphics , the term “ reflection ” almost always refers to specular reflection , but the “ specular ” component of a material has little to do with the actual specular reflection of the surface .
The refraction of light through a surface is the effect we see when we look through a magnifying glass or through frosted glass .
Light changes speed ( and direction ) within the surface and subsequently , we see a different shape of the objects behind the refracting surface .
Refraction is useful in simulating glass objects , water , plastics , and physical phenomena like heat waves .
Now that we know about rays , reflection , and refraction , we can start constructing a model for ray tracing .
First , we must understand that in the real world , light sources emit rays that bounce off surfaces until they reach the observer , such as a person or a camera .
This sort of mechanism is computationally intensive , so when renderers use ray tracing to simulate the real world , they send out rays from the observer ’s viewpoint instead of passively receiving them .
This makes computation much faster , but the underlying mechanism is still the same , just reversed for speed ’s sake .
The observer sends out a number of rays , which proceed to either reflect off or refract through the objects in the scene .
Once reflected , the rays continue on their path towards the light sources in the scene , at which point other useful parts of the image may be computed , such as shadow rays , which can determine whether or not an object casts a shadow .
This is the essence of ray tracing , which happens to be a simple and straightforward process .
Ray tracing is quickly taking over as the preferred way of rendering an image with render engines such as mental ray and Yafaray being set by default in popular 3D packages .
Notably , 3ds max has continued using its scanline rasterizing renderer by default , which can render a hybrid of raster and ray - traced materials .
One advantage of ray tracing is that it is fundamentally a more realistic and desirable mode of rendering .
Many physically correct phenomena can be modeled with ease using a ray tracing algorithm , since the algorithm simulates the motion of light in the real world .
Rasterizing renderers have to approximate , or outright invent their own solutions to , these phenomena , which can include anything from fluorescence to shadows .
Ray tracing also allows artists to provide additional render detail when necessary , such as global illumination and photon mapping .
With other types of renderers , such detail often fundamentally changes how the image is rendered .
For example , one can add more rays when rendering an image to get a more precise and accurate output , but an analogous mechanism does n’t exist for scanline and other renderers .
Sampling depth is sometimes used as such a mechanism , but at its lowest levels , it does not provide the basic standard of imaging that ray tracing does .
This makes rapid prototyping of a scene much more convenient with ray tracing .
A huge disadvantage of ray tracing is its speed .
Ray tracers are to this day rather slow .
A great deal of work is being done in this area to parallelize and otherwise separate a render job into smaller chunks , however hardware plays a much larger role in render speed .
Some ray tracers , like POV - RAY , are still serial and not parallel , which makes a faster CPU all the more important .
It ’s for reasons of speed that most 3D applications use a hybrid of scanline and ray tracing render engines .
Ray tracing is still primarily a technique used in asynchronous computer graphics .
Due to the complexity of modern scenes , ray traced images still have to be rendered without anticipating that they ’ll be in real time .
However , this is changing .
Ray tracing is coming to consumer GPUs with the GeForce GF100 ; real - time raytracing is being offered by CausticRT on a dedicated card ; there has been a lot of work done to convert the Quake engine to a ray - traced version .
All of these developments point to ray tracing becoming more and more common within the next 10 years .
As ray tracing becomes more common , the focus of renderers and GPUs will shift dramatically .
Currently , most renderers and GPUs have to sacrifice physical correctness for speed .
When the hardware powering most consumer systems becomes powerful enough to ray trace in real time ( or at least at 30 frames per second ) , a lot of these compromises will no longer be required .
3D artists will be able to preview their work immediately and gamers will be treated to an increasingly realistic experience .
The eventual arrival of real time ray tracing means it ’s important for artists to understand how the technique works .
Though it is quite simple in nature , it ’s very powerful and understanding it can allow an artist to predict how their work will look before it ’s rendered .
Senate Republicans refuse to work past 2 p.m. [ Updated ! ]
" There is a little - known rule in the Senate stating that hearings ca n’t happen after 2:00 p.m. each day without unanimous consent , " explains Amanda Terkel .
" However , every day , at the start of business , the Senate generally agrees , by unanimous consent , to waive this rule and continue with the necessary business of holding hearings . "
Every day , that is , until now .
Republicans angry about the passage of health - care reform are invoking the dreaded half - day maneuver .
Terkel explains :
Today , during a Senate Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing on transparency , Sen. Tom Carper ( D - DE ) announced that he had to stop the proceedings because of Republican blocks .
...
The AP also reported today that Sen. Mark Udall ( D - CO ) had a hearing on the bark beetle canceled today “ after Republicans angry over the passage of health insurance reform legislation blocked it by using an obscure Senate rule requiring a unanimous consent to hold hearings scheduled after 2 p.m . ”
I could imagine a lot of smart ways to begin obstructing the chamber and making life miserable for Democrats .
But declaring that you wo n't work after 2 p.m ?
Do Republicans really think the average American is going to rally to that battle cry ?
Update :
My colleague Paul Kane notes that this is n't specifically a 2 p.m. rule .
Rather , the Senate needs unanimous consent to continue work two hours after it 's gaveled into sessions .
So it could be earlier than 2 p.m .
And it turns out to be an old minority trick that Democrats have used too .
This is further evidence , I think , that it 's long past time to clean the Senate rulebook and get rid of the minority 's ability to throw these procedural tantrums .
Fresh evidence that fatty food is bad for our health has come to light : mice fed a lard - based diet over a long period got worse at fighting bacteria in the blood , reveals a thesis from the Sahlgrenska Academy .
The mice fed the lard - based diet derived 60 per cent of their total calories from fat .
They were compared with mice fed a low - fat diet , where no more than ten per cent of their calories came from fat .
As expected , the mice on the high - fat diet got fatter .
A more surprising result was that their immune system was less active .
The white blood cells got worse at dealing with bacteria in the blood , which could have contributed to many dying of sepsis .
" Obesity is usually associated with inflammation that does not result from an infection , which simply means that the immune defences are activated unnecessarily , " says doctoral student Louise Strandberg who wrote the thesis .
" Ironically , the mice on the high - fat diet seem to have a less active immune system when they really need it . "
Fat people are also at a greater risk of acquiring infection , for example in connection with an operation .
In mice , the thesis shows that it is fatty food rather than obesity in itself which affects the ability to fight off sepsis caused by bacteria .
Strandberg has also investigated different variants of three genes that are important for the immune system and noted that several of the gene variants that strengthen immunity also result in less obesity .
" So there are all kinds of links between the immune system on the one hand and obesity and diet on the other , " says Strandberg .
And so the H264 / Theora debate concerning HTML5 video continues .
The most recent entry into the discussion comes from John Gruber , who argues that Theora is more in danger of patent litigation than H264 .
He ’s wrong , and here ’s why .
Gruber argues that the patent situation around H264 is safer than that around Theora , because he claims Theora is vulnerable to not one , but two types of patents .
Not only is Theora vulnerable to “ submarine patents ” , but also to patents that reside in MPEG - LA ’s patent pool .
Submarine patents
Let ’s talk submarine patents first .
This argument has been bandied around quite often now , and if I ’m not mistaken , this argument comes straight from Apple .
Submarine patents are patents which have been filed , but not granted ; this keeps them hidden from the public , and therefore , potential infringers cannot even be aware they ’re infringing .
Prior to 1995 , United States patent law had patent terms run from the date of issuance , while after 1995 , patent terms start right at the filing date .
This meant that prior to 1995 , patent owners could extend their patent ’s term simply by employing delaying tactics to keep the patent from actually being issued ; keeping the application in limbo , if you will .
Some submarine patents had a “ hidden ” time of 40 years ( see footnote 27 on page 9 ) .
Since this practice became impossible after 1995 , this means that any possible submarine patents threatening Theora must have been issued prior to that year .
While this is not impossible , it does negate this threat quite a bit .
In addition to that , such a submarine patent could threaten H264 just as well .
Last but not least , we must take into account where this argument hails from .
Apple , like Microsoft , has large stakes in the MPEG - LA , making them anything but impartial in this debate .
Apple of course has a vested interest in shackling the web to H264 , since both its software and hardware have been geared towards this codec .
While someone like Gruber , an Apple fan after all , might be sympathetic towards Apple and give them the benefit of the doubt – I certainly would n’t , and many would agree with me on that one .
MPEG - LA ’s patents
The second group of patents Gruber claims Theora might be infringing upon are those that reside within the MPEG - LA ’s patent pool .
Theora supporters have long claimed this is not the case ( Theora is patent - free , they say ) , but Gruber points to an interview with MPEG - LA ’s CEO , Larry Horn , who claims otherwise .
“ No one in the market should be under the misimpression that other codecs such as Theora are patent - free , ” Horn claims , “ Virtually all codecs are based on patented technology , and many of the essential patents may be the same as those that are essential to AVC / H.264 .
Therefore , users should be aware that a license and payment of applicable royalties is likely required to use these technologies developed by others , too . ”
When asked to clarify that statement , Horn said that the MPEG - LA believes that some of its patent holders own patents used in Theora .
He also added that the MPEG - LA might consider offering a license to Theora users to negate these worries .
And thus our true colours reveal .
The interesting part here is not these threats by the MPEG - LA – after all , Theora is a competitor to H264 , so anything the MPEG - LA can do to scare people away from it is something they ’ll do .
This does n’t mean they are wrong – it just means that their credibility in this regard is n’t very high .
Conveniently , Gruber ignores the more interesting aspect of the above interview : the interviewer also decided , in good journalist fashion , to contact Monty Montgomery , the founder of the Xiph.org Foundation , the body overseeing Theora ’s and Ogg ’s development .
When asked about the Theora - is - not - patent - free statement , Montgomery was fierce in his reply , which I ’m quoting in full .
For 15 years , Xiph .
Org has carefully “ played by the rules , ” fully within the bounds , intent , and letter of intellectual property and patent law .
For the past ten years we ’ve informed the entire world , including MPEG LA , of our specifications and algorithms in detail .
We ’ve requested in open letters that any group believing we are infringing to inform us so that we make take immediate corrective action .
I predict that MPEG LA may counter that they know groups have been pressured into licensing patents in order to use Theora .
This has been a recent back - room assertion .
You might want to ask point blank if MPEG LA itself or any of its constituent members has engaged in this practice , thus manufacturing the evidence that “ vindicates ” their patent allegations .
I beg you – tell me immediately if you get a straight answer ( or good video of any squirming ) !
I ’m sure you can tell I ’m a bit peeved ; this has been going on for over a decade .
It ’s amazing they ’ve never been called out on it .
This is a pretty harsh accusation , and I ’d doubt he ’d make it if he did n’t have any solid evidence backing this up .
Then again , just like with the MPEG - LA statements , you have to consider that Xiph competes with the MPEG - LA .
When asked about the more direct claim that Theora infringes upon MPEG - LA patents specifically , Montgomery was clear .
“ Non-logic , ” he asserts , “ i.e. , ‘ I ’m not saying Mr. Strawman is a pedophile .
I simply remind you he ’s regularly seen in the company of children . ’
MPEG LA has had more than ten years to say anything substantial on this front .
They have not . ”
Remind you of something ?
Google ’s Theora endorsement
I ’d like to add another argument to this that further negates these so - called patent threats against Theora .
If Theora is so sensitive to patents , as MPEG - LA , Apple , and its supporters claim – than why on earth would one of the biggest technology companies in the world ship it as part of its browser and as part of its operating system ?
I ’m of course talking about Google .
Google has implemented support for Theora in its Chrome web browser , as well as in its upcoming Chrome OS .
Do you really think a large and visible company like Google , a very attractive target for patent trolls , would include it if it had even the slightest worries about infringement claims ?
Would one of the world ’s most profitable tech companies willingly paint such a big bulls - eye on itself , especially now that this debate has been raging for so long ?
FUD
To sum up : first , submarine patents have been impossible for the past 15 years , which severely limits this supposed threat .
Second , the patent claims against Theora come from its competitor , and not from a neutral party ; the threats are well - countered by Xiph .
Third , Google supporting Theora so openly effectively means that Google believes that Theora ’s patent threat is minimal .
In fact , this last part is delightfully interesting in light of Apple ’s original complaint against Theora .
Back in 2007 , Apple ’s Maciej Stachowiak argued that while Ogg / Theora / Vorbis are free of patents now , they might get into trouble later on .
“ Although the Ogg codecs do n’t have known patents that are n’t RF licensed , it ’s not completely clear that none of the patents out there on video / audio encoding apply , ” he argued , “ Often , parties holding a submarine patent wait for a company with very deep pockets ( like Apple , or Microsoft , or Google ) to infringe on the patent before they sue . ”
Emphasis added .
Even though I do n’t like to use this term ( too convenient a discussion killer ) , all this looks and smells like “ FUD ” , propagated by those with a vested interest in shackling the web to H264 .
Colleges really want to know a lot about their students .
A whole lot .
Sometimes it gets a little creepy what they want to know for “ marketing ” purposes .
Combine that with the annoying pleading for bucks from alumni , and you have the birth of this strip .
Oddly , the guy seems more bothered in the last panel than the girl .

HTML Slidy : Slide Shows in XHTML
You can now create accessible slide shows with ease
Works across browsers and is operated like PowerPoint Advance to next slide with mouse click Move forward / backward between slides with space bar , Pg Up and Pg Dn keys
Home key for first slide , End key for last slide Function F11 to go full screen and back The " F " key toggles the display of the footer The " A " key toggles display of current vs all slides
Use the " A " key when you want to view or print all slides
Try it now to see how to include notes for handouts ( this is explained in the notes following this slide )
Font sizes automatically adapt to browser window size use < and > keys for additional control ( or - and + keys on number pad ) Switching off JavaScript reveals all slides
Now move to next slide to see how it works
For handouts , its often useful to include extra notes using a div element with class = " handout " following each slide , as in : < div class = " slide " > ... your slide content ... </div> < div class = " handout " > ... stuff that only appears in the handouts ... </div>
What you need to do Each presentation is a single XHTML file
Each slide is enclosed in < div class = " slide " > ... </div>
Use regular markup within each slide
The document head includes three links : ( required ) to the slide show style sheet for presentations : http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/show.css ( required ) to the slide show script : http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/slidy.js ( optional ) to the slide show style sheet for printed handouts : http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/print.css < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " lang= " en " xml:lang= " en " > < head > < title > Slide Shows in XHTML </ title > < meta name= " copyright " content = " Copyright © 2005 your copyright notice " /> < link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text / css " media= " screen , projection " href = " http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/show.css " /> < script src= "
http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/slidy.js " type =" text / javascript " ></ script > < style type =" text/css " > <!-- your custom style rules --> </ style > < link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text / css " media= " print " href = " http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/print.css "
/> </head >
To get the W3C Style The head element should include the following link to the style sheet : < link rel= " stylesheet " type =" text / css " media= " screen , projection " href = "
http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/w3c-blue.css " />
The body element 's content should start with the following markup : < div class= " background " > < img id =" head - icon " alt = " graphic with four colored squares " src= " http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/icon-blue.png " align = " left " /> < object id =" head - logo " title = " W3C logo " type = " image /svg+xml " data= " http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/w3c-logo.svg " >< img alt = " W3C logo " id =" head - logo - fallback " src= " http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/w3c-logo-blue.gif " align = " right " /></object > </div>
This adds the logos on the top left and right corners of the slide .
You are of course welcome to create your own slide designs .
To use it off - line
The following files must be copied on your local machine in a folder / directory .../ Slidy of your own choice : slidy.js
show.css
print.css
If you use the W3C style , then you also need : w3c-blue.css keys.jpg icon-blue.png w3c-logo-blue.svg w3c-logo-blue.gif
The simplest thing is to use cvs to check out the whole directory , but remember to periodically check for updates
You then have two choices :
Use relative URIs depending on your local setup to access the appropriate files .
Use the same directory structure as on the W3C server , ie , " .../2005 / Talks /... " .
Run a
Web server on your machine so that the directory above can be accessed via http://localhost/Talks/Tools/Slidy and use the URIs of the form " / Talks / Tools / Slidy / show.css " , " / Talks / Tools / Slidy / slidy.js " .
In both cases you can then publish your files on the W3C server unchanged .
Generate a Title Page
If you want a separate title page , the first slide should be as follows : < div class = " slide cover " > < img src= " http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/keys.jpg " alt =" Cover page images ( keys ) " class= " cover " /> < br clear = " all " /> <h1>HTML Slidy : Slide Shows in XHTML </ h1 > < p > < a href= " http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/ "
>Dave Raggett , </a > < a href= " mailto:dsr@w3.org " >dsr@w3.org </a></p> </div>
The style sheet looks for the class " cover " on div and img elements
Incremental display of slide contents
For incremental display , use class= " incremental " , for instance : First bullet point
Second bullet point
Third bullet point which is marked up as follows : < ul class= " incremental " >
< li >
First bullet point </ li > < li>Second bullet point </ li > < li > Third bullet point </ li > </ul > < p class= " incremental " > which is marked up as follows : </ p> < pre class= " incremental " > ... </ pre>
You can use class= " incremental " on the following elements ul , ol , dl , div , p , pre , blockquote , li , dt , dd , span , img , object , address , table , tr , th , td and h2 to h6
Make your images scale with the browser window size
For adaptive layout , use percentage widths on images , together with CSS positioning : CSS positioning is simpler and more reliable than using tables < div class = " slide " >
< h1 > Analysts -
" Open standards programming will become mainstream , focused around VoiceXML " </ h1 > <!-- use CSS positioning and scaling for adaptive layout --> < img src=" trends.png " width = " 50 % " style = " float: left " alt = " projected growth of VoiceXML " /> < blockquote style = " float:right ; width : 35 % " >
VoiceXML will dominate the voice environment , due to its flexibility and eventual multimodal capabilities </ blockquote > < br clear = " all " /> < p style = " text - align : center " > Source Data Monitor , March 2004 </ p> </div >
Incremental display of layered images
These can be marked up using CSS relative positioning , e.g. < div class= " incremental " style = " margin - left : 4em ; position : relative " > < img src=" face1.gif " alt =" face " style= " position : static ; vertical - align : bottom " /> < img src=" face2.gif " alt = " eyes " style= " position : absolute ; left : 0 ; top : 0 " /> < img src=" face3.gif " alt =" nose " style= " position : absolute ; left : 0 ; top : 0 " /> < img src=" face4.gif " alt =" mouth " style= " position : absolute ; left : 0 ; top : 0 " /> </div>
You should also use transparent GIF images to avoid the IE / Win bug for alpha channel in PNG .
A fix is expected in IE 7 .
A work around is available on skyzyx.com .
My thanks to ACID2 for the graphics .
Include SVG Content Inclusion of SVG content can be done using the object element , for example : has been achieved by : < object data= " example.svg " type = " image / svg+xml " width = " 50 % " height = " 10 % " title= " Indian Office logo " > < img src=" example.png " width = " 50 % " alt = " Indian Office logo " /> </object >
This ensures that the enclosed png is displayed when the browser has no plugin installed or can't display SVG directly .
However , there are caveats , see the next slide !
Caveats with SVG + object
There is a serious bug in IE6 + Adobe Plugin that can create problems .
Namely : IE6 makes a copy of the SVG file on the local disc when displaying it ; but does n't pass the original URI to the plugin
As a result relative references from within the SVG to external resources ( scripts , CSS , images , other SVG ) will break .
The work around is to use absolute references within your SVG .
This problem does n't effect Mozilla / Firefox .
No idea as to whether it will be fixed in IE7 .
On Windows , the Adobe SVG plugin does n't respect the CSS z - index property , and if used on backgrounds will always show through other content .
Some browsers ( e.g. Opera 8 ) only support SVG
Tiny , which does n't support external style sheets or style elements within SVG .
The work around is to set the properties via style attributes on the corresponding elements .
In principle , browsers should honor the version attribute and fall back to the alternative within the object element if they do n't support the version used by a given SVG file .
Are there any tools for downgrading SVG to SVG Tiny ?

This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100 % accurate .
Systems like Mass Effect 2's Cerberus Network , Dragon
Age 's DLC network and upcoming launch add - ons for Bad Company 2 are all part of something EA calls " Project Ten Dollar " .
That 's according to a report in BusinessWeek talking about CEO John Riccitiello 's plan to reduce second - hand sales , which the company makes no money from .
The idea , apparently green - lit last autumn , is to include a coupon or redeemable code with every new game which gives the buyer another chunk of content .
Without that code , second - hand buyers will have to spend $ 10 to obtain the missing extras .
Riccitiello told BusinessWeek that despite 11 straight quarters of losses EA is on the up again thanks to its 2010 line - up and strategies like Project Ten Dollar .
" You see a six - foot hole that we 're in .
I 'm telling you that we were in a 20 - foot hole and we 've climbed 14 feet out of it , " he said .
As well as providing consumers more reasons to buy games new rather than second - hand , EA also plans to try and stop people trading their games in by tacking multiplayer onto everything - something that rival Ubisoft this week said it was also planning to do .
But the old regime ’s attack squads are relentless and shameless .
The Obama administration , which put the brakes on any new investigations into Bush - Cheney national security malfeasance upon taking office , will sooner or later have to strike back .
Once the Bush - Cheney failures in Iraq , Afghanistan and Iran again come home to roost , as they undoubtedly and explosively will , someone will have to remind our amnesia - prone nation who really enabled America ’s enemies in the run-up to 9/11 and in its aftermath .

There ’s a good reason why Rove ’s memoir is titled “ Courage and Consequence , ” not “ Truth or Consequences . ”
Its spin is so uninhibited that even “ Brownie , you ’re doing a heck of a job ! ” is repackaged with an alibi .
The book ’s apolitical asides are as untrustworthy as its major events .
For all Rove ’s self - proclaimed expertise as a student of history , he writes that eight American presidents assumed office “ as a result of the assassination or resignation of their predecessor . ”
( He ’s off by only three . )
After a peculiar early narrative detour to combat reports of his late adoptive father ’s homosexuality , Rove burnishes his family values cred with repeated references to his own happy heterosexual domesticity .
This , too , is a smoke screen : Readers learned months before the book was published that his marriage ended in divorce .
Rove ’s overall thesis on the misbegotten birth of the Iraq war is a stretch even by his standards .
“ Would the Iraq war have occurred without W.M.D. ? ” he writes .
“ I doubt it . ”
He claims that Bush would have looked for other ways “ to constrain ” Saddam Hussein had the intelligence not revealed Iraq ’s “ unique threat ” to America ’s security .
Even if you buy Rove ’s predictable ( and easily refuted ) claims that the White House neither hyped , manipulated nor cherry - picked the intelligence , his portrait of Bush as an apostle of containment is absurd .
And morally offensive in light of the carnage that followed .
As Col. Lawrence Wilkerson , Colin Powell ’s former chief of staff , said on MSNBC , it ’s “ not a very comforting thing ” to tell the families of the American fallen “ that if the intelligence community in the United States , on which we spend about $ 60 billion a year , had n’t made this colossal failure , we probably would n’t have gone to war . ”
Rove and his book are yesterday .
Keep America
Safe is on the march .
Liz Cheney ’s crackpot hit squad achieved instant notoriety with its viral video demanding the names of Obama Justice Department officials who had served as pro bono defense lawyers for Guantánamo Bay detainees .
The video branded these government lawyers as “ the Al Qaeda Seven ” and juxtaposed their supposed un-American activities with a photo of Osama bin Laden .
As if to underline the McCarthyism implicit in this smear campaign , the Cheney ally Marc Thiessen ( one of the two former Bush speechwriters now serving as Washington Post columnists ) started spreading these charges on television with a giggly , repressed hysteria uncannily reminiscent of the snide Joe McCarthy henchman Roy Cohn .
This McCarthyism has not advanced nearly so far as the original brand .
Among those who have called out Keep America Safe for its indecent impugning of honorable Americans ’ patriotism are Kenneth Starr , Lindsey Graham and former Bush administration lawyers in the conservative Federalist Society .
When even the relentless pursuer of Monicagate is moved to call a right - wing jihad “ out of bounds , ” as Starr did in this case , that ’s a fairly good indicator that it ’s way off in crazyland .
In the wake of Washington 's health - care overhaul , some companies are taking big one - time charges for anticipated costs , fanning tension with the administration over the legislation 's impact on corporate America .
Three companies that were among vocal opponents of the legislation have warned they would see an immediate impact on their earnings as a result of the loss of deductions on tax - free subsidies they receive for providing retiree prescription - drug benefits .
On Thursday , Deere & Co. said it would take a $ 150 million one - time charge in the current quarter related to the loss of deductions .
Earlier in the week , Caterpillar Inc. reported a $ 100 million charge and AK Steel recorded a $ 31 million charge .
Beginning in 2006 , companies have received a 28 % federal subsidy , up to $ 1,330 per retiree , tax - free , to help pay for prescription - drug coverage .
Until now , companies could deduct the subsidy from their taxes , essentially getting a second benefit from the money .
Under the new law , companies will no longer be able to deduct the subsidy , but it remains tax - free .
Although the changes do n't go into effect until 2013 , companies say they have to take the charge to earnings now , to reflect the loss of the future tax deductions .
In all , the S&P 500 companies will take a combined hit of $ 4.5 billion to first - quarter earnings , estimates David Zion , an analyst with Credit Suisse .
Burial cloth found in Jerusalem cave casts doubt on authenticity of Turin Shroud
Archaeologists have discovered the first known burial shroud in Jerusalem from the time of Christ 's crucifixion - and say it casts serious doubt on the claimed authenticity of the Turin Shroud .
Ancient shrouds from the period have been found before in the Holy Land , but never in Jerusalem .
Researchers say the weave and design of the shroud discovered in a burial cave near Jerusalem 's Old City are completely different to the Turin Shroud .
Discovery :
The shrouded body of a man was found in this sealed chamber of a cave in the Hinnom Valley , overlooking the Old City of Jerusalem
Radiocarbon tests and artefacts found in the cave prove almost beyond doubt that it was from the same time of Christ 's death .
It was made with a simple two - way weave - not the twill weave used on the Turin Shroud , which textile experts say was introduced more than 1,000 years after Christ lived .
And instead of being a single sheet like the famous item in Turin , the Jerusalem shroud is made up of several sections , with a separate piece for the head .
Professor Shimon Gibson , the archaeologist who discovered the tomb , said ancient writings and contemporary shrouds from other areas had suggested this design , and the Jerusalem shroud finally provided the physical evidence .
The debate over the Turin Shroud will not go away .
Last month a Vatican researcher said she had found the words ' Jesus Nazarene ' on the shroud , proving it was the linen cloth which was wrapped around Christ 's body .
Tests : DNA analysis of the fibres of the Jerusalem shroud , left , have revealed it dates back to the time of Christ 's death .
Experts say it casts doubt on the authenticity of the Turin Shroud , right
Barbara Frale said computer analysis of photographs of the shroud revealed extremely faint words written in Greek , Aramaic and Latin which attested to its authenticity .
But the shroud - wrapped body dated to the time of Christ discovered in Jerusalem seems to point in the opposite direction .
The shroud was found around the remains of a man in a sealed chamber of a burial cave in the Hinnom Valley overlooking the Old City of Jerusalem by archaeologists from the Hebrew University and the Albright Research Institute , both in Jerusalem .
DNA tests indicated the man had suffered from leprosy and died of tuberculosis .
That was probably why his burial cave was sealed - a move that preserved the shroud and even some of the man 's hair for 2,000 years .
The Turin Shroud , which measures 14ft by 3ft , is unlike the burial practice of the time which used separate sheets for the head and body of the deceased
Find :
The new shroud was discovered in a sealed cave in the Hinnom Valley near Jerusalem 's Old City
Professor Gibson said the Turin Shroud did not fit what was known of burial practices in first - century Palestine - now confirmed by the Jerusalem shroud .
' The Turin shroud is a single sheet made with a twill weave .
' The twill weave is known from this part of the world only from the mediaeval period , so we 're talking about something that 's from the Middle Ages , ' Gibson told the Daily Mail .
' But the Jerusalem shroud confirmed another local practice which casts even more doubt on the Turin artefact .
' It was n't one continuous sheet , ' said Gibson , pointing out the Turin Shroud is a single rectangular sheet measuring about 14ft by 3ft .
' What our shroud shows is that the practice of having a separate shroud or wrapping for the body and for the head was common practice .
' There was a separate wrapping for the head itself , which was very important because when they brought someone to burial they would place the head wrapping separately on the face in case the person was n't actually dead and woke up again , they would be able to blow off the face wrapping and shout for help , ' said Gibson .
Evidence : Archaeologist Shimon Gibson , centre , said tests had revealed the man suffered from leprosy and died from tuberculosis
' This did occur quite a lot in antiquity because they did n't have the medical means we have today .
' The idea was that if you enshrouded somebody , you had a separate set of wrappings for the body and a separate set of wrappings for the head , ' he said .
Ancient rabbinical writings mention people who woke up , apparently miraculously and lived for years afterwards .
It was the custom at the time for the family to visit the tomb after three days to check their relative was indeed dead .
Gibson said this was probably the source of the Gospel story about Jesus 's followers visiting his tomb three days after the Crucifixion , when they found it empty .

The chamber may have been sealed because he suffered from tuberculosis
The Hinnom Valley where the Jerusalem shroud was discovered has long been associated with death .
The Gospel of Matthew calls it Akeldama or ' Field of Blood . '
It is dotted with Roman - era burial tombs carved out of caves in the rock face .
In ancient times , pagan tribes burned children alive there as offerings to the god Moloch .
The ancient Israelites called the valley Gehinnom - the Hebrew for ' Hell ' - and it was the site where the scapegoat was driven over a cliff on the Day of Atonement in Solomon 's Temple .
LOOK at an ancient coin under ordinary light and the chances are that its features , worn down by its passage from hand to hand , will be hard to make out .
Point a spotlight at it , though , so that the face of the coin is illuminated from an acute angle , and the resulting shadows will emphasise any minor details .
This is the basic principle behind a novel technique that is helping archaeologists reveal previously invisible clues hidden in the worn or damaged surfaces of any objects they uncover .
From wall paintings in Herculaneum to Scandinavian stone tools to rock art in Libya , polynomial texture mapping , as the process is known , is proving an invaluable way to illuminate the past .
The Antikythera in a new light
The lighting method was originally developed by Tom Malzbender , a computer scientist at HP 's laboratory in Palo Alto , California , to generate better 3 - D imagery for computer games .
In its most basic form , the process involves capturing between 30 and 50 digital photos of an object of interest .
The pictures are taken from directly above the object in a darkened room .
Though the camera is fixed , the object is lit from a different angle in every shot .
The photos are then combined on a computer to create an image that can have a “ virtual ” light shone from various angles to reveal any hidden surface detail .
The wavelength of this virtual light can also be changed using the computer , allowing colour - sensitive details of the artefact 's surface to be brought out more clearly .
Graeme Earl of the University of Southampton , in England , has used the technique to study wall plaster from the Neolithic settlement of Catalhoyuk in Turkey and artefacts including consular brick stamps found at Portus , an ancient harbour at the mouth of the Tiber .
He has also carried out trials which suggest that the use of a high - speed video camera can accelerate the process , so that it can be used in the field .
The technique has also been used to increase the number of readable characters on the Antikythera mechanism — a badly corroded geared device that spent more than 2,000 years at the bottom of the sea — from 800 to more than 2,000 .
It has also enhanced cuneiform inscriptions — markings made in clay tablets dating back as far as 3000 BC that are the earliest known form of writing .
Many video games , from “ Tomb Raider ” onwards , borrow from archaeology .
It is nice to see video - game technology returning the favour .
Sadly , the larger meaning of this is completely lost on her fans :
Sarah Palin drew a straight line from Alaska to Alberta as she told a sold - out , largely adoring crowd in Calgary that the province gets her message of less government , lower taxes and development of natural resources .
In what was billed as her first Canadian appearance since stepping down as governor of Alaska last summer , Ms. Palin 's trademark folksy charm was on full display Saturday night .[..]
The vocal opponent of health - care reform in the U.S. steered largely clear of the topic except to reveal a tidbit about her life growing up not far from Whitehorse .
“ We used to hustle over the border for health care we received in Canada , ” she said .
“ And I think now , is n't that ironic ? ”
Well yes , Sarah , you could call it " ironic " that you feel no compunction about running across the border to avail yourself of the health care you fight and lie and propagandize against to keep your fellow Americans from enjoying .
Or you could call it " grossly hypocritical . "
However , I prefer to think of it as " brainlessly missing the picture " and hoping to take a bunch a tea baggers down with you .
If we indeed had " the best health care system in the world " , why would anyone go to Canada ?
Because it was free ?
Because you did n't need to decide whether the need for a doctor was important enough to pay the associated costs , even if it meant forgoing a few meals or a payment elsewhere ?
Because you felt you had a RIGHT to good health and the Canadian government agreed that it is in everyone 's best interest ?
Was the socialized medicine safety net of Canada frightening ?
Of course not .
It was a social service that Palin used when she needed ... even though she presumably paid no taxes into the Canadian system ( remember how important it was to the GOP to make sure illegal immigrants could n't milk the system ) .
But will any one of her fans or the nut case tea - baggers screaming about how Obama wants to turn us into some socialist state ever put two and two together and realize it 's something we should aspire to ?
Of course not .
Personal income in 42 states fell in 2009 , the Commerce Department said Thursday .
Nevada 's 4.8 % plunge was the steepest , as construction and tourism industries took a beating .
Also hit hard : Wyoming , where incomes fell 3.9 % .
Incomes stayed flat in two states and rose in six and the District of Columbia .
West Virginia had the best showing with a 2.1 % increase .
In Maine , Kentucky and Hawaii , increased government benefits , such as unemployment insurance and Social Security , offset drops in earnings and property values .
Nationally , personal income from wages , dividends , rent , retirement plans and government benefits declined 1.7 % last year , unadjusted for inflation .
One bright spot :
As the economy recovered , personal income was up in all 50 states in the fourth quarter compared with the third .
Connecticut , again , had the highest per capita income of the 50 states at $ 54,397 in 2009 .
Mississippi ranked lowest at $ 30,103 .

It might be hard for people to believe that large parts of California are still in major housing bubbles .
The truth is many California cities are still dwelling in the shadow of the bubble era prices pretending as if they really have corrected .
Yet much of this is lost in aggregate data that looks at statewide data or county level prices .
Why ?
The flood of toxic mortgages and lower priced homes in areas like the Inland Empire has caused home sales to go up but at the lower end of the market .
What this did was lower the median statewide home price by nearly 50 percent ( we ’re still swimming at the bottom of the barrel ) while many cities still remain in large bubbles like Culver City , Pasadena , and Cerritos .
It is n’t enough to show a few basic examples but we will try today to pull inflation , housing , and sales data specific to California and Los Angeles to drill down into the actual trend .
What we will find is that many areas are very much elevated to bubble level prices .
What we will be looking at is data from January of 2001 to December of 2009 .
I was fortunate enough to dig up median zip code data for 263 zip codes in Los Angeles County from January of 2001 .
I then compared these zip codes to their latest median price data in December of 2009 .
This will provide us a better analysis of what is happening in the market over the bubble decade at a very micro level .
Keep in mind from 2000 to the summer of 2007 virtually every area in California went up to bubble levels :
What has occurred is the lower end of the market has corrected and as we will see , has now come close to being in line with inflation adjusted levels while certain counties like Los Angeles and Orange remain in elevated levels that have no economic justification aside from being in a bubble .
These are the areas with a large amount of shadow inventory but also Alt - A and option ARM products .
Round two of the California housing correction will hit these areas next .
In fact , many of the cities in these zip codes have not fully corrected and the overall median price has fallen because of their lower priced zip codes .
First let us look at some economic measures over this time frame :
The Bureau of Labor and Statistics ( BLS ) largely missed the entire housing bubble both in California and nationwide because they focus on a dubious form of home price indicators named owners ’ equivalent of rent ( OER ) .
As we demonstrated in the Cerritos example , if you focus on the rental value of a home only you will miss the fact that in some markets people will bid homes up to bubble levels .
So for the entire decade the measure looked at what you would likely get for renting your own home but this completely missed the decade of housing inflation .
As the chart above shows , rents went up by 32 percent and homeowners ’ equivalent of rent went up by 26 percent for California .
This of course is technically right since mortgages like option ARMs allowed you to pay out a tiny amount per month while allowing people to overpay for the actual home .
I remember folks telling me about paying $ 1,500 per month on a $ 500,000 pay option ARM teaser mortgage .
These homes would have rented for $ 1,750 to $ 2,000 in many cases so guess what ?
The OER missed all of this of course because a 30 year mortgage would yield a housing payment of $ 3,000 or higher depending on the down payment .
But what we can gather from the above is that rents went up by 32 percent .
That is one piece of the puzzle so far .
Also keep in mind that in many areas including Los Angeles rents have fallen in the last year because of the massive amounts of inventory but also ( more importantly ) the troubled economy .
But over this time period , how much did the income of families go up ?
Source : Census , Current Population Survey
Over this period the median family income in California went up by 24 percent .
We do n’t have data on 2009 but given California ’s underemployment rate hit over 20 percent last year , we can actually assume that income went down last year .
So we ’re starting to see at least a trend for incomes and rents over this period .
The increase of general prices seems to fall between 24 and 32 percent .
Let us look at the overall CPI for the U.S. , California , and Los Angeles ( we ’ll be focusing on L.A. primarily in this article ) :
One thing that is part of the smoke and mirrors of the real estate industry is the argument that home prices and everything else for that matter is always more expensive in California .
For the last few decades maybe so , but a flat screen here will probably cost the same as it does in Texas .
If it does n’t you can order it online .
What is also not factored into these equations is Californian ’s will usually pay less on heating and electricity bills due to the weather .
So in a few areas we do pay less .
But the one thing the real estate industry harps on is housing prices .
The above data is the CPI for all items , housing included .
What you ’ll see is that even though California prices and L.A. prices went up higher than the nationwide data , it is n’t that big of a difference .
Certainly not enough to justify housing values going from $ 200,000 to $ 505,000 in Southern California for example from 2000 to 2007 .
As is the case much of this rise in prices was spurred by toxic mortgages like Alt - A and option ARMs but also the subprime mess .
But what you will see is that over this period of time the CPI , family incomes , rents , and OER all went up between 24 and 32 percent with the overall measure for Los Angeles going up 28 percent .
Now this is important because it gives you a sense of where prices should go thanks to the fiat money joy machine of the Federal Reserve .
Multiple studies including those from Robert Shiller have shown that over time real estate tracks inflation .
So if the general price level went up by 28 percent in Los Angeles you would imagine that home prices would track closely to this trend .
They have not :
Now the above is essentially the story of California and the burst of the bubble in some areas .
The lower priced areas like Riverside and San Bernardino even though they went up in values exponentially during the bubble as well have now largely corrected to come in line with the general inflation levels of the state .
In other words , if you are looking at data from January of 2001 to December of 2009 these areas are actually under the statewide inflation rate .
Yet that does n’t necessarily mean it is a good time to buy since the economy of these areas is mired in unemployment .
And these areas have seen the largest volume of home sales ( a large bulk of investors ) .
But look at Los Angeles and Orange counties .
These areas are still in big bubbles .
We have shown the shadow inventory of Los Angeles and Orange in great detail .
If these areas are up not because of incomes and certainly not because of the inflation rate then why are they still elevated ?
Why ?
They are still showing bubble like metrics because the middle of the market is still harboring mania like behaviors .
The numbers above show that Los Angeles is by far the most over priced county with Orange County right on its back .
But this in itself does n’t tell the entire story .
If it did , then the above data on San Diego would seem to be in line with inflation data since San Diego over this period of time went up by 35 percent .
But keep in mind where the bulk of the sales are occurring and you start seeing a very familiar pattern .
Also , San Diego inflated earlier on so the correction hit first as well .
The lower end is skewing the data while the mid to upper tier of the market remains with bubble like valuations .
As many long time readers may know , I enjoy digging through the data .
I have little room for the “ touchy feely ” reasons realtors give for why prices are high in some areas .
These are the same people that thought putting home buyers into homes with Alt - A and option ARMs was a smart idea .
They clearly are the last people you want to go for regarding advice on bigger economic trends .
So I managed to dig up data on 263 zip codes in Los Angeles from January of 2001 .
I decided to line these up with their current valuations as of December of 2009 .
This is important because it cuts to the core of what is happening in the current market but also exposes which cities are in bubbles .
First , let us look at the most over priced zip codes in Los Angeles :
Now what you ’ll find are a few usual Real Home of Genius suspects here .
We see a handful of Westside zip codes but also areas like Culver City .
Now look at those median price changes from January of 2001 to December of 2009 and remember the charts above showing the actual inflation for the area and also income gains .
All these zip codes are in bubbles , plain and simple .
The 90232 zip code in Culver City went up from $ 317,000 in 2001 to the current $ 769,000 mark .
This is unsupportable by any metric .
Take a look at another area like Arcadia .
It went from $ 312,000 to $ 770,000 or a price increase of 149 percent .
Nothing can justify this price increase .
And as we know with areas that have corrected , when there is no economic reason for a price support level values will come down .
This bubble ran from 1997 to 2007 in California !
So those thinking a two or three year correction will fix everything have another thing coming their way .
The first zip code above in West Hollywood is hard to use since it is only based on 2 home sales for December of 2009 .
But look at Encino .
From $ 405,000 to $ 1,287,000 in this time .
And December even saw more home sales !
All of the above areas are perfect examples of areas that will see prices come down .
Yet in the midst of things , there are also a handful of zip codes in Los Angeles that are actually cheaper both nominally and inflation adjusted from January of 2001 :
Now this is an interesting mix of data here .
First , take a look at Lancaster and Palmdale .
Of the top 15 most over priced areas 156 homes sold in December of 2009 .
One zip code in Lancaster ( 93535 ) almost matched that number by itself ( 147 homes sold ) .
Palmdale had 126 homes sold .
But look at the prices .
Now you would n’t expect to see Malibu and Bel - Air in the same chart as Lancaster and Palmdale but there it is above .
And for an area like Malibu with such few home sales , it is hard to say what is really going on because a few $ 10 million home sales can suddenly push data into another level .
But the pattern is unmistakable .
Some areas have fallen and fallen hard .
But the majority of areas in Los Angeles have not .
I ran further analysis on the 263 zip codes .
The overall Los Angeles inflation increase from January of 2001 to December of 2009 was 28 percent .
Now out of 263 zip codes analyzed how many had increases of less than 28 percent ?
Only 29 fit these criteria .
In fact , we have 206 zip codes that are still registering increases of 50 percent or more !
Los Angeles is still largely over priced aside from a few exceptions .
And all this data blends in with the trend in million dollar homes sales :
Now why is this occurring ?
Because the FHA insured loan market is backing 4 out of 10 mortgages in Southern California and only requires a 3.5 % down payment .
Is it any wonder the FHA is registering record defaults ?
The limit is $ 729,750 for FHA insured loans .
So these million dollar home sales are dwindling because the Alt - A market and jumbo loan market is done and many were bought with these absurd loans during the heyday of the bubble .
The lower end was saturated with subprime loans .
Now the lower end is being dominated by first time buyers and investors .
As we have shown , some areas are actually under cutting the inflation rate for the region .
But what about the bulk of the mid tier market ?
This market is now full of delusional folks going after bubble 2.0 with government backed loans .
The high - high end of the market is hurting because you need to go the conventional route .
But that middle of the road market is still being sustained with government backed loans and folks paying bubble level prices .
But just because it is being propped up right now does n’t mean it will remain that way .
The above data clearly shows that the bubble is alive in well in many areas in California especially in Los Angeles County .
All bubbles over time will pop and this is no exception .

Update :
The Minister followed up his attacks today , see below .
During yesterday 's Question Time , Communications Minister Stephen Conroy again faced questions about the Rudd Government 's highly unpopular push to introduce mandatory , nationwide internet censorship .
In his answer , the Minister accused this organisation of misleading the public and international organisations .
We relish the opportunity to respond and set the record straight .
The minister was asked by Senator Boyce about the reaction of international watchdog Reporters Without Borders , who have written an open letter to the Prime Minister and recently added Australia to a watch list of countries with worrying internet censorship trends . [ 1 ]
Senator Conroy , in his answer , asserted that RWB were simply misled and continued :
Senator Conroy :
What we have announced is perfectly clear .
Anyone in this chamber or anyone who talks to Reporters Without Borders who tries to suggest that anything other than material included in the RC classification is subject to the filter is misleading all Australians .
Let me be very clear : the material under the RC classification is material like child pornography , pro-rape websites and pro-bestiality websites — material of that nature .
You can not buy it on DVD and you can not buy it a book store .
RWB have not been misled by EFA or anybody else .
( In any case , they have not had a special briefing from us . )
Neither they nor EFA are suggesting that the scope of the filter is broader than what is proposed , or that the Minister is hoping to use it to block dissenting political speech .
Australia has not been placed on the " Internet enemies " list with Iran or China , but has been flagged as a country of concern .
That concern is simply this :
That a tolerant and liberal democracy such as Australia is taking the first steps down a path of secretive and automated censorship of the Internet .
Reporters Without Borders are not alone in appreciating the enormous potential of the internet in bolstering freedom of expression , a freedom under assault in many countries around the world .
This struggle has recently been fully embraced by the U.S. Government .
The policy being championed by Senator Conroy is exactly counter to the ideals of complete openness that are being championed by these other entities .
EFA understands very well that the filter will be targeting RC - Refused Classification - material .
Asserting this does not dispel our concerns nor those of many other organisations and individuals .
As the Minister likes to point out , a subset of RC content is universally unwelcome , such as the illegal ( child pornography ) or that depicting bestiality or extreme sexual violence .
However , at the edges of the RC category lies much more controversial material .
Euthanasia , information on safe drug use , and adult material depicting particular fetishes would all certainly be blocked .
Setting aside questions of the filter 's effectiveness , other concerns include the opaque and undemocratic nature of a secret blacklist not open to public scrutiny , and the virtual inevitability of an expansion of the list 's scope by this or a future government .
EFA has never maintained that the Government intends to use the filter to stifle political debate .
The fact remains that , although the filter is designed with a different purpose in mind , what we are going to get is a mandatory and secret system that could one day be used for that purpose .
It is this fact that concerns Reporters Without Borders , and concerns many Australians as well .
There is a widespread impression that the Minister , in lieu of tackling the issues , has sought to frame the debate in terms of those who want to do something about child pornography , and those who do n't care enough about the problem .
This is something EFA has indeed taken issue with in the past .
Senator Boyce followed up her question by asking :
Senator Boyce : Is n’t Reporters Without Borders right when it states , ‘ Even though a true national debate on the subject is needed , Senator Conroy has made such a discussion very problematic by branding his critics as child pornography advocates ’?
The Minister responded :
Senator Conroy : Once again the material that has been supplied to Reporters Without Borders comes from Electronic Frontiers Australia , who have been challenged publicly on a number of occasions to produce a quote where I have ever said that .
It should go without saying that RWB have not been coached by us or approached us for comment on this particular issue ; they have come to that conclusion on their own .
In any case , here are two occasions on which the Minister is on record wielding the spectre of child pornography to deflect the issue .
Firstly , in one of the first public pronouncements of the policy , the Minister stated :
If people equate freedom of speech with watching child pornography , then the Rudd - Labor Government is going to disagree . [ 2 ]
On another occasion , when answering a question on the filter put to him by Greens Senator Scott Ludlam during a Senate Estimates hearing , the Minister dodged the question using this device :
Senator Ludlam – Just let me finish .
In terms of the countries that you have just listed for me , it is mandatory or is it an opt - in system that , for example , concerned parents could take advantage of ?
Senator Conroy – Illegal material is illegal material .
Child pornography is child pornography .
I trust you are not suggesting that people should have access to child pornography . [ 3 ]
We maintain that these remarks do not reflect well on Senator Conroy .
Nobody , including EFA , have ever argued that the filter is a bad idea because child pornography is not worth combating .
Our argument is and has always been that the filter will be ineffective in doing so yet comes at enormous cost .
To rail against " people " for equating " freedom of speech with watching child pornography " is simply a cheap rhetorical trick .
We trust that with legislation imminent , we can move past such distractions .
Senator Conroy minced no words in singling out EFA and criticising our campaign against his policy , saying that " Electronic Frontiers Australia have run one of the most disgraceful misinformation campaigns and have misled Australians . "
We are aggressive in educating the public on the drawbacks of this and other policies that threaten our online freedoms , but take great pains to provide factual information and analysis to the Australian public .
If we have erred in any particular instance , then we welcome a correction .
That said , we have carefully considered the legalities and technical issues surrounding the policy and unreservedly stand by our assessment .
It will achieve nothing for parents and police , it will cost enormous amounts of money , and presents a real threat to our freedom of speech .
For the Government 's part , we have heard many frightening statements about internet bestiality , but are still awaiting a solid defence of this policy that references any evidence , study , or reputable expert that demonstrates this filter will help Australian children .
We challenge the Minister to produce such evidence .
For our part , EFA intends , as always , to stick to the facts .
The many flaws of this policy require no exaggeration .
Update : Today in question time the Minister also took the opportunity to further the attacks on EFA and its board , naming myself ( Colin Jacobs ) , Chair Nicolas Suzor and board member Geordie Guy as those chiefly responsible for a misinformation campaign being waged against the Australian public .
The specific charges stem from an article written by me for Crikey reporting on Reporters Without Borders open letter to the Prime Minister , and our supposed assertion that no child pornography is traded on the open internet .
These issues have been addressed comprehensively elsewhere .
Our argument is not that there is no child pornography on the web , but that the blacklist filter will not be effective in stopping it .
As for supposed inaccuracies being promulgated about the scope of the blacklist , this is largely due to a lack of policy clarity from the Government ; at its inception , the filter was to implement the current ACMA blacklist ( which is much broader than RC , including R - 18 + content ) , and it has only gradually changed .
A year ago , the Minister was still referring to " almost exclusively RC " before finally settling on RC .
Given the lack of a solid policy document , it 's no surprise there has been confusion amongst the public and international organisations .
Nevertheless , since this change we have been clear in our message - RC is broader than the Minister likes to let on , and he cannot guarantee that the scope will never increase any more than he can guarantee he will remain Minister forever .

The report reads : " Among the countries “ under surveillance ” are several democracies : Australia , because of the upcoming implementation of a highly developed Internet filtering system , and South Korea , where draconian laws are creating too many specific restrictions on Web users by challenging their anonymity and promoting self - censorship .

" Canada 's last two elections are proof positive that we have a flawed electoral system .
Does it make any sense that it 's impossible to get a government that reflects the views of the majority of our population ?
How is it that a little more than a third of the electorate can determine who forms Canada 's government ? "

Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
This is how I once began an article on the need for a Liberal - NDP - Green electoral coalition .
Find it here .
The article does n't deal in the abstract .
It includes a set of tables that I compiled from the 2008 Elections Canada data which provide the basis for determining that in a coalition , in the next election , the Liberals could win up to 125 seats , the NDP 46 , and the Green Party two seats -- for a majority government of 173 seats .
The Conservatives would be reduced to 92 members and the Bloc Quebecois to 41 .
In the last two elections , almost two - thirds of our electorate did not vote for the Conservatives , yet it is the Conservatives who formed the government .
This is a bizarre state of affairs .
As should be apparent to everyone , the majority vote was split amongst four parties , and with politics as usual , it is unlikely that this is going to change .
At present we have a dysfunctional political system in which the views of the majority of Canadians cannot be represented by a single political party .
Given what 's at stake , in the interests of Canada , the opposition parties have an obligation to reconsider their usual political strategies .
Several months back , with a similar message , I wrote to Michael Ignatieff , Jack Layton and Elizabeth May .
I also sent them my previously published article on the urgent need for an electoral coalition .
The article deals at length with the framework and the advantages of such a coalition .
Somehow I did n't expect a response , and I did n't get one .
Although the leaders appear determined to go on with politics as usual , I am now writing this open letter with a direct appeal to you members of parliament and to Elizabeth May to get your parties to try a different election strategy .
Conservative majority in reach
From all indications , if an election were to be held in the next while , it appears that the Conservatives may once again form a minority government , but it is not inconceivable that they could get a majority government .
Despite their recent success in appearing somewhat innocent and benign , there is no reason to believe that the party has turned its back on its original raison d'etre .
Given this , one term of office with a majority could enable them to carry out most of their underlying agenda and do irreparable harm to Canada 's social and economic fabric .
A different coalition this time
It should be made clear that an electoral coalition would be totally different from the Dec. 2008 coalition that included the Bloc Quebecois .
That coalition was discredited by the Conservatives largely because of two circumstances : 1 ) the Liberals had been soundly defeated a few weeks before , so for many people it was somewhat unseemly for Stephane Dion to suddenly want to become prime minister , and 2 ) although the Bloc was not formally part of the coalition and the NDP are far from being socialists , Harper , through distortion and lies , portrayed this as a " socialist " and " separatist " coalition .
At this stage , if the Liberals , the NDP and Greens established a formal coalition , before an election , it would be difficult for the Conservatives to try to discredit this .
Importantly , the Bloc would not be part of it .
The coalition should be upfront and in the open , as coalitions are in Europe and elsewhere .
It 's time that people in Canada came to realize that this is now the reality of the situation in our country -- that there is nothing wrong with the centre - left forming a coalition , with a combined platform that reflects the country 's political and ideological structure .
Despite entrenched party loyalties , what centre - left Canadians need is a new political entity which the Liberals , the NDP , and the Greens could form if they acted creatively and courageously .
If they did this it could be the dawn of a new era in Canada .

British intelligence service MI5 has discovered that Al Qaeda female suicide bombers are getting explosive charges inside their breasts , using a similar procedure to breast augmentation .
This makes bombs almost impossible to detect at airports .
But there 's something strange here .
Advertisement
The explosive devices are made of pentaerythritol tetranitrate — also known as PETN — one of the most powerful explosives in existence .
The surgeons performing the operations — reportedly trained in the United Kingdom — place the PETN devices inside bags , just like the ones used to hold the silicone gel inside breast implants .
PETN is difficult to detonate , however , even while it 's more sensitive to shock and friction than TNT .
It has an explosive energy of 5.810 kilojoules per gram , which means that an explosive cup C — with just a few grams of PETN inside — would be able to open a large hole in an airplane 's fuselage , effectively causing a crash .
Allegedly , MI5 — who picked up the information from Middle East terrorist chatter following the failed crotchbomber attempt — has also pointed out that some men terrorist are getting PETN - based devices into their buttocks , using the same surgical procedure .

It sounds scary .
It is scary .
When they are inside clothing or bags , you can easily detect PETN using scanners or chemical test swabs .
But the report says that these bombs would be almost impossible to detect when they are inside a body ... unless you install human body scanners at airports .

And that 's when things get oddly convenient for some companies , pushing hard for the installation of not - so - effective airport body scanners .
Just in the middle of the debate , which has rights and privacy watchers pup in arms , here 's a report that says that the only way to stop these highly dangerous naughty bits are body scanners .

I do n't doubt that MI5 's intentions are good this time — even while they were n't good at all back in the ramping up of misinformation before the Iraq invasion — but there 's something here that smells a bit fishy .
Actually , really fishy , since the " terrorism expert " quoted by the Sun and Fox News is none other than Joseph Farah , publisher of World Net Daily , Rush Limbaugh collaborator , and well known for questioning President Obama 's origins .
In other words , an extremist douchebag .

There ’s been a lot of talk recently about the remaining fixtures of the top three sides and how it might influence the whereabouts of this season ’s league title .
Heck , I was in on the act almost three weeks ago , just before the Chelsea game , when I stated that Arsenal ’s more generous fixture meant that at $ 10 they were a ridiculously good gamble for the title .
We were six points behind at that stage , the same as we are now , yet somehow have shortened to $ 7.50 .
But I digress .
There are two factors that could influence our ability to accurately predict whether we win the title ; predicting where our rivals will drop points and predicting where we might drop points .
The first is a difficult and ill - advised process that would take a fair amount of guesswork and generalising , so I ’ll steer clear .
The second is much easier .
Anyone who has watched enough of Arsenal this season will know how predictable their results have been .
Sure , we have won and lost our fair share of games , but they tend to be the same types of games .
This season has seen us lose six games ; two at home to Manchester United and Chelsea and four away to the big two as well as Manchester City and Sunderland , who were both in good early season form .
What is interesting is that virtually every time we have lost we have deserved to lose , the Old Trafford game an exception , and the opponents have played very well .
As well as the six losses we have drawn four matches ; three away from home against Burnley , West Ham and Villa and once at home against a resurgent Everton that then went on to beat United and Chelsea .
Two things stick out to me there ; first that in three out of the four games ( not including West Ham ) we were lucky to get a point and second that the three teams we drew with away have significantly better home records .
All of this can be basically summarised as the following :
We tend to lose to teams who are better than us
We tend to beat teams who are not as good as us and destroy them when at home
We tend to struggle more away from home against sides that have significantly better home records and are in good form
When teams outplay us , we generally tend to get a result better than our performance deserves
The first three points are as obvious Alex Song ’s armbands , but they tell us something very important .
We are a team that tends to beat the teams we should beat and struggle when we should struggle .
We lose the games you would expect us to lose , win the games you would expect us to win and draw games on tougher than average away trips against in - form teams .
It ’s not rocket science , but is revealing when applied to our season run-in .
Looking at our remaining fixtures that means :
Stoke ( A ) – WIN ( Stoke ’s home record is nowhere near as good as people think , compare it with Blackburn )
Burnley ( H ) – WIN
Hull ( A ) – WIN
West Ham ( H ) – WIN
Birmingham ( A ) – DRAW ( Although Birmingham ’s form appears to be on the slide )
Wolves ( H ) – WIN
Spurs ( A ) – DRAW
Wigan ( A ) – WIN ( Massive potential for a banana skin on Wigan ’s shoddy pitch )
Man City ( H ) – WIN
Blackburn ( A ) – DRAW ( Another big banana skin , Blackburn have won 8 from 12 although we always tend to beat them )
Fulham ( H ) – WIN ( Despite a good season , their away record is awful )
In some ways that is a generous prediction ( 27 points from 33 , no losses and an assumed win over City ) but in others it is quite conservative .
As I ’ve indicated Birmingham are running out of puff after their terrific unbeaten run , we have n’t lost to Spurs in a decade and we usually beat Blackburn , good home record or not .
In fact , we usually smash them .
The final thing to consider is the last point from the four I mentioned earlier : when teams outplay us we tend to get a better result than our performance deserves .
That is the reason why our position on the table tends to be surprise to be many people and why we it has been suggested that our presence in the top three indicates that the standard at the top has dropped this season .
It ’s funny , when the tendency to get points where it is not deserved is applied to Chelsea or United it is usually portrayed as a title - winning attribute .
But with us it indicates a drop in the standard of the competition ?
They wo n’t be saying that if we win the thing and judging by this analysis , we ’ll go damn close .
Thoughts ?

Ubuntu 's future 10.10 operating system is going to make a small , but contentious change to how file sizes are represented .
Like most other operating systems using binary prefixes , Ubuntu currently represents 1 kB ( kilobyte ) as 1024 bytes ( base - 2 ) .
But starting with 10.10 , a switch to SI prefixes ( base - 10 ) will denote 1 kB as 1000 bytes , 1 MB as 1000 kB , 1 GB as 1000 MB , and so on .
It was first reported that 10.04 Lucid Lynx would make the switch to base - 10 , but it was eventually delayed to lucid+1 ( 10.10 ) as all applications did n't comply with the new units policy and were still using base - 2 .
The new units policy establishes two basic guidelines : applications should use the IEC / binary prefix for base - 2 units and the SI prefix for base - 10 units .
The SI prefix should not be mixed with base - 2 units .
The exact policy from the wiki is outlined below :
Applications must use IEC standard for base - 2 units :
1 KiB ( kibibyte ) = 1,024 bytes ( Note : big k )
1 MiB ( mebibyte ) = 1,024 KiB = 1,048,576 bytes
1 GiB ( gibibyte ) = 1,024 MiB = 1,048,576 KiB = 1,073,741,824 bytes
1 TiB ( tebibyte ) = 1,024 GiB = 1,048,576 MiB = 1,073,741,824 KiB = 1,099,511,627,776 bytes
Applications must use SI standard for base - 10 units :
1 kB ( kilobyte ) = 1,000 bytes ( Note : small k )
1 MB ( megabyte ) = 1,000 kB = 1,000,000 bytes
1 GB ( gigabyte ) = 1,000 MB = 1,000,000 kB = 1,000,000,000 bytes
1 TB ( terabyte ) = 1,000 GB = 1,000,000 MB = 1,000,000,000 kB = 1,000,000,000,000 bytes
It is not allowed to use the SI standard for base - 2 units :
1 kB ≠ 1,024 bytes
KB ( with a big k ) does not exist
Additional implementation guidelines are also outlined : base - 10 should be used to represent network bandwidth and disk sizes while RAM sizes should use base - 2 .
File sizes can either be shown in both base - 10 and base - 2 , only base - 10 , or a user option to choose between the two ( but with base - 10 set as the default ) .
This new counting will finally put them in line with the standard Greek meaning of " kilo " as 1000 and will seek to alleviate the confusion that regular consumers often have when buying a new hard drive .
The pros are not exclusive of the cons though , as inconsistencies between different operating systems presents a troubling user experience dilemma .
Other new confusions that this would bring are also outlined in the wiki :
CD - ROM sizes are specified in MiB , but the manufacturers label this " MB " ( a " 700 MB " CD - ROM contains approximately 700 MiB = 737 MB ) .
Memory ( RAM , ROM ) is specified in base 2 , but labeled with SI prefixes .
For example , a " 512 MB " RAM contains 512 MiB = 536.9 MB .
Apple themselves moved over to base - 10 counting with the release of 10.6 Snow Leopard .
Previous Mac OS
X operating systems from 10.0 to 10.5 measured file and drive sizes in base - 2 .
Credit to Mephistopheles for the news tip .
Realist Fareed Zakaria did a great interview with King Abdullah of Jordan on Sunday where the King said over and over again what no one likes to hear in the U.S. : the Palestinian grievance is feeding all the problems in the region and stoking the Iran threat , and Obama is losing credibility .
The King said the two - state - solution is the only thing out there but it may be finished – we may have crossed that line in the sand on " the viability of a two - state solution " ( I think it ’s probably crossed , Kingster ) , and if it ’s a one - state solution , this will lead to instability in the region because the Israelis are so terrified of it .
( Agreed ; and this is part of the job of this website , whatever happens , to help my stockaded people climb down from old wooden ideas . )
Zakaria parrots two Israel - lobby threads to the King .
He says , Why should n’t the Palestinians fold into Jordan ?
And is n’t it , per Bernard Lewis , Arab repression that ’s feeding terrorism ?
Abdullah swats both aside .
Says that Palestinians are Palestinians ( as we reported here last month ; gee it would be nice if someone interviewed some goddamn Palestinians about what they think , I am really really curious ) .
As to progress , Abdullah says
Yes but even these efforts are stymied by the sense that a Zionist ( neocon ) plot is behind it .
I agree : ending the Israel / Palestine grievance would be a giant liberation throughout the Arab world .
Here are some of Abdullah ’s smart comments :
The strangest of all the very strange things about the strangest place on earth , North Korea , is that it 's surprisingly easy to go there .
Or at least , not as hard as it somehow ought to be .
I 'd always thought that it was only marginally less difficult than going to the moon or , say , Eton , but my amazing revelation is this : type " North Korea " and " tourism " into Google , and you 'll find Koryo Tours , a British - run , Beijing - based travel firm .
A couple of clicks and a certain amount of cash later , and you , too , could find yourself on a vintage Russian jetliner heading towards the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea .
It 's impossibly exciting .
And when Paul , the Australian sitting next to me , remarks , casually , that Air Koryo is considered unairworthy by the EU , it becomes , perhaps , just a little too exciting .
But then some rousing martial music strikes up over a crackling intercom , and air stewardesses wearing what looks like jet - age vintage – white gloves , natty hats , red lipstick – bring around the in - flight reading material : the Pyongyang Times .
The highlight of a recent firework spectacular , I learn , was a sky - writing display that read " Down With Imperialism " , although the top story concerns a visit by Kim Jong Il to the new September 26 Breeding Pig Farm .
" The country 's economy is growing remarkably through a series of big events in the flame of the new revolutionary upsurge , " he notes .
But then the flame of revolutionary upsurge is burning strongly among us , too .
There are 21 of us , from all parts of the globe , most of us reasonably well - travelled , with the exception of Dan , a twentysomething Canadian , who has selected North Korea for his first ever trip abroad .
( " No , Dan , " I hear someone say , possibly myself .
" In other countries , you are allowed to leave your hotel without being officially accompanied by a government guide . " ) .
And we 're all as excited as puppies .
Because barely 1,500 people a year visit North Korea .
Or , to put this in context , several thousand fewer than make it to the British Lawnmower Museum .
Collectively , we know more about a strimmer once owned by Joe Pasquale than we do about the nation that last May announced it had carried out a second successful underground nuclear test .
And as we land on an empty runway , and walk into an empty terminal , it feels like not unlike entering a fold in the space - time continuum .
Not least because our mobile phones are immediately confiscated .
The investment bankers in the group ( we have three of them , two of whom have been recently made redundant – there 's obviously something about having experienced the distintegrating edge of capitalism that makes North Korea an attractive holiday destination ) look like they might cry .
And yet , for what the West calls a rogue state , and George Bush the most easterly point on the axis of evil , it does n't seem very evil .
It takes a while to clear customs , not because our belongings are searched or we 're interrogated about the purpose of our visit , but because , as becomes clear when we see the luggage carousel , we 're the only passengers who 've failed to pack at least two flat - screen TVs .
And when we finally meet our guides by the departures board ( there are none until three days ' time ) , they 're smiling expansively : an older man , Mr Lee , and a pretty young woman in a fashionable coat , Miss Kim .
We trundle along empty roads towards Pyongyang , a " model " city of Soviet - style blocks and grandiose boulevards where only citizens with special permits can live or even visit .
Miss Kim tells us the name means " flat land " , and " the weather is neither too hot nor too cold with adequate precipitation " .
It 's just getting dark when we reach our hotel , the 47 - storey , 1,001 room , Yanggakdo , built on an island in the middle of the Taedong river .
There are perhaps three or four rooms with lights on .
But then this is more than in most of the apartment blocks we pass because , of all the things that North Korea is short of , it 's most short of electricity .
There 's a famous satellite shot of the Korean peninsula at night , a dark puddle in a sea of light .
Our hotel has electricity , but by 10 pm , from the magnificent revolving restaurant , the city simply vanishes from view .
Poof !
Like a cheap trick in a pantomime .
Now you see it , now you do n't , although it 's there again next morning , shimmering in the crisp winter light .
The upside of having no electricity is that because there 's very little industry , there 's very little pollution , and as we travel south out of Pyongyang , towards the Demilitarised Zone , almost no traffic .
It 's a four - lane highway , the key route south .
With no cars .
We stop at a roadside service station and are mesmerised by the lack of traffic : a bicycle passes .
And some time after that , a unit of soldiers marches past in what was meant to be the fast lane .
Because if you want to go somewhere in the DPRK , you walk .
Everywhere , criss - crossing the countryside , across fields and dirt roads , people are walking .
Who knows where they 're going ?
I scrape the ice off the inside of the bus window and peer out but the North Korean hinterland is an unknown , mysterious place .
We know almost as little about North Korea as the North Koreans know of us .
This state of affairs is n't helped by the fact that journalists are banned .
The last two to enter the country illegally were imprisoned until Bill Clinton intervened last year and negotiated their release .
I have special , rare dispensation as a travel writer because Nick Bonner , the founder of Koryo Tours , believes that the more the world engages with North Korea , the more North Korea will engage with the world .
And because I 've agreed in advance that I shan't write about North Korea 's human rights record or in any way insult the Dear Leader .
It 's strongly impressed on all of us before we leave that if we misbehave , it 's not us but our guides who'll bear the brunt of any " repercussions " .
I 've been allowed in as " a travel consultant " and in this capacity I 'm happy to report that visiting North Korea is surely one of the greatest holidays on earth .
You will see only what everyone else who goes to North Korea sees : which is what the North Korean government wants you to see .
In this , it reminds me of Hello ! magazine .
I 've always marvelled at how celebrities , given editorial control , choose to portray themselves .
And so it is with North Korea .
You may not get to see the " real " North Korea , but this " unreal " North Korea is a fascinating thing in and of itself .
Because this is tourism at its most perfected .
It 's like a cruise ship .
Every minute of every day has been pre-formulated and it's beautifully worked out : from the € 5 charge if you want to try the national speciality , dog soup , to the man with a video camera who follows our every move , and at the end of the tour produces a DVD of our visit set to martial victory music , and sells it back to us for € 40 a pop .
What you get a sense of , most acutely , is the country 's extreme isolation and paranoia , although after a few days in the country , it does n't seem as paranoid as all that .
" After President Bush named us as the axis of evil , he attacked first Afghanistan , then Iraq .
Are we next ? "
The relationship with the US affects everything : it fuels juche , the ideology of self - reliance , and its strategy of songun , putting the military first , and explains everything from the lack of electricity to the " Arduous March " , the famine in the late 90s when up to two million people died .
It 's not as bad as then , but the World Food Programme estimates a third of the population will go hungry this year without emergency aid .
Our food , on the other hand , is plentiful and not bad .
Even the dog soup is pretty good ( half of us reckon it tastes like lamb ; the other half , beef ) .
The highlight of the trip is a visit to Kim Il - sung 's mausoleum , an encounter that must qualify as the greatest touristic experience on earth .
( The " International Friendship Exhibition " in Mount Myohyang - san runs a close second .
It displays the 223,579 gifts given to Kim Il- sung , including a stuffed crocodile in bow tie and waistcoat serving drinks , presented by the Sandinista National Liberation Front of Nicaragua , and a Tolpuddle Martyrs plate from the British parliamentary Labour party . )
We 're in our smartest clothes .
Miss Kim lines us up in rows of four and we march solemnly through a security scanner and on to a travelator that spans an endless marble corridor until we reach the inner sanctum , where we form two perfect rows , take three steps forward on Miss Kim 's command , and bow to a statue of Kim Il - sung , march down more marble corridors , through a wind tunnel ( to shake the dust from our clothes ) , and into a darkened room holding the embalmed body of Kim Il - sung himself .
Here we form six rows and step forward three steps at a time , to bow solemnly , not once , but three times , from three different directions .
Even then it's not over : in another marble chamber is an audio guide to the nation 's reaction when the Great Leader died .
" All people were rending their hearts !
And weeping scalding tears that as they hit the ground fossilised and became glittering pieces of stone !
It was as if the earth itself had died ! "
Outside afterwards , groups of Korean women line up to have their photographs taken in front of the palace , and we watch as more than one brushes tears from her eyes .
Kim
Il - sung was the father of the nation ; in fact , he still is , described in the constitution as the " eternal president " , and this emotion is n't faked .
The trouble with North Korea , says Hannah , one of our English guides , is that people tend to see what they want to see .
The Chinese see China ; the Russians , Russia ; Ferenc , a Hungarian in our group , sees a little bit of Hungary – like the pupils in the June 9 Middle School we visit , he wore the red scarf of the Young Pioneers when he was a boy .
" My parents could n't believe I was coming here , " he says .
" They were horrified . "
Dan , the Canadian , sees " Abroad " .
( And it scares the shit out of him .
I 'm not sure he 'll ever leave Winnipeg again . )
And Peter , the 74 - year - old Australian in our group , sees a battleground .
I 'm standing next to him when he lifts his trouser leg to show Miss Kim his bullet wounds : " That 's where you buggers tried to kill me , " he says .
" Although , in fairness , I was trying to kill you lot at the time . "
He 's the first Korean War veteran from " the other side " that Miss Kim and Mr Lee have met , and it 's genuinely touching what a fuss they make of him .
They pay out of their own money to upgrade him on the train on the return trip so that he 's more comfortable .
It 's a remarkable journey : like travelling through a Constable painting .
There are oxen pulling carts , farmers unloading a haywain , children playing with a wooden hoop .
It 's so strangely innocent : a landscape that could be from any time within the last three centuries .
It 's four hours before I see the first car , and some time after that , we approach the border , where a charmless customs officer systematically goes through my camera and deletes half my photos .
Beyond the Yalu river we see the towers of Dandong , a small provincial Chinese city that looks like a crazy modern metropolis .
How can buildings be so tall and shiny , I wonder .
But then if there 's one thing that going to North Korea teaches you , it 's that everything , all of life , is just perspective .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The Obama administration is proposing a new agency to study and report on the changing climate .
Also known as global warming , climate change has drawn widespread concern in recent years as temperatures around the world rise , threatening to harm crops , spread disease , increase sea levels , change storm and drought patterns and cause polar melting .
Commerce Secretary Gary Locke and Jane Lubchenco , head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , planned to announce Monday that NOAA will set up the new Climate Service to operate in tandem with NOAA 's National Weather Service and National Ocean Service .
CLIMATE SCIENCE CENTRAL : USA TODAY coverage NOAA recently reported that the decade of 2000 - 2009 was the warmest on record worldwide ; the previous warmest decade was the 1990s .
Most atmospheric scientists believe that warming is largely due to human actions , adding gases to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas .
Researchers and leaders from around the world met last month in Denmark to discuss ways to reduce climate - warming emissions , and a follow - up session is planned for later this year in Mexico .
" More and more people are asking for more and more information about climate and how it 's going to affect them , " Lubchenco explained .
So officials decided to combine climate operations into a single unit .
Portions of the Weather Service that have been studying climate , as well as offices from some other NOAA agencies , will be transferred to the new NOAA Climate Service .
The new agency will initially be led by Thomas Karl , director of the current National Climatic Data Center .
The Climate Service will be headquartered in Washington and will have six regional directors across the country .
Lubchenco also announced a new NOAA climate portal on the Internet to collect a vast array of climatic data from NOAA and other sources .
It will be " one - stop shopping into a world of climate information , " she said .
Creation of the Climate Service requires a series of steps , including congressional committee approval .
In recent years , a widespread private weather forecasting industry has grown up around the National Weather Service , and Lubchenco said she anticipates growth of private climate - related business around the new agency .
While most people notice the weather from day to day or week to week , climate looks at both the averages and extremes of weather over longer periods of time .
Understanding both weather and climate , and their changes , are vital to much of the world 's economic activity ranging from farming to travel to energy use and production and even food shipments and disease prevention .
Atmospheric scientists have long joked that climate is what you expect and weather is what you get .
But greenhouse warming is changing what can be expected from climate , and researchers are seeking to understand and anticipate the impacts of that change .

乳酸菌で美肌づく り
乳酸菌は腸内環境を整えるのが主な作用であるとされていますが、同時に美肌作りにも効果を発揮します。
そもそも乳酸菌は腸内で有機酸と呼ばれるものを作り出しますが、これは腸そのもののエネルギー源になるとされています。
よってこの有機酸が多く作られれば作られるほど腸の働きが活発になるため、食べ物の消化吸収が円滑的に進み、体内の栄養素のバランスが良くなるのです。
またこの有機酸によって腸が程よく刺激されることで腸のぜん動運動が助けられるため作られた便の排出がスムーズになります。
この作用が美肌作りに大きな役割を果たします。
腸内環境が整わす排便が困難になり便秘気味なると、排便されずに腸にたまってしまった便はやがて有毒物質を発生させるようになります。
最悪の場合、こうした便は体内で腐敗し、体にさまざまな悪影響をもたらし、不快な体臭や口臭を発生させる原因にもなってしまいます。
そしてこうした便から発生した有毒物質は肌へも悪影響を及ぼします。
また人間の肌は常に代謝を繰り返し新しく生まれ変わるのと同時に、さまざまな老廃物も生成していますが、便秘になることによってこの老廃物を体外に排出することが困難になり、結果的に老廃物が肌にたまって肌が汚くなってしまうのです。
肌をきれいにするためには、肌の代謝が円滑に進むことが重要ですが、便秘はこうした肌の代謝作用を阻害してしまいます。
肌をきれいにするためにはもちろん、化粧水などを用いて外側から肌をケアすることも大切です。
しかし外側からいくらケアをしても、上記のような状態で肌の代謝が阻害され、肌が内側から汚れていては美肌を作り出すことはできません。
肌を外側からケアすると同時に内側からケアすることも美肌を手に入れるためには非常に重要なことなのです。
乳酸菌は以上にまとめたメカニズムにより、腸内環境を正常なものにし排便困難を解消しますが、それが結果的に肌の代謝をも促進し、肌を内側からケアすることにつながるのです。
乳酸菌にはたくさんの種類があるので自分に合った種類を見つけることが大切ですが、生きたまま腸に届きやすい乳酸菌を選ぶようにしましょう。
ヨーグルトには動物性の乳酸菌、味噌やキムチなどには植物性乳酸菌が含まれていますので、日常的に食べているような食品から摂取することが可能です。
El mandatario federal asegura que seguir� apoyando a las familias afectadas por las lluvias en todas las entidades en las que el temporal gener� estragos
Toluca | Lunes 08 de febrero de 2010
Jorge Ramos / enviado | El Universal

CARACAS , Venezuela 
News travels fast in this city , and rumors even faster .
So when a billionaire banker named Ricardo Fernández Barrueco learned that his home had been searched by agents from the feared secret intelligence police , he might have suspected that the rumors of a purge of magnates loyal to President Hugo Chávez were true .
Being one of Venezuela ’s richest and most influential men , Mr. Fernández , 44 , went to the headquarters of the Disip intelligence police to clear up the matter directly with the agency ’s powerful spymaster .
Then a surprising thing happened , especially in a nation that had grown accustomed to the unfettered activities of pro-Chávez tycoons like Mr. Fernández .
The self - described socialist revolution of Mr. Chávez notwithstanding , the prominence of these moguls was so well known it inspired a nickname  the Boligarchs  for their fast accumulation of wealth and their ties to the government , which reveres Simón Bolívar , the 19th - century aristocrat who won Venezuela ’s freedom from Spain .
But instead of dismissing the matter , the intelligence chief imprisoned Mr. Fernández last year and ordered agents to start detaining other pro-Chávez magnates .
Some slipped into hiding abroad and are still being sought .
Several others and their associates were arrested and put in cells adjacent to Mr. Fernández’s .
The course of a metastasizing cancer is unlikely to be changed by how we talk about it .
With schizophrenia , however , symptoms are inevitably entangled in a person ’s complex interactions with those around him or her .
In fact , researchers have long documented how certain emotional reactions from family members correlate with higher relapse rates for people who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia .
Collectively referred to as “ high expressed emotion , ” these reactions include criticism , hostility and emotional overinvolvement ( like overprotectiveness or constant intrusiveness in the patient ’s life ) .
In one study , 67 percent of white American families with a schizophrenic family member were rated as “ high EE . ” ( Among British families , 48 percent were high EE ; among Mexican families the figure was 41 percent and for Indian families 23 percent . )
Does this high level of “ expressed emotion ” in the United States mean that we lack sympathy or the desire to care for our mentally ill ?
Quite the opposite .
Relatives who were “ high EE ” were simply expressing a particularly American view of the self .
They tended to believe that individuals are the captains of their own destiny and should be able to overcome their problems by force of personal will .
Their critical comments to the mentally ill person did n’t mean that these family members were cruel or uncaring ; they were simply applying the same assumptions about human nature that they applied to themselves .
They were reflecting an “ approach to the world that is active , resourceful and that emphasizes personal accountability , ” Prof. Jill M. Hooley of Harvard University concluded .
“ Far from high criticism reflecting something negative about the family members of patients with schizophrenia , high criticism ( and hence high EE ) was associated with a characteristic that is widely regarded as positive . ”
Widely regarded as positive , that is , in the United States .
Many traditional cultures regard the self in different terms — as inseparable from your role in your kinship group , intertwined with the story of your ancestry and permeable to the spirit world .
What McGruder found in Zanzibar was that families often drew strength from this more connected and less isolating idea of human nature .
Their ability to maintain a low level of expressed emotion relied on these beliefs .
And that level of expressed emotion in turn may be key to improving the fortunes of the schizophrenia sufferer .
Of course , to the extent that our modern psychopharmacological drugs can relieve suffering , they should not be denied to the rest of the world .
The problem is that our biomedical advances are hard to separate from our particular cultural beliefs .
It is difficult to distinguish , for example , the biomedical conception of schizophrenia — the idea that the disease exists within the biochemistry of the brain — from the more inchoate Western assumption that the self resides there as well .
“ Mental illness is feared and has such a stigma because it represents a reversal of what Western humans . . . have come to value as the essence of human nature , ” McGruder concludes .
“ Because our culture so highly values . . . an illusion of self - control and control of circumstance , we become abject when contemplating mentation that seems more changeable , less restrained and less controllable , more open to outside influence , than we imagine our own to be . ”
CROSS - CULTURAL psychiatrists have pointed out that the mental - health ideas we export to the world are rarely unadulterated scientific facts and never culturally neutral .
“ Western mental - health discourse introduces core components of Western culture , including a theory of human nature , a definition of personhood , a sense of time and memory and a source of moral authority .
None of this is universal , ” Derek Summerfield of the Institute of Psychiatry in London observes .
He has also written : “ The problem is the overall thrust that comes from being at the heart of the one globalizing culture .
It is as if one version of human nature is being presented as definitive , and one set of ideas about pain and suffering .
. . .
There is no one definitive psychology . ”
Behind the promotion of Western ideas of mental health and healing lie a variety of cultural assumptions about human nature .
Westerners share , for instance , evolving beliefs about what type of life event is likely to make one psychologically traumatized , and we agree that venting emotions by talking is more healthy than stoic silence .
We ’ve come to agree that the human mind is rather fragile and that it is best to consider many emotional experiences and mental states as illnesses that require professional intervention .
( The National Institute of Mental Health reports that a quarter of Americans have diagnosable mental illnesses each year . )
The ideas we export often have at their heart a particularly American brand of hyperintrospection — a penchant for “ psychologizing ” daily existence .
These ideas remain deeply influenced by the Cartesian split between the mind and the body , the Freudian duality between the conscious and unconscious , as well as the many self - help philosophies and schools of therapy that have encouraged Americans to separate the health of the individual from the health of the group .
These Western ideas of the mind are proving as seductive to the rest of the world as fast food and rap music , and we are spreading them with speed and vigor .
No one would suggest that we withhold our medical advances from other countries , but it ’s perhaps past time to admit that even our most remarkable scientific leaps in understanding the brain have n’t yet created the sorts of cultural stories from which humans take comfort and meaning .
When these scientific advances are translated into popular belief and cultural stories , they are often stripped of the complexity of the science and become comically insubstantial narratives .
Take for instance this Web site text advertising the antidepressant Paxil : “ Just as a cake recipe requires you to use flour , sugar and baking powder in the right amounts , your brain needs a fine chemical balance in order to perform at its best . ”
The Western mind , endlessly analyzed by generations of theorists and researchers , has now been reduced to a batter of chemicals we carry around in the mixing bowl of our skulls .
Two new documents laying out the Obama administration ’s defense and homeland security strategy over the next four years describe the nation ’s terrorist enemies in a number of ways but fail to mention the words Islam , Islamic or Islamist .
The 108 - page Quadrennial Homeland Security Review , made public last week by the Department of Homeland Security , uses the term “ terrorist ” a total of 66 times , “ al Qaeda ” five times and “ violent extremism ” or “ extremist ” 14 times .
It calls on the U.S. government to “ actively engage communities across the United States ” to “ stop the spread of violent extremism . ”
Yet in describing terrorist threats against the United States and the ideology that motivates terrorists , the review - like its sister document from the Pentagon , the Quadrennial Defense Review - does not use the words “ Islam , ” “ Islamic ” or “ Islamist ” a single time .
Although the homeland security official in charge of developing the review insists it was a not a deliberate decision , the document is likely to reignite a debate over terminology in the U.S. - led war against al Qaeda that has been simmering through two administrations .
“ There was not an active choice ” to avoid using terms derivative of Islam , Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Policy David Heyman told reporters on a conference call .
President Obama had “ made it clear as we are looking at counterterrorism that our principal focus is al Qaeda and global violent extremism , and that is the terminology and language that has been articulated ” by Mr. Obama and his advisers , Mr. Heyman added .
He declined to use the I - word .
The sensitivity to terminology is not new .
In April 2008 , during the George W. Bush administration , an official guide produced by the National Counterterrorism Center ( NCTC ) , the multiagency center charged with strategic coordination of the U.S. war on terrorism , urged officials not to use the words “ Muslim ” or “ Islamic ” in conjunction with the word “ terrorism . ”
Such usage “ reinforces the ‘ U.S. vs. Islam ’ framework that al - Qaeda promotes , ” read the NCTC ’s “ Words That Work and Words That Don’t : A Guide for Counterterrorism Communication . ”
Instead , the guide urges policymakers to use terms such as “ violent extremists , ” “ totalitarian , ” and “ death cult ” to characterize al Qaeda and other terrorist groups .
The Obama administration has adopted “ violent extremism ” as its catchall phrase for terrorism .
It is advice that officials at the Defense Department also appear to have taken to heart .
The 128 - page Quadrennial Defense Review - which like the homeland - security review is a congressionally mandated effort to ensure budgeting and other planning efforts are properly aligned against threats to the nation - also eschews words associated with Islam , employing instead the constructions “ radicalism , ” “ extremism ” or “ violent extremism . ”
“ I understand the reluctance to play up religion as a part of violent extremism , ” said Stewart Baker , who held Mr. Heyman ’s job at the Department of Homeland Security in the last administration .
“ But it ’s easy to take that too far .
Which communities [ in the United States ] is the government planning to engage to counter extremism ?
Not Hispanics , I ’ll bet , or Lutherans . ”
Sen . Susan Collins , Maine Republican , said in a statement that she was “ struck ” by what she called the “ glaring omission . ”
Other kinds of extremism - for instance , white supremacism - are also seen as threats by many analysts , but they generally are acknowledged to pose a much less significant danger .
“ To understand a threat and counter it , we must know our enemy , ” said Ms. Collins , the ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee .
“ While there are other threats to our national security from other types of violent extremism , the gravest threat comes from Islamist extremists . …
In a review such as this , it is critical that we identify and address the specific threat posed by Islamist extremism . ”
Ms. Collins noted that the publicly available portions of the recent Pentagon report on the attack at Fort Hood also did not use terms related to Islam .
“ We should n’t be reluctant to identify our enemy , ” she said .
Patrick Poole , a counterterrorism consultant to government and law enforcement agencies , said the documents reveal a “ culture of willful blindness that continues to grow ” within senior levels of government .
“ For our military , intelligence , and homeland security agencies to continue to ignore the short - and long - term strategic threat from jihadist groups , and the radical Islamic ideology that fuels them , is nothing less than a dereliction of duty , ” Mr. Poole said .
“ The current administration seems hellbent on doubling down on the previous administration ’s failure to comprehend this threat , and there are American citizens and armed service members [ who ] are going to die as a result . ”
The Heritage Foundation ’s James Carafano poured scorn on the idea that the omission was not deliberate , pointing out that the quadrennial reviews were subjected to a comprehensive interagency editing and approval process .
“ It ’s not like this is an oversight . …
No one is slapping their forehead going , ‘ Oh , yeah , we forgot to use the word . ’ ”
Mr. Carafano said he sympathized with the desire “ to separate the act of terror from the religion ” of Islam , but he said there was a straightforward solution :
The word Islamicist or Islamist - as used by Ms. Collins .
Webster ’s dictionary defines Islamist or Islamicist as “ an advocate or supporter of Islamic , especially orthodox Islamic , political rule . ”
Mr. Carafano called this “ terminology that ’s well understood in both the East and the West … [ as ] an extremist grouping with a political agenda , not a religious one . ”
A 2008 paper produced by the Department of Homeland Security ’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties suggested that the distinction between Islam and Islamism might not be well understood .
“ The experts we consulted did not criticize this usage based on accuracy , ” according to the paper , “ Terminology to Define the Terrorists : Recommendations From American Muslims . ”
“ Nevertheless , they caution that it may not be strategic for [ U.S. government officials ] to use the term because the general public , including overseas audiences , may not appreciate the academic distinction between Islamism and Islam . ”
A U.S. military report produced in 2008 by a special unit of the U.S. Central Command criticized the federal government for not properly identifying the nature of the Islamist terrorist threat .
“ We must reject the notion that Islam and Arabic stand apart as bodies of knowledge that cannot be critiqued or discussed as elements of understanding our enemies in this conflict , ” said the internal report by the Centcom “ Red Team , ” a unit that provides contrarian views for the combatant commander .
“ The fact is our enemies cite the source of Islam as the foundation for their global jihad , ” the report said .
“ We are left with the responsibility of portraying our enemies in an honest and accurate fashion . ”
Other Obama administration officials , including , most strikingly , the top U.S. diplomat , appear less timid than their defense and homeland security colleagues in using terms such as “ Islamic ” to describe the nation ’s terrorist enemies .
Speaking over the weekend of the various threats to U.S. security , Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton described al Qaeda and its allies as “ extremists … fundamentalist Islamic extremists . ”
A homeland security official authorized to speak on background said the quadrennial review was not designed to provide a definition of the enemy ; instead , it “ focuses on what the key goals and objectives should be to prevent terrorism .
…
Preventing and deterring terrorism - in any form - is the primary mission , which is very clearly spelled out . ”

When it comes to sex and reproduction , mammals are ultra- orthodox and , frankly , rather dull .
Individuals are either male or female , no one changes sex and there are never more than two sexes in a species .
No mammal reproduces asexually — by budding off a small piece of itself , say , or by splitting down the middle and growing a new individual from each half .
Nope : among mammals , offspring are always produced by sex .
That is , an egg fuses with a sperm to produce a child that is genetically distinct from both parents .
But things can get much hairier .
Take ciliates — which get my vote for Life - form of The Month : February .
Most ciliates are single - celled organisms covered with tiny hair - like structures known as cilia — which is Latin for eyelashes .
The cilia are used for a variety of activities , including swimming and feeding .
Some ciliates even use them to scuttle across surfaces .
Behind the cilia , however , ciliates are a diverse and ancient group .
Their lineage split off from the one that we evolved from more than a billion years ago ; their closest relations are the apicomplexans ( a group of single - celled parasites that includes Plasmodium , the bug that causes malaria ) and the dinoflagellates ( which I profiled in January ) .
Ciliates live in all kinds of places , from the guts of cockroaches to the waters around Antarctica , and they have a range of lifestyles .
Some are filter feeders , sieving particles of food from the water like microscopic blue whales .
Others are active predators , harpooning their prey ( usually bacteria , or other ciliates ) and killing them with poisons .
And if you ’re a fact jock , you ’ll like this detail .
Almost all organisms on the planet read their DNA with the same language , so that if you put a jellyfish gene into a pig , you get exactly the same product in both organisms .
Ciliates , however , do n’t play strictly by the rules : they have repeatedly evolved small variations on the normal way of reading genes .
( They also , mysteriously , have rather a lot of genes : some have as many as 30,000 , which is several thousand more than we have . )
Although ciliates sound obscure , they ’ve been hugely important in scientific research .
Last year , for example , three scientists won a Nobel prize for their discoveries in the ciliate Tetrahymena .
( The discoveries concerned telomeres — the bits of DNA that cap off chromosomes — and telomerase — the enzyme that keeps telomeres in good shape .
Both are thought to be important in aging . )
And if you did biology at school , a ciliate may already have batted its eyelashes at you : the lozenge - shaped paramecium often gets put under the classroom microscope for everyone to draw .
Usually , though , no one mentions it ’s a representative of one of the most sexually unorthodox groups on Earth .
Ciliate sex is peculiar in several ways .
For one thing , reproduction and sex do not happen together .
When a ciliate reproduces , it does so asexually , typically by splitting in half and growing a complete new individual from each piece .
So : where there was one individual , there are now two .
In and of itself , asexual reproduction is not especially strange — many organisms , from aphids to sea anemones , do it at least from time to time .
The weird stuff happens when ciliates get sexual .
In ciliate sex , two individuals arrive , and two individuals leave : no eggs are fertilized , no offspring are produced .
But by the time the two individuals go their separate ways , a massive change will have come over both of them : they will both have acquired a new genetic identity .
Here ’s what happens .
Each ciliate has something called a micronucleus ; this contains two complete versions of its genome .
During sex , the micronucleus divides in such a way that each individual keeps one version of its genome for itself ; it then gives an exact copy of this version to its partner .
Afterwards , each individual fuses the two genomes ( the one it kept and the one it got ) to make a new micronucleus .
This has three odd consequences .
The first is that , by the end of sex , the two individuals have become genetically identical .
It ’s as if you and your mate began coitus as yourselves and finished as identical twins .
The second odd consequence is that , partway through its life , a ciliate can radically alter its genetic make - up ; genetically speaking , the transformation is so extreme that it ’s as if you changed into one of your children .
Talk about being reborn .
Which brings me to the third odd consequence : after sex , the organism undergoes a profound remodeling .
Ciliates have evolved a curious system by which the micronucleus is reserved for sex : the DNA there is not involved in the day - to - day running of the cell .
Instead , the job of running the cell is done by something known as the macronucleus .
( After sex , the old macronucleus is destroyed , and a new one is built . )
The macronucleus is made from the micronucleus , but it is not at all the same in content .
In extreme cases — such as that of Oxytricha trifallax — less than 5 percent of the DNA in the micronucleus is used by the macronucleus .
The rest is cut out and thrown away .
Why ?
It ’s not clear .
However , what we do know is this : like many organisms , ciliates have a lot of DNA that does not encode genes .
It ’s this other DNA that gets removed from the macronucleus : the macronucleus is a genes - only sort of place .
But why the micronucleus has all this extra “ stuff ” , and what function it serves , is something of a mystery .
( Part of the answer is that the micronucleus has accumulated huge numbers of genetic parasites — DNA segments that simply proliferate themselves .
To what extent these can also serve their host is an interesting question .
Recent results suggest that at least some of these “ parasitic ” sequences play an important part in building the macronucleus . )
As if that was n’t enough strangeness , here ’s one other peculiar detail .
Many ciliates have more than two sexes ( or “ mating types ” ) and some — Stylonychia mytilus , for example — have as many as 100 .
This does n’t mean that 100 individuals have to gather for sex to take place .
Rather , it means that you can mate with anyone not of the same mating type as yourself .
In principle , it gives you more choice : with more mating types , more individuals are eligible mates .
In my next life . . . .

Despite being a three - system game , BioWare ' shad much clearer platform differentiation between console and PC SKUs than most modern games do -- and online producer Fernando Melo tells Gamasutra that effort has " really paid off " in the game 's commercial success .
"
When we originally started talking aboutbefore it came out , there were a lot of questions about , ' Is the PC market dead ? ' "
Melo recalled .
But despite those concerns , the PC version of the game " is doing really , really well , " he said , adding , " It was really a surprise . "
" I think the market was always there , " Melo said .
" Perhaps the idea of taking a console game and porting it back to PC was n't working , but something like this -- which was built first for a PC audience -- I think that 's really paid off .
" Of course , that applies to console platforms as well , Melo stressed .
" We invested quite a lot of time making sure that it made for a good console game as well , as opposed to just doing a port , " he noted , " because the same is true both ways .
" Melo said digital distribution was also a key factor in the game 's success on the PC .
" That has helped quite a bit , " he said .
" It 's done very well on there .
" That claim is supported by statements made by EA in its recent quarterly financial results .
The publisher said its digital distribution business grew 30 percent year - over - year to reach a high of $ 152 million for the quarter .
But perhaps more than any of those factors , Melo believes 's success was driven by the core philosophy of the development team .
"
We always felt very strongly about this kind of game , and I think we were going to make it regardless , " he recently told Gamasutra .
" What this has shown is that people love great story ; people love good games of any fashion .
It 's really helping the team to validate that , yes , this is something people want . "
There was some talk a few months ago about Vosges ’ new bacon - flavoured chocolate bar .
When I first heard about it , I immediately started imagining the smoky saltiness of good bacon buried in smooth , rich chocolate .
I went on chocolate - search alert .
Unfortunately for me , I saw neither rind nor rasher of it .
But I kept imagining those flavours .
Last month , when I was contemplating –again –how much I love my ice cream maker , it suddenly hit me !
If bacon works in a chocolate bar , why ca n’t it work in ice cream ?
I wrote the idea down , which is why for weeks , visitors have been puzzled by the note on our fridge that reads “ Bacon - Choco Ice Cream . ”
In my imaginings I always pictured dark chocolate , so when I started recipe planning , it was with something much darker than the milk chocolate Vosges uses .
Our base recipe comes from Kate Zuckerman ’s incredible cookbook “ The Sweet Life . ” ( go. buy it .
you wo n’t regret it . )
In her recipe for dark chocolate sorbet , Zuckerman explains how the starches in chocolate absorb water at certain levels of heat , becoming incredibly creamy .
I figured this was the way to go , as I could n’t quite imagine the bacon bits nestled into a custard base .
Maybe I ’m wrong about this .
Next go - round , anyone ?
So .
We had the concept of the base down .
The bacon was next .
I decided to candy the bacon so that it would n’t clash with the chocolate .
I dipped the bacon in sugar and baked it until it was crispy .
Then I mixed it into the incredibly rich , creamy , delicious chocolate sorbet .
Quick note –this sorbet is an absolute must - try , bacon or no bacon .
In her intro to the recipe , Zuckerman says that people are always shocked that the sorbet has no dairy .
There ’s a reason for this .
Go look at the picture at the beginning of this piece again .
Ignore our sub- professional photo skills and instead look at the sheen .
It ’s a thousand times silkier in the mouth than it even shows in the photo .
The chocolate sorbet with the bacon mixed in , however , is a whole different experience .
Because the bits are mixed in after the sorbet , they do n’t change the initial flavour or or silkiness at all .
However , once your mouthful of chocolate has melted a bit , you get a little bacony , salty crunch .
We liked how the salt cut through the heaviness of the chocolate , and how the smoky bacon flavour melted into the last vestiges of the rich chocolate at the end of every bite .
Cooking notes –
- Make sure your bacon is diced small .
I was a bit lazy and left some larger bits ( like 1/4 inch ) , and those few interfered with rather than complimented the chocolate .
- The candied bacon was beautiful coming out of the oven , but in hindsight we were n’t sure we needed to candy it .
Maybe it was a cowardly move ?
You tell me .
Next time , I might try just frying it up nice and crisp and mixing it in without the sugar protection .
– This is obviously not going to work with just any bacon .
We got our smoked bacon from Porcmeilleur , at the Jean - Talon Market , but there are a few places around Montreal that might be worth trying .
I think maple - smoked bacon would be delicious in this .
- If you do n’t own an ice cream maker , I discovered that the base for this sorbet thickens into a beautiful silky puddingy mass in the fridge .
So you can still play along .
After you ’ve prepared the sorbet base , ladle it into individual serving bowls and place them in the fridge .
In a few hours , they will be thickened to a pudding consistency .
Then , if you want to get in on the bacon , you could sprinkle the candied bacon on top .
- Use the best cocoa powder you can justify , as it is really the flavour base for this sorbet .
Carlo went all crazy and insisted on Valhrona cocoa powder .
It was < ahem > $ 13 for 250 grams , but WOW is it amazing .
DARK CHOCOLATE BACON CRUNCH SORBET
for the sorbet , adapted from The Sweet Life by Kate Zuckerman
3/4 cup plus 1 tbsp .
sugar
2 1/4 cups water
3 tbsp . corn syrup
6 oz . dark chocolate ( we used two Valhrona chocolate bars , one 55 % and the other 66 % )
1 cup Dutch - processed cocoa powder
for the bacon
app. 8 slices of bacon ( more or less depending on the meatiness of your bacon )
1/2 cup white sugar
Chop the chocolate into small pieces and combine it with the cocoa , which you have sifted into a medium stainless steel bowl .
On the stovetep , combine 2 1 / 4 cups water , sugar and corn syrup .
Bring the mixture to a boil and then remove it from the heat .
Whisk 1/3 of the sugar syrup into the waiting bowl of chocolate .
The chocolate will make you nervous at first , as it seizes a little .
Add another 1/3 of the syrup , whisking all the time .
By the time you add your last 1/3 of sugar syrup , the mixture should be smooth and silky .
Continue whisking this mixture for about five minutes , until you think it ’s smooth and silky .
If you notice any chunks of cocoa in your sorbet base , you can pass it through a fine - mesh strainer .
Cool the mixture over an ice bath ( fill a bowl larger than the one your base is in with ice cubes and water .
Place your bowl inside the icy bowl , and continue to whisk it until it is cool ) .
Place your base in the refrigerator to cool completely and thicken .
Zuckerman recommends at least four hours .
While your sorbet base is cooling , prepare your bacon .
First , preheat your oven to 400 degrees .
Next , coat your bacon slices with sugar .
I did this by pouring a small amount of sugar onto a plate and then pressing the bacon into it .
Next time , I might try just sprinkling it over the bacon , like this method .
Place the bacon on a parchment paper - lined baking sheet and bake it for 8 minutes .
After 8 minutes , remove it from the oven , and turn it over , baking it for another 8 minutes .
Keep a close eye on it , because it burns fast .
When the bacon is done , remove it from the oven and allow it to cool before dicing it into small pieces .
You should have about 1 /2 cup of bacon bits to add to your sorbet .
If you have any extra , reserve it for garnish .
After the sorbet base has cooled for a few hours , freeze it in your ice cream maching according to manufacturer ’s instructions .
It is done when it has gained volume and it holds the marks of the stirring mechanism , like stiffly - whipped cream .
Now you have to work quickly .
Remove the sorbet from your machine to a storage container , quickly stirring in your bacon bits in batches as you fill the container .
Store your sorbet in the freezer for a couple hours to harden it .
Or , if you ’re like us , just ignore the last instructions and eat super - soft sorbet .
Garfield : First Blood
A tale of adventure , passion and romances !
It was a sunny day when Garfield was practicing Tai Chi on the roof top to harness his inner strength when he heard panic .
" Garfield there is panic ! " Said Jon Arbuckle .
" Stop behaving like woman , Jon Arbuckle , what is the matter ? "
Scolded Garfield as he put on his members only jacket .
" Natalie Portman has been kidnapped you must come to the rescue ! " Said Jon Arbuckle with bone chilled eyes .
" WHAT .? ! "
Said Garfield as he bolted down the stairs with speed of a buffalo hoard .
Garfield switched on the tv showing Natalie Portman taken captive by vampire gangsters .
" Help Garfield , I am being taken captive by vampire gangsters ! " Cried Natalie Portman in hysterically .
" HAHA Garfield ! ,
We demand the blood Bank of USA give us 600 million gallons of blood , all in one hundred dollar bills or else we will be making evening breakfast out of Natalie Portman ! "
Said the head Vampire Gangster with menace .
" The only deposit being made will be yours ! " Said Garfield with triumph , while shooting the tv in anger with his Desert Eagle .
" Garfield what will you do ? " Asked John Arbuckle with audacity .
" A man must do what he must do I will rescue Natalie Portman with these hands . "
Said Garfield fist clenched with justice .
Garfield strutted to his closet where he took his steak firing machine gun .
He then hopped into his ALL AMERICAN four wheeled pick up truck .
" Garfield let me come with you " said John Arbuckle with intent .
" No you must stay , if I do not return in 24 hours call Tiger Woods . " ( Timely Joke )
" That was a timely joke Garfield . "
Said John Arbuckle , getting his joke .
Garfield than drove off into the thickness of summer night , determined to deliver justice through personal delivery .
When driving , Garfield turned on the radio for inspirational music .
" Here is inspirational music for Garfield so that he may save the day again . "
Said the DJ .
The DJ started playing heart thumping rocking music to pump Garfield up .
" This is the beat to my groove . "
Said Garfield as he let himself get pumped .
As Garfield drove he saw a kid taking drugs and ruining his life .
Garfield was enraged by the waste of the youth and ran him over with his pickup truck .
" Drugs are for dopes go back to education ! " Said Garfield .
" Yes you are right Garfield . "
Said the kid who stopped doing drugs and went back to school for degrees .
Garfield than arrived at the vampire warehouse where the vampire gangsters held their Natalie Portman .
Garfield notices there was a vampire gangster guarding the entrance .
" Oh , no its Garfield I must make alarm ! "
Said the vampire gangster .
" The only alarm you will be making is in hell ! "
Said Garfield as he shot the vampire gangster in the chest with his Desert Eagle .
" HA Garfield !
Vampires can only be killed with steaks and suns ! "
Said the vampire gangster .
" Fool my bullets are made of suns . "
Said Garfield with astrophysics .
" Oh no I am dead ! "
Said the stupid vampire gangster as he burned away .
Garfield lit a cigarette on the burning vampire and continued his mission .
During exploration , Garfield encountered two other vampire gangsters guarding a room .
" Here is a prime rib meal ready for serving ! " Quipped Garfield as he shot the vampire gangsters to their deaths with his steak gun .
Garfield than bursted into the room seeing the Natalie Portman captured with the menacing vampire gangster leader her at her side .
" Haha Garfield you have entered a trap !
Look around you are surrounded ! "
Said the Vampire Gangster leader .
Garfield looked around him seeing vampire gangsters all around , closing in , when Garfield heard a familiar voice .
" AMAKOOOO "
John Arbuckle crashed in from the ceiling with his two golden revolvers daftly firing all around at the vampire gangsters .
" Thank you for my back up John Arbuckle , I was in a pit of danger " Said Garfield with sternness .
" No problem , you have gotten me out of more jam than I can remember . "
Said John Arbuckle .
" The jig is up Vampire Gangster , time to face the face of justice . "
Said Garfield with justice coming out of his eyes and ears .
" Oh no Garfield I have a terrible secret to unveil ! "
Said the vampire gangster as he ripped off his face to reveal that he was really Odie !
" Odie how could you . "
Said John Arbuckle .
" After all the adventure and bonding we shared you have fallen into criminality ? "
Said Garfield with disappointment .
" Yes Garfield I am tired of you having all the glory and women .
No more this time the glory and women will be my own ! "
Said Odie with bitter triumph .
" Odie I thought you were a man but you are just a mutt . "
Said Garfield with sadness in his heart .
" You do not have the heart to kill me Garfield so say your good byes to your precious Natalie Portman ! " Leered Odie with evil .
" You are forgetting one thing Odie , you may have drawn first blood , but I always draw last . "
Said Garfield with cool style as he shot Odie with his Desert Eagle .
" NOOOO " Said Odie as he staggered and fell out of the window into acid .
Garfield went to the tied up Natalie Portman and freed her swiftly .
" Thank you Garfield I am forever in debt . "
Said Natalie Portman with love to Garfield .
" No problem babe I liked you in Space Balls , now lets dance a sexy tango . "
Said Garfield .
" Thank you for complimenting my acting . "
Said Natalie Portman with gratitude .
So after Garfields gracious compliments they both danced a sexy tango and got all tens .
" Wow Garfield you are great dancer are you doing anything tonight ? " Said Natalie Portman .
" I am now , I will take to four stars restaurant called Olive Garden it has food of one of a kind taste . "
Said Garfield with class .
" That sounds delicious and romantic . "
Said Natalie Portman with romance on her mind .
With these words Garfield and Natalie Portman rode to Olive Garden on a black stallion with wind flowing through their hair .
The End ??
Authors Note : If Natalie Portman is reading this and would like to date me that would be ok .
All the men who were analyzed had a Y chromosome that is now mostly found in Eastern Europe , Central Asia and Siberia , but rarely in China .
The mitochondrial DNA , which passes down the female line , consisted of a lineage from Siberia and two that are common in Europe .
Since both the Y chromosome and the mitochondrial DNA lineages are ancient , Dr. Zhou and his team conclude the European and Siberian populations probably intermarried before entering the Tarim Basin some 4,000 years ago .

The Small River Cemetery was rediscovered in 1934 by the Swedish archaeologist Folke Bergman and then forgotten for 66 years until relocated through GPS navigation by a Chinese expedition .
Archaeologists began excavating it from 2003 to 2005 .
Their reports have been translated and summarized by Victor H. Mair , a professor of Chinese at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert in the prehistory of the Tarim Basin .
As the Chinese archaeologists dug through the five layers of burials , Dr. Mair recounted , they came across almost 200 poles , each 13 feet tall .
Many had flat blades , painted black and red , like the oars from some great galley that had foundered beneath the waves of sand .
At the foot of each pole there were indeed boats , laid upside down and covered with cowhide .
The bodies inside the boats were still wearing the clothes they had been buried in .
They had felt caps with feathers tucked in the brim , uncannily resembling Tyrolean mountain hats .
They wore large woolen capes with tassels and leather boots .
A Bronze Age salesclerk from Victoria ’s Secret seems to have supplied the clothes beneath — barely adequate woolen loin cloths for the men , and skirts made of string strands for the women .
Within each boat coffin were grave goods , including beautifully woven grass baskets , skillfully carved masks and bundles of ephedra , an herb that may have been used in rituals or as a medicine .
In the women ’s coffins , the Chinese archaeologists encountered one or more life - size wooden phalluses laid on the body or by its side .
Looking again at the shaping of the 13 - foot poles that rise from the prow of each woman ’s boat , the archaeologists concluded that the poles were in fact gigantic phallic symbols .

Abu Hurayrah Qasim al Raymi ,
The Yemeni government confirmed that Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ’s military commander was killed in an airstrike launched against the terror group on Jan. 15 .
Abu Hurayrah Qasim al Raymi , the group ’s military commander , was among six senior members of the terror group identified as being killed during an airstrike in the Al Ajasher region , a mountainous region between Saada and Jawf .
The government said it was certain that Raymi and al Qaeda leaders and operatives Aidh Jaber al Shabwani , Ammar Obada al Waili , Saleh al Tais , Abdullah Hadi al Tais , and Abu Ayman al Masri were killed in the strike that targeted two vehicles .
Two other operatives , who have not been named , escaped , according to the Yemen Observer .
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has not released a statement confirming or denying the deaths of Raymi and the other operatives .
Raymi was the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen before he yielded authority to Abu Nasir al Wuhayshi .
Both Raymi and Wuhayshi were among 13 al Qaeda leaders and fighters who escaped from a Yemeni jail in 2006 .
In February 2009 , Al Qaeda in Yemen merged with the Saudi branch and became Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula .
Raymi was appointed the military commander of the group .
Shabwani was the leader of al Qaeda in the province of Marib .
Abu Ayman al Masri was a master bomb - maker .
He was said to have moved back and forth between Yemen and Afghanistan , where he directed suicide attacks against Afghan and Coalition forces .
The Jan 15 strike is the third since mid-December .
The US used air - launched cruise missiles during the Dec. 17 strike that targeted al Qaeda camps in Sana ’a and Abyan .
The Yemeni government claimed it carried out the Dec. 24 airstrike that targeted Abu Nasir al Wuhayshi , his deputy Said al Shihri , Raymi , and radical US - born cleric Anwar al Awlaki .
US intelligence officials contacted by The Long War Journal would not comment on US involvement in the Dec. 24 and Jan. 15 strikes .
The Yemeni government claims it carried out all three strikes , but the Yemeni Air Forces is not thought to have the capability to carry out precision attacks .
Al Qaeda is known to operate several training camps in Sana ’a , Abyan , and Shabwa provinces , and has the support of several influential tribes in Yemen .
The US has sought the Yemeni government ’s assistance in cracking down on Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula after two plots have been directly traced back to the terror group .
The attempt to blow up an airliner over Detroit on Christmas Eve 2009 and the shooting at Fort Hood , Texas , that killed 13 US soldiers have been linked to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula .

France -
Dans son rapport annuel publié mardi dernier , la Cour des comptes accuse l'État d'un manque de détermination face à la pollution des eaux liée aux pratiques agricoles .
Évoquant un " bilan décevant de la politique de l'eau " , la Cour épingle l'État français , dont l'inaction entraîne , selon elle , un gâchis de moyens exposant la France à de lourdes pénalités financières .
Appelant l'État à " adopter une politique plus volontariste " en matière de pollution agricole , la Cour des comptes dénonce " la méconnaissance par la France des objectifs communautaires " de même qu'elle déplore une " action répressive insuffisante " .
Comme tous les États membres de l'Union européenne , la France s'est engagée à réduire la présence de nitrates et d'azote dans les eaux destinées à la consommation , visant un " bon état " écologique d'ici à 2015 .
Or , le manque de respect des règlements européens à déjà valu au pays six condamnations et la Cour des comptes souligne que cette inaction entraîne un véritable gâchis de moyens , tout en conduisant à " douter de la capacité de la France à atteindre les objectifs " .
Et la Cour de dénoncer une " approche routinière " des six agences de l'eau qui préfèrent payer " 1,8 fois plus " pour réparer les dégâts plutôt que les prévenir .
Alors que le ministère de l'Environnement se défend en précisant que la Cour se base sur des contrôles effectués entre 2002 et 2006 , il demande à ce que soit pris en compte " l'immense mouvement de transformation engagé depuis trois ans " .
There ’s a reason men ( and women ) loved “ Gladiator . ”
The main character Maximus Decimus Meridius is the epitome of manliness .
Here are four lessons on manliness that we can learn from him .
He loved his family and was loyal to them
Maximus was a family man .
He turned down the glory of being Emperor of Rome in order to embrace the warmth of familial love .
Marcus Aurelius :
When was the last time you were home ?
Maximus Decimus Meridius :
Two years , two hundred and sixty - four days and this morning .
Although Maximus ’ wife was brutally murdered , this did not dampen his devotion to her .
Throughout the film a romantic tension exists between Maximus and the Emperor ’s daughter .
Yet Maximus stayed loyal to his dead wife and family and turned down her advances .
[ Maximus looks at images of his wife and son ]
Juba :
Can they hear you ?
Maximus Decimus Meridius : Who ?
Juba : Your family .
In the afterlife .
Maximus Decimus Meridius :
Oh yes .
Juba : What do you say to them ?
Maximus Decimus Meridius :
To my son —
I tell him I will see him again soon .
To keep his heels down while riding his horse .
To my wife … that is not your business .
He loved his country
Before Maximus became a gladiator , he was a loyal general in the Roman army .
His men respected and honored him greatly .
When Rome falls into corrupted hands , he did not give up on his country .
Loyally striving to fulfill the dying emperor ’s wish for Roman rule to be restored to the people and the Senate , Maximus toils and sacrifices until the Republic is restored .
He could kick anyone ’s ass , yet remained honorable .
“ Gladiator ” is known for its amazing fight scenes .
In every battle , whether in war or in the arena , Maximus always defeated his opponent with a combination of brute force and strategy .
He was able to ignore pain to get the job done .
He never gave in to fear .
Instead , he exuded an a quiet confidence that unnerved his opponents .
He never doubted his ability to win .
Maximus :
At my signal , unleash hell .
While Maximus excelled at the martial arts , he did not revel in bloodshed .
He only fought when he needed to and in the service of a worthy cause .
He was in tune with spirituality
Maximus Decimus Meridius :
What we do in life , echoes in eternity .
Maximus devoted time to his spiritual life .
He prayed to his gods .
He had no doubt that his wife and son were waiting for him in the afterlife .
Before each battle , Maximus would reach down and run dirt through his hands .
It was as if he was asking the gods to be with him during the battle .
Maximus Decimus Meridius : Ancestors , I ask you for your guidance .
Blessed mother , come to me with the Gods ’ desire for my future .
Blessed father , watch over my wife and son with a ready sword .
Whisper to them that I live only to hold them again , for all else is dust and air .
Ancestors , I honor you and will try to live with the dignity that you have taught me .

Calling all college history professors and instructors .
It is time to use our clout as history professors to make a statement .
According to the New York Times article the Texas Board of Education is making significant changes to the history curriculum for high schools students .
We need to come to the aid of Mary Helen Berlanga and use our clout as academics to boycott the rewriting of history for political purposes .
If it were just Texas , I may not suggest such a boycott .
However , because publishers have become so economical in the past years , the book published according to the Texas guidelines will be used by other states for their classes .
It is time to say ENOUGH to this blatant attempt at censorship and academic political correctness .
Censorship on the part of the publisher and censorship on the part of the Texas Board of Education who did not even have , according to the CBC new broadcast on March , 23 , 2009 , an academic historian suggesting changes .
We need to show our support for Mary Helen Berlanga by emailing her our support at this email address here .
I am proposing to spread the word to all historians who teach at the college and public school level .
If they we have the power to choose our textbooks , we need to boycott the publisher , and their subsidiaries , of the textbook for Texas public schools .
Show them that we will not accept the rewriting of history .
These are not just changes to a curriculum these are calculated extractions of American history .
The claim by many is that history is some leftist tool to twist facts .
I am sorry but both VanRanke and Droysen would argue with that .
What qualification does a dentist and a preacher have to determine historical standards ?
I will need your help here academics and graduate students .
Boycott the publisher of this book and their subsidiaries .
Let 's illustrate that historians can use their clout to stop the abuse of history by agenda seeking loons who think that history is merely interpretation .
It is not just interpretation .
It is an informed analysis determined by factual evidence .
I shutter to think what they will want to exclude next , the holocaust ?
That will be the next step if we do not take a stand now .
All those who support this issue can make a comment below and I will respond .
Let me know what more we as historians can do to prevent this gross malfeasance of history on the part of the Texas Board of Education .
It must be stated that censorship is NOT academic freedom .
Academic freedom means that one should be able to choose resources for inclusion within an academic setting .
What the Texas School Board is doing is excluding , that is censorship .

Yo - ho , a pirates ' life for all your customers !
Here come the disclaimers now , cause they need to happen .
I intend to bridge the gaming co. exec vs gamer gap since I am currently both ( albeit at a small start up for the exec thing ) .
I 'll start by saying I do not pirate games .
I even look for ways like Steam to buy games at the price I want ( if I want to be cheap about it ) that still gives money to the developer , unlike buying used .
I do not condone piracy generally speaking ( you 'll see why I 've qualified this soon enough ) .
My intent of this article is to shed light on something that you may not already see and help our industry to make smart decisions about piracy / anti-piracy measures .
So why is all this important in the first place ?
Well , I know that talking to the business folks in our industry makes anyone concerned about piracy .
Sure , they want to cover their behind to get the most ROI as possible .
Unfortunately , they often decrease their ROI without knowing it .
-------------------
For whatever reason , I have recently started receiving Rolling Stone magazine in the mail .
It is a well written and exciting magazine to read .
I wish they 'd cover games more ( or at all , really ) , but that 's not what I 'm interested in talking about .
Rolling Stone recently had some good recaps of the past year and past decade .
I want to highlight the report on the music industry in record sales .
It is dismal at best .
Apparently vinyl sales have gone up , which is a phenomenon that has a similarity in the game industry ( the ' retro - fetish ' or buying old games on a new system or for the dusted off old console ) .
In the music industry , this is the only sales figure reporting growth .
Everything else has rapidly shrunk with figures so low I 'm starting to worry about the RIAA moguls ' ability to continue affording to gold plate their toilets ( sarcasm here ) .
Why have I already wasted so much time talking about the Recording Music industry if my point is about piracy in the game industry ?
Well , here 's why : it is the single biggest warning flag we could have .
Ever since Napster came on the scene at the tail end of the 90's the RIAA has been acting like idiots and not adapting to the changing market place .
The music industry has even done things as dastardly as taking their fans to court and suing them for incredible and unpractical fines .
What has all this done ?
Killed the industry .
Make no mistake .
People will continue to make music , people will continue to make money making music .
But the industry is by and large dead now .
I do n't always want to point up and say the sky is falling , but when it 's moments from impact I at least want to be kind enough to say duck and cover .
Let 's be fair to ourselves and say that the game industry is n't quite dooming itself like the recording music industry has ... yet .
But we are doing some key things that wave the black with white skull flag of piracy if not the white flag of surrender .
Let 's take a look at those contributing factors to piracy :
Abandonware .
I can't begin to count how many insanely awesome games were made in the past and for whatever reason have no feasible legal way to purchase and play now .
An example : I have played many games in the Suikoden series and generally really enjoy it .
I have heard from many people that Suikoden II is the best .
I missed out on it while it was in retail for whatever reason and now the only officially sanctioned way for me to play it is to track it down on ebay and pay an absurd price tag that exceeds $ 100 for a used game that will give no extra pennies or yen to the developers .
Sony and Konami , you can thank me for restraining the irresistible urge to pirate that game .
I wish that was the only game that was like that , but sadly there are many out there .
And with great services like GOG.com , VirtualConsole for Wii , ( Virtual Console that should be on ) DSiware , PSN store ( Psone games can be played on both PS3 and PSP ! ) , XBLA , Steam , D2D , Impulse and others there is no excuse .
So many great old games can be run on almost all or any current hardware .
Even the DS or iDevice ( which , correct me if I 'm wrong represent the lower end of hardware power ) can run games that were on the NES , SNES , Genesis , N64 , etc .
So , I 'm missing the reason why we do n't have a full back catalog on one of those platforms ( I can cut a company , let 's say Nintendo , some slack for not wanting it 's games on Apple / Sony products , but why not on the Wii / DS ? )
Again , this frustrates me , but any logical sane human would just go directly to pirating .
High Prices .
Really guys , really ?
I mean do I even need to beat this dead horse again ?
Yep , I do .
And it has a lot to do with money I shell out for games .
And every other gamer out there .
And how upper management at the bigs rewards themselves handsomely for learning how to mark up stuff and make people just angry enough that they do n't care to do anything .
Let 's not get this wrong , overcompensating wo n't help either .
99 Cents games just do n't cut it either .
There 's a middle ground where you can afford to pay your workers a reasonable living wage and not rip off the consumer .
If a gamer must spend his hard earned cash on gas / transportation expenses just to see that the local Gamestop wants too much for a game , he 's not going to bother .
Piracy it is !
Why does any sane person pay $ 60 + transportation + taxes + fees to get something in an inconvenient way when he could just kickback , relax and pirate it for free ?
But if the marginal benefit outweighs the marginal cost , we can convince him to come to the store and give us his hard earned cash to become our hard earned cash .
Would n't that be better ?
DRM .
Not every case is as bad as the Spore fiasco .
Almost all cases are bad though .
The only decent DRM I 've ever seen / used is Valve 's Steam DRM .
It allows you to own your game , back it up , copy it , play it on a different machine ( or the same machine after a wipe / reinstall of OS ) , re-download your game , and keep your game indefinitely .
But you can't pirate it .
Any other way of doing DRM is basically like yelling “ Pirates , you just hit the mother - load of buried treasure , c'mon and get it ! ”
Why ?
Well , let 's briefly go back to the music industry .
Apple does n't think that I can handle music data I purchase , so they reserve the rights to limit my use of my stuff with their DRM .
When it comes to buying music on iTunes , I simply think “ Why ? ” I 'm old enough to be legally punished for my mis-use of my possesions , so why am I not also entitled to use them how ever I want to within the law ?
I 'd rather buy a CD ( like I still live in the 90's ) cause I can rip it and back it up for when something happens to that CD , or digital file .
Media are volatile .
All of them .
There will exist a time when I will no longer be able to use CDs , game cartridges , game discs , digital media , etc. because they exist physically in some form and nothing physical lasts forever .
I should be legally and digitally allowed to back things up .
DRM is like selling a car to someone with a ' boot ' that towing companies use as standard equipment .
Sure , you wo n't be able to do bad things with the car , like perhaps vehicular manslaughter , but then again , what the heck can you do with it ?
Not much .
Again , any sane person buys the car that does n't come with the boot , or in our case the game without DRM .
DRM encourages piracy .
Generally stupid marketing moves .
This is a bit of a catch all category since it 's hard to spell out all of these .
Basically , gamers that I know tend to be people of decent intelligence at least and can sniff out something fishy if it 's there .
And what other reaction should they have than to pirate or boycott the game ?
Things like milking gamers for money , withholding games due to stupid financial reasons ( this is a grey area , but if it benefits you as a producer way more than the gamer , you are generally in the wrong ) , bad PR , and other things along these lines .
Quick recap :
This is n't one of those OJ 's book situations .
I 'm not writing “ If I did ” like how I actually did it .
I do n't like piracy and I do not practice it with games , no matter how much you make me want to .
I 'm writing this because you make me want to be a pirate .
YAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRR !
It 's hard to resist , but I will , and I trust that you will examine your own company for these bad practices and work to amend them so that not only I am swayed from the temptation , but others out there are too .
Here 's the best part : you get more money and more loyal customers !
Take a serious look at your price tag on games .
Just cause there 's a de facto standard does n't mean you have to , or should follow it .
Has your company been at it a while in the industry ?
Chances are that 's so because you 've got a great back - catalog of games in your portfolio .
Chances are also good that gamers still want access to them and could compensate your porting / localizing efforts even on a small end user price tab .
DRM is evil .
Treat your customers like pirates and pirates they will be .
Be shrewd with your business and marketing practices .
Gamers will see through your BS if you throw it at them .
Be warned : they throw back and have great aim due to all the FPS 's we have been feeding them .
Piracy is impossible to stop altogether , but please do n't encourage it !
You 've been warned and now know better , there 's no reason to not expect a negligible piracy rate when you factor in what I 've said and keep your ears to the ground .
" Botox is a poison , " makeup artist Bobbi Brown tells the Times of London : " when we are so careful about what we put into our bodies , why do we want someone to shoot poison into our faces ? "

Brown , who says she had Botox " a couple of years ago , between my eyebrows .
I really did n't like it .
I looked unnatural , " is currently promoting a new line of cosmetics designed to help women give themselves " face - lifts " using only makeup , as opposed to plastic surgery .
Brown notes that her line is more about looking refreshed than being completely wrinkle - free : " as we age we should still want to look like ourselves , " she says , " A face without lines looks expressionless - it lacks warmth and personality .
I think there should be a movement away from using Botox and back towards real beauty . "
Sarah Crompton of the Telegraph agrees , noting that Hollywood pushes the notion that women should be wrinkle - free , even as their male co-stars are allowed to age gracefully : " Middle - aged women who actually look their age and feel proud of it are becoming invisible . "
Crompton uses Crazy Heart as an example of Hollywood 's age imbalance , pointing out that a wrinkled Jeff Bridges falls for a much younger , and wrinkle - free , Maggie Gyllenhaal .
The airbrushing of age is also a concern of Dr. Linda Papadopoulous , a government advisor in England , who is pushing for airbrushing warnings on magazines : " ' It 's going to say this is not a realistic ideal - people have pores on their face and if someone 's waist was that small their lungs would collapse . "

But even with calls for actresses and " normal " women alike to embrace their wrinkles and question the aging standards set before them , is the age of Botox truly at an end ?
Probably not .
Just as there are women ( and men ) who take their Botoxing to the extreme , there are others who view it as a simple procedure that improves their self - confidence and use it in moderation .
Botox is just the latest symptom of a youth - obsessed culture that does not allow women to age ; even if it falls out of popularity , the odds are that another " fountain of youth " will come to take its place .
The procedure is n't the problem ; it 's the culture that fosters its use , and the notion that a wrinkle is a flaw , as opposed to a natural part of the aging process , and the idea that beauty can only be found in the young .
As Brown notes : " Beauty and youth are not the same thing .
Of course we all want to look better - but that does n't have to mean looking younger .
Women simply do not need to mess around with their faces in order to look good . "
So what say you commenters ?
Is Botox on the way out ?
Have you had personal experiences with it ?

You should upgrade to Tor 0.2.1.22 or 0.2.2.7 - alpha : https://www.torproject.org/download.html.en
In early January we discovered that two of the seven directory authorities were compromised ( moria1 and gabelmoo ) , along with metrics.
torproject.org , a new server we 'd recently set up to serve metrics data and graphs .
The three servers have since been reinstalled with service migrated to other servers .
We made fresh identity keys for the two directory authorities , which is why you need to upgrade .
Moria also hosted our git repository and svn repository .
We took the services offline as soon as we learned of the breach .
It appears the attackers did n't realize what they broke into -- just that they had found some servers with lots of bandwidth .
The attackers set up some ssh keys and proceeded to use the three servers for launching other attacks .
We 've done some preliminary comparisons , and it looks like git and svn were not touched in any way .
We 've been very lucky the past few years regarding security .
It still seems this breach is unrelated to Tor itself .
To be clear , it does n't seem that anyone specifically attacked our servers to get at Tor .
It seems we were attacked for the cpu capacity and bandwidth of the servers , and the servers just happened to also carry out functions for Tor .
We 've tried to address the most common questions below .
*
Does this mean someone could have matched users up to their destinations ?
No .
By design ,
Tor requires a majority of directory authorities ( four in this case ) to generate a consensus ; and like other relays in the Tor network , directory authorities do n't know enough to match a user and traffic or destination .
*
Does this mean somebody could have changed the Tor source ?
No , we 've checked the source .
It does mean you should upgrade so your client knows about all the currently valid directory authorities .
*
Does this mean someone could have learned more about Tor than an ordinary user ?
Since our software and specifications are open , everyone already has access to almost everything on these machines ... except some old bridge descriptors , which we give out only in small batches as entry points for blocked clients .
* Can I trust
Tor 's security ?
We 've taken steps to fix the weaknesses identified and to harden our systems further .
Tor has a track record of openness and transparency , with its source code and specifications and also with its operations .
Moreover , we 're disclosing breaches such as this so you can monitor our status .
You should n't assume those who do n't disclose security breaches never have any !

The rosary vs. the ring finger : St. Paul , Minnesota edition
by Jeremy Hooper
Look out , Minnesota .
The man who most everyone involved on the pro-Prop 8 side of the debate credits as being the sole most important guiding voice , Bishop Salvatore Cordileone , is coming to St. Paul next month to rally Catholics for the cause of " reclaiming " marriage .
And he 's bringing along with him Maggie Gallagher , the person who flat - out admits that she " was asked to fly to San Diego in October of 2007 " to begin working with Cordileone on what would eventually become Prop 8 :
Event info ( * be sure to also note the support for the " Manhattan Declaration , " a doc with some pretty eye - opening signatures )
So why is this important ?
Well , because Minnesota , which neighbors marriage - allowing Iowa , is currently without a anti-equality amendment .
Which means that the push is on from both sides :
Maggie laid the groundwork with Cordileone in California , and we know from her own admission that she held private meetings with one of Maine 's biggest anti-equality Catholics , Bishop Malone , in the early days of that ballot fight .
Plus the NOM - Catholic coalition has been the major donor in these ballot initiative states .
And in every jurisdiction where this has been in contention , we know that the Catholic community has been rallied with the fury of a thousand Hail Marys , with church bulletins turned into fundraisers , vote - getters , and general condemnations of our civil -- civil , civil , did we mention , CIVIL !??! -- equality .
Do not ignore this evidence of a new push , Minnesota !
The time to start caring is NOW !
***
** NOTE : Unlike Maine and California , Minnesota does not have an initiative / referendum process .
It would be up to the legislature to put an amendment before the voters , which seems unlikely now , but is not outside the realm of possibility in the future .

What needs to be done is a direct action like ACTUP used to do .
Get a bunch of people together , go to this " event " wait until everyone gets good and setteled in , then start waving the flags and banners and chanting and screaming at the people there until the cops come to break it up .

True , it is not certain that global warming will destroy the earth .
But nothing is certain when you 're talking about climate change .
The cost of doing something about that potential climate change , meanwhile , is small relative to the possible benefit .
As a result , argues Robert Frank in the NYT , we should phase in a $ 300 / ton carbon tax , which will result in U.S. gas prices rising by $ 2.60 per gallon .
The Europeans have already adapted quite nicely to gas prices that are $ 4 a gallon higher than they are here , so the argument that this will destroy the country seems a bit hysterical .
If we do nothing , meanwhile , global temperatures seem almost certain to rise , no matter who is doing the predicting .
The consensus model at MIT , which includes the forecast of global warming denialists , shows a zero- percent chance of no temperature increase over the next century -- and a 10 % chance of a catastrophic 12 - degree one .
Given the odds that global warming will inflict serious global pain over the next century , the cost of taking action seems low .
Of course , because the causes of global warming seem natural and unobjectionable , we wo n't take action , especially in a country in which cheap gas has come to be viewed as a constitutional right .
As Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert puts it :
“ If climate change were caused by gay sex , or by the practice of eating kittens , millions of protesters would be massing in the streets . ”
Read Robert Frank 's whole argument here >
Carl and I have been working on the plugins system over the past few days .
As part of that process , we read through the Rails Plugin Guide .
While reading through the guide , we noticed a number of idioms presented in the guide that are serious overkill for the task at hand .
I do n't blame the author of the guide ; the idioms presented are roughly the same that have been used since the early days of Rails .
However , looking at them brought back memories of my early days using Rails , when the code made me feel as though Ruby was full of magic incantations and ceremony to accomplish relatively simple things .
Here 's an example :
module Yaffle def self.included ( base ) base . send : extend , ClassMethods end module ClassMethods # any method placed here will apply to classes , like Hickwall def acts_as_something send : include , InstanceMethods end end module InstanceMethods # any method placed here will apply to instaces , like @hickwall end end
To begin with , the send is completely unneeded .
The acts_as_something method will be run on the Class itself , giving the method access to include , a private method .
This code intended to be used as follows :
class ActiveRecord :: Base include Yaffle end class Article < ActiveRecord :: Base acts_as_yaffle end
What the code does is :
Register a hook so that when the module is included , the ClassMethods are extended onto the class
In that module , define a method that includes the InstanceMethods
So that you can say acts_as_something in your code
The crazy thing about all of this is that it 's completely reinventing the module system that Ruby already has .
This would be exactly identical :
module Yaffle # any method placed here will apply to classes , like Hickwall def acts_as_something send : include , InstanceMethods end module InstanceMethods # any method placed here will apply to instances , like @hickwall end end
To be used via :
class ActiveRecord :: Base extend Yaffle end class Article < ActiveRecord :: Base acts_as_yaffle end
In a nutshell , there 's no point in overriding include to behave like extend when Ruby provides both !
To take this a bit further , you could do :
module Yaffle # any method placed here will apply to instances , like @hickwall , # because that 's how modules work !
end
To be used via :
class Article < ActiveRecord :: Base include Yaffle end
In effect , the initial code ( override included hook to extend a method on , which then includes a module ) is two layers of abstraction around a simple Ruby include !
Let 's look at a few more examples :
module Yaffle def self.included ( base ) base .
send : extend , ClassMethods end module ClassMethods def acts_as_yaffle ( options = {} ) cattr_accessor :yaffle_text_field self.yaffle_text_field = ( options [ : yaffle_text_field ] || : last_squawk ) .to_s end end end ActiveRecord :: Base.send :include , Yaffle
Again , we have the idiom of overriding include to behave like extend ( instead of just using extend ! ) .
A better solution :
module Yaffle def acts_as_yaffle ( options = {} ) cattr_accessor :yaffle_text_field self.yaffle_text_field = options [:yaffle_text_field ].to_s || " last_squawk " end end ActiveRecord : : Base.
extend Yaffle
In this case , it 's appropriate to use an acts_as_yaffle , since you 're providing additional options which could not be encapsulated using the normal Ruby extend .
Another " more advanced " case :
module Yaffle def self.included ( base ) base .
send : extend , ClassMethods end module ClassMethods def acts_as_yaffle ( options = {} ) cattr_accessor :yaffle_text_field self.yaffle_text_field = ( options [ : yaffle_text_field ] || : last_squawk ) .to_s send : include , InstanceMethods end end module InstanceMethods def squawk ( string ) write_attribute(self.class.yaffle_text_field , string.to_squawk ) end end end ActiveRecord :: Base .send :include , Yaffle
Again , we have the idiom of overriding include to pretend to be an extend , and a send where it is not needed .
Identical functionality :
module Yaffle def acts_as_yaffle ( options = {} ) cattr_accessor :yaffle_text_field self.yaffle_text_field = ( options [ : yaffle_text_field ] || : last_squawk ) .to_s include InstanceMethods end module InstanceMethods def squawk ( string ) write_attribute(self.class.yaffle_text_field , string.to_squawk ) end end end ActiveRecord :: Base .extend Yaffle
Of course , it is also possible to do :
module Yaffle def squawk ( string ) write_attribute(self.class.yaffle_text_field , string.to_squawk ) end end class ActiveRecord : : Base def self.acts_as_yaffle(options = {} ) cattr_accessor :yaffle_text_field self.yaffle_text_field = ( options [ : yaffle_text_field ] || : last_squawk ) .to_s include Yaffle end end
Since the module is always included in ActiveRecord : : Base , there is no reason that the earlier code , with its additional modules and use of extend , is superior to simply reopening the class and adding the acts_as_yaffle method directly .
Now we can put the squawk method directly inside the Yaffle module , where it can be included cleanly .
It may not seem like a huge deal , but it significantly reduces the amount of apparent magic in the plugin pattern , making it more accessible for new users .
Additionally , it exposes the new user to include and extend quickly , instead of making them feel as though they were magic incantations requiring the use of send and special modules named ClassMethods in order to get them to work .
To be clear , I 'm not saying that these idioms are n't sometimes needed in special , advanced cases .
However , I am saying that in the most common cases , they 're huge overkill that obscures the real functionality and confuses users .

That 's kinda the point of this series .
If the NYT was so easily conned by these same guys --- on a story that was easily verifiable * before * they misreported it --- how can we count on them to investigate the important points you mention above ?
If they remain in the pockets of these con-men , the stuff that actually matters will never get covered .
And , unfortunately , The BRAD BLOG World News Headquarters does n't have quite the same resources and access to dig into every one of the stories that they need to be doing for the American people !
( But do n't let that stop you from dropping a few dollars in the tip jar so we can keep trying ! )

I found the following Hoyt statement nothing short of fascinating : " The Times would need to find out for itself what actually happened at those Acorn offices .
It is up to the paper to decide whether the investment of effort is worthwhile . "
Odd , Mr. Hoyt .
I thought real journalists were supposed to make an " investment of effort " in order to determine " what actually happened " before they run a story .
But then maybe I 'm just old school .
I always thought that in real journalism , truth and accuracy actually mattered .
I see that I must be out of date ; that like " new math " we are now in the 21st Century era of " new journalism " or what George Orwell referred to as " newsspeak . "

re my own comment 3 Was I being overly dramatic ?
The way this story is taking off seems like a big deal to me .
It 's thrilling to see Brad 's efforts finally getting what I hope is significant traction .
I had visions of him getting on Maddow regularly and that he'd then be off to the races and stars .
Whatever happens I 'd like to amend my fantasy for us the supporting cast here .
My elves , gnomes , trolls bit of whimsy had some nice elements but I felt afterwards a little dismissive of the power of the intelligence , persistence , and creativity of the impressive cast of characters here .
So rather than a picture of us being left behind while our hero is out in New York after the show having dinner with Rachel Maddow , I want to wish us all possible starring roles in our own adventure after adventure , lighting fire after fire under the monster 's toes .
Relentless and wild .
There are a bunch of good - hearted , tough , smart people here .
I think it 's important what you imagine .
( Okay , I 'm laughing out loud .
This is cyberspace and I 'm trying to expand the boundaries and having fun in the attempt .
And I 've had a couple of weird days and I 'm releasing here .
But I fear I may be sounding like a complete lunatic .
So let me just say that I do n't think I 'm complete .
Yet .
But I 'm working on it . ) love , Dave

... Lora said on 2/24/2010 @ 8:21 pm PT ...
Brad , this is a great and wonderful endeavor .
The two representatives of the NYT who you have been dealing with have shown themselves to be really pathetic .
I ’ve spent a good deal of time studying the Baltimore transcript .
I wanted to check for myself how the transcript compared with the videos in terms of the tax advice given .
Did the tax advisor really advise Giles to pay her taxes , or did she advise Giles to hide her income ?
With the very important caveat that we do n’t know how accurate the transcript is without the unedited video , I believe the answer is a little of both .
Consider the following exchanges ( emphasis added ) :
[ Note : I typed this from the PDF .
My apologies for any typos . ] ( p .
Tonja : well there is a difference between having a job and having your own business okay so tell me
Kenya [ Giles ] :
Well I guess before it was a job .
There was this guy that people would give me money and I would give money to him … .
[ Here Tonja is trying to establishing whether “ Kenya ” has her own business or works for someone else . ] ( p.9 )
Tonja : right so you wanna get a house so you do need a tax return so what you do is .
For ’08 how much did you make do you know … guesstimate .
James :
Is that by herself or is that gross with the money she gave to that guy … this guy who has been harassing her
Tonja : that guy .. do n’t worry about that guy because if he does n’t do a quarterly report
James : & Kenya [ Giles ] : uh huh
Tonja : he is not reporting that money
James : well it ’s all off the books
Kenya : right
Tonja : so he is not reporting that money so do n’t use that money just the money you made [ Here Tonja is advising Giles not to report income from the “ job , ” just from her own " business . "
The “ job ” money is classic “ under - the - table ” money .
Legally it should be reported , just as all income should be reported .
So should babysitting money , all tip money and all money made on the side that most people do n’t report , probably on the advice of their tax professionals too .
But , technically , here Tonja is advising her not to report certain income on her tax return . ]
p. 16
Tonja :
In order for you to file a return for business
Kenya : what ’s a return
Tonja : a tax return .
In order for you to file a return for business you have to
Kenya : so I am returning taxes to the government
Tonja : no you have to pay taxes on the money you makeJames : is there any way around that though
Tonja : yeah do n’t file them and you continue doing cash
James : okay okay [ Tonja is explaining that Hannah must claim income and pay taxes on it . ]
In other exchanges , Tonja questions Hannah as to why they want to file a return at all .
It comes back to needing a tax return for a mortgage on a house .
Also , when gathering information for a Schedule C for Hannah 's business , Tonja is looking for appropriate business deductions ( clothing , grooming , etc ) that will offset the income and reduce it below where she will have to pay self - employment tax .
This is not hiding income but rather looking for " legitimate " business expenses ( if you can have legitimate expenses for an illegitimate business , that is ! )
In conclusion and based only on this transcript which has not been vetted for accuracy , I would say that Tonja questioned why Hannah would want to file tax returns on an illegal , cash - only business , advised Hannah NOT to report the " job " income from her association with the pimp , but made a bona fide effort at getting information for a business tax return that would be fairly accurate and reflective of both income and expenses .

Bottom line :
Sure , those misguided dolts on the right wing who still believe that they are liberal will be glad to see the NYT go down , but so will I , and I 'm as far from the right as you can get .

Oh , and P.S. Did the venerable and great New York Times EVER do a well - researched and balanced story on the total destruction of our electoral system ?
No .
It was Rolling Stone who had to do that story , and even THEN , the Times could have picked up the story ( they way they picked up the stories of the Washington Post when they wanted to take down Nixon ) and run with it , but NO , they did not .
The single most important story of our country 's history --- that our electoral process has been stolen --- and the " paper of record " has missed it completely .

Lora :
Thanks for the link to the Baltimore transcript .
I had watched the video previously - - ca n't quite remember where someone else posted it .
The transcript underscores O'Keefe and Giles deception .
It is a far cry from the edited video .
It begins by revealing that O'Keefe and Giles ( who went by the name Kenya ) advised the ACORN workers at the outset that O'Keefe was a 22 year old college student hoping to one day run for Congress .
They are half way to the end of the transcript before the word " prostitution " is mentioned .
The word " pimp " is later mentioned but only in the sense that they were seeking to protect Giles from the guy .
It is obvious from the content that the ACORN " tax employee " is not the sharpest tool in the shed .
Giles tells her she 's making $ 8 grand / month and the tax employee concludes that Giles is making $ 9,600 / year .
Through much of the conversation both Giles and O'Keefe are quite evasive , dropping hints but never coming out until the very end stating that Giles works as a prostitute .
That said , some of the conversation towards the end suggests that the light went on for the tax employee and the " advice " she gave them was , in my opinion , quite inappropriate .
What also comes through is that Giles and O'Keefe never once said that the girls coming from El Salvador would be working as prostitutes .
To the contrary , O'Keefe says that they 're going to put a roof over their heads and that 's how the conversation turns to whether they can claim them as dependents .
Keep in mind that per Harshbarger , no ACORN supervisory personnel were present during the entire interaction and that both of these employees were fired the moment their conduct came to light .

" Not the sharpest tool in the shed " may be a bit unfair there .
At least from the evidence you proffer .
Obviously , she heard $ 800 / month , not $ 8 grand ( $ 800 x 12 months = $ 9,600 ) FWIW .
And yes , the low - level employees did n't follow ACORN 's written protocols , etc. and so were let go .
But the difference between that , and criminal wrong doing is , apparently , too fine a nuance for wingnuts to actually understand .
So the fact that they were fired is evidence that ACORN is a " criminal organization " .
Sigh ...

You want a story Mr. Hoyt ? worth your investment ?
I have doozie for you .
It 's all about this community organization , ACORN
They have been attacked relentlessly for years over a supposed role they played in Voter Fraud .
You 've heard of Voter Fraud I 'm sure Mr. Hoyt and when you do , do you think of ACORN ?
Most People do .
They have been brainwashed again and again to equate Voter Fraud with , you got it , ACORN .
Then comes along this " Amateur Sting Journalism "
with its out of context video that captures a few employees out of 10's of 1000 's giving very bad advice , which , cost them their jobs , but also sparked such a furor that Congress cut off all federal funding to it , over a video we now know was bullshit !
The Story Mr. Hoyt is to look at who wants ACORN destroyed and why ?
Why not do a story and right the wrongs done to this Community organization ?
Their only crime Mr Hoyt , is registering Minority Voters who mostly Vote towards Democrats .
So when your paper continues the lies ( so ever small in your eye's ) to me , it 's a big deal " Freedom of the Press , is only free , if you own it "

What I wrote Mr Hoyt :
Mr Hoyt :
I find your inability to review the ACORN issue very revealing .
It confirms for me that people in the mainstream news media are more comfortable with telling the stories that conform to the accepted mindset of the " in " crowd , and not to newly developing facts as they are revealed .
This is the same mind set of a religious zealot .
A zealot is so sure of his / her position that even in the face of damning facts they are unwilling to admit that there was a wrong interpretation .
Mr. Hoyt , you seem to be unwilling to consider any possibility of inaccurate reporting .
The scientific approach would be to make a hypothesis , and if facts come to light that challenge the initial hypothesis then you should be willing to entertain and even change your hypothesis to fit the new evidence .
You , on the other hand , disregard the new evidence because it does not conform to your beliefs .
Either you are a media zealot who is unwilling to consider other views , or you and your paper have other agendas ( or people with agendas that have to be placated ) .
Neither is good for the reputation of the " paper of record " .
This is why I have not subscribed to the NY TImes and I only read it through internet sites or when I visit my parents .
When I visit my parents and read the paper I am reminded by the narrowness of coverage why I am glad I am not a subscriber .

The mental gymnastics required of Hoyt to avoid saying / looking at something he just can't bring himself to honestly examine is beyond Olympian .
But I 'm telling you this goes way beyond this guy .
From where I 'm sitting , standing , trying to engage people , it 's a cultural thing .
I do n't know to what extent it 's true in other countries , but we 've got an epidemic of magic thinking in the U.S.
I 've seen it again and again in my personal life .
It happens in personal matters when there is conflict .
It can happen when you bring up some uncomfortable political matter .
Can be election integrity , our endangered food supply , the reality behind the ongoing Acorn attacks , Israel , any number of things .
And it happens across the political spectrum .
It 's what WE do .
Time and again I have witnessed people just refuse to look at what is right in front of them .
They jump and weave and dance and dodge and go silent .
This is what Hoyt is doing , but he 's just picked up on an MO that 's going on all around him .
And for the most part we let each other get away with this .
Particularly unfortunate in his case because this is exactly what his job requires him NOT doing .
But he is not really behaving much outside the lines .
Just seems that way if you 're a freak who still wants the words to mean what the words mean .
It 's gonna be a long haul getting the meaning of words back , chillun ' .
So roll up your sleeves .
Make sure you got on some shoes with good traction .
And push that windmill .
Just for context .

As I noted in # 20 , When Giles and O'Keefe came into the Baltimore ACORN office they represented to the temporary employees that O'Keefe was a college student hoping to one day run for Congress - - a far cry from the pimp & prostitute canard which emerged in the right - wing echo chamber and which then was repeated by the unthinkingly stenographers of the corporate - owned media who mistakenly describe themselves as " journalists . "
Forget the fact that O'Keefe never posed as a pimp .
The transcript reveals the extraordinary deception employed by Giles & O'Keefe to secure what they hoped would be damning words from the unsuspecting ACORN employees without actually divulging that Giles was posing as a " prostitute . "
I 've used " ACORN tax lady , " Giles & O'Keefe rather than the pseudonyms used in the transcript and edited for punctuation .
ACORN tax lady :
They pay you with cash .
And they are reporting this to the government ?
Giles :
No who ?
O’Keefe :
The clients .
Giles :
My clients .
Tax lady :
No the person that ’s paying you .
James :
The clients .
Tax lady :
The job that ’s paying you .
Giles :
Well people pay me different things every day .
Tax lady :
Well there ’s a difference between having a job and having your own business .
Okay , so tell me .
Giles :
Well before I guess it was a job .
There was this guy that people would give me money and I would give money to him .
But now …I am trying to get away from that guy .
O’Keefe : I am trying to help her out ; maybe give her a place to go where she can perform her work , maybe a house where she does n’t have to get targeted by this other guy .
You know what I am saying ?
Tax lady : … Does the business have an ID number ?
O’Keefe : No .
Tax lady : Okay .
So there is no taxes and nothing being put to government so the government really knows nothing about this business ?
Giles : No .
They do n’t know about me — hopefully .
Tax lady :
So you are just starting the business .
Note how slickly Giles and O'Keefe moved from taxes to a house where Giles can work without ever divulging that the " work " would entail prostitution ?
Note also that the ACORN tax lady does not have the slightest inkling that Giles is a prostitute .
If she did , she would not be asking about tax ID numbers .
__________________
Responding to Brad @ 21 :
Tax lady : About $ 800 a month .
Giles : 8 grand a month .
Tax lady : 8 grand a month .
Okay .
So that ’s going to put you at 8,000 , 9,600 a year .
Clearly the tax lady did n't know that 8 grand is $ 8,000 .
This and the inability to recognize the ruse are the reasons why I do n't think she 's one of the " sharpest tools in the shed . "
I state that not in a derogatory sense , but actually because it underscores the extent to which O'Keefe & Giles manipulated her , for Giles & O'Keefe , too , understood that they were not dealing with one of the sharpest tools in the shed ; sought to exploit that to their advantage .

As to who funded okeefe , think " blowjob " and who funded that ... olbermann made the connection a couple of weeks back .
" Politico.com today reports all four men , quote , “ had been groomed for years to be part of a new wave of activist conservative journalists by a series of influential and often deep - pocketed benefactors , not as you might imagine friends of health care reform .
O‘Keefe , Basel and Stan Dai all received grants to start their right - wing college newspapers from the Leadership Institute , right - wing training ground for alumni like Karl Rove and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell .
They got more funding from the right - wing Collegiate Network funded by Richard Mellon Scaife among others .
And O‘Keefe ‘s legal bills for the ACORN lawsuit against him are being paid for by a legal group affiliated with James Dobson ‘s Focus on the Family . "
And do n’t forget this component :

According to Media Matters Mr Hoyt " devoted an entire column last year in order to scold the Times news team for not reacting fast enough to the all - important ACORN story . "
So when Mr Hoyt says that everyone in this story has a political agenda he really means it .
Thing is , the Public Editor of the " paper of record " should n't be one of them .
Hoyt should be fired immediately .

And the punch - line is that ACORN has folded , in large part because of media coverage by the NYTimes .
I heard the head of the Working Families Party of NYS , which has been affiliated with ACORN in the past , say that ACORN has ended .
There 's a new group formed in NYS to continue some of the work .
One more success story for big lies .
I heard the Working Family Party head on the radio several days ago , on Mark Riley 's show , " Early Drive Time " on WWRL AM 1600 .

Brad and Ernest ,
How about we say that the ACORN tax adviser was confused .
With all the innuendo the two imposters were throwing around , it would have been hard to figure out just what was going on .
She may have heard $ 8 grand but it may not have registered .
What would anyone making $ 96,000 a year be doing in ACORN 's offices anyway ?
She may have simply been confused enough to have assumed $ 800 a month , which would have been exactly what she said : $ 9600 a year .
I think she had this confusion during the entire interview .
In part I think she heard what she expected to hear , but checked out most of her assumptions with questions .
I think the same thing happened with the El Salvadorean ( later inexplicably turned into Guatemalan ) girls .
I 'm speculating here that the tax adviser did not want to think that O'Keefe and Giles were planning to pimp out a bunch of underage girls .
The situation was getting more and more bizarre and she just wanted to focus on what she knew : taxes .
Consider p. 18 of the transcript : James : well I want to ask you a question there is another variable here that Kenya should we talk to you about which may complicate our taxes is that we have a couple of girls overseas who are coming over and they are very young you know , what I mean .
We do n't wanna put them on the books .
Kenya : they are kind of dependent
James : they are from El Salvador
Tonja : okay
James : there is like 13 of them and they are probably going to move into the house that we get
Kenya : just for a year while they get on their feet
James : just to get them on their feet so they can do this type of thing
Tonja : so do you want to .... so why you all even wanna do taxes oh cause of the house
The tax adviser then focuses on the tax implications of young dependents in a household and seems oblivious or ignores what type of work if any the girls might potentially be doing , seeming to assume that the girls will be somehow coming over legally , unitl p. 20 : Tonja :
They under 16 so you do n't worry about that , but on the other part of the form you can use them as a dependents because they live in your house they are under 16 and they are living in your house .
Well you live in a boat but because you are taking care of them you can use them as a dependent .
James : what if they are going to be making money because they are performing tricks too
Tonja : but if they making money and they are underage you should n't be letting anybody know anyway O'Keefe slipped in the zinger about performing tricks and Tonja ignored that part totally .
I expect she was overwhelmed and not quite processing everything she was hearing .
She stuck to the part relating to employment and employment taxes .
I also found it interesting that O'Keefe was the one who supplied the zingers about prostitution and Hannah seemed to present herself more as someone who was just watching out for the girls ' interests .
And the tax advisor I believe was focused on Hannah .

The media was liberal at one time .
It did hold the powerful accountable .
What better plan was there than for the powerful to usurp the liberal media and keep calling it liberal ?
The reason they call it liberal is because it was liberal before they usurped it .
So , it follows , that those who keep calling it liberal , like Rush Limbaugh , work for the powerful .

When an editor at a paper such as the NYTimes cannot admit when he is wrong , and then attacks the person who is telling him about being wrong as having a political agenda , then : 1 . He needs to step down
2 . He should be fired
3 . If neither of the above is done , then there 's something really funny going on that needs even FURTHER investigation !

Remember I asked why they want us to keep thinking it's " liberal " ?
The " liberal media " ?
And I think Karen said that was a good but unanswered question ?
Well , I think the answer is because when the liberal media was usurped , the powerful who usurped it had to keep calling it liberal so you 'd think they did n't usurp it !
That 's actually a pretty simple answer , but it was very difficult to figure out .
Ron Paul 's Tea Party was usurped the same way , and guess what ?
They kept calling it the Tea Party !
LOL !
It all makes sense !
" Thou dost protest too loudly " .
When they usurp an existing entity , like the media , they also overcompensate by saying " liberal media " a million times a day .
The ones saying it are the ones who usurped it , like Rush Limbaugh , which is an accurate indicator of who is usurping it .
Breitbart , too , he always says " liberal media " .
Notice , though , with this NYTimes thing , Breitbart is n't calling the NYTimes the " liberal media " !

Wikipedia : Clark Hoyt is an American journalist who is currently the public editor of the New York Times , serving as the ' readers representative ' .
He is the newspaper 's third public editor , or ombudsman , after Daniel Okrent and Byron Calame .
His initial two - year term began on May 14 , 2007 , and was later extended for another two years .
Hoyt is a member of the The Hill School class of 1960 and a 1964 graduate of Columbia University .
He served previously as the Washington , D.C. bureau chief for Knight Ridder newspapers .
On Sept. 27 , Times ombudsman Clark Hoyt published a column in which the paper 's managing editor acknowledged having been " slow off the mark " but denied that political bias played any role .
[ 1 ]
An October 16 , 2009 , Wall Street Journal interview with Andrew Breitbar [ 2 ] revealed his intention to use the Acorn scandal as an opportunity to expose a liberal media bias .
In November 2009 , Hoyt publicly responded to an allegation by Timothy Dolan , the archbishop of New York , that the New York Times was displaying a systematic anti-Catholic bias .

If the NYTimes does n't publish a retraction , it 's " Mission : Accomplished " for rightwingers who can make shit up and the NYTimes will act as a stenographer for them instead of a world class newspaper .
So , that 's what they NYTimes wants to be known as , fine .
That 's what I thought is was , anyway , since the Judith Miller propaganda and then getting William Kristol as a columnist .
Liberal ???
They 're becoming a joke , at least to those who actually check up on things .
Maybe they cut too many people to save money and they 're just stenographers who are really appreciative when someone like Breitbart does the " work " for them and they just transcribe it and say he was their source .
I have an idea : Hoyt should fire himself and just let Breitbart be the ombudsman !

SO ...it's " OK " for the NYTimes not to retract a damaging myth to ACORN !
Is it because ACORN is considered a " black " organization ?
Is there some RACISM involved here ?
A bunch of rich WHITE conservatives did the myth so they 're not retracting it ?

A couple of studies released last year produced surprising results about the average consumers of right - wing media .
“ The dirty little secret of conservative talk radio is that the average age of listeners is 67 [ so now 68 ] and rising … [ The ]
Fox News audience , likewise , is in its mid-60s . ”
In addition , a Pew study in February 2009 found that 72 percent of Rush Limbaugh ’s grizzled Dittoheads are men and so have a life expectancy of 75.6 years , which means this cohort will expire by 2017 .
Limbaugh will be 60 next January , which means he will be 67 when his average - aged listeners die off .......

I was recently reviewing the online edition of the NYT fourth quarter report .
According to my recollection , their costs have been cut , resulting in over $ 400 million savings , their advertising revenues are up , they intend to begin the pay for play online in 2011 .
They expect increasing revnue based on their " Quality reporting " .

@ #61 I would suggest the Council for National Policy as an excellent point of refernce to begin connecting the dots .
However , to be clear , I have NOT seen evidence of Mr. Hoyt being associated with CNP , whatsoever .
The CNP was founded in 1981 , just two years after Morton Blackwell founded the Leadersip Institute , whose alumnae including the Pimpostor and his telephoneys .
( BTW , Blackwell was raised in Louisiana , and has longstanding ties to Abramoff , as they were both active in College Republicans activites .
Blackwell was Rove 's mentor .
And is not coincidental , that Tony Perkins of FRC is a member , nor the David Vitter is on the LI board - they are both from Louisiana .
And ACORN 's national headquarters is in New Orleans . )

sooner or later , we 're gonna come to terms with the fact that the only reason they have n't come after brad and all more aggressively ( and nastily ) is because they do n't feel the need .

Of course it still needs some work but it is exciting to realize that a release might come in the near future .
For those that are unfamiliar with Fennec , Fennec is the name of Mozilla ’s mobile project which aims to provide a mobile web browser with similar goals to what FireFox has brought to desktops .
The Mozilla team is striving to “ Deliver an exceptional mobile experience to users , complete with the performance , personalization and security you expect ” .

The NSW Government wants to erode the current defence of " scientific , medical , legal , artistic or other public benefit purpose " of the Crimes Act ( s 91H ( 4 ) Crimes Act ) .
Great works of art have as their basis that young people are sexual , precocious , attractive and careless with their affections .
Romeo and Juliet were 13 .
In a knee - jerk - off reaction to Bill Henson 's case last year , the Attorney - General wants to illegalise possession of images or words that appear to sexualise persons " under 16 or who looks like a child under 16 " .
Beware flat - chested women .
Fair enough .
No one wants to defend real child pornography but if , like Henson 's work , it serves a higher purpose , is shown in relative seclusion and is a thing of acclaimed beauty , then are we not burning books ?
Child pornography is in the eye of the beholder .
The favourite television show of the rock spiders at Long Bay is It 's Academic .
At 4 pm every day , they roll their sleeves and get down to basics .
Many have posters of Bindi Irwin in jungle greens .
No amount of censorship takes away the desire , imagination and cunning of the deviant .
They cut out newspaper advertisements for school uniforms , search the internet for photos involving kids toys and clothes .
They would get off on a postage stamp if it had one of the young princes on it .
Civility , of course , must be maintained .
However , the Government 's proposals in the Report of the Child Pornography Working Party claim they want to bring the NSW statutes in line with the federal law .
Under the Commonwealth Criminal Code , " the literary , artistic or educational merit [ if any ] of the material " is just a factor in deciding if material is child pornography .
It allows for expert evidence to be given on the issue .
The proposed state laws would take away the defence of artistic merit and replace it with visions that suggest such intent and pursuits can be taken into account in deciding if the material is child pornography .
Drunk Driving Death Clock as shown on March 5 , 2009 I placed 15 of these machines in a town of only 200,000 people .
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) reports that , on average , someone is killed by a drunk driver every 40 minutes .
A new computer widget is shedding light on that startling statistic .
AlcoholAlert.com , a manufacturer of drunk driving / alcohol breathalyzers , has just announced that its frequently accessed Death Clock is now available for download and sharing on personal and business Web sites , blogs and social networking pages .
Individuals who would like to illuminate the ongoing havoc drunk driving wreaks on society can download the portable Death Clock widget online at AlcoholAlert.com .
According to the Centers for Disease Control , the year 1982 saw 25,165 drunk driving casualties .
That was the first year such statistics were compiled , and the figure represented an all - time high for such deaths .
NHTSA statistics further reveal that " in 2007 , an estimated 12,998 people died in drunk driving related crashes . "
That 's still a staggering number despite the noticeable decrease over time .
When it comes to the victims and their families just a single death at the hands of an inebriated driver is one too many .
The myriad heart - breaking Drunk Driving Memorial pages created by victims ' loved ones on AlcoholAlert.com attest to that fact .
The sad part about this sobering situation is that many of the intoxicated drivers who wind up taking a life had no idea their blood alcohol levels exceeded the legal limit .
The scene repeats itself at alcohol - serving establishments across the country .
The bartender asks a patron who 's quite possibly had one too many drinks to hand over his or her keys and wait for a cab to be called .
The customer blows off the offer , insisting he or she is fine to get behind the wheel .
Minutes later , another casualty is added to the Death Clock toll .
Alas , a little eye - opening proof of non-sobriety might very well have prevented the tragedy .
Developed by KeRo , LLC , the Alcohol Alert breathalyzer aims to provide just that .
The vending machine accurately tests breath alcohol content to alert impairment and prevent possible drunk driving , thereby sparing unsuspecting victims of its deadly effects .
Police - tested and enhanced , this coin / dollar bill - operated talking vending machine can easily be installed anywhere alcohol is served or consumed .
In combination with the company 's new Death Clock , the breathalyzer opens people 's eyes to the devastating consequences of drinking and driving .
When Jim Thompson put the Alcohol Alert breathalyzers to the test in Lubbock , Texas , a few years back , the results surprised him .
" I placed 15 of these machines in a town of only 200,000 people . "
Over a three - month test period , " This initial study has shown a decrease of seven percent in alcohol - related traffic accidents after the introduction of the machines .
There were no other police or private campaigns run during the same time period that could account for the drop .
Thus , it can be safely assumed that the machines played a large role in that reduction . "

As if that was n’t cool enough , they were also sending me $ 100 and a free one - year subscription to the magazine .
How cool is that ? ”

But did you Know she had some Hidden Brothers and sisters all over Space and time ?

WRITTEN off for dead just five days ago , Taronga Zoo 's teak - tough elephant calf has emerged from intensive care to perform his first routine on the public stage .
Sticking close to the protective belly of his mother Porntip , the calf , dubbed Mr Shuffles , gingerly explored the confines of one of the world 's more unlikely elephant breeding grounds on the harbour 's rocky edge on the fringe of Mosman .
Venturing close to the waters of his yard 's little pond , his trunk danced like a conductor 's baton as he sampled smells and textures of his world , tasting the palm trunk that was his mother 's breakfast .
He sniffed sawdust and almost teetered over as he struggled up a tiny mound of earth , a first lesson on just how high an elephant 's centre of gravity really is .
Apart from his bloodshot eyes , which are a normal feature of birth , he appears remarkably healthy .
Although , the zoo's experts are still struggling to comprehend how quickly the 116 - kilogram infant has recovered from a week - long labour , including three motionless days in a coma with no hint of a heartbeat .
Are home Bible studies slowly being made illegal in many areas of the United States ?
Unfortunately , the headline above is not a joke .
It is actually happening in many areas of the country .
Many of you who are reading this have already seen some of the headlines .
It just seems so bizarre that authorities are spending their time and resources going after home Bible studies when there are so many other problems out there right now .
But it is happening .
Ever since the United States was created , people have gathered in their homes to study the Bible and worship God together .
There has never been a time when such meetings in homes have been against the law .
Until now .
For example , it is being reported that a home Bible study group in Rancho Cucamonga , California must have a “ Conditional Use Permit ” by Good Friday , April 2nd , in order to continue gathering .
This is for a Friday Bible study that only has an average of 15 people attend .
Do the authorities there really need to spend time , money and resources to stop a 15 person Bible study ?
No wonder this nation is spinning wildly out of control .
But sadly there are more examples of this phenomenon .
One town in Arizona has actually banned absolutely all church meetings in private homes .
Seriously .
The pastor of the Oasis of Truth Church received a cease and desist letter ordering him to terminate all religious meetings in his home , regardless of their size , nature , or frequency .
So how many members does this horribly threatening church have ?
7 members .
But apparently the town of Gilbert , Arizona is prepared to go all out to keep these 7 adults and their children from having Bible studies in their homes .
What in the world has happened to the United States of America ?
The truth is that we need to be able to meet in our homes .
The home church movement in America is growing , because most of the “ establishment churches ” have sold out and have abandoned the gospel long ago .
But in the new America the churches that sell out and conform to worldly standards are the ones that get approval from the establishment .
For example , many national leaders are absolutely thrilled that the Episcopal Church has confirmed the election of an Annapolis , Maryland priest as the first openly lesbian bishop in the worldwide Anglican Communion .
But churches and Christian organizations that try to live according to God ’s standards increasingly find themselves being persecuted .
In fact , a new bill before Congress would prohibit Christian adoption agencies from refusing to adopt to gay and lesbian couples .
So would that cause a large number of Christian adoption agencies to shut down ?
Of course .
But they do n’t care .
The truth is that America is increasingly becoming a hostile place for Christians .
But America is not alone .
The world is becoming an increasingly hostile place for Christians , but this is exactly what Yahshua ( Jesus ) told us would happen in the last days .
Persecution of Christians is only going to get worse from here on out , so you better buckle up and get ready .
This is going to be quite a ride .
PARIS , France —
From the day of their first public date — at Disneyland Paris of all places — their lives have always seemed torn from the pages of a fairy tale .
That was back in December 2007 when the confident new French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , courted the Italian - born model and French pop singer , Carla Bruni , as they wandered the pathways with Disney 's fabled characters .
Soon after , they wed and became an extraordinary media sensation .
But now it seems there might be some trouble in the magic kingdom .
And if the latest rumors buzzing around the French blogosphere about them both having extramarital affairs are true , this glitzy political saga could be coming to an end .
( Repercussions of the Sarkozy / Bruni affair rumors . )
Suchablog.com has published posts saying that Carla Bruni fell in love with the French singer Benjamin Biolay , who just won the award for best male singer and best album of the year at the prestigious “ Victoires de la musique . ”
Bruni and Biolay have reportedly been friends for many years .
And according to suchablog.com , Bruni and Biolay already live together .
The same blog , which brands itself as a web magazine , also says that president Sarkozy has found “ comfort in the arms ” of right - wing politician Chantal Jouanno — a 40 - year - old cabinet member in charge of the environment as well as a karate champion .
But the French establishment media is legendarily indifferent when it comes to covering the private affairs of their elected leaders .
So there has been no questioning of the president about all this .
The way the possible scandal has slowly emerged in France stands in stark contrast to how it would be covered in the tabloid culture of the American media , according to observers here .
This hyperactive , American - friendly president and this French - Italian former model and singer have always been flamboyant and always prompted all kinds of speculations and rumors , including that Sarkozy was begging his former wife Cecilia to get back together , to rumors of a Sarkozy - Bruni baby .
But now the rumor mill is working overtime in France , and a lot of it is ending up online .
Other websites to chronicle the rumor include the well - known blog Le Post , Yahoo News France and Agoravoxtv .
UPDATE : While a blog of the Sunday newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche had chronicled the rumors about the Sarkozy and Bruni affairs , the post has now been removed " by the editors " because the material was " seriously detrimental to privacy . "
See below for more on French privacy law .
For now mainstream media have n’t published the rumors , which bloggers said are more likely to become public after the March 21 regional elections in France .
On television , only the news channel i-tele has suggested that Sarkozy and Jouanno , and Bruni and Biolay , are close .
An i-tele presenter said on the air that Bruni was the first to congratulate Biolay for his awards , and wondered whether Sarkozy had had the time to congratulate minister Jouanno on her recent karate win .
For its part , Sarkozy ’s public relations office had no comment on the rumors in response to a request from GlobalPost .
Most mainstream French media are likely to stay away from the rumor because the president ’s personal life is a touchy topic and they worry reporting on the rumors could put their jobs at risk .
Also , in France , privacy law keeps tabloids off the shelves and offers public figures a greater measure of , well , privacy , than in the U.S .
" Journalists often whisper a few gossips off the record , but they do not publish them , because they do n't want to jeopardize their relations with politicians , " said Dominique Moisi , a French political expert at the French Institute of International Relations .
" That said , sometimes it is a good thing , you do n't want every gossip to get published . "
According to word of mouth , Alain Genestar , the former editor - in - chief of the magazine Paris Match , was fired after he published an article and pictures that showed that Nicolas Sarkozy ’s ex-wife , Cecilia , was having an affair with the media guru Richard Attias .
At the time , the public was shocked , according to Nicolas Thierry , president of the journalists ’ union CFDT Journalistes .
“ Alain Genestar received a lot of sympathy from the public after this event , ” Thierry said .
“ The public felt that it was only fair that Sarkozy ’s personal life would be exposed , after he used the image of his wife a lot during his presidential campaign . ”
But according to Thierry , the French public “ does n’t always support the media when they disclose personal information about famous people . ”
“ The French sometimes feel that paparazzi should n’t go too far , ” Thierry said .
“ They think that sometimes journalists should leave personalities alone . ”
It is widely accepted in France that public figures should n't be judged on their sentimental lives but on their work , especially when it comes to politicians .
Former presidents Francois Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac reportedly had affairs , but this did n't ruin their political images , although Mitterrand 's " hidden daughter " Mazarine did make the headlines when the story came out .
As for the current rumor , reactions from the streets of Paris seemed to show more disappointment with Sarkozy ’s policies than keen interest in his love life .
“ I could n’t care less , ” said Gauvin Leconte , a young professor .
“ What I care about is my everyday life and the president ’s decisions .
I am not happy at all with what Sarkozy does .
He made things harder for us teachers . ”
A man named Jean - Francois , who did n’t want his last name used , was chatting with a pal on a bench in front of Paris ’ Saint Sulpice church and had a similar reaction .
“ I am not interested in Sarkozy and in his huge ego , ” said Jean - Francois .
“ At the end of the day if he did go with another chick , it would just be an expression of what he is inside ... a jerk . ”
Raoni Moisan , a student in Paris , was a bit less harsh .
“ Frankly , I think that Sarkozy has other things to do , ” Moisan said .
“ He ’s probably focused on trying to keep his job and pursue his programs . ”
As for Bruni ’s alleged new choice of lover , Moisan suggested that it would definitely represent a step - down for the French - Italian diva .
“ After Mick Jagger , Biolay is definitely a much smaller fish , ” he said .
History — and sales — will decide on the artistic merits of singer Biolay , while the coming regional elections will surely give the French a chance to express themselves on what they apparently really care about the most : the president ’s policy and its impact on the economy .

They Tried to Make Mohammed al - Awfi Go to Rehab
On Nov. 9 , 2007 , after years of incarceration at the detention camp in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , Mohammed al - Awfi and more than a dozen other suspected militants boarded a plane bound for their home country , Saudi Arabia .
Awfi had been caught shortly after the 9/11 attacks by Pakistani authorities with more than $ 10,000 in cash on the Afghanistan - Pakistan border , according to the U.S. Defense Department .
He was suspected of supporting terrorist activity .
When the men finally arrived home in Riyadh , the Saudi capital , they were likely greeted by members of the Saudi royal family , as is customary for ex-Gitmo detainees .
" Welcome back to the fold " is the implicit message .
But after reuniting with their own families , they were transferred to local prisons .
Because there was no evidence Awfi had engaged in violence , the Saudis did not consider him a security risk at home .
They transferred him to the Care Center , a rehabilitation program for Islamist extremists in a desert resort town just outside Riyadh .
" Awfi had so much hate for the Americans , " says psychologist Turki al - Otayan , who was one of the first to evaluate the former Guantánamo detainee .
" ’ They destroyed me , ’ he would say .
‘ They tortured me .
They killed my friends . ’ "
The Care Center was established by the Saudi Ministry of Interior in early 2007 as a way to re-educate extremists in nonviolent Islamic principles and reconnect them with their social networks ; the aim was to deter them and their relatives from joining militant groups in the future .
The center is run by an advisory committee of academics who earned advanced degrees in the West and Islamic scholars who studied in Saudi Arabia .
The center has been touted in the West as a model program that could inspire other nations grappling with a rise in militant extremism .
A recent Foreign Affairs article , for instance , touted the program as " a pioneer in rehabilitation efforts , " explaining that it has inspired " governments elsewhere in the Middle East and throughout Europe and Southeast Asia [ to launch ] similar programs for neo -Nazis , far - right militants , narcoterrorists , and Islamist terrorists . "
But some analysts wonder if it ’s the kind of program that could only work in Saudi Arabia .
One thing is clear :
The Care Center ’s advisory committee is charged with deprogramming not only Saudi detainees released from Guantánamo , but also Saudi extremists suspected by Riyadh of planning attacks in places like Iraq .
( Those arrested for planning and executing attacks inside the kingdom are detained separately and indefinitely , without trial , according to Human Rights Watch . )
So far , Saudi officials say , nearly 300 men have completed the Care Center program — more than 100 of them from Guantánamo .
Nearly 80 percent of these have gone on to lead normal lives .
But among the remaining 20 percent are men who , upon their release from the program , later formed a group called al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) , which is inspiring and launching attacks in the United States ; the group recently claimed responsibility for training the Christmas Day " underpants bomber . "
It ’s that 20 percent that worries U.S. officials .
Back in late 2007 , Awfi and his fellow Guantánamo detainees spent several months in the Care Center , taking courses in Islamic law , history , anger management , and art therapy .
No longer detainees , they were renamed , in the official parlance of the program , " beneficiaries . "
They played ping - pong , ate lavish meals of lamb and rice , shared a locker room , and prayed together five times a day .
Psychologist Otayan helped Awfi reintegrate with his family .
" He would come to me and say , ‘ My son , Sami , does n’t like me when I come to visit .
What can I do ? , ’ " Otayan says .
" On another occasion , he told me one of his brothers had been killed in Afghanistan .
He said he wanted to marry his brother ’s wife , to protect his brother ’s children .
I told him it would hurt his own wife ’s feelings if he took a second wife .
I told him to relax and be calm .
He followed my advice . "
By early 2008 , Awfi had done his time at the center and was released .
Then , during the holy fasting month of Ramadan , he had a revelation of sorts , according to a jihadi publication and his own subsequent confession :
He decided he wanted to " glorify Islam " with violence and " join " his brother , whom he said was martyred in Afghanistan .
So , along with a handful of other Saudis , he fled to Yemen .
Awfi eventually surfaced in a video in January 2009 , dressed in a Che Guevara - style beret and fatigues .
He appeared with three other men — one Saudi and two Yemenis — to announce the formation of AQAP , the group that since has claimed responsibility for killing tourists in Yemen , for attempting to assassinate a Saudi official — and for that Christmas Day attack .
" We warn our fellow prisoners ( from Guantánamo ) about this Care program , " Awfi says to the camera .
" We were used . …
They tried to lead us away from Islam .
But thank God , we were able to escape their power . "
It ’s often said that hard - core al Qaeda members are more difficult to rehabilitate than younger , less entrenched militants .
That ’s generally true , says Christopher Boucek , an associate in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , but it does n’t tell the whole story .
" If you look at how somebody got into this , it ’ll tell you a lot about how he will get out of it , " says Boucek , who has researched and written widely about the Saudi rehabilitation program .
" The guys motivated by religion benefit from religious discussions .
The guys who got here through criminality , you ’d better address their social needs .
The guys who got here through bad social networks — separate them from these social networks . "
A typical day at the center , then , touches on all of these aspects .
There are robust debates about the meaning of jihad , intense sessions on how to negotiate , and therapeutic exercises like role - playing .
But special attention is given to each beneficiary ’s particular needs , Otayan says .
Guys like Awfi were " tough , " he says .
" They want to be famous .
They think they know everything about Islam .
But they do n’t know anything . "
So in addition to the classroom , members of the advisory committee take great pains to ingratiate themselves with the beneficiary ’s family .
" All the Saudis [ on the committee ] will tell you that if you want to make any progress , you need the family on your side , " Boucek says .
" A lot of these guys who get recruited and then radicalized , one of the first things that happens is they get separated from their families . "
So officials work hard to reposition a militant inside his tribe , probably the single most important element of Saudi life .
When a beneficiary is released , authorities will go so far as offering him a dowry of up to $ 20,000 to encourage him to marry .
In return , his relatives must sign a pledge that they are responsible for his actions .
After Awfi appeared in the now - infamous AQAP video , Otayan and other members of the advisory committee decided to pay his family a visit .
"
The family thought the security forces would come to the house , search the house , and arrest them — like they would in any other Arab country , " Otayan says .
" But then we told them , ‘ Mohammed is our son .
He has made a mistake .
We do n’t hate him personally ; we hate his behavior . ’
The family was shocked .
We said , ‘ For his protection , and for your own protection … try to help us . ’
This is how the contact — the telephone calls — started .
When Mohammed called his wife , she would pass information to the security forces . "
What happened next is unclear .
Either Awfi’s relatives convinced him to turn himself in to Saudi authorities , or he was sold to Yemeni authorities by the Yemeni tribes who ’d been hiding him .
( A third , less likely , theory has Awfi pretending to surrender but continuing to work as a secret agent of AQAP , to test how far a repentant militant could get .
Months later , another AQAP operative surrendered .
This man then attempted to assassinate Saudi counterterrorism chief Mohammad bin Naif with explosives reportedly hidden in his rectum .
The bomb was faulty , though .
The prince survived , but the attacker did not . )
Whichever scenario is true , Gregory Johnsen , a former Fulbright fellow in Yemen and a Ph.D. candidate in Near Eastern studies at Princeton University , says the conversation with Awfi ’s family probably was n’t as benevolent as Otayan makes it sound .
" It seems that they put a lot of pressure on the women , " Johnsen says .
Pressure that he says might have sounded something like this : " It ’s a real shame that there are no men to protect the women in your family .
Bad things can happen to women if they do n’t have male guardians around to protect them . "
Either way , after Awfi was brought into custody , Said Ali al - Shihri , the other Saudi in the AQAP video , moved his entire family from comfortable Saudi Arabia to rugged Yemen .
Johnsen says this not only shows how much freedom of movement AQAP has in Yemen , but also that Shihri did n’t want his family to be " subjected to the same kind of pressure " that Awfi ’s was .
Boucek agrees that the pressure on families can be great , but he says it ’s more about friendly co-optation than draconian control .
" In a society where you get everything from the government , it can be very powerful when the government comes and asks you to do something , " he says .
" I think [ families ] understand the message being sent :
You have a duty and responsibility , and we ’ll take care of you .
We ’re doing our part ; you need to do your part . "
In the end , this is what worked for Mohammed al - Awfi .
These days he ’s back in Saudi Arabia , living with his family under a kind of house arrest in a tony Riyadh apartment .
He reportedly provides intelligence on his colleagues in AQAP .
In a recent interview with the BBC , he claims he was coerced into joining the group and making the video .
He also has publicly denounced terrorism on Saudi state TV .
At the end of the statement , he thanks his mentors at the Care Center — a place many agree that for all its flaws is a Saudi solution to a Saudi problem , though perhaps not necessarily a model that would work anywhere else .
Membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , which includes 30 of the world ’s most developed countries , does not provide money or any special economic benefits .
Yet it is easy to see why the Israeli government attributes great importance to Israel becoming one of its members .
For Israel , membership in the OECD would mean a victory of legitimacy , and a major setback for the worldwide movement calling on Israel to be held accountable for its crimes against the Palestinian people .
Only democratic countries are allowed to join the OECD .
With 35 percent of the population under Israel ’s control and sovereignty disenfranchised , denied their basic human and civil rights and repeatedly attacked by the Israeli army , Israel is finding it increasingly difficult to portray itself as a democracy .
What appears less obvious is why the member countries would want to include Israel in the OECD .
Israel ’s membership would be a confirmation of Israeli policies , thus eroding the organization ’s prestige while undermining the efforts of these very same countries to achieve peace in the Middle East .
The OECD would be inviting the world to see how it prefers to ignore the crimes committed by Israel , and reward it instead .
This would do no less than feed into the argument of extremists who claim that only violence can safeguard the rights of occupied Palestinians .
Ironically , however , the OECD seems to be working harder than Israel to facilitate the latter ’s acceptance , which is expected to occur in May .
Israel has refused to comply with the OECD demand to provide statistical data which applies only to the internationally - recognized parts of Israel , excluding the illegal settlements in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights and the Occupied Palestinian Territories ( OPT ) .
Yet despite Israel ’s refusal , the OECD ’s Committee on Statistics is acting to find ways to accept Israel anyway .
According to a leaked report , “ Ascension of Israel to the Organization : Draft Formal Opinions of the Committee on Statistics ” ( download the PDF ) , the committee proposes to accept Israel based on the statistics currently available , which includes Israeli citizens in the OPT .
However , it requests that Israel provide more detailed statistical data which will allow the OECD to conduct its own calculation in order to separate the OPT data from that of Israel .
However , Israel will only commit to provide this data after it becomes a member of the organization .
Yet as soon as Israel becomes a member , it will have the right to veto this decision , rendering the commitment an empty statement .
It should be noted that in this way the OECD is adopting the Israeli approach — an approach that eliminates the Palestinians and Israel ’s effective sovereignty over the OPT , and focuses solely on Israeli citizens .
This approach is tantamount to recognizing Israel ’s illegal occupation , which stands in direct contradiction to international law and the foreign policies of virtually all OECD countries .
It should also be noted that the OECD takes decisions by consensus .
It only takes one OECD country to oppose the integration of Israel into the organization in order to block the process .
So far , not a single OECD country has voiced its intention to vote against including Israel in the organization .
The reason for that is twofold .
First , there is the usual fear that any country ( especially a European country ) , that voices its objection to Israel ’s joining the OECD will be accused of anti-Semitism .
Israel enjoys the unflinching support of the United States , and few European politicians have the courage to take a moral stand against either Washington or Israel .
Second , right - wing parties around the world see Israel as the Mecca of anti-immigration policies , Islamophobia and the “ war on terror . ”
With every new line that Israel crosses in abusing the human and national rights of Palestinians , right - wing parties are emboldened to deepen their own politics of hatred toward immigrants .
If Israel conducts extra-judicial assassinations , why wo n’t other countries be allowed to do the same ?
If Israel installs surveillance mechanisms that invade the privacy of its citizens , what would stop other countries from doing so also ?
Legitimizing Israel by inviting and facilitating its ascension to the OECD is thus a tool to legitimize the extreme measures promoted by far - right parties in Europe , which are eager to do away with democratic mechanisms and human rights of minorities in the name of nationalism and “ security . ”
European law clearly forbids European countries from recognizing the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories , as has been affirmed by the Russell Tribunal .
Yet by granting Israel membership in the OECD , they will be doing exactly that .
OECD members will knowingly accept Israel to the organization based on deceptive statistics provided by the latter , statistics which conceal the occupation while simultaneously treating it as a permanent fact .
Israel ’s acceptance into the OECD would be a grave mistake .
It will reward violations of international law , feed the extreme right wing which is growing in developed countries and render all OECD countries as accomplices in Israel ’s illegal occupation .
Shir Hever is an economist at the Alternative Information Center .
General McChrystal promptly apologized for the Oruzgan episode , both directly to Afghanistan ’s president , Hamid Karzai , and in a videotaped statement released to local television stations .
On Feb. 12 in a village near Gardez , in Paktia Province , Afghan police special forces paired with American Special Operations forces raided a house late at night looking for two Taliban suspects , and instead killed a local police chief and a district prosecutor when they came out , armed with Kalashnikov rifles , to investigate .
Three women who came to their aid , according to interviews with family members and friends , were also killed ; one was a pregnant mother of 10 , the other a pregnant mother of 6 .
A press release from the International Security Assistance Force , as NATO ’s force here is known , said at first that the three women had been discovered bound and gagged , apparently killed execution style .
NATO officials now say their bodies were wrapped in traditional manner before burial .
Admiral Smith said Afghan forces fired the shots in the compound .
“ The regret is that two innocent males died , ” Admiral Smith said .
“ The women , I ’m not sure anyone will ever know how they died . ”
He added , however , “ I do n’t know that there are any forensics that show bullet penetrations of the women or blood from the women . ”
He said they showed signs of puncture and slashing wounds from a knife , and appeared to have died several hours before the arrival of the assault force .
In respect for Afghan customs , autopsies are not carried out on civilian victims , he said .
Interviews with relatives and family friends give a starkly different account and described an American cover -up .
They say a large number of people had gathered for a party in honor of the birth of a grandson of the owner of the house , Hajji Sharaf Udin .
After most had gone to sleep , the police commander , Mr. Udin ’s son , Mohammed Daoud , went out to investigate the arrival of armed men and was shot fatally .
When a second son , Mohammed Zahir , went out to talk to the Americans because he spoke some English , he too was shot and killed .
The three women — Mr. Udin ’s 19 - year - old granddaughter , Gulalai ; his 37 - year - old daughter , Saleha , the mother of 10 children ; and his daughter - in - law , Shirin , the mother of six — were all gunned down when they tried to help the victims , these witnesses claimed .
All the survivors interviewed insisted that Americans , who they said were not in uniform , conducted the raid and the killings , and entered the compound before Afghan forces .
Among the witnesses was Sayid Mohammed Mal , vice chancellor of Gardez University , whose son ’s fiancée , Gulalai , was killed .
“ They were killed by the Americans , ” he said .
“ If the government does n’t listen to us , I have 50 family members , I ’ll bring them all to Gardez roundabout and we ’ll pour petrol on ourselves and burn ourselves to death . ”
If you ’re not aware , Glenn Beck ’s show airs in the United Kingdom .
Accordingly , we have been targeting his sponsors in the United States as well as in the U.K. ( with the assistance from the StopBeck – UK Effort ) .
During the last week and a half , Glenn Beck lost his 100th , 101st and 102nd sponsors .
A full list of all 102 sponsors that dropped Mr. Beck ( or Fox News as a whole ) can be found here .
Please note that this total includes sponsors that have dropped him both United States and / or in the United Kingdom .
It seems like our efforts are having an effect …
Glenn Beck ’s show in the United Kingdom has not run any commercials during the past three days ( Tues - Thurs ) .
Glenn Beck ’s show in the UK used to run commercials .
The shows that come on before and after Glenn Beck still run commercials .
But , for the past three days , Mr. Beck has n’t had any sponsors in the U.K .
During the commercial break , instead of running ads , they cut away to Sky News updates or the weather .
Perhaps they ’re having trouble finding sponsors willing to subsidize Glenn Beck ’s misinformation , vitriol , sexism and race - baiting ?
Kudos to all of those that had a part in convincing all of Glenn Beck 's former sponsors in the United Kingdom that his kind of racist , red- baiting , Republican propaganda is not welcome in a sane society .
I know that similar efforts have been somewhat successful here in the United States .
Beck 's advertisers are down to made - for - TV products and G. Gordon Liddy hawking overpriced gold .
But that means we should just keep on pushing .
Make it incredibly unprofitable for Fox News to keep the Beckman on the air .
And at the end of the day , it may not make all that much of a difference .
Glenn Beck 's show still runs in the United Kingdom ... without any commercial sponsorship .
It might just be that important for the powers that be to export Beck 's brand of hatred to an audience , regardless of the cost .
But we 'll make it that much harder !
The Teabonic dialect has little regional variation but is more common among White Southerners .
It 's usage is influenced by educational background .
The main characteristic is grammatical structures and spelling of vocabulary on political signs .
The deletion or improper use of ( ' ) and second grade level English misspellings are frequent .
Linguists maintain that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with Teabonics , since like all dialects Teabonics shows consistent internal logic and is used earnestly to express thoughts and ideas .
However non-specific attitudes of Teabonics can be negative as a sign of laziness or ignorance .
Specific examples of Teabonics are : Gien Beck , crisis of competnce , you cant fix stupid , politians are like dipers , wernot going to take it , no more failouts , Hitler wrote good speaches too , I did 'nt serve , taxed enough allready , no pubic option , term limits for Congess , keeping us infromed , half breed Muslin , no goverment run healthcare , just extremey over taxed , no amesty , youth in Asia will kill your grandma , calculis is easy , a lyin ' African , read the consitution , a new era of medioracy , let Mitt fix Washinton , who 's side you on , get a brain morans , you'r a fake , do n't give away my daugters , descent the highest form of patriotic ( and ) make English America 's offical language .
Havana is famous for its 1950s retro cars , all tail - fins and whitewall tyres .
But the BBC's Michael Voss finds out that Cuba 's motorcycle aficionados are keen not to be upstaged .
Each year Cuba 's Harley Davidson Club joins forces with the Classic British Motorcycle Club to celebrate their shared fascination with all things two - wheeled .
Our correspondent says the convention seemed at times like a scene from the cult film Easy Rider .
For the past few years their annual ride around Havana has had a new stop - the grave of Pepe Milesimo , the founding father of Cuba 's bike restoration movement who died in a bike accident .
After the solemnity comes the main event - parking up to engage in the serious business of bike - talk .
Despite their Hells '
Angels get - up , the bikers are mostly well - behaved middle - aged men who say they have no problem with the authorities .

What are these ?
If everyone else jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge , would you do it too ?
And if everyone else raped children , would you defend it ?
The child rape scandal in the Catholic Church ( like Stephen Fry , I am no longer willing to call it pedophilia or molestation or child abuse ) has been heating up lately , with new stories about the widespread rape of children by priests in Germany , an admission from the senior cleric in Ireland that he was present at meetings where two abused teenagers were made to sign vows of silence , questions about Pope Benedict 's handling of an abuse case when he was an archbishop , and more .
So via Pharyngula , we have the story of one Andrew Brown of the Guardian , who has written a defense of the Catholic Church child rape scandal and an excoriation of those who are condemning it ... on the grounds that everyone else does it , too .
No , really .
From this it emerges that the frequency of child abuse among Catholic priests is not remarkable ...
and :
This is vile , but whether it is more vile than the record of any other profession is not obvious .
and :
There are , however , some fragments of figures from the outside world suggesting that not many professions do better .
Etc .
Shudder .
Where to begin ?
First of all , as many commenters in the Pharyngula thread have pointed out : Brown 's analysis of the child rape statistics are appallingly ignorant , both of statistics in general and of these statistics in particular .
There is every reason to think that child rape among Catholic priests occurred -- and for all we know , is still occurring -- at a much higher rate than in any other field where adults have access to children and authority over them .
But as far as I 'm concerned , that question is only tangentially relevant .
And for Brown to focus on it so fixatedly shows that he is completely missing the point .
What makes the Catholic Church child rape scandal so morally repugnant , and what is making it have the effect of turning people away from the Catholic Church , is not the rapes themselves .
Of course the rapes themselves are morally repugnant .
And of course we need to be looking at whether there is some institutional force that makes Catholic priests more likely to rape children than other people in positions of trust and authority : such as the celibacy requirement for the priesthood , or the Church 's fear and loathing of sexuality as a central part of their theology , or the special power that priests have because they purport to have a special line to God , or religion 's veneration and armor against criticism which makes people less comfortable making accusations against it .
( Indeed , it 's fair to look at whether it 's even true that Catholic priests rape children at a higher rate than other trusted authority figures . )
But it is certainly the case that child rape does occur in other fields where adults are in positions of trust and authority with children : teachers , coaches , etc .
Brown 's not wrong about that .
That is not where the depth of the scandal lies .
What makes the Catholic child rape scandal so morally repugnant , and what is giving it the effect of turning people away from the Catholic Church in horror , is the way the Church handled it .
The Church knew about widespread reports of priests repeatedly molesting children ... and instead of acting to protect the children , they acted to protect the priests , and themselves .
Thus deliberately and knowingly putting more children in the way of known child rapists , solely for their pure self - interest .
Repeatedly .
Time and time again .
In every part of the world .
As a cold - blooded matter of Church policy .
That is the scandal .
The fact that some adults in positions of trust and authority over children violated that trust by raping them ?
That is a tragedy .
The fact that the Catholic Church knew about it -- and instead of reporting the child rapists to the police , they deliberately shielded them from detection and criminal investigation ?
The fact that the Church moved child rapists from parish to parish , thus exposing even more children to them ?
The fact that they lied to law enforcement , concealed evidence , even paid off witnesses ... purely to protect their organization from looking bad ?
That , Mr. Brown , is the scandal .
You fucking moral imbecile .
We do n't know what makes people into child rapists .
It is a serious mental illness as well as a profound moral failing .
But the Church hierarchy who shuffled around known child rapists from diocese to diocese -- not out of uncontrollable impulse , but consciously , thoughtfully , with a cool evaluation of the pros and cons , in a calculated attempt to prevent a PR disaster and protect their own self - interest ?
We know what makes people do that .
What makes people do that is utterly craven moral bankruptcy .
They do n't even have the excuse of mental illness .
And for Andrew Brown to defend this moral bankruptcy ?
For him to use the " Everyone else does it , too " defense -- a defense that does n't even stand up at third grade recess , and that absolutely has no validity in a serious adult discussion of morality ?
For him to insist that the Church is being picked on , unfairly singled out among all the teachers and coaches and babysitters and so on who have raped children ?
That suggests a moral tone - deafness that makes me physically ill .
Brown is essentially doing exactly what the Church has consistently done in the face of this scandal .
He is placing a higher value on the well - being of the Catholic Church than he is on the people , the children , who trust in it .
Shame on him .

With the increasing shift from analog to digital , some elections officials are unsurprisingly chomping at the bit to move toward Internet - based voting .
Last year , Elections Canada officials mused about the possibility of online voting trials , noting the potential benefits of increasing voter participation , particularly among younger demographics .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners Hurrah !
Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
More recently , the province of Alberta opened the door to incorporating new technologies into their voting processes as part of an electoral reform package .
New trials would require the approval of a legislative committee , but the province 's chief electoral officer acknowledged that online voting may be coming , noting " online voting is something that 's on the forefront of people 's minds ... people say , ' I can do my banking online , but I can't do my voting online . ' "
The enthusiasm for Internet voting is understandable .
At first blush , there is a certain allure associated with the convenience of Internet voting , given the prospect of increased turnout , reduced costs , and quicker reporting of results .
Moreover , since other security - sensitive activities such as banking and health care have gravitated online , supporters argue that elections can't be far behind .
Yet before rushing into Internet voting trials , the dangers should not be overlooked .
Hackers and viruses
Democracy depends upon a fair , accurate , and transparent electoral process with outcomes that can be independently verified .
Conventional voting accomplishes many of these goals -- private polling stations enable citizens to cast their votes anonymously , election day scrutineers offer independent oversight , and paper - based ballots provide a verifiable outcome that can be re-counted if necessary .
While technology may someday allow us to replicate these essential features online , many of them are currently absent from Internet voting , which is subject to any number of possible disruptions .
These include denial of service attacks that shut down the election process , counterfeit websites , phishing attacks , hacks into the election system , or the insertion of computer viruses that tamper with election results .
These concerns are based on real - world experience .
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) , the organization that administers the domain name system , ran an online board of director election in 2000 .
The experience was fraught with technical difficulties , leading a reviewer to conclude " the technical weakness in the registration system made it virtually impossible to assess the integrity of the voters ' list , the security of the PINs , and secrecy of vote . "
More recently , the Netherlands used Internet voting as part of its 2006 parliamentary elections .
The online option was an alternative for Dutch citizens working or living abroad .
Nearly 20,000 valid Internet votes were received at a cost of approximately 90 euros per Internet voter .
Two years later , the country implemented a ban on Internet voting .
Caution here in Canada
The Canadian experience is limited primarily to municipal elections .
Several Ontario municipalities have offered Internet - based voting , enabling local residents to vote without leaving their homes .
Residents were required to pre-register for Internet voting and were provided with detailed instructions on the technical requirements to " vote anywhere . "
Caution on Internet voting appears prudent , since experts have identified a long and costly list of necessary precautions , including random spot checks and post - vote verification programs to preserve anonymity .
Given the security risks , opening the door to provincial or federal Internet voting seems premature .
In the zeal to increase voter turnout , the reliance on Internet voting could inadvertently place the validity of the election process at risk .
Health authorities in Australia say they are concerned about the growing number of women who have undergone some form of genital mutilation .
Female circumcision is illegal in Australia , but experts say there is evidence that it is being practised here .
More and more migrant women are also seeking help after having the procedure in their home countries .
Across Africa , the Middle East and parts of Asia , female genital mutilation is practised on about three million girls and women each year .
The centuries - old custom has been outlawed in Australia since the 1990s .
But that has not stopped it happening here , according to Dr Ted Weaver from the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists .
" There is some evidence to suggest that it does happen in certain parts of Australia , " he said .
" It 's hard to gauge the actual numbers because it 's prohibited by legislation and it's something that is performed in an underground way .
" But certainly there have been reports of children being taken to hospital after having the procedure done with complications from that procedure . "
Melbourne 's Royal Women 's Hospital says it is seeing between 600 and 700 women each year who have experienced it in some form .
Somali - born Zeinab Mohamud , from the hospital 's Family and Reproductive Rights Education Program , says much of her work involves untangling some outdated cultural traditions and religious misconceptions .
" Some questions that we ask the women is ' why were you doing it ? ' and they will tell you , ' because of my religion ' , " she said .
" We bring imams or priests to convince them that there is nothing from both books that says you have to do circumcision to girls .
So why are you doing it ? "
Ms Mohamud is optimistic the practice will end , but she fears migrant communities or individual women will be demonised .
" Some people when they hear they say , ' how can that happen ? '
It 's when something is cultural and the people have been doing it for so long , it 's not easy to either eliminate it or to say , ' you have got a bad culture ' , " she said .
" You have to work with them , listen to them .
You have to know where they are coming from in order to help them . "
Dr Ted Weaver agrees and he says ordering people against the practice would be inappropriate .
" If we try and dictate and pontificate about this and not provide culturally appropriate care , we 'll further disenfranchise those women , " he said .
" Any progress will be incremental .
I do n't think that it 's something that will stop overnight .
" But I think all we can do is advocate against it , speak out , try to educate women , try to empower women , certainly in this country , and we should do our best for international organisations that are also espousing the same message . "
A federal agency appears to have collaborated in an effort to silence foreign workers who claimed they were lured here under false pretenses and abused by the company they worked for .
The role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement  reported in The Times by Julia Preston  is being investigated by the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department .
This is the latest twist in a sad tale of human trafficking and another reason why Congress , as part of its immigration reform efforts , must solve a problem that dates back to the Mexican bracero program : how to accept guest workers in this country while preventing their exploitation .
In 2006 , a company called Signal International hired 500 skilled metalworkers from India , under the H - 2B temporary guest worker program , to repair oil rigs after Hurricane Katrina .
The workers say they were promised green cards for themselves and their families .
Some paid recruiters as much as $ 20,000 to make the trip to Mississippi , often taking on crushing debt or selling their homes .
The workers quickly learned that they had no hope of green cards .
They could not work for anyone else and were told they would be fired and deported if they left their isolated labor camps .
They were trapped as surely as if they were shackled .
The International Monetary Fund wants more power to police the global financial system and a bigger role in emergency financing , managing director Dominique Strauss - Kahn said Friday .
In a speech to the Bretton Woods Committee , a finance reform think tank in Washington , D.C. , he claimed that a stronger IMF also warrants a new global reserve currency that would serve as an alternative to the U.S. dollar .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Strauss - Kahn said such an asset could be similar to but distinctly different from the IMF ’s special drawing rights , or SDRs , the accounting unit that countries use to hold funds within the IMF , ” ABC News reported .
“ It is based on a basket of major currencies . ”
“ One day , the Fund might even be called upon to provide a globally issued reserve asset , similar to — but in important respects different from — the SDR , ” he said .
Strauss - Kahn added that “ having several suppliers of reserve assets would limit the extent to which the international monetary system as a whole depends on the policies and conditions of a single , albeit dominant , country . ”
“ The challenge ahead is to find ways to limit the tension arising from the high demand for precautionary reserves on the one hand and the narrow supply of reserves on the other , ” he also said , according to ABC .
Both China and Moscow support such a plan , but U.S. leaders have vehemently insisted that empowering the IMF ’s special drawing rights , or establishing another fund with a global pull similar to the dollar , is not necessary .
ADVERTISEMENT
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has also offered its support to the idea , suggesting that an as - yet - unformed regulatory committee oversee the new currency , which would be traded almost exclusively by governments .
European leaders such as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy have also called for an expanded role for the IMF in the emerging global economy .
The IMF ’s special drawing rights were created in 1969 as a way of supplementing countries ’ currency reserves .
Their value is determined by a formula based on the values of the US dollar , the British pound , the Japanese yen and the Euro .
The IMF has been using SDRs to help shore up the finances of poorer nations amid recent economic uncertainty .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ There may be a need for a clearer mandate to pursue risks for global economic stability , but also — I stress — for financial stability , ” Strauss - Kahn said .
“ During the crisis , the Fund proved its worth to the world . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
But Strauss - Kahn said that as the world slowly emerges from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , “ we must build on this positive momentum : to transform the Fund into an institution even better equipped to meet the challenges of the post - crisis era . ”
The bulk of the IMF ’s efforts today are conducted on a country - specific basis , but this will not be sufficient to avoid or even dampen a major crisis in the future .
The 186 - nation IMF already provides economic assessments of individual member countries and publishes reports on the world economic outlook and the stability of the global financial system .
ADVERTISEMENT
But in the years preceding the crisis , the Fund did not foresee the risk from a US housing meltdown that led to a credit crisis and a financial firestorm that engulfed the globe .
“ We are floating the idea of a new multilateral surveillance procedure .
This would allow — indeed require — the Fund to assess the broader and systemic effects of country - level policies , and the associated risks , in a fundamentally different way , ” Strauss - Kahn said .
The role of guardian of systemic stability would be backed up by new financial firepower .
The IMF has tripled its lending capacity over the past year , to 850 billion dollars , thanks to loans from member countries .
The expanded financial resources “ should be sufficient to meet demand in the coming period , ” he said .
ADVERTISEMENT
Strauss - Kahn recalled that in the global crisis , key emerging market economies seeking financial lifelines had not turned to the Fund as the “ first responder , ” but instead approached the US Federal Reserve and other central banks for currency swaps .
“ In this context , we are currently exploring various options — including for short - term , multi-country credit lines that the Fund might extend in a systemic crisis , ” he said .
Strauss - Kahn proposed increasing the flexibility and accessibility of the new Flexible Credit Line that the IMF created last March .
Available to any member country whose economy is deemed well - managed by the Washington - based institution , the facility currently allows Mexico , Colombia and Poland to tap credit as needed .
ADVERTISEMENT
Strauss - Kahn also suggested the IMF could work with “ regional reserve pools ” which he said “ can be a positive and stabilizing force in international financing . ”
He cited the IMF ’s recent cooperation with European Union lending to help three EU members : Hungary , Latvia and Romania .

Motor Skill Learning in User Interfaces
In general , retention of a variety of motor skills is very high , even for no-practice intervals of up to two years , and relearning is rapid ( for reviews see [ 1 ] , Chap. 8 , and [ 9 ] ) .
On the other hand , verbal material is typically forgotten much more quickly [ 8 , 10 ] .
The few instances in which motor learning dissipates rapidly ( [ 1 ] , pp. 267-237 ; [ 9 ] ) are those in which the task has a large verbal or other non-motor component .
Motor Skill Learning in Discretized Pie Menus
Player uses D - Pad to position the cursor at the desired position .
Player holds the " menu " button which pops - up a pie menu .
The player presses left on the D - Pad to open the " Turret " menu , then presses right to select " Missile Turret . "
The building is placed .
Alternatively , the player can let go of the menu button at any time to cancel the action .

An important area of human - computer interaction research focuses on pointer - based graphical user interfaces .
The literature shows that designers must be sensitive to the subtleties resulting from the interface paradigm .
Specifically , video game designers must understand the level of difficulty and thus the overall efficiency of a user interface .
Can the player , in quick succession , efficiently perform many distinct actions using a traditional pointer - based GUI ?
Are there too many icons to place on one screen ?
What if the player uses a gamepad instead of a mouse ?
This article provides a short overview of Fitts ' Law and related material as a basis for discerning common pitfalls of pointer - based interfaces .
Discretized pie menus are introduced as an alternative to the pointer interface .
Following that is a discussion of its merits and demerits .
Although this article uses typical real time strategy games as an example , the ideas presented can be generalized to any traditional pointer - based game interface .
Fitts '
Law is a logarithmic function describing the index of difficulty ( ID ) in movement based motor tasks [ 4 , 5 ] .
The function is defined aswhereis the amplitude or distance of movement andis the width of the target where movement ends .
In Figure 1 , if a subject were to perform a one dimensional , horizontal movement from the start position ( marked ) , to any point within the rectangular region , thenis the distance to the rectangular region andis the width of the rectangular region .
Figure 1 : Fitts '
Law describes difficulty based on distance of movement , , and width of target , Many HCI researchers have used Fitts ' Law [ 7 ] with one of the first uses emerging from the work of Card , English , and Burr [ 2 ] .
With the aid of Fitts ' Law , Card .
evaluated the performance of four devices in text selection on a CRT screen .
Of the four devices ( mouse , rate - controlled isometric joystick , step keys , text keys ) they found the mouse to provide the best performance .
Cardused Welford 's formulation of Fitts ' Law [ 11 ] , which expressed the time required to make a hand movement .
Given an index of difficulty ( ID ) , it is possible to predict the movement time based on the following equation [ 7 ] whereandare constants depending on the type of device used ( e.g. , how long it takes to grasp the device ) .
Though Fitts '
Law deals with movements in one dimension , it has been shown by Mackenzie [ 7 ] that the law can be extended to two dimensions .
Mackenzie suggests that a more accurate strategy for determining ( target width ) in two dimensions is to use either a ) the " Smaller - Of " model whereis the smaller of the width or height or b ) the " W ' " model where the 1D nature of Fitts '
Law is maintained by measuringalong the approach ( to target ) vector .
Clearly , Fitts ' Law is applicable to two dimensional user interfaces .
Note that the major factors in determining the difficulty of movement based actions is the amplitude ( distance to target ) and the width ( size of target ) .
These spatial factors contribute to subtle deficiencies in typical pointer - based interfaces .
Real time strategy games commonly implement an interface where players use a pointer to select icons representing actions or units .
The result is an easy to learn interface requiring little explanation .
However , the downside of such an interface emerges when players are required to perform several actions in quick succession .
For example , if the player wishes to quickly build several turrets , he / she would repeatedly reposition the pointer from the game board to the menu icons and back .
From the experiments performed by Card [ 2 ] , mouse movements over short distances ( 1 - 16 cm ) required just over one second of positioning time !
Given that data , a player wishing to build in quick succession would require a considerable amount of time .
Designers solved this problem by providing shortcut keys to frequently used actions or units .
This alleviates the time cost associated with pointer based interfaces .
Given Fitts ' Law , A = 0 and so MT = a .
The time to perform the action is simply the time it takes for the player to press a key .
Yet in resolving the time issue , new problems arise .
Now a player must follow an unrelated input protocol requiring the memorization of shortcut keys .
Over time , veteran players run the risk of forgetting these keys .
Worse , this solution is not suitable to game platforms which do not include a keyboard ( consoles and portable gaming systems ) .
It also does not scale to games requiring many actions and / or units as it would either clutter the screen with icons or require additional pointer movements ( i.e. , submenus ) .
One way to alleviate these shortcomings is to teach an interface relying on motor skills .
In studying H. M. , a 40 - year - old patient showing a severe anterograde amnesia , Corkin [ 3 ] discovered that despite the patient 's inability to remember new information , he was able to acquire new motor skills through repeated practice .
His findings supported the theory that a motor skill memory system exists separate from other memory systems .
Corkin [ 3 ] also states :
The fallibility of human memory can be offset by taking advantage of the robustness in motor skill learning .
It can be argued that shortcut keys rely on motor skill learning .
Since touch - typing is a motor skill , why do shortcut keys not exhibit the robustness described by Corkin ?
The problem emerges when the act of typing is contrasted with the act of pressing a shortcut key in a typical RTS game .
With typing , users always place their fingers on the " home " keys thereby allowing them to perform each action in a consistent matter .
In other words , they learn to type each letter by repeatedly practicing the same motion .
With a typical RTS game , the player may approach the key from various angles and positions .
Unlike typing , there is no obvious " home " position that allows the player to repeatedly practice the same motion .
Thus the player cannot rely solely on his / her motor skill and is forced to use a less robust memory system .
Providing a " home " position for the user enhances the motor skill element of the interface learning .
The directional / movement keys are one of the most familiar " home " positions in gaming .
Typically ( assuming , without loss of generality , the player is right handed ) , the middle finger is on the up - arrow key with the index and ring finger on the left and right arrow keys respectively .
This position can be transposed to other areas of the keyboard ( e.g. , the WASD keys ) .
On a gamepad , the natural position is the thumb on the directional - pad ( D - Pad ) .
Taking advantage of these natural positions activates players ' robust motor skill learning mechanisms in the brain .
Many games , most notably " The Sims " , now employ a pie menu user interface .
It is easy for novice users , who simply follow the menu labels , and remains efficient for expert users , who remember the correct sequence of movements without reading the labels [ 6 ] .
In addition , novice users do not need to learn a separate input protocol in becoming an expert user .
The graphical display is also kept clean since the menu is drawn only when the player performs a menu action .
For games requiring a vast number of options , multi - level or hierarchical menus can be used , an example of which can be seen in the Half - life mod , " Natural Selection " .
Still , pie menus rely on pointer - based input devices and thus distance and target size become factors of MT .
Using directional keys to discretize the menu interface gains the benefit of minimizing MT ( do not need to take into account distance and target size ) while continuing to leverage the robust nature of motor skill learning .
In addition , the interface can be utilized on any gaming platforms .
As an example , suppose a player wishes to place a missile turret in a typical RTS game using a gamepad and discretized pie menus .
The player might take the following steps ( see also Figure 2 ) : Figure 2 : Example implementation of an RTS game using a gamepad .
Player positions the cursor .
Player opens the menu and selects " Turret Menu " by pressing left on the D - Pad .
Player selects " Missile Turret " by pressing right on the D - Pad .
The turret is placed . )
The player is able to perform the actions required in RTS games without the aid of a mouse .
In practice , there are various caveats to the proposed interface system .
Depending on the game , the number of key presses required to navigate a multilevel menu may increase MT to an unacceptable amount .
This problem can be circumvented by providing shortcut keys to sublevels within the menu .
Assigning the shortcut keys such that it suggests an obvious " home " position on the keyboard / gamepad enable the user to continue motor skill learning .
Obviously , forcing the user to learn too many shortcut keys will attenuate the effectiveness of the interface .
Anecdotal evidence also suggest discretized pie menus have a short but very steep learning curve .
This is possibly because the interface requires an input protocol that vastly differs from other traditional input protocols .
Therefore the difficulty may drop as more developers adopt this scheme .
Ultimately however , the difficulty depends on the difficulty of the game .
Since all actions required in a game can be placed in one hierarchical pie menu , it easy to overwhelm the novice player with too many options .
Despite these caveats , discretized pie menus keep the game interface clean while allowing players to learn using robust motor skill memory .
Once players overcome a short learning curve , they can perform actions quickly and efficiently .
Finally , discretized pie menus are scalable to different input devices including mouse , keyboard , and gamepad .

Some women avoid drinking calorie - filled cocktails , wine , and beer because they 're worried about packing on the pounds .
Now , a new study suggests that women who are moderate drinkers actually tend to gain less weight over time than teetotalers .
The risk of becoming overweight or obese falls as alcohol consumption rises , even when factors such as smoking , fruit and vegetable consumption , and physical activity are taken into account , the study found .
Women who consumed between 1.5 and 3 drinks daily had a 27 percent and 61 percent lower risk of becoming overweight or obese , respectively , than women who did n't drink at all , according to the study , which was published in the Archives of Internal Medicine .
However , the researchers did not look at how the participants ' drinking may have affected their lives besides weight gain .
Alcohol use can lead to health problems and " psychosocial problems , " they point out , and they caution that appropriate alcohol intake differs for each individual and depends on a range of factors .
In addition to potentially causing problems at work and with relationships , daily alcohol consumption has a number of health risks , including a small increase in the risk of breast cancer .
Experts recommend that women drink no more than one alcoholic beverage a day , and that men limit themselves to two .
And if you do n't drink , experts say , these findings should n't inspire you to start hitting the bottle .
" It wo n't change recommendations for my patients , I can say that for certain , " says Scott Kahan , M.D. , the co-director of the George Washington University Weight Management Program , in Washington , D.C. " If you do n't drink , there 's no reason to start . "
But , he adds , " I think [ the study ] suggests that there 's no need to quit or avoid alcohol if it 's something you enjoy . "

Eat this and burn more fat
In the study , researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and Brigham and Women 's Hospital , in Boston , Massachusetts , surveyed 19,220 healthy , normal - weight women about their diet and drinking habits .
Nearly 40 percent of the women did n't drink at all , and a very small number -- just 3 percent -- consumed more than about 2.5 drinks a day .
Over the 13 - year study period , 4 out of 10 women became overweight or obese .
The women who drank cut down on their calorie intake from food , especially carbohydrates , the study showed .
However , total calorie intake did inch up as alcohol consumption increased ; women who drank at least 2.5 drinks a day averaged about 1,800 calories a day , compared with 1,670 for teetotalers .
R. Curtis Ellison , M.D. , the director of the Institute on Lifestyle and Health at the Boston University School of Medicine , says this study is the strongest evidence to date that calories from food and booze are not created equal .
" Many other studies that are not nearly as well done or as large as this suggest that calories from alcohol are metabolized differently , " Ellison says .
" The alcohol calories probably do n't count as much as calories from a Hershey 's bar . "

Kahan says that the findings challenge the conventional wisdom about calories from alcohol .
" The way that the body handles those calories very possibly might be very different from carbohydrates , fats , and proteins , " he says .
" It makes you wonder if we 've been thinking about alcohol as a nutrient a little bit incorrectly . "
One drawback of the study , Kahan adds , is that the researchers did not examine how alcohol consumption might influence weight gain in women who are already overweight or obese .
Another limitation , according to Ellison , is that the study contains no information on the role a woman 's drinking patterns might have played -- whether , for instance , a glass of wine each day had a different effect than downing several drinks once or twice a week .
Although recovering alcoholics and people with uncontrolled epilepsy should n't drink , Ellison says , moderate alcohol consumption can have health benefits for people middle - aged and older , especially when it comes to heart health and stroke risk .
For most women , he adds , these benefits will outweigh the small increase in breast cancer risk associated with alcohol consumption .
" I am someone who 's a strong believer that substances in wine are helpful , " he says .

Mice trained to improve their working memory become more intelligent , suggesting that similar improvements in working memory might help human beings enhance their brain power , according to research published March 26 in Current Biology by researchers at Rutgers , The State University of New Jersey .
" Working memory refers to a short - term memory system used to complete a task , such as remembering a phone number , a grocery list , reading comprehension , or something else not intended to be stored in long - term memory , " says corresponding author Louis Matzel , professor of psychology in Rutgers ' School of Arts and Sciences .
Matzel 's co-authors are postdoctoral researcher Kenneth Light ; graduate students Christopher Wass and Stefan Kolata ( now a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institutes of Health ) ; undergraduate Ryan Zagalsky ( now a graduate student at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey ) ; and laboratory technician Alexander Denman - Brice .
Working with about 60 young adult , genetically heterogeneous mice , Matzel and his colleagues used mazes to put the mice through a series of exercises designed to challenge and improve their ability to retain and use current spatial information .
For example , they would allow a mouse to run through a particular maze ( for a food reward ) until he had the route down cold , and then teach him to run through a second maze .
The researchers would then start the mouse on his way through the first maze , stop him en route and stick him in the second maze .
This procedure is known to tax working memory , and was here found to promote an improvement in that skill .
" There is a lot of evidence from the literature on human intelligence that working memory and intelligence are correlated , " Matzel said .
" But that does n't mean that one causes the other .
So our question was , does improving an animal 's capacity for working memory make him smarter ?
And the answer , from our experiment , was yes . "
In fact , mice that underwent this working memory " exercise " exhibited improved proficiency on a wide range of cognitive tests .
The all - male group of mice was deliberately selected for their genetic diversity , which is different from the practice in most research projects involving laboratory mice .
Young adults at the time of the research , they are now nearing the end of their lives .
( Mice rarely live more than 30 months . )
The surviving mice seem to be hanging on to their cognitive abilities , and this suggests that the working - memory training they received in their youth may be at least partly responsible , Matzel said .
" They are getting cranky , though , " he added .
A shocking report from Brookings exposes just how massive America 's poverty problem is .
While substantial reductions in poverty were made during the 1990's , America 's poor have been rocked by the dual economic downturns since 2000 .
The result is that poverty grew at twice the rate of U.S. population growth from 2000 - 2008 , and now encompasses 39.1 million Americans .
If one were to expand the definition of poverty to merely ' poor ' ( yet still very poor ) , then a eye - popping 30 % of the nation lives no higher than twice the poverty base line .
Brookings :
In 2008 , 91.6 million people — more than 30 percent of the nation ’s population — fell below 200 percent of the federal poverty level .
More individuals lived in families with incomes between 100 and 200 percent of poverty line ( 52.5 million ) than below the poverty line ( 39.1 million ) in 2008 .
Between 2000 and 2008 , large suburbs saw the fastest growing low - income populations across community types and the greatest uptick in the share of the population living under 200 percent of poverty .
Here 's where it gets even more ridiculous --
If you break down the data to individual areas , then there 's at least ten U.S. cities with poverty rates of around 30 % .
Moreover , Brookings latest research highlights how poverty has been getting worse especially fast in the suburbs , thus the U.S. is faced with the challenges of suburban poverty like never before :
California and Florida have been hit especially hard :
Finally , this bad news has likely become far worse already .
This research does n't include 2009 since full data has n't come out yet .
When it does , expect a huge up - tick in poverty rates given since that 's when the real brunt of the recent crisis hit ' Main St . ' .
Unfortunately , our regression analyses suggest that these metro areas are not likely to see such decreases in 2009 , a year in which no metro area proved exempt from increased unemployment rates .
Although the Census will not officially release poverty rates for 2009 until fall of next year , job losses alone foretell a substantially larger increase in the metropolitan poverty rate than the 0.3 percent reported from 2007 to 2008 , when unemployment increases were just beginning to accelerate .

There is a silent monster that looms menacingly over U.S. government finances .
Every politician knows about it , but very few of them ever want to talk about it .
This silent monster grows larger every year , and yet nobody seems to know quite what to do about it .
Those who have closely analyzed this monster all seem to agree that one day it will create a financial tsunami of a magnitude that is absolutely unprecedented , but there is vast disagreement about how to escape this financial tsunami or if it is even possible to escape it .
The name of this monster is “ entitlements ” – Social Security , Medicare and other social Ponzi schemes that the U.S. government has locked itself into funding .
It would be hard to understate the seriousness of the problem that entitlements present .
In fact , according to an official U.S. government report , rapidly growing interest costs on the national debt together with spending on major entitlement programs will absorb approximately 92 cents of every dollar of federal revenue by the year 2019 .
By 2020 , that figure will be up around 100 cents of every dollar of federal revenue .
So that means that interest on the debt and spending on entitlement programs will eat up everything the U.S. government takes in before a penny is spent on anything else .
That is a recipe for national financial suicide .
And unfortunately , the problem is only going to get far , far worse when you project things out beyond the year 2020 .
Right now , interest on the debt and spending on entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare eat up only about 10 percent of GDP .
By 2080 , they are projected to eat up approximately 50 percent of GDP .
In fact , things are even more dire than the chart below indicates .
This chart is based on previous government figures that projected that mandatory spending will exceed government revenues at some point between 2030 and 2040 , but the latest government figures now project that this will happen right around 2020 .
So as mind blowing as this chart is , keep in mind that it actually understates the problem we are facing ….
This week , there was news that the Social Security system is in much worse shape than previously projected .
According to the Congressional Budget Office , this year the Social Security system will pay out more in benefits than it receives in payroll taxes .
This was not supposed to happen until at least 2016 .
Now it is happening in 2010 .
It turns out that the “ recession ” that we have just been through has hit Social Security revenues really hard .
And unfortunately , as waves of Baby Boomers start retiring , these “ Social Security deficits ” are going to get even worse .
So where will the money come from to pay the benefits that are owed ?
For now , the money will come from the $ 2.5 trillion Social Security Trust Fund that has been accumulated .
But keep in mind that the $ 2.5 trillion figure is extremely misleading .
There are not $ 2.5 trillion dollars sitting around in a bank account somewhere to pay these benefits .
The truth is that the Social Security Trust Fund does not contain any actual assets .
The only assets the Social Security Trust Fund has are IOUs from the U.S. government .
So basically the U.S. government owes the Social Security Trust Fund $ 2.5 trillion dollars , and now it turns out that the Social Security system is going to start needing that money .
So where will the U.S. government get that money ?
Well , they will borrow it of course .
The reality is that the Social Security program is simply not sustainable .
Back in 1950 each retiree ’s Social Security benefit was paid for by 16 workers .
Today , each retiree ’s Social Security benefit is paid for by approximately 3.3 workers .
By 2025 it is projected that there will be about two workers for each retiree .
As a society , we simply have not been producing enough new workers to sustain the current system .
Of course the politicians all say the right things to make us think that they are going to do something about this crisis .
For example , Barack Obama recently had the following to say about the massive deficits the U.S. government keeps piling up : “ It keeps me awake at night , looking at all that red ink ” .
But the truth is that neither political party would dare propose a dramatic restructuring of Social Security or Medicare that would significantly reduce benefits .
Why ?
Because it would be political suicide .
Say what you want about old people – the truth is that they vote more than the rest of us do .
Anyone who would dare “ take away ” their Social Security or Medicare would suddenly find hordes of old people voting against them in the next election .
But something has to be done .
The 2009 Financial Report of the U.S. Government was recently released , and it basically says that the U.S. government is facing financial Armageddon if something drastic is not done … .
Absent a change in policy , under this scenario , the interest costs on the growing debt together with spending on major entitlement programs could absorb 92 cents of every dollar of federal revenue in 2019 .
Keep in mind that this is before anything is spent on defense , health care , education , homeland security , job creation or anything else .
The following chart was pulled right out of the report .
These are n’t the projections of some Internet wacko .
These projections are in an official U.S. government report .
The implications of the chart below are absolutely mind blowing ….
Keep in mind that the U.S. government and the U.S. economy are already on the verge of financial oblivion in 2010 .
So what is going to happen if these projections are anywhere close to accurate ?
In addition , the report also admitted that the present value of projected scheduled benefits exceeds earmarked revenues for entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare by about $ 46 trillion over the next 75 years .
$ 46 trillion !
Either the U.S. government is going to have to radically slash Social Security and Medicare benefits or they will have to come up with tens of trillions of extra dollars from somewhere .
And remember , the $ 46 trillion figure is just the “ present value ” of those future payments .
Because of inflation , the “ actual value ” of those future payments will be far greater .
In a section about Social Security and Medicare , the authors of the report confessed that “ it is apparent that these programs are on a fiscally unsustainable path ” .
Obviously something has got to give .
These programs cannot keep on paying the same level of benefits .
It is financially impossible .
But what are we going to do ?
Millions upon millions of elderly Americans rely on these programs .
Are we going to reduce payments to a level where they can only afford dog food to eat and a shack to live in ?
As a society , we are really between a rock and hard place .
If we continue on the same path , the United States government is going to go bankrupt .
But any politician who tries to cut benefits or raise taxes will likely face the wrath of the voters at the ballot box .
So for now the U.S. government just continues to spend even more money and continues to go into increasing amounts of debt – apparently hoping that somehow everything will just turn out okay .
But things are not going to turn out okay .
We are headed for a financial mess of horrifying proportions .
The truth is that it does n’t matter how much the U.S. government cuts spending in other areas if it does not get entitlement spending and interest on the national debt under control .
If those expenditures are not addressed , it is absolutely guaranteed that the U.S. government will be swamped in red ink for many years to come .
But until severe financial pain starts happening , a large percentage of the American people are not going to be motivated to do anything about this problem .
But by then it will be too late .
Nukak are nomadic hunter - gatherers , they always have to move to find new territories .
As they stuck in a refugee camp , they hunted out all the animals around and now there is nothing left for them .
Nukak Maku : Stuck between Worlds
Meta dept. , Colombia – September 2009
The Nukak Maku people , a nomadic indian tribe from Amazonia , were violently driven out of the jungle by the Colombian guerilla and paramilitary squads .
Since the time of the first contact , more than a half of Nukak have died of the western diseases like flu .
Now , roughly cut off their original tribal lifestyle in refugee camps , they stuck between worlds .
They learn from the ( mainly Christian ) aid workers to use clothes , to listen to the radio , to beg for money despite the fact they do not understand these concepts .
Although their digestion suffer , they love to eat sweets , cookies and other western food .
They have hunted out all the animals around and now there is nothing left for them .
Nukak can not return to the jungle , their world has already passed through an irreversible change .

A total of 140 banks have failed year to date and FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair is adding staff , prepared for even more failures next year .
Please consider Seven U.S. Banks Are Seized , Raising Year ’s Failure Toll to 140
Seven U.S. banks were seized by regulators today , bringing this year ’s total of failed lenders to 140 as financial companies are tested by the recession and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. anticipates more shutdowns .
Banks with $ 14.4 billion in total assets were closed in six U.S. states , the FDIC said in statements on its Web site .
The agency is overseeing the dissolution of banks at the fastest pace in 17 years .
Earlier this week , the FDIC boosted its 2010 budget by 56 percent to $ 4 billion to manage further shutdowns .
The total budget will increase from $ 2.6 billion and the set - aside for bank failures doubles to $ 2.5 billion over this year , according to a proposal approved by the FDIC board .
The agency staff will increase to 8,653 next year from 7,010 this year .
The budget “ will ensure that we are prepared to handle an ever - larger number of bank failures next year , if that becomes necessary , ” FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said in a statement .
Today ’s bank closings will cost the agency about $ 1.8 billion , according to the FDIC statements .
U.S. lenders are buckling under the weight of loans tied to commercial real estate , which is plummeting in value .
Prices have dropped 43 percent from their peak in October 2007 , Moody ’s Investors Service said last month .
Assets at Banks whose ALLL exceeds their Nonperforming Loans
For each size category , the sum of all assets held by banks where this ratio is greater than one is divided by the sum all assets held by banks in the class .
In other words , banks whose allowances are negative are excluded from the chart .

Tim Bray is n’t as well - known as Sir Tim Berners - Lee , but the guy has had a leading role in defining the Internet .
His name tops the list of editors on the official specs for the Internet ’s XML language , the basic building block for all Web pages .
Bray can be entertainingly cranky , but it was off - putting today to read his blog post announcing his new job as an evangelist to software developers for Google ’s Android platform .
He wasted only a couple of paragraphs before getting to his point : Apple sucks .
“ The iPhone vision of the mobile Internet ’s future omits controversy , sex , and freedom , but includes strict limits on who can know what and who can say what .
It ’s a sterile Disney - fied walled garden surrounded by sharp - toothed lawyers .
The people who create the apps serve at the landlord ’s pleasure and fear his anger .
“ I hate it . ”
The problem with this post is obvious :
He praises the Web as “ the first - ever platform without a vendor , ” yet Bray has taken a job as spokesman for Google , a vendor .
The company sells the Nexus One phone that runs on the open - source Android platform he admires .
Google is also in an escalating business battle with Apple .
Google and Apple ’s CEOs went from best buddies in August 2006 to open enemies in August 2009 , demonstrating a key problem with the vendors Bray does n’t want to control the Internet .
Vendors pledge to do one thing , then go against their word when the winds of cash flow change direction .
And at this point in his career , Bray also knows that whenever techies disagree with someone , they look for the money strings to discredit the other side .
He probably thinks he ’s taken a lot of guff over the years as a steward of the complicated XML standard , but the Apple fanboy army will now simplify things for him :
He ’s a shill for Google .
In his first post as a Google employee , Bray brags that he gets to say whatever he wants on his blog .
Yet he also admits the post was pre-screened by Google PR .
They “ did n’t suggest any changes , ” he writes .
Of course they did n’t , Tim .
Apple is a sterile Disney - fied walled garden blah blah lawyers is exactly what they ’re paying for .

The original version of this article confused some of Tim Berners - Lee ’s accomplishments with Tim Bray ’s work .

A Santa Monica sushi restaurant facing federal charges for serving endangered whale meat appears set to close its doors Saturday , according to a statement posted to The Hump 's website Friday which called the decision a “ self - imposed punishment . "
“ The Hump hopes that by closing its doors , it will help bring awareness to the detrimental effect that illegal whaling has on the preservation of our ocean ecosystems and species , ” read the statement on the restaurant 's longstanding website .
Phone calls to the restaurant and its attorney were not answered late Friday .
Federal prosecutors last week charged the owner and chef of the restaurant at the Santa Monica Airport with the illegal sale of whale meat in violation of the Marine Mammal Protection Act , a misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a maximum fine of $ 200,000 .
While the restaurant immediately took responsibility once it was charged , the charges came only after an undercover sting operation that was orchestrated by animal activists and the associate producer of the Oscar - winning documentary “ The Cove . ”
The activists used a tiny video camera to record their payment of $ 600 for the omakase , or chef 's choice , which included eight pieces of whale .
The activists bagged samples of the meat and sent them to the Marine Mammal Institute , where they were determined to be Sei whale , an endangered species .
In the online posting , The Hump also vowed to make a “ substantial contribution ” to whale preservation or endangered species groups and apologized to the public for “ our illegal actions . ”

Multi -hop mesh networks , confined to university labs at the start of this decade , are now widely available from commercial vendors .
These vendors tout a number of advantages for mesh technologies : lower costs of deployment , easier administration , better coverage , and lower power consumption .
Mesh networking is now being used in an impressive range of applications , from large - scale institutional deployments to networks of tiny sensors .
Mesh networking is sometimes mentioned as a solution to the much - discussed " last mile " problem in US telecommunications policy .
Unfortunately , the inherent capacity limits of the wireless medium means that mesh networks are unlikely to provide a serious alternative to fiber or coax broadband connections in this market .
Mesh is a reasonable way to provide broadband to consumers in developing countries who might not otherwise be able to afford access at all .
But in the developed world , mesh technologies are best viewed as a supplement to wired Internet connections and traditional single - hop access points .
To help us understand the state of technology , Ars talked to two experts on mesh networking : Sanjit Biswas , the CEO of mesh wireless startup Meraki Networks , and Jinyang Li , a computer science professor at NYU .
Each did pioneering work on mesh networks at MIT earlier this decade , and both continue working on mesh networking technologies today .
Both identified the relative paucity of spectrum available for mesh networking applications as a major constraint on the technology 's continued growth .
Most mesh networks today operate on the same unlicensed bands used by WiFi and other consumer electronics devices .
The amount of unlicensed spectrum available has increased with the deregulation of the 5GHz band , but the vast majority of the spectrum is locked up for other uses .
The evolution of mesh
Computer scientists have been studying mesh networks for a quarter century .
In the 1980s , the military funded research into self - configuring multi-hop wireless networks suitable for use on the battlefield , but a lack of affordable hardware limited researchers ' ability to build working systems .
In the 1990s , researchers began building and testing mesh networks .
In one influential test in 1998 , a team at Carnegie Mellon mounted computers and networking gear into five cars and drove them around campus .
The car - mounted nodes were able to automatically adapt to changes in network topology , maintaining reliable connectivity among themselves and providing continuous connectivity between two fixed nodes at opposite ends of campus .
By the turn of the century , wireless networking gear had become cheap and powerful enough to allow more ambitious tests .
One of the most famous is Roofnet , an experimental mesh network built by MIT researchers earlier this decade , and Meraki , the commercial spin - off that counts Google among its investors .
Sanjit Biswas co-led the Roofnet team and co-founded its commercial spin- off Meraki .
In 2001 , Biswas was a grad student at MIT exploring ways to provide wireless broadband access to residents near the MIT campus in Cambridge .
An initial plan for a single large antenna was scrapped when it became clear that it would not provide sufficient range or throughput .
Biswas and his fellow grad student John Bicket switched to a multi- hop design , with multiple nodes cooperating to cover a large area .
When fully operational , Roofnet covered about 5 square miles of Cambridge , MA , between the MIT and Harvard campuses .
At its peak , it had almost 100 nodes , and Biswas estimates the network served thousands of MIT and Harvard students over its lifetime .
Each Roofnet node was an ordinary PC with a WiFi card and antenna .
Because the project relied on volunteers to deploy Roofnet nodes in their homes , the Roofnet team had no real control over the topology of the network .
" We had to understand what it takes to build a network that can survive a lot of failures , " Biswas said .
" People would move from their apartments , or trees would go up in the springtime , blocking the signal . "
The network 's routing protocols had to be robust enough to handle a network with constantly - changing topology and disappearing nodes .
The Roofnet team found that traditional routing protocols designed for wired networks did n't work well in the wireless setting .
For example , Biswas told Ars that before Roofnet started its research , " It was widely believed that wireless links either worked or they did n't . "
In reality , there is " a continuous range of packet - delivery rates , all the way from 0 to 100 percent . "
This means that nodes cannot assume that any reachable node is a reliable node .
Instead , mesh routing protocols need to constantly monitor link reliability and avoid routes with high rates of dropped packets .
Mesh routing protocols also have to worry about interference issues that do n't crop up in wired networks .
This can be a serious obstacle to high throughput for single - radio mesh nodes , because it prevents adjacent nodes in a route from broadcasting simultaneously .
The Roofnet team found that in mesh networks with a single radio per node , this means that a two - hop route has less than half the throughput of a single - hop route .
Some recent mesh products deal with this problem by having two or three radios in each node .
This allows adjacent nodes on a route to transmit on different frequencies , dramatically improving throughput .
Meraki
In 2006 , with several years of experience running a full - scale mesh network under their belts , Biswas and Bicket founded Meraki to commercialize their technology .
The firm attracted an early investment from Google , and closed a $ 20 million venture capital round in 2008 .
The most lucrative segment of Meraki's mesh networking business is sales to large institutions .
Leading hardware vendors such as Cisco have long sold gear designed to blanket a campus , apartment building , or office tower with WiFi coverage .
But Biswas argues that the sophisticated meshing technology in its routers makes them easier to configure and manage than products offered by established vendors .
Meraki 's access points self - configure and then phone home to Meraki servers for further instructions ; customers tweak their networks using a Web - based interface hosted on Meraki 's servers .
At the low end of Meraki 's product line are mesh nodes optimized for providing basic connectivity for areas that lack traditional wired connectivity .
These products are popular internationally ; Biswas touts customers in 143 countries worldwide .
Mesh networks are especially appealing in nations that lack the resources to put extensive fiber or copper networks in the ground .
In these areas , a mesh network can extend connectivity to homes and businesses that would not be able to access it in other ways .
The XO laptop distributed by the One Laptop Per Child project uses mesh networking protocols for similar reasons .
For remote areas of developing nations , omnidirectional mesh networks must be paired with backhaul connections that use directional antennas for increased range .
For example , Lakshminarayanan Subramanian , a computer science professor at NYU , has used WiFi and directional antennas to transmit 7 - 10 Mbps over a distance of 100 km .
These links will never be as fast as a fiber connection , but for poor villages who otherwise would n't be able to afford an Internet connection , mesh networking is a boon .
Going the " last mile "
Mesh networks may provide a cheap way to get villages in the developing world online , but they do not seem likely to pose a serious threat to telecom incumbents in the developed world .
One of Meraki 's leading competitors , Tropos networks , focuses on public - sector clients such as police departments , public utilities , and municipalities wishing to build city - wide wireless networks .
One case study on the Tropos website touts the experience of Chaska , MN , which hired Tropos in 2004 to build a municipal WiFi network for the city 's 23,000 residents at a cost of $ 1.3 million .
Tropos says its 802.11 b/g - based network in Chaska offered " 1+ Mbps " connectivity .
Biswas says Meraki's newer 802.11n - based products boast typical speeds on the order of 10 Mbps .
But with Verizon and Comcast already offering 50 M bps connections in some areas , mesh networking technology seems unlikely to be a serious threat to cable and telephone incumbents in the developed world .
Biswas told Ars that Meraki's low - end gear is primarily used in the United States to supplement traditional wired network connections .
So , for example , a neighborhood association might deploy Meraki routers in parts of the neighborhood that are not one hop away from a wired access point , on the theory that relatively slow access is better than no access at all .
But these small - scale applications are best thought of as a complement , rather than an alternative , to incumbent broadband providers .

With the results of a medical study summarized by a new report delivered to the California state legislature , the California Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research ( CMCR ) claims it has established scientific proof that inhaled cannabis holds medical value at or above the level of conventional prescription medicines used for a variety of ailments .
“ As a result of the vision and foresight of the California State Legislature Medical Marijuana Research Act
( SB847 ) , the CMCR has successfully conducted the first clinical trials of smoked cannabis in the United
States in more than 20 years , ” the group said in the study ’s conclusion summary .
“ As a result of this program of systematic research , we now have reasonable evidence that cannabis is a promising treatment in selected pain syndromes caused by injury or diseases of the nervous system , and possibly for painful muscle spasticity due to multiple sclerosis . ”

“ Obviously more research will be necessary to elucidate the mechanisms of action and the full therapeutic potential of cannabinoid compounds .
Meanwhile , the knowledge and new findings from the CMCR provide a strong science - based context in which policy makers and the public can discuss the place of these compounds in medical care . ”
“ ‘ There is good evidence now that cannabinoids ( the active compounds in the marijuana plant ) may be either an adjunct or a first - line treatment for … neuropathy , ’ said Dr. Igor Grant , Director of the CMCR , at a news conference at the state Capitol , ' ” according to Salem - News .
“ He added that the efficacy of smoked marijuana was ‘ very consistent , ’ and that its pain - relieving effects were ‘ comparable to the better existing treatments ’ presently available by prescription . ”
While the dangers of smoking remain , a study published by the Journal of Pharmeseutical Sciences in 2006 showed that inhaling vapors from the cannabis plant , created by flushing heated air through a small chamber , is a “ safe and effective ” mode of transmission for the drug .
“ The California Legislature established the [ CMCR ] in 2000 to examine whether the therapeutic claims of medical marijuana advocates could withstand scientific scrutiny , ” the Associated Press reported .
“ In 1996 , state voters became the first in the nation to pass a law approving pot use for medical purposes . ”
The study found that cannabis can help ease the pain of neuropathy , migraine headaches and facial pain , AP noted .
In tests on rats , a “ cannabis - like drug ” reportedly reduced nerve cells ’ pain signals .

Seeing winter squash at the HOPE Farmer ’s Market on Sunday made me squeal a little .
Winter squash is one of my favorite things to eat , and I was so sad when my fledgling butternuts died due to my late planting and a freeze .
At the market I grabbed two big hunks of the squash and wondered what to do with it .
I blame Cheryl of 5 Second Rule for this recipe , but it ’s not like that is a bad thing .
She posted about sriracha earlier this month and it got me thinking .
And then I realized I had those huge hunks of squash sitting in my fridge , with no particular plans for them .
So one night after dinner , I made up some soup .
This soup has a nice heat that warms up your throat but does n’t burn off your tongue .
It has been the perfect thing to eat with all the chilly wet weather we ’ve been having here .
Feel free to add more sriracha , but I really suggest starting out small and going from there , or better yet – having the bottle at the table for the heat lovers .
Sassy Squash Soup Author : Megan Servings : 6 0 from 0 votes Print Recipe Ingredients 2 tbsp butter
1 onion , diced
5 medium carrots , diced
4 celery ribs , diced
Salt and pepper to taste

This blog is hosted on WordPress.com .
This has its advantages , but it means that I ca n’t use the huge range of add-ins that are available to those that host their own WordPress server .
In my attempts to find a simple way to add social bookmarking to WordPress posts I stumbled across GetSocial , a Windows desktop program that generates the social bookmarking icons you see at the bottom of my recent posts .
GetSocial is donationware – the author requests a small donation if you find the software useful .
But the software is not crippled or time limited in any way and the donation is optional .
I found the software useful so I made a small donation .
I use a number of donationware products .
Human nature being what it is , I rarely get round to making donations – despite the best of intentions .
It just never quite makes it to the top of my ever expanding TODO list .
I have also heard various tales about how dismal the donation rates are .
So I was curious about how well the donationware model works in this particular case .
I emailed the author of GetSocial , Hillel Stoler , and he was kind enough to do this interview .
What was the motivation behind GetSocial ?
GetSocial is not a business – it ’s my contribution to the WordPress.com community .
I needed a way to generate social bookmarking buttons for my own blog , and when I saw none was available I made GetSocial .
I decided to request donations because I too was curious about the feasibility of donationware , and wanted to investigate the subject .
I hate spammy “ business models ” such as installing Toolbars , embedding ads and so forth and wanted to make software that I would like to use .
Does anyone actually make a donation ?
Surprisingly , yes .
Many people donate , and I think all of them are glad to do so .
What is the average donation ?
At the beginning I was only asking for a fixed amount ( 5 USD ) .
The reason for this was that a fixed donation simplifies the donation process ( because the potential benefactor needs to make one less decision ) .
I ’ve selected 5 USD because it was the lowest sum of money for which the PayPal commissions amounted to less than 10 % of the donation .
Recently I ’ve enabled donations in different currencies and variable amounts ( but only on my websites , donations made from inside the application are still fixed ) .
I ’ve seen some decline in the ratio of donations per download ( although it could be explained by many factors , and cannot be directly attributed to the added complexity of the process without applying proper A /B testing methods ) .
However , the average donation has increased to 9.19 USD , and I ’ve also received donations of over 20 USD .
This is interesting because 19.99 USD is enough to purchase many commercial software products .
To date , no one has donated less than 5 USD .
What is the donation / download ratio ?
First of all , please consider that GetSocial is upgraded frequently , and I cannot differentiate between a new download and an upgrade download .
Also , I can only count downloads which originated from my own websites .
That said , dividing the number of the donations by the total number of documented downloads yields a donate / download ratio of about 0.55 percent ( e.g. a single donation is received on average about every 182 downloads ) .
Can you make any money out of donationware ?
I do make some money out of GetSocial , but I ’m far from making a living out of it .
With the current donation / download ratio , GetSocial will only begin to become economically interesting when it hits the 500k download mark .
It ’s not impossible market - size wise ( there are about 10 million bloggers in WordPress.com ) but it ’s not easy .
The amount of money one can make with donationware is directly proportional to the number of people involved .
For example , in the case of GetSocial , take a million downloads , divide by 182 and multiply by 5 dollars and you have 27 k USD ( before PayPal commissions ) .
This amount of money can cover the development costs for many small software products .
That said , a million is a big number , even for free software .
If you ’re thinking about making real money out of a donation based product , I would recommend that you research the size of your market carefully .
Getting those million downloads is not an easy task .
I personally do n’t think that money is the sole motivation for doing things though .
When discussing profits , we should also take into account the indirect benefits I receive from GetSocial such as incoming links , a user base , visits to my website , comments , world fame ( or at least some publicity ) , and even fan mail !
And hey , the donationware model works for Wikipedia , does n’t it ?
Why did you choose a donation model instead of selling licences ?
The reason I made GetSocial was that when I started hillelstoler.com ( on a WordPress.com platform ) , I wanted to add social bookmarking buttons for my visitors .
When I realized no one was doing that ( there was an old text file floating around for manual use ) I decided to make GetSocial .
I wanted to attract visitors to my new blog , and I knew that distributing a hyped piece of free software would help me build credibility and acquire an international audience .
It did .
Why did you choose donationware over freeware ?
Out of curiosity , I guess .
I wanted to know if one could make any money this way , and if people actually pay when they do n’t have to ( especially in cases where no one is looking ) .
Today I can clearly say that I was pleasantly surprised .
I think that Donationware is a beautiful ( and very user - friendly ) concept , and I ’m glad it ’s not just another web myth .
Besides , I knew that people needed GetSocial , but to be honest I did n’t really think that anyone would actually pay for such a service at the time .
In the end , I think that my potential buyers are also the ones who made the effort and donated , even though they did n’t have to .
I ’ve actually received some donations larger than what I could possibly charge if GetSocial was a commercial product !
Another important factor in my decision was the fact that I could do it rather easily .
Recall the old days , when Donationware DOS programs asked you to kindly snail - mail some cash to a P.O box ?
That ’s the kind of thing I would never bother with , especially when we ’re talking about an international market .
Do you think you have made more money through donations than you would have through selling licences ?
Absolutely !
When I ’ve received my first donation I was surprised ( so people do donate after all ) , and as donations kept pouring in I realized that there is a donation culture .
Selling licenses also meant becoming a part - time police officer , and that ’s not what I was after .
What really amazed me , is that even in this very specific niche of social bookmarking for WordPress.com blogs ( where I offer an industry grade solution for free ) competition still sprung !
How did you promote GetSocial ?
I did n’t .
I ’ve posted about it on the WordPress.com forums several times , and wrote about it on my website , hillelstoler.com .
Other people wrote about it too .
No paid ads or anything like that .
You ’ll notice that I did n’t even include a link on the toolbar itself ( the viral ‘ Get one ! ’ link you see everywhere else ) because it was important to me not to impose .
You now have a web version of GetSocial .
How long did that take to create compared to the desktop version ?
How do the desktop and web version compare in terms of the amount of use and the amount of donations ?
GetSocial Live ( the on - line version ) started as a weekend project actually .
GetSocial is a Windows application , and many people wanted a Mac version .
Since I do n’t even own a Mac , I decided to make a cross- platform web service ( currently , about 40 % of GetSocial Live visitors are indeed Mac users ) .
It was easy to make , because I copied some of the code directly from GetSocial .
The images are all photos I took of the plants in my house .
In the end it did mean additional costs ( hosting , domain , etc ) , but originally it was hosted for free on ( the late ) Google Pages service .
Later on , I discovered that the on - line version made GetSocial much more flexible and dynamic .
I can now post updates much more quickly and effectively .
The web version is also much easier to upgrade and maintain because it lacks some of the internal complexity of the GetSocial application ( things like self encryption ) .
Do you get any useful revenue from the Google ads on getsociallive.com ?
As in the case of the donations , I was curious about AdSense .
I know for a fact that I never click sponsored links myself , but I guess some other people do because Google makes a living out of it .
I did n’t bother with A/B testing and other cash boosters , I just added a single ribbon of ads .
So far revenue has been disappointing ( this is also the place to mention that the process of getting my AdSense account approved was very annoying and arbitrary , with zero support ) .
There were some cases where I got more than 1 dollar per click , but I currently get more money through donations than through AdSense .
Interestingly , the ratio of ad clicks per page view is similar to ( though a bit lower than ) the ratio of donations per download .

Children of British soldiers who fought in wars in which depleted uranium ammunition was used are at greater risk of suffering genetic diseases passed on by their fathers , new research reveals .
Veterans of the conflicts in the Gulf , Bosnia and Kosovo have been found to have up to 14 times the usual level of chromosome abnormalities in their genes .
That has raised fears they will pass cancers and genetic illnesses to their offspring .
The study is the first to analyse chromosome deformation in soldiers .
Paul Tyler MP , a member of the Royal British Legion Gulf War Syndrome working group , said it would be ' outrageous ' if the findings were ignored by the Government .
' High levels of genetic damage do not occur naturally .
It increases the probability of cancer , deformed babies and other genetic conditions significantly , ' said Professor Albrecht Schott , a German biochemist who co-ordinated the research .
Schott collected blood samples from 16 British veterans last year .
Fourteen had fought in the Gulf war , one of whom also served in Bosnia .
Of the others , one served only in Kosovo and one only in Bosnia .
Two of the veterans are women .
The former soldiers have between double and 14 times the usual level of chromosome abnormalities .
The average was five - and - a - half times higher than found in civilians .
None had less than double the normal rate .
Ex -Warrant Officer Ray Bristow , who served in Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf war , has previously been found to have hundreds of times higher than the safe limit of depleted uranium in his urine .
The father of three from Hull , now a wheelchair user , suffers problems with his memory , respiratory system , liver , kidney , bowels and hearing .
He recently had a large tumour removed from his hand .
Schott , who has a £ 30,000 debt after funding the tests himself , said that in the 18 months since they were done the condition of many veterans had worsened .
Some were suffering from cancers .
' This confirms that we have been exposed to ionising radiation , ' said Shaun Rusling , chairman of the National Gulf Veterans and Families Association .
' That is the only way we could have this level of chromosome damage . '
Last month the MoD said it was launching an investigation after a study revealed 19 Gulf veterans had developed lymphatic or bone marrow cancers compared with 11 in a control group .
A US government survey of 21,000 veterans has also shown that those who served in the Gulf were two to three times more likely to report birth defects in their children .
Depleted uranium is used in shells because its high density allows maximum penetration of hard targets such as tanks and underground bunkers .
The US and Britain have admitted using 350 tonnes of depleted uranium in the Gulf war .
Iraqi scientists have reported high levels of childhood cancers and deformed babies in populations exposed to the ammunition .
Some 53,000 British troops served in the Gulf .
Of these , at least 552 have died and more than 5,200 have reported a range of illnesses .
Once in the body , depleted uranium can remain for years emitting small doses of alpha radiation .
Former soldiers who were heavy smokers , or had undergone chemotherapy or X - ray treatment were excluded from the study as these factors could also lead to higher than normal levels of chromosome aberrations .
Kenny Duncan believes that his children 's health problems are linked to his service in the Gulf war .
All three were born with deformed toes and suffer from asthmas , hay fever and eczema .
His wife Mandy said : ' It 's scandalous that while we are suffering with the consequences of what the Government has done , politicians are just thinking about money . '
A spokesman for the MoD dismissed Schott 's findings .
' We consider the tests neither well thought out nor scientifically sound , ' he said .
Another year of war in Iraq has come and gone , and with devastating violence still virtually a daily reality in the nation , the seventh anniversary of the US invasion looks to come and go with considerably less discussion than in years past .
The repeated escalations of the war in Afghanistan have turned Iraq into a comparatively forgotten war .
This , coupled with President Obama ’s repeated pledges to end the war have led many Americans to conclude that the conflict is , if not entirely so , virtually over .
Yet nearly 100,000 American troops remain on the ground in Iraq , increasingly held hostage by what looks to be a virtual deadlock in this month ’s parliamentary election .
US officials still insist further cuts are “ on the horizon , ” but the Obama Administration ’s pledge to have all combat troops out by August , which was itself a considerable retreat from his campaign pledges to end the war entirely in 16 months , looks like it will not come to pass .
There is open talk about a “ plan B ” in Iraq , which is to slow or even entirely stop the withdrawal of troops from the nation .
Officials had said last year that the bulk of America ’s combat force would not leave until after the election was resolved , but this is now expected to take several months .
In a way , the situation has become even less certain than it was a year ago .
At this time last year officials were presenting the then - upcoming parliamentary election as a stabilizing event .
With that election dividing the nation ’s polity more than ever , there seems to be no hypothetical future event for the administration to hang its hopes on .
Stefan Schwarzer ( sometimes collaborating with Susan Schnur ) has created a bunch of
infographic posters for the United Nations Environment Program ( UNEP ) as part of the Global Environment Outlook .
They ’re not available for sale , but high - resolution PDFs of all of these posters are available for download !
These posters have been developed mainly on the basis of existing data from the GEO Data Portal .
Thanks Stefan , from UNEP , for the links !
Last year , Baby Boomers quit Facebook at a faster pace than they joined .
That 's according to data published last year by the site Inside Facebook .
After a huge growth in Facebook membership among the over - 55 age group took place at the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 , that same demographic began to defect in large numbers , just months after signing up .
Boomers were the the only shrinking age demographic on the site .
What do Boomers know that others do n't ?
Boomers have discretion , according to Scott Wright , a security consultant based in Canada who also researches and writes about social media and security awareness on his site streetwise - security - zone.com .
While the numbers certainly continue to indicate that more people are joining Facebook than quitting , certain web sites that help people " kill " your online self have gained popularity , too .
Facebook recently issued cease and desist orders to several of these sites , including one called Web 2.0 Suicide Machine .
Why would someone decide to sign off Facebook forever ?
Here are ten observations from security and privacy pros about the risks of social media .
Your privacy is history
Wright took part in a panel discussion recently on the topic of privacy and said he was intrigued by the opinion of one academic who pointed out that the notion of privacy differs widely among generations .
" The 20 - something view of privacy is basically that their parents not see what they are doing .
That 's about it , " said Wright .
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg apparently agrees .
Zuckerberg made controversial remarks to a live audience earlier this year at an awards event and stated that openly sharing information with many people is today 's social norm .
He went on to say " We view it as our role in the system to constantly be innovating and be updating what our system is to reflect what the current social norms are . "
Many have translated this to mean Facebook does n't think its users want much privacy , and the policies of the site reflect that view .
Whether Zuckerberg is right or wrong depends on who you ask .
And that leaves us to consider :
As younger generations define privacy in new ways , it really good for us ?
Bethan Tuttle , an Washington - based independent consultant and privacy advocate , says no .
Tuttle said she is concerned about some of the newer changes to Facebook that force users to share certain information because , in her words , without privacy , we do n't have civil liberties .
" If you can't maintain privacy online and off , then you can't speak freely , " said Tuttle .
" These security issues need to be addressed in such a way that our privacy can be protected . "
Tuttle thinks the massive and quick growth Facebook has experienced in the last two years , coupled with a lack of privacy - centric leadership has left end user privacy as casualty .

They do n't have your best interests in mind
As Tom Eston , creator of the web site socialmediasecurity .com points out , the very business model Facebook , and other social networking sites like Twitter , stands on is making user information as public as possible in order to generate new ways to make money .
" They are really startups if you think about it .
They do n't have a true business model , " said Eston .
" Their philosophy is the more you share , the more information they have to make money with . "
With that in mind , can you really count on them to protect you ?
And do you know just how much information you are sharing that can be used not only by Facebook , but by the application developers that create those fun quizzes and games ?
Wright says most people do n't .
Case in point : A quiz designed by the ACLU that shows Facebook users just how much information they hand over to application developers every time they agree to install a new app .
Want to take that quiz to find out who you were in a past life ?
Each time you do , almost everything on your profile , even if you use privacy settings to limit access , is made available to the creators of that application .
Frequent redesigns affect privacy settings
" Just when people figure out the privacy settings on Facebook , they go and change them again , " said Wright .
" It always seems like it is being done in everyone 's best interest , but if you really examine it , they have never done anything other than to try and get people to share more information . "
The latest Facebook redesign in December now makes public , and searchable , certain user information that was previously private , such as which pages you are a fan of and your profile picture .
And many of the features you can make private are left public unless you go in and adjust your privacy settings , which is no small task , according to Tuttle .
" I am really good online but it took me several tries to get my Facebook privacy settings where I needed them to be , " she said .
" I think Facebook actually implemented some great changes with this redesign , but they need to make those easier and more stable .
Privacy settings need to not be changed so many times in such a short period .
People need to know weeks ahead of time exactly what to do and a method of not waking up one day and finding out all of their information has gone public . "
Social engineering attacks are getting more targeted
If you are using Facebook , surely you have received messages by now on your wall asking " Have you seen this video ? " or " Is this you in this photo ? "
If you click on the link , you run the risk of being infected by malware .
These are known as social engineering attacks , and they are becoming more sophisticated said Wright .
( Read more in 9 Dirty Tricks : Social Engineers ' Favorite Pickup Lines . )
" They are becoming very targeted .
Even seasoned security professionals are falling for them , " he said .
The more information you share , coupled with a decrease in privacy , only means it is even easier for cyber criminals to get information about you that can be used to trick you into clicking on a bad link .
Spam
Blackberry owners using the mobile Facebook application have been experiencing increased amounts of spam lately that claims to be from Facebook , said Eston .
" I think it 's a security concern , " said Eston .
" Mostly because spammers can use that vulnerability to make you think the message is coming from Facebook when it is not .
Many users simply wonder " Why is Facebook sending me this ? " and instinctively open the message and log in to what turns out to be a fake screen that steals credentials .
You do n't really know your friends
A report from security firm Cloudmark that was released at the end of 2008 concluded that close to 40 percent of new Facebook profiles are actually fake .
If you are one of those people with hundreds of " friends , " what are the chances you might have a fake friend or two out there in your network ?
Pretty high , said Wright .
Having lots of friends is dangerous is because it opens you up to additional security risks .
Wright said those who get targeted for hacking are the ones who have lots of friends .
The more friends you have , the more reach a criminal will have when he breaks into your profile and sends out a bad link to everyone .
You can't help yourself from being dumbthe site pleaserobme.com has brought to light the safety concerns around social networking .
Pleaserobme aggregates the Twitter feeds of people who play Foursquare , a location - sharing application that allows users to " check in " from their various geographic whereabouts .
The problem is , in playing the game , many users are also publicly broadcasting that their home is likely unattended and a good " opportunity " ( as the site terms it ) for thieves .
The recent attention around
As Tuttle puts it , you need to think about what you are doing and many people are not .
Whether you 're updating your Facebook status or playing a location - sharing game through Twitter , you 're putting yourself out there in potentially dangerous ways , particularly if you do n't know all of your " friends " that well ( See " You do n't really know your friends " above ) .
" If you are posting that you have arrived at a hotel at 11:00 at night and you are a female with a cute photo , you 're giving someone incentive to put on their shoes and go look for you .
Are you even thinking about that ? " she said .
The great unknown
The layout and privacy settings keep changing .
There is a lot of analysis and speculation about a potential Facebook IPO in the future and generally a lot of discussion of Facebook 's future business strategy .
What does this mean for users ?
Wright said some fear it means an increase loss of privacy as the social networking site inevitably looks for ways to make money by offering up valuable user information to advertisers and developers .
Will you stick around to see how the site evolves ?
Or will others take a cue from the Boomers and opt out ?
" One of the things I find most interesting is that there are still many people who are scared to death of social networking sites , " said Wright .
" These are usually the people who do n't see value in them .
In the end , they may be the wisest of us all . "
Ex's , creeps and parents
George Straight once sang , " All my ex's live in Texas , that 's why I hang my hat in Tennessee . "
There is little doubt that if Straight were break up with a girlfriend in today 's information age , he'd have to do more than simply move across state lines to avoid being found again .
Facebook is making it possible for people who break up to be cyber stalked , even if they are n't friends anymore , said Eston .
Although the virtual connection is broken along with the actual relationship , having mutual friends makes it easier for your ex to keep tabs on you .
The same goes for any creepy guy or girl you are trying to avoid .
Or you may get a friend request from a parent , which Wright claims many 20 - something users he talks to considers the worst thing that could ever happen in the history of social networking .
" That is big driver for quitting , " he said .
" Once the parent friends some of these people they immediately think ' I 've got to get out of this ! ' "
Of course , if you 're the parent and you 're concerned about kids revealing too much on social networks , this is the promised reason you might want to STAY on Facebook — it might make your kids quit .
A BRITISH Chinook helicopter pilot was shot between the eyes by a Taliban bullet - but flew on and saved all 20 aboard , The Sun reported .
The Sun reports that Flight Lieutenant Ian Fortune , 28 , had flown in to pick up casualties as a firefight raged between American and Afghan forces and heavily - armed rebels near Garmsir in Helmand Province .
Flt - Lt Fortune - who had TV presenter Mike Brewer on the aircraft filming a documentary - was advised to hold off on approach to the battle as it was " too hot " on the ground .
He circled until troops reported incoming fire had calmed down .
But as he flew in the helicopter came under attack - which continued as casualties were being loaded .
Then , as he lifted off , Flt - Lt Fortune was shot .
A bullet hit a metal rail on the front of his helmet which is used to attach night vision goggles .
The round then penetrated his helmet hitting him between the eyes .
It knocked his head back and caused severe bleeding .
More bullets followed , hitting the Chinook 's controls and shutting down the stabilisation system .
But with blood pouring into his eyes , Flt - Lt Fortune battled with the controls to stop the chopper from spiraling out of control
Then with the aircraft lurching from side to side he continued flying for eight minutes before landing at Camp Bastion .
He was taken to the field hospital and treated for his wound .
It is the first time in the nine - year war in Afghanistan a pilot has been shot while in the air .
One senior RAF source said : " This could have become one of the worst incidents of the conflict .
" If the bullet had hit the pilot a millimetre lower , those on board would n't have stood a chance .
" And had it not been for the skill of the pilot the result would have been the same . "
Brewer , 41 , who was with a crew from the Discovery Channel , said : " The courage and heroism of the pilot was beyond belief . "

TMZ has learned Brittany Murphy received no fewer than 200 pills every month from January 2008 through August 2009 ... and sometimes as many as 400 .
As we first reported , Murphy used an alias -- Lola Manilow Murphy -- at Eddie 's Pharmacy in Los Angeles for nearly two years before the pharmacy finally cut her off 4 months before her death .
Pharmacy records show Murphy was getting regular scrips for hydrocodone ( Vicodin ) , clonazepam and Klonopin ( anti-anxiety ) , and Vicoprofen ( a Vicodin / ibuprofen combo ) -- doubling up on some prescriptions on certain months .
For example , one month Murphy was prescribed 200 hydrocodone and 100 clonazepam ; another month it was 300 Vicoprofen and 100 Klonopin .
All the prescriptions were prescribed by Dr. Richard Kroop .
We 're told investigators paid a visit to Kroop on Friday afternoon .
As we first reported , the owner of Eddie 's Pharmacy told TMZ he cut Brittany and her family off 4 months before her death because , " We thought there was going to be an accident there . "

They are in some cases strange bedfellows , yet they are lending their names and political muscle to a common cause today : updating U.S. privacy laws that predate the World Wide Web .
From an Electronic Frontier Foundation press release :
The " Digital Due Process " coalition includes major Internet and telecommunications companies like Google , Microsoft , and AT&T as well as advocacy groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) and the Center for Democracy & Technology ( CDT ) .
The coalition has joined together to preserve traditional privacy rights and clarify legal protections in the face of a rapidly changing technological landscape .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
" The federal law protecting Internet and telephone users ' privacy was written nearly 25 years ago , which is eons ago in ' Internet time , ' " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston .
" When it comes to privacy , EFF has had its disagreements with fellow Digital Due Process members such as Google and AT&T .
But this diverse coalition of privacy advocates and Internet companies agree on at least one thing :
The current electronic privacy laws are woefully outdated and must be updated to provide clear privacy protections that reflect the always - on , location - enabled , Web 2.0 world of the 21st century . "
From an ACLU press release about the coalition 's formation :
" Our privacy laws desperately need an upgrade , " said Laura W. Murphy , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
" Technology has evolved at a lightning pace , leaving our privacy protections out of date and ineffective .
The Fourth Amendment guarantees us the right to be secure in our ' papers and effects ' and that means something entirely different in the 21st century .
Many of our ' papers and effects ' are no longer tangible in the same way they used to be but still must be defended from the overreaching hands of government .
Congress must step up and make the much - needed changes to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act . "
Here are the four primary areas of concentration the coalition envisions for an overhaul of existing law , according to the EFF :
Better protect the privacy of communications and documents you store in the cloud ;
Better protect you against secret tracking of your location through your cell phone or any other mobile device ;
Better protect you against secret monitoring of when and with whom you communicate over the telephone or the Internet ;
Better protect innocent Americans against government fishing expeditions through masses of communications data unrelated to a criminal suspect .
You can read much more detailed explanations - complete with all the legalese you can handle - at the coalition 's new Web site .
Google has a blog post explaining its motivation for joining the group , as well as a video summarizing the effort for those who prefer not to read :
Another blog post from Microsoft and one from Intel .
It 's difficult to argue with the overarching goal here :
The law needs updating .
Needless to say , however , it will be interesting to see how the coalition holds once actual changes start winding their way through Congress and the varying interests of these member organizations begin to conflict .
That will be a whole different round of press releases .

Some of the night 's other major winners included Lady Gaga , who won best dance / electronic album awards for " The Fame . "
Green Day , which won best rock album for " 21st Century Breakdown , " and Maxwell , who won best R&B album for " Blacksummers ' Night . "
Beyoncé 's wins included best R&B contemporary album for " I Am ... Sasha Fierce , " and she took home song of the year for " Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) . "
She also performed a rock ' n ' roll take on her single " If I Were a Boy , " and then segued into " You Oughta Know " by Alanis Morissette .
Though Swift won the top prize , it was R&B star Beyoncé who can lay claim to a Grammy record .
She won six awards total , the most ever by a female artist in a single year .
Norah Jones won five awards in 2003 ; her album was recognized for a total of eight that year .
In the last two years , Grammy voters have bestowed album of the year on industry icons .
Robert Plant and Alison Krauss won the title in 2009 for " Raising Sand " and Herbie Hancock took it home in 2008 for " River : The Joni Letters . "
Swift won the prize for her 2008 album " Fearless , " which finished as the top - selling album of 2009 , moving a total of 3.2 million copies , according to Nielsen SoundScan .
8:30 p.m. The Grammy Awards took a bet on youth in 2010 , giving its top prize to country star Taylor Swift .
The 20 - year - old won four Grammys , including album of the year and best country album .
8:26 p.m. ALBUM OF THE YEAR : Taylor Swift 's " Fearless . "
8:25 p.m. Weirdest intro of the night : Quentin Tarantino playing the role of an angry car salesman introducing Drake , Eminem and Lil Wayne .
He seemed to suddenly develop some sort of gangster accent for the rant .
Not sure how the performance played in the Staples Center -- and it seemed to look pretty powerful -- but it was largely bleeped on CBS broadcast .
8:05 p.m. Imelda May and Jeff Beck perform a sharp tribute to Les Paul , tackling " How High the Moon . "
Beck was clear , direct and honored the guitar maker in an impressive display that did n't cloud the vocalist .
7:58 p.m. Maxwell , who already won best R&B album for " Blacksummers ' Night , " reprises his award - show staple " Pretty Wings , " a gorgeous tune worthy of its nomination for song of the year .
He 's joined by Roberta Flack for a few moments of " Where is the Love . "
Flack is n't the showstopper she once was , but Maxwell looks honored and thrilled to share the stage with her .
One of the more respectful performances of the night .
7:47 p.m. : BEST FEMALE POP VOCAL PERFORMANCE : Beyoncé 's " Halo . "
That 's No. 6 for the R&B singer .
A foreshadowing of album of the year ?
Swift , remember , did n't win either top single categories at the Grammys .
7:43 p.m. Dave Matthews
Band gets the string section treatment for " You & Me . "
In case strings were n't enough for you , how about a marching band ?
As many layers as the Grammys throw on top of the song , however , it still sounds like the end - credits tune for a " Shrek " film .
7:30 p.m. Wyclef Jean introduces the Grammys ' Haiti benefit segment -- a performance of " Bridge Over Troubled Water " with opera singer Andrea Bocelli and R&B star Mary J. Blige .
The Grammys do n't do much restrained , and the performance of the Simon & Garfunkel classic is definitely blown up for the CBS telecast .
It will be available as a download on iTunes after the show .
For what it 's worth , this writer would have liked to have seen a little more Blige , and a little less opera .
7:18 p.m. Jay - Z thanks the " genius that is Kanye West " as he accepts the award for best rap sung collaboration for " Run This Town , " but Kanye is nowhere to be found .
Rihanna and a heretofore unknown child are on stage , however , and accept the award .
" Run This Town " did beat Lonely Island 's " I 'm on a Boat , " and here 's betting Grammy voters breathed a sigh of relief that a novelty song did n't win an award .
7:12 p.m. The Bon Jovi extravaganza .
Not to be a Crotchety Old Man Blogger here , and not to take anything away from Bon Jovi 's arena success and memorable hooks , but a nearly six - minute bit for a band that only has one nomination this year ?
Not to mention for an album that kinda tanked ?
Somebody must have been owed a favor .
We have multiple episodes of " The Mentalist " on the DVR , and now we 're six more minutes away from them .
7:06 p.m .
What a difference a year makes .
At the 2009 Grammy Awards , Taylor Swift was relegated to the kid 's table , as she performed with Miley Cyrus .
This year , she got to appear with some music royalty , being joined by Stevie Nicks .
She may not best Lady Gaga and Beyoncé for album of the year , but she 's in their company .
To mark the occasion , we propose that the Taylor Swift doll now come with Lady Gaga accessories .
To wit :
6:57 p.m. Gimmick alert !
Michael Jackson 3 - D tribute for " Earth . "
While no one expected this to be " Avatar , " the effects were hit - and - miss , and the song is n't so much as a song as it is a lecture .
Celine Dion , Jennifer Hudson , Smokey Robinson and Usher do their best to inject some passion into the routine , but it plays out like an ad for the DVD release of " Michael Jackson 's This Is It " rather than a tribute .
Prince and Paris Jackson make a brief appearance , and tell us that Michael was to perform at the Grammys this year .
6:46 p.m. " You could not make up a success story like this one , " Ryan Seacrest said Taylor Swift , who 's performing " Today Was a Fairytale , " her vehicle for the film " Valentine 's Day . "
The song lacks the energy of some of her hits , but gives us something fresh from the star .
But in a Grammy pairing that makes little - to - zero sense , we get Swift and Stevie Nicks for a few seconds of Fleetwood Mac's " Rhiannon " and then a folksy take on Swift 's " You Belong With Me . "
Putting Swift with such a distinctive rock ' n ' roll voice is n't the best showcase for her .
Swift 's appeal is her good - natured charm and simplicity , but she 's also a flat vocalist .
6:36 p.m. Play ball !
Hands in the air , and the crowd is on their feet for " America the Beautiful " with Zac Brown Band .
The best new artist winners are joined by legend Leon Russell and perform a medley of " Dixie Lullaby " and " Chicken Fried . "
Pandering -- half - expected the song to finish in a giant Fourth of July - like fireworks explosion -- but Russell made the best of his few seconds on stage .
6:32 p.m. : BEST ROCK ALBUM : Green Day's " 21st Century Breakdown . "
The band won for " American Idiot , " and beat out U2 for this prize .
6:22 p.m. : Here 's an unnecessary performance : Jamie Foxx and T - Pain singing the Auto - Tune wonder " Blame It . "
Shots of George Clinton , and a final big screeching gratuitous guitar solo from Slash .
At first , it seemed like a nod to 2008 , but then it shot back to the late ' 80s .
6:17 p.m. RECORD OF THE YEAR : Kings of Leon 's " Use Somebody . "
The rock ' n ' roll slow - dance catapulted the Kings of Leon to the top of the charts , and overtook cuts from Lady Gaga , Black Eyed Peas and Swift to win record of the year .
Since record of the year is awarded to the artists and producers , many thought Gaga or the BEPs would take this category , but voters again went the more traditional route .
Also of note , without a song or record of the year win , Swift will now truly have a reason to act shocked if she takes album of the year .
6:11 p.m. Colbert wins best comedy album for " A Colbert Christmas : The Greatest Gift Of All ! "
He quips , " It 's a Christmas album , so I suppose I should thank God . "
6:08 p.m. Country 's Lady Antebellum performing adult pop hit " Need You Now . "
It 's been an award show staple of late , but it 's a pleasant - enough hit .
It 's a showcase for Hillary Scott , who will be a star thanks to this cut .
At the Grammys , the song did have a bit more kick , turning this late - night tale of boozy desperation into a surprising clap - along ditty .
5:54 p.m. Miley Cyrus introduces the Black Eyed Peas , who like Beyoncé are dressed like their auditioning for a sci- fi film .
The censors appear to just miss a curse word , starting with " Imma Be , " and eventually going into " I Gotta Feeling . "
Gotta say , the BEPs do n't usually translate well on national television -- the fact that all their songs are are in every other commercial probably does a bit to lesson their appeal -- but they came off ridiculously fun here .
They get a bonus point for some dancing robots , and did n't appear to be taking things too seriously .
" Welcome to the future , " will .i.am said .
No one really believed the goofy sound effects and military - like outfits were a sign of things to come , but this was B - movie camp at its best .
5:49 p.m. BEST NEW ARTIST : Zac Brown
Band , the first country artist to win this title since Carrie Underwood , and only the second in the last 10 years .
Silver Lake 's Silversun Pickups are saved from the so - called best new artist curse .
But the Ting Tings were robbed , though the spunky duo never had a chance .
5:45 p.m. Pink , proving once again that some pretty acrobatics can distract from a boring song , in this case " Glitter in the Air . "
For those who ’ve always wanted to add some circus stunts to their bummer ballads , this was your dream come true .
For the rest of us , this was the kind of stunt you see outside the Luxor .
5:31 p.m . What Beyoncé may as well have been saying to Taylor Swift : “ So , you think you 're a crossover artist ?
You ain't seeing nothing , kid . ”
Queen B rocks it out with " If I Were a Boy , " complete with a crotch - grab and all , and then jumps into " You Oughta Know . "
Yes , the Alanis Morissette song .
Beyoncé has done what every artist should do , and that 's use this platform to take some chances , and try out something the prime - time audience is n't expecting .
She was crawling on all fours , and belting out the lyrics with greater ferocity than Billie Joe Armstrong ( see what the theater does , Billie ? ) , even if it was a bit of an obvious attempt to prove that she can do it all .
5:27 p.m. BEST COUNTRY ALBUM : Taylor Swift 's " Fearless . "
This gives
Swift three wins for the night .
She noted that it was the first time she ’d walked up the Staples Center stairs to " accept a Grammy on national television . "
First time for everything .
I guess when you 've won nearly every award known to man , you have to find new angles .
" I just believe I 'm standing here accepting an impossible dream . "
5:15 p.m. Dear Green Day :
The world loved " American Idiot . "
Its political anthems shot you back to relevancy , and the album ’s flashes of theatricality added a welcome bit of bombast to your sound .
When the album was turned into a Broadway - bound musical , that was all a bit unexpected , and even deserved we would say .
But -- and do n't be offended Green Day -- bigger is n't always better .
The choir on " 21 Guns " was overkill , and there 's Never ( we capitalized the “ N ” on “ never ” for added emphasis ) a reason to duet with multiple Broadway singers on the Grammys .
Just because people seem to like " Glee , " it does n't mean we want giant choirs with all our punk rock songs .
Then again , we appreciate the fact that there was no Elton John .
Cheers .
5:13 p.m. SONG OF THE YEAR : Beyoncé 's " Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) . "
This gives Beyoncé five total awards .
5:12 p.m. Stephen Colbert gave a pretty sharp opening monologue , joking that the music biz was saved by a " 48 - year - old Scottish cat lady with sensible shoes , " alluding to Susan Boyle .
Will she be at the Grammys in 2011 ?
Let us hope not .
5:06 p.m. Gaga started pretty electric , her " Poker Face " getting a slight reworking for the big stage .
The Broadway ( or maybe Vegas ? ) production had her kidnapped onstage , and materializing with Elton John .
And the two traded off on " Speechless " and Elton 's " Your Song . "
It showed off Gaga 's vocal chops , but it was another over - the - top Grammy attempt to connect a legend with a current artist .
If Grammy producers had wanted to do something truly inspired , they would have put Gaga onstage with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs , and drawn the connection between the mainstream and the underground .
There 's 109 categories .
The Grammys should use them all when plotting their performances .
5:04 p.m .
You know it 's winter when Elton John migrates west for award season .
5:01 p.m. Lady Gaga , in a glittery butterfly outfit , starts with " Poker Face " -- the first few notes a bit theatrical .
A tease to the Elton John pairing happening in moments .
Gaga is opening the medley with an oldie , but it 's the song that put her on the map .
4:59 p.m .
We are live !
Stay tuned .
Pre - show blogging below :
4:01 p.m. Pop vocal album : The Black Eyed Peas ' " The E.N.D . "
With the win , the pre-tel comes to an end .
Beyoncé will head into the telecast with four Grammys , Lady Gaga has two and Taylor Swift also has two .
Only nine categories will be given out on the air , as the Grammys will again go with a performance - heavy telecast , including a 3 - D tribute to Michael Jackson .
The awards will open with Lady Gaga .
Some of the major pre-tel winners include Eminem 's " Relapse " for best rap album , Beyoncé 's " I Am ... Sasha Fierce " for best contemporary R&B album and Phoenix 's " Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix " for best alternative album .
The band 's " 1901 " has been inescapable of late , having been featured in a car commercial , but it also likely raised the band 's profile for Grammy voters .
Pop &
Hiss will take a slight break , and be back at 5 p.m. for the start of the show .
Stay tuned to this post .
3:57 p.m. Kings of Leon has quickly tallied two wins for its cellphone - in - the - air ballad " Use Somebody " -- best rock performance of a duo or group with vocals and best rock song .
The latter bested titles from U2 and Pearl Jam .
Kings of Leon lost best rock album in 2009 to Coldplay .
3:55 p.m. Bruce Springsteen 's " Working on a Dream " wins best solo rock vocal performance .
The win means
Young misses his chance to move ahead of Britney Spears in the Grammy win total , and has to hold at one .
3:49 p.m .
Best alternative music album : Phoenix wins for " Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix . "
Well deserved for the Parisians .
Two of the alt album contenders -- Phoenix and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs ' " It 's Blitz ! " were titles that should have been legit album of the year contenders .
Of late , Grammy voters have been using the " alternative " term as a catch - all for more adventurous rock .
3:38 p.m . Is Beyoncé in line for a sweep of the major categories ?
Her " I Am ... Sasha Fierce " wins best contemporary R&B album .
Note that best country album was not given out in the pre-tel , so Swift still has some potentially big awards on the horizon .
Swift versus Beyoncé :
This is what passes for tension at the 2010 Grammy Awards .
3:36 p.m. Maxwell 's " Blacksummers ' Night " wins best R&B album .
3:34 p.m. Beyoncé 's " Single Ladies " takes best R&B song , besting Maxwell 's " Pretty Wings . "
The two will face off in song of the year tonight .
3:32 p.m. Beyoncé has now tied Swift and Lady Gaga with two awards .
Her " At Last " won best traditional R&B vocal performance .
3:29 p.m .
The pre-tel is flying through the genre categories .
Beyoncé gets her first award .
She 's up for 10 .
Her " Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) " took best female R&B vocal solo , and Maxwell won for best male R&B vocal solo for " Pretty Wings . "
This is Maxwell 's first Grammy win .
3:27 p.m .
And the popularity contest begins .
Eminem 's " Relapse " wins best rap album , besting titles from Mos Def and Q - Tip .
3:24 p.m. Jay - Z's " D.O.A. ( Death of Auto - Tune ) " wins best rap solo performance .
One of the weaker tracks on " The Blueprint 3 , " this award should have gone to the psychedelic rap of Kid Cudi .
3:22 p.m. Ramblin ' Jack Elliott wins best traditional blues album for " A Stranger Here , " released on Silver Lake 's Anti- Records .
" I do n't know what they 're anti , but I 'm for it . "
3:14 p.m.Charlie Wilson -- " Uncle Charlie " -- performs a few seconds of his recent " There Goes My Baby , " later offers what will likely be the best mid-song ad - libs one hears on this Grammy Day , telling the crowd he was addicted to crack for 25 years and beat prostate cancer .
" How do I look ? " he then repeatedly shouts .
3:09 p.m. Recording Academy chief Neil Portnow takes the stage .
The Neil Young benefit on Friday night " raised more than $ 4 million . "
3:08 p..m. Team Beyoncé , the R&B awards are coming up in an estimated 15 minutes or so .
3:01 p.m .
Prefer red carpet coverage to what we 're doing here ?
Head over to sister blog Ministry of Gossip , which has observations and interviews from outside Staples Center .
" I 'm so excited to be here but also overwhelmed , " alt - country hero Neko Case told the Ministry .
" I 'm so country mouse !
I 'm pretty excited by the outfits too .
There are some amazing looking ladies . "
2:57 p.m. Coming up soon in the pre-tel will be a performance from Beast , which is nominated for best short form music video for " Mr. Hurricane . "
Come on , Grammy , if there 's time for yet another award show performance from Jamie Foxx tonight , you can put Beast on CBS .
2:50 p.m. The Grammy Awards are n't worth breaking some appointments for .
In accepting the best bluegrass album trophy for Steve Martin , his producer , John McEuen , noted that the comedian - banjo player wanted to keep " his massage appointment . "
2:47 p.m. Swift 's " White Horse " wins best country song .
She accepts with her co-writer Liz Rose .
" We just won a Grammy , " Swift said to her partner , adding , " She started writing songs with me when she had absolutely no reason to do so .
I did n't have a record label .
I did n't have anything to offer her . "
2:45 p.m. Swift wins her second Grammy .
2:42 p.m. " I live in awe of the people I was nominated against in this category , " Swift said as she accepted her trophy for best female country vocal solo .
Her " White Horse " beat out Miranda Lambert 's " Dead Flowers " and Carrie Underwood 's " Just a Dream , " among others .
While Miranda is certainly a better pure singer than Taylor , give Swift credit for sticking around in the pre-tel to hear her categories , opting to forgo a few extra minutes on the red carpet .
2:40 p.m. Taylor Swift wins her first Grammy .
2:39 p.m .
Best contemporary folk album : Steve Earle 's " Townes . "
2:35 p.m. Levon Helms ' " Electric Dirt " wins best Americana album , besting titles from Bob Dylan and Wilco .
The latter 's " Wilco ( The Album ) " did n't really fit in this category , but that 's a quirk of having 109 categories .
Here 's a fun fact :
Wilco did not submit its title for album of the year contention .
2:29 p.m .
Here 's a long overdue award .
One of the trophies given out in the pre-tel was best boxed or special limited edition package .
This hotly contested little nugget of an award went to Neil Young for his " Neil Young Archives Vol. I ( 1963-1972 ) . "
It brings Young 's Grammy total to one .
He is now tied with Britney Spears .
2:24 p.m. Speaking of Gaga , word , according to E !
Online , is she 'll be opening the Grammy telecast tonight , performing with Sir Elton John .
The pianist , of course , famously performed with Eminem at the Grammys in 2001 , but there are fewer social undertones to this pairing , and more a meeting of theatrical minds .
This likely means our hope here at the P&H HQ of seeing Gaga and Kanye West perform will go unrealized .
2:21 p.m. Lady Gaga wins her second award .
She has a total of five nominations tonight .
Her debut , " The Fame , " won best dance / electronic album , but do n't necessarily think this means she 's in line for a top album of the year nod tonight .
It was expected that Gaga would take the dance fields .
She , of course , was n't in the pre-tel to accept the award , as most of the major artists are either on the red carpet , or plotting their late arrival .
2:20 p.m. Lady Gaga wins her first award , with " Poker Face " taking best dance recording .
She beat out her fellow album of the year nominees the Black Eyed Peas .
2:16 p.m .
We 're coming up on Taylor Swift territory .
First country awards to be given out within the next 20 to 30 minutes .
Swift has eight nominations , second only to Beyoncé 's 10 .
1:58 p.m .
To backtrack a little bit , the Grammys had technical difficulties when the first few awards were handed out , meaning we missed the film awards .
" Slumdog Millionaire , " a blast from last year 's award season , unsurprisingly , won best compilation soundtrack album .
In the best score field , composer Michael Giacchino had two noms -- " Up " and " Star Trek " -- and won for the right film .
His score for " Up " is a lovely , jazzy addition to the film , encompassing a lifetime of adventure and heartache with understatement and grace .
1:55 p.m. Béla
Fleck wins best contemporary world music album for " Throw Down Your Heart : Tales From the Acoustic Planet , Vol. 3 -- Africa Sessions , " beating out Amadou & Mariam 's " Welcome to Mali . "
1:46 p.m. Los Tigres del Norte win best norteño album .
The pre-tel is in the midst of the Latin and world categories .
Pop & Hiss has already covered the Latin Grammys here , but the Recording Academy has n't shown much desire to trim its 109 categories .
On to best Hawaiian music album , won by " Masters of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar , Volume 2 . "
1:38 p.m. Buck Howdy , accepting his best spoken word album for children , noted that it cost less to produce his album than it did to valet his car at the Grammy nominee dinner .
1:34 p.m. Grammy.com has a fun little widget and we 're going to see how it looks embedded in this blog .
Below is something the Grammy site is calling a " fanbuzz visualizer , " which is supposed to tell us which artists are generating the most discussion on social network sites .
Take a look :
1:31 p.m .
Thanks for the comment , Rebecca .
She 's not too pleased with the topics discussed by the Grammy.com red carpet reporters .
Rebecca writes , " Well that was a massive fail .
I hoped to actually have my kids watch their dad win / lose and instead they got to listen to numb - nuts talking about peeing next to famous people .
Aaargh . "
1:25 p..m. Producer / DJ David Guetta wins his first award of the night for best remixed recording , non-classical .
He 's up for five tonight , including record of the year with the Black Eyed Peas for " I Gotta Feeling . "
He gives a brief non-scripted speech , one that champions the dance community .
" Finally , the DJ culture , and the dance culture , is growing in America ...
I 'm not a real musician trained , and I cannot write music , but I first started to remix and then create my own music . "
1:22 p.m .
We 're back in the pre-tel , picking up with best engineered album , non-classical .
Former best new artist nominee Imogen Heap won this for her " Ellipse . "
She appears to be wearing part of a drum kit around her neck .
1:13 p.m. " We lost the pre-tel tape . "
That 's what we 're overhearing on the Grammy.com broadcast right now , as the cameras are affixed on the red carpet .
This is actually more fascinating , as we 're getting a full live broadcast , including off - camera asides , and glimpses of red carpet journalists trying to improvise their way through awkward interviews .
Right now , for instance , the Grammy.com reporters are discussing which artists they have " peed " next to .
Cuz that 's what the kids talk about ?

As the dust settles on the publicity storm triggered by the Dubai assassination of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh , a deep feeling of disappointment has descended on the Israeli - Palestinian peace camp .
What started as an important public discourse with a potential for real change eventually missed the essential point of the affair .
The international debate over the assassination of Hamas member al - Mabhouh , allegedly carried out by the Mossad , concentrated more on the illegal use of foreign passports than on the illegal taking of a human life .
Most critics of the operation seem to ignore the fact that sending trained assassins to a foreign country to strangle a man in his bed is not just a diplomatic incident or a violation of international law , it 's cold - blooded murder .
Has the world become accustomed to Israel 's violations of human rights to the point of acceptance ?
Extrajudicial killing of unwanted rivals is a " tool " frequently used by Israel , both in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and abroad .
Strangled in their beds , bombed from the air , ambushed in their cars or shot down by snipers , hundreds of " unwanted " Palestinians have died at the hands of the IDF and the secret service , leaving a long trail of blood and grief .
Beyond the targets themselves , hundreds of innocent bystanders have died in these operations .
The typical profile of the assassination target varies from active terrorist to political leader .
The typical profile of the innocent bystander is not an issue for the Israeli security services .
Israel , which frequently accuses its enemies of leading a culture of killing , is a dedicated follower of this fashion .
Security officials would have us believe that these killings have actually saved the lives of hundreds of Israelis by preventing terrorist attacks .
This argument ignores the aftershock of vengeance that inevitably follows each of these operations , costing many more lives .
A critical analysis of this policy shows that in the long run these operations have contributed nothing at all to Israel 's security .
The broader picture is that 42 years of living under Israeli occupation has created no shortage of Palestinian men and women willing to kill and die for their people 's independence .
For every fighter killed two are born .
Strategically speaking , these assassinations are futile at best .
Beyond the tactical and strategic side of this practice lies a darker reality .
By killing their leaders , Israel is sending a clear message of rejection and contempt to the Palestinians .
Israel is saying , and has been saying for decades : we do not negotiate .
Israel 's assassination policy should be understood as a complement to its politics ; its refusal to arrive at a compromise with its neighbours is the real story behind the extrajudicial killings .
Binyamin Netanyahu , the Israeli prime minister who allegedly authorised the Dubai assassination , was also responsible for another Mossad fiasco .
In 1997 he ordered the assassination of the Hamas operative Khaled Mashaal in Jordan .
The operation failed .
Today Mashaal is head of the Hamas politburo and , according to some , a pragmatist .
There 's a lesson to be learned from this : yesterday 's terrorist may be tomorrow 's political partner .
Perhaps the most effective way to deal with Hamas is to bargain with its leaders rather than to assassinate them .
If the barbaric culture of killing is abandoned and replaced with a truthful attempt to reach an agreement with our neighbours , perhaps today 's threats can become tomorrow 's hopes .

PRAHA
Jaké jsou doopravdy produkty ze dna nabídky tuzemských supermarketů ?
Jak velkou chybu můžete udělat , když při nákupu sáhnete vedle ?
Jaká je daň za nízkou cenu ?
Média i veřejnost dnes věnují tolik pozornosti složení , původu a ceně potravin , že se téměř vytratil rozhodující aspekt jídla – chuť .
Rozhodli jsme se proto prozkoumat , jak jsou na tom levné výrobky nejen s ohledem na zdraví konzumentů , ale i na jejich chuťové buňky .
V supermarketech jsme si nejprve vytipovali potraviny , jejichž výrobci obvykle chemikáliemi nešetří .
S pomocí odborníka na výživu a potraviná řského technologa Víta Syrového jsme pak vybrali desítku těch , které svým složením hřeší nejvíce , a gastronomická novinářka Hana Michopulu je poté ohodnotila po chuťové stránce .
Každá potravina od nás také získala bodové vysvědčení za množství škodlivých chemikálií ve složení .
Všechna " éčka " jsme ohodnotili jedním až pěti body podle škodlivosti a výsledek sečetli .
Nejlepší by tedy byla čerstvá plnohodnotná surovina s 0 body , nejhorší naopak takový průmyslový výrobek , jenž obsahuje nejvíce nevhodných aditiv , a získá tak nejvíce bodů .
K určení škodlivosti jednotlivých látek posloužil přehled vypracovaný v knize Tajemství výrobců potravin .
Salát z chemické laboratoře
( Hermelínový salát , výrobce : Lahůdky Cajthaml. 47 trestných bodů )
" Pokud si někdo skutečně přečte celé složení , které je uvedeno na obalu , zřejm ě ho přejde chuť .
Skoro až komické je , že hermelín je ve složení téměř na samém konci .
Před ním nalezneme uvedenu neuvěřitelnou snůšku všemožných chemikálií , jako jsou konzervanty , stabilizátory a další z éček , " popisuje složení salátu pan Syrový .
Použité suroviny přitom mají být podle zákona uváděny v sestupném pořadí , na prvním místě by tedy měla být nejvíce zastoupená složka , na posledním naopak ta nejméně .
Množství aditiv je až zarážející a tomu odpovídá i bodový zisk .
" Je to adept na výrobek s nejvyšší mírou chemického znečištění způsobeného nemírným užíváním aditiv , " prohlašuje Vít Syrový .
Výrobce přitom dokazuje , že vybrané přísady nezvolil náhodou a chuť zdaleka neodpovídá hrozivému složení .
" Ta konzistence je u salátu dost zvláštní a podezřelá , protože se drobí .
Chuť a vůně hermelínu mi ovšem připadá v pořádku .
Je to ale dost kyselé na to , abychom mohli cítit jakékoliv další chutě , " popisuje svůj dojem Hanka Michopulu .
" Točená " limonáda v plastové lahvi ( Točená limonáda s malinovou příchutí , výrobce : ZON. 41 trestných bodů )
" Jako potravinářsk ý technolog nechápu , proč do červené limonády přidali tři rozličná umělá barviva , mimo jiné i žluté a modré .
Že by pokus o trikoloru ? " pozastavuje se nad způsobem výroby Syrový a ani z ostatních složek nápoje není nadšený .
" Tato v uvozovkách točená limonáda má ve složení čtyři umělá sladidla : kromě aspartamu a acesulfamu i sacharin a cyklamát ; o posledním z nich byly již před lety zveřejněny odborné studie dokazující poškozování zdraví .
Konkrétně byly cyklamáty spojovány s rakovinou močového měchýře , " upozorňuje .
I zde ovšem platí , že kdo hledá chuť tradiční červené limonády , vyloženou chybu neudělá .
" Chutná podobně jako klasická červená limonáda mého dětství .
V tomto případě jsem sentimentální , ale možná právě proto mi vadí nesmyslně velké množství cukru , které vládne celé chuti a slepuje pusu , " shrnuje Michopulu .
Jedovaté špekáčky
( Špekáčky výběrové , výrobce : Jan Prantl – Masný průmysl Žirovnice , 35 bodů )
" Ukázka typické uzeniny , na kterou by měla platit hamburgerová daň , " konstatuje Syrový .
Tato daň má být zavedena na nezdravé potraviny s vysokým obsahem tuků , solí , cukrů a aditiv .
Ty totiž výrazně zvyšují rizika civilizačních onemocnění , které pak zat ěžují státní rozpočet .
Daň má přinést více peněz do zdravotnictví a zrazovat lidi od nákupu nezdravých potravin .
" Kromě témě ř polovičního obsahu tuku , zřejm ě ze zbytkového vepřového masa , sádla a kůže , obsahuje dost rizikových přídatných látek .
Mimo to skrývá toxické dusitany mezi stabilizátory , což je matoucí .
Dusitany jsou ve sbírce zákonů řazeny mezi konzervanty .
Až tragikomická je užitá trojkombinace fosfátů : difosforečnany , trifosforečnany a polyfosforečnany , " říká Vít Syrový .
V tomto případě už je navíc umělá podstata výrobku na chuti znát .
" Cítím chuť uzení , soli a tuku .
Jinak nic .
Ty špekáčky nejsou odporné , spíš chuťově úplně prázdné .
I v tom je ostatně důvod , proč lidé tyto výrobky vůbec kupují , " míní gastronomická novinářka .
Sladká buchta podle pejska a kočičky
( MARMOR , výrobce : Kuchenmeister . 33 bodů )
" Dlouh ý soupis přídatných látek , uváděných pod chemick ými názvy , trochu připomíná pohádku o tom , jak pejsek s kočičkou pekli dort .
Avšak s tím rozdílem , že zvířata by si do laskomin nikdy nepřidala různé chemikálie , takové nesmysly dělají jen lidé , " říká Vít Syrový a pozastavuje se i nad tím , že odhalit složení vyžaduje dlouhé minuty hledání a brýle .
Není ale třeba studovat složení aby bylo jasné , že základní suroviny zde prakticky chybí .
" Je to strašlivě sladké , není cítit nic než cukr .
Nedrží vůbec pohromadě , plátek se rozpadá pod rukama .
Čokoláda je ošizená , je to jen hnědé .
Taková hnědáda , " komentuje buchtu Hanka Michopulu a přidává i vlastní zážitek .
" Moje děti byly kdysi alergické na žloutky .
Ukázalo se ale , že to není až takový problém , protože v českých cukrovinkách se s vejci zas tak často nepočítá .
Jak to drží pohromadě , bůh ví. Zato když jsme přijeli do Francie , každ ý druhý obal od sušenek měl na sobě napsáno : mouka , máslo , vejce , mléko .
V Česku by to byla rarita .
Průmyslově se tu peče ze surovin , jaké by slušný člověk ani nevyndal na kuchy ňskou linku . "
Přeslazené slané chipsy
( BERSI Snack , výrobce : ZP Šumvald. 31 bodů )
" Je až neuvěřitelné , kolik chemikálií do těchto snack ů přidali , aby navodili dojem , že obsahují čabajku .
Zjevně chtěli , aby to nějak chutnalo ; nešetřili proto přídatnými látkami .
Neopomněli ani tři barviva .
Také je zajímavé , že do takového výrobku přidali tři různé druhy cukrů , " zkoumá složení zjevně barvených křupek Syrový .
Ten , kdo má tento druh potravin rád , však při odhlédnutí od složení zřejmě bude spokojen .
" Vypadají hůř než chutnají .
Na pohled jsou takové jedovaté , ale ochutnala jsem už mnohem horší a umělejší varianty tohoto občerstvení , " hodnotí Hana Michopulu .
Gothajský salám bez gothaje a salámu
( Gothajský salám , výrobce : Procházka . 26 bodů )
" Další ukázka běžné uzeniny , na kterou by se měla vztahovat hamburgerová daň .
Kromě vysokého obsahu skrytého tuku obsahuje též nemálo ze škodlivých přídatných látek .
Nejhorší z nich jsou toxické dusitany E250 , na něž by měly dávat pozor hlavně těhotné a kojící ženy .
Stejně tak by se mělo zamezovat jejich zbytečnému příjmu u dětí .
Pokud někoho zaujme gumovitá konzistence salámu , který se po stlačení rychle vrací do původního tvaru , tak to způsobuje hlavně přidaná guma guar , " vysvětluje Syrový .
Ani plejáda chemikálií a guma však chuť nezachrání .
" Tohle je vážně špatné .
Necítím absolutně žádnou jedlou vůni ani chuť , kromě pachu fólie .
Když vezmu jedno kolečko mezi prsty , celé se rozdrobí a rozláme .
Tohle není gothaj , převaha cizorodých surovin je taková , že už se tomu ani nepodobá .
A není to ani žádný jiný salám , " kroutí hlavou Michopulu .
Trochu příliš " taven ý " sýr
( MIX tavený sýr , výrobce : TANY . 15 bodů )
" Zřejm ě chtěli ud ělat čest názvu tavený sýr a proto užili čtyři druhy tavicích solí .
Tři z nich se řadí mezi fosfáty , jejichž nadměrný příjem může mimo jiné způsobovat zhoršené vstřebávání nepostradatelných minerálů , jako je vápník .
Kromě toho jde o typický příklad nedostatečně označeného výrobku .
Ve složení není uvedeno , co obsahuje v něm přítomná šunka .
To lze posuzovat až jako klamání zákazníka dle zákona o ochraně spotřebitele , " upozorňuje Vít Syrový .
Přitom právě tento výrobek jako jeden z mála obsahuje správné suroviny , což je na chuti znát .
" Chuť je v pořádku .
Jsou tam základní suroviny a ne náhražky .
Řekla bych dobrý český taveňák .
Příchutě už jsou slabší – pažitka je sušená až příliš a šunková varianta vysloveně slabá , hodně sladká a drobivá , " říká Michopulu .
Přebarvená hořčice
( Hořčice speciální orientální , výrobce : ALBA plus. 10 bodů )
" Typick ý příklad výrobku , u něhož se snaží navodit dojem lepší kvality .
Pokud by neobsahovala dvě umělá barviva , bylo by zřejmě její zbarvení dost fádní , " říká pan Syrový a odhaduje , že s hořčičným semínkem se nejspíš šetřilo .
" Kromě zbytečného zat ěžování organismu chemick ými látkami nebude hořčice působit tak , jak má .
Hlavní přínos má hořčičné semínko působící na prokrvení zažívacího traktu , což podporuje trávení , " dodává .
U většiny lidí by nicméně nejspíš chuťově obstála .
" Je hodně kyselá , což signalizuje potřebu zakrýt chuťové nedostatky .
Zajímalo by mě , co je to orientální koření a kdo přišel na ten divný nápad přidávat ho do klasické české hořčice .
Vzato kolem a kolem , nevybočuje z průměru , " shrnuje Michopulu .
Tajemné pivo pro diabetiky ( Ambrosius Free , výrobce : Pivovar Holba. 8 bodů )
" Je v něm cítit něco navíc , co tam nepatří .
Má podivnou pachuť , " přemýšlí Hanka Michopulu a složení jí dává za pravdu .
" Tomu , kdo považuje pivo za přírodní produkt , by po přečtení údajů o složení asi vstávaly vlasy hrůzou na hlavě .
Otázkou je , co si představit pod pojmy , upravený chmel ‘ a , chmelový extrakt ‘ .
Něco z chmelu to asi obsahovat bude , ale kdo ví co .
Z dále uváděných látek je šokující náhradní sladidlo .
Že by bylo toto pivo určeno jen pro diabetiky ?
Barvivo a kyselina již jen doplňují celkový nepříznivý dojem , " rozebírá složení nealkoholického piva Syrový .
Borůvkový jogurt s příchutí řepy
( Nízkotučn ý jogurt borůvka , výrobce : Yoplait Czech . 8 bodů )
" Jelikož umělá sladidla jsou určena pro diabetiky , je nepochopitelné , proč jsou přidávána do běžného , byť nízkokalorického mléčného výrobku .
Ve složení jsou uváděna dvě : aspartam a acesulfam K . O jejich možných nepříznivých účincích se můžeme dočíst leckde a je zcela zbytečné zatěžovat jimi organismus , " popisuje Syrový .
Vedle malého obsahu borůvek je jogurt prakticky bez příchuti .
" Cítím nepříjemnou chuť um ělého sladidla , ale kdybyste mi dali hádat poslepu , borůvkovou příchuť bych tedy netipovala ani náhodou .
Ne , není cítit po borůvkách , opravdu ne , " říká Michopulu a v chuti nachází spíš stopy řepy .
Jak se ukázalo , největším " podvodem " na zákazníkovi bývá právě chuť , kterou si na rozdíl od složení na obalu nepřečtete .
A to buď její naprostá absence , nebo její přítomnost , která však nemá se skutečnými přísadami nic společného a jen zastírá nulovou kvalitu .
" Největší problém předložených potravin není špatná chuť , ale její celkový nedostatek .
Podíl pověstných výplňových surovin je už takový , že ohrožují či vytlačují původní chuť výrobků .
Která éčka škodí ?

Imagine what being Google must be like .
Since the start of the year , the company has roiled up world affairs with its decision to stop censoring Chinese search results , got the NSA to help it out with security , launched a new social media service called Buzz , and dropped a bombshell on the US by announcing a new 1 G bps fiber - to - the - home testbed that will serve up to 500,000 people .
Crazy stuff , right ?
And it all happened in the last six weeks .
But zoom in a bit closer and look at what Google had to deal with just this week and on just one topic : censorship .
Australia
Communications Minister Stephen Conroy , the man currently pushing the nation into a broad Internet filtering scheme that would be run by ISPs , gave an interview this week to the TV show Hungry Beast ( Aussie readers can watch the segment online ) .
In it , he said that the ISP filtering solution was unworkable for big sites like YouTube , since the goal would be to block only particular videos .
This requires precise URL matching , not just a blanket block on YouTube traffic , and it's hard to make this work at scale for a site like YouTube without unacceptable slowdowns .
So Conroy had a brilliant solution : get Google to do the filtering for him .
" What we 're saying is , well in Australia , these are our laws and we'd like you to apply our laws , " Conroy said .
He added , " Google at the moment filters an enormous amount of material on behalf of the Chinese government ; they filter an enormous amount of material on behalf of the Thai government . "
This could basically have come out of the mouth of a Chinese official , and it plays right into the idea that differences in censorship between countries are merely acceptable differences of local law ( which is the claim that China has made , repeatedly , in recent weeks , to justify its widespread Internet surveillance and firewall system ) .
On the other hand , Conroy has a point ; Google does take on the filtering of locally objectionable content in some jurisdictions , though the China example was a pretty poor choice given that Google has recently kicked up a huge fuss about precisely this kind of censorship .
What Conroy wants is for YouTube to voluntarily censor all material on its site that is " Refused Classification " by the Australian ratings board , a government agency .
Google has refused to do this voluntarily , saying that RC material is simply too broad in scope .
Pakistan
If there 's one thing YouTube has taught us , it 's that when people can upload their own content , they will upload inflammatory videos about political leaders ... and those leaders will then try to block YouTube .
We saw it back in 2007 in Thailand , where the archaic rule against lèse majesté led to a wholesale block against YouTube .
This week , the problem country was Pakistan , where someone uploaded a video of President Zardari at a political rally .
In the clip , Zardari gets irritated at some people near the stage and yells at them in English to " shut up ! "
After the clip ( and assorted remixes became popular ) , YouTube was blocked for a short time , and then the block was changed to filter out only the offending clips .
It 's not clear who was behind the move , but the videos remain up on YouTube and can easily be viewed outside of Pakistan .
An ABC news correspondent living in Islamabad checked with his ISP .
" One official said he was under the impression all had been fixed — and insisted nobody from his side was specifically restricting embarrassing videos of the democratically elected president .
' It must be some restriction from government side , ' he said , confirming that the videos had been restricted .
He laughed and joked , ' Zardari might be blocking it himself ! ' "
Iran
But it 's not just YouTube that makes leaders nervous .
Iran 's government , facing major internal unrest over its recent election results and resulting brutality , Iran simply blocked Gmail altogether .
Instead , according to the Wall Street Journal , the regime will roll out its own e-mail service soon .
" An Iranian official said the move was meant to boost local development of Internet technology and to build trust between people and the government , " said the paper .
And really , what could build more trust between a government and those who fear it than making it far simpler for that government to monitor e-mail ?
The move came one day before the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution , and Google reports that it has already seen big drops in traffic to Gmail from Iran .
One Iranian - American blog notes that , after last year 's election unrest , " the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) purchased a controlling stake in the Iranian telecom company , giving them wide latitude to monitor and disrupt communication throughout the country .
It is no surprise that Gmail is being targeted — given Google ’s recent actions regarding government censorship in China , as well as the fact that Gmail has widely been regarded as one of the more secure email services available to the public .
Iranian human rights defenders and activists among the One Million Signatures women 's rights campaign often encourage each other to utilize Gmail , instead of Yahoo or other email services , due to the level of security it offers . "
While Google remains a technology company , the events of this week drive home an important point : the company is a powerful worldwide political force .
Its services are major targets for government censorship , and its pronouncements can kickstart international rows .
It may not be long before Google moves beyond the need for lobbyists and starts hiring diplomats ; it 's not a country , but Google is close to needing an internal " State Department " of its own .
Chiaki Kuriyama , best known for her role as Gogo Yubari in Kill Bill and Takako Chigusa in Battle Royale is appearing in ads for a disc - based download movie rental service for the PS3 .

In this latest ad , Kuriyama shows how to use disc - based retail service for entertainment company DMM.com .
Kuriyama has previously stated that because she is predominately a film actress , that she is not as famous in Japan — the biggest celebrities in Japan appear on variety shows or TV dramas .
Appearing in television ads is one way Kuriyama can stay in the public eye between film projects .
Kuriyama is a gamer herself .
Back when I interviewed her for my book on Japanese schoolgirls , Kuriyama told me she liked The Legend of Zelda , role - playing games , puzzle games and Gyakuten Saiban ( Ace Attorney ) .
The Catholic Church is in serious trouble and may have nowhere to run , depending on who you ask .
“ I warned them about all of this , ” declared author Christopher Hitchens , appearing on HBO ’s Real Time with Bill Maher on Friday night .
“ Nothing good can come of a church that has as its ’ slogan , ‘ Leave no child ’s behind . ’
And then they went and chose as pope the man who was personally responsible , in his dioceses , and institutionally responsible for the cover - up .
So now , there ’s no escape . ”

The child rape scandals that have savaged Catholic ranks for years starting in the United States , then flaring up in Ireland , Germany , Italy and other locations around the world , have finally come to implicate Pope Benedict XVI , according to recent reports .
At time of this writing , the most recent scandal flare - up involved a school for the deaf in Wisconsin , where up to 200 boys were molested by a man whom Hitchens said “ was allowed to walk free and was buried with full honors as a priest . ”
Even with his role in covering - up child molestations at his former dioceses in Munich , Pope Benedict offered an apology for the sexual abuse so rampant in the church , but did not call for any law enforcement action .
Hitchens called the pope ’s apology a request for “ wiggle room ” on the “ rape and torture of children . ”
“ It ’s funny because in this society …
Even in prisons , there is a hierarchy of crimes , ” said Maher .
“ The child molesters are the ones who even hardened criminals shun , or actually kill . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ This is the one crime no one can think about without vomiting , that the once great , moral church wants wiggle room for , ” Hitchens summarized .
“ This present pope is the head of a state , a political state , as well as the church .
So , it ’s not just that the spiritual leader of a big cult is a proven protector of child molesters , but the head of a government is , with - has an embassy in Washington .
Well , can he land here from now on ?
Should n’t Congress become seized with the matter ?
Should n’t the European Union be asking , ‘ Can this guy travel freely ? ’
Is n’t he wanted for the foulest crime of all ?
These are questions that , I promise you , are going to continue being asked . ”
This video was published to YouTube on March 26 , 2010 , as snipped from HBO by Mediaite .
In the final moments of a U.S. Senate race that was never expected to be close , Republican Scott Brown and Democrat Martha Coakley crisscrossed Massachusetts on Monday , a day before an election that could alter the fortunes of both major political parties .
At stake is the Democrats ’ filibuster - proof Senate majority , key to advancing President Obama ’s agenda .
For Republicans , the race offers a chance to demonstrate that the party has rebounded from its catastrophic losses in 2008 .
The race to replace the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy has become a national contest , with outside money and support pouring into the state and the candidates clashing over issues such as healthcare and national security .
Because the victor will be serving out Kennedy ’s term , he or she will need to run for reelection in 2012 .

Coakley , the state attorney general , has been transformed in a matter of weeks from heavy favorite to underdog .
She has responded with a furious wave of TV ads attacking Brown , a GOP state senator , and has been backed by Democratic luminaries such as Obama and President Clinton .
Her campaign aired a new TV ad Monday featuring Obama , who visited Boston on Sunday in an effort to spur Democratic turnout .
But new polls suggested that she faced an uphill battle and that Brown had seized the momentum with a relentless anti-Washington , anti-incumbent message .
Brown appeared in position to become the first Massachusetts Republican elected to the Senate in nearly 40 years , even though Democrats outnumber Republicans here 3 to 1 .
He has appealed to moderate Democrats and independents , pledging to block the congressional healthcare bill by providing Senate Republicans with the 41st vote needed to sustain a filibuster .
Democrats hold 58 seats , including Paul G. Kirk , who was appointed to fill Kennedy ’s seat temporarily .
Enlisting two independents , Democrats can muster the minimum 60 votes required to cut off debate .
Brown ’s election would destroy that dynamic .

Early Monday afternoon , Brown shook hands with supporters outside Boston ’s TD Banknorth Garden sports arena .
Kat Malone , 22 , of Charlestown , said she was voting for him because of the healthcare bill .
“ I think it ’s a bad thing for the country , ” she said .
“ I like to buy my health insurance .
I also do n’t want my taxes to go up . ”
Later in the day , hundreds of Coakley supporters filled a union hall in Dorchester , some working the phones to persuade voters to come out for their candidate .
Jugo Kapetanovich , 24 , a volunteer from Bethesda , Md. , said he spent the day knocking on doors .
“ I do n’t think a lot of people realized how close this race was , ” he said .
“ We ’re trying to make people aware of the urgency of the situation . ”
Snow and rain were forecast for election day , after an icy , wind - swept Monday .

Voter turnout , typically low in a special election , “ is going to be much higher than everybody thought , ” said Raymond La Raja , a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst .
But La Raja said that regardless of the result , “ the damage is done ” for Democrats .
“ Every Democrat in the country should be upset with Martha Coakley .
She ’s created challengers for all of them , challengers with money and a game plan . ”
In another election year , Coakley would have been unbeatable , with her law - and - order background and track record as a consumer advocate .
She crushed her opponent in the 2006 attorney general race with 73 % of the vote , and handily won the Senate Democratic primary late last year .
But this campaign , Brown capitalized on voters ’ discontent over the healthcare bill , government spending and the economy .

“ Massachusetts is hurting like everyplace else , ” said Jeffrey Berry , an expert on state politics at Tufts University .
“ He ’s run a terrific campaign .
He ’s made moderate voters look past his very conservative views .
He ’s very much in lock - step with national Republicans . ”
Many voters do n’t view Brown as a hard - line partisan .
Alycia Torres , 31 , of Boston , says he would bring “ independent thinking ” to the Senate .
“ Coakley ’s too locked into the party , ” she said .
But Brown is n’t shy about highlighting conservative positions .
In a recent debate , he said he favored waterboarding in some cases to extract information from suspected terrorists .
He opposed Obama ’s suggestion that large banks and insurance companies be taxed to recoup federal bailout funds .
He opposes same - sex marriage and supports limits on abortion rights , including waiting periods and parental notification .
He pledges to torpedo the healthcare bill , although he voted in favor of Massachusetts ’ healthcare initiative four years ago .

In speeches , however , Brown rarely evokes standard Republican themes or even refers to himself as a Republican .
“ He ’s done a smart job of not linking himself with the national party , ” La Raja said .
Coakley has attempted to make that link for him , to keep moderate Democrats in her camp .
“ He would n’t be as far ahead as he is if people were thinking with their heads and not with their guts , ” said Carol Hardy - Fanta , director of the nonpartisan Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts - Boston .

Gender may be another factor , she said .
The state elected its first African American governor , Deval Patrick , in 2006 , and gave Obama more than 60 % of the vote in 2008 .
Coakley would be Massachusetts ’ first female senator , but Hardy - Fanta senses a different public mood .
“ She has had to walk a very fine line .
She ’s not talking about making history , ” Hardy - Fanta said .
Brown , on the other hand , has aggressively pursued the male vote , frequently mentioning his pickup truck and campaigning with sports figures .
“ He ’s making points with people uncomfortable with women candidates , ” she said .

Still , Hardy - Fanta offered a sliver of hope for Coakley , noting that women often vote in greater numbers than men .
With turnout crucial , that could be enough , she said .

Cardinal Sean Brady said he was following bishops ' orders
The Catholic Church in Ireland has released more details about why Cardinal Sean Brady asked child abuse victims to sign secrecy agreements .
When he was a priest in 1975 the cardinal was at meetings where children signed vows of silence over complaints against serial abuser Fr Brendan Smyth .
The church said two boys were asked to sign oaths " to avoid potential collusion " in evidence gathering .
It added this would ensure that the complaints could " withstand challenge . "
The church statement does not explain why either Cardinal Brady or his superiors at the time did not share their information with the police .
Critics of the cardinal have accused him of colluding with clerical child sexual abuse and pressuring victims to remain silent .
Reports since the weekend suggested the two children in this case were a boy and a girl , but the church has now said it involved two boys .
The church statement said that in late March 1975 , the then Fr Sean Brady , who was a teacher , was asked by his bishop , Francis McKiernan , to conduct a canonical ( church ) inquiry into an allegation of abuse which was made by a boy in Dundalk , County Louth concerning Fr Smyth .
On 29 March 1975 , Fr Brady and two other priests interviewed a 14 - year - old boy in Dundalk .
Fr Brady 's role at that meeting was to take notes .
I am advised that the administering of an oath requiring these children not to disclose the abuse to anyone else may also have constituted an offence
Roisin Shortall , Irish Labour party
On 4 April 1975 , Fr Brady interviewed a second boy , who was 15 , in the Parochial House in Ballyjamesduff , County Cavan .
On that occasion Fr Brady conducted the interview by himself and took notes , the statement continued .
The church said that at the end of both interviews , the boys were " asked to confirm by oath the truthfulness of their statements and that they would preserve the confidentiality of the interview process . "
The statement said the intention of the confidentiality oath was " to avoid potential collusion in the gathering of the inquiry 's evidence " and to ensure that the process was " robust enough to withstand challenge by the perpetrator , Fr Brendan Smyth " .
The statement said that a week later Fr Brady passed his findings to Bishop McKiernan and in turn the bishop reported the findings to the local head of Fr Smyth 's religious order , the Norbertines .
Responsibility
The bishop withdrew Smyth 's right to practise as a priest and advised psychiatric intervention .
The church said at that stage " the specific responsibility for the supervision of Smyth 's activities " fell to his superiors in the Norbertines .
They conspicuously failed to supervise Smyth who went onto to abuse more children .
The church statement echoes comments made by Cardinal Brady .
He said he believed the victims , and in his limited role , did all he could to make sure Fr Smyth was stopped from working as a priest .
He said it was not fair to judge him by the child protection standards of today .
' Untenable '
He added that as a relatively junior cleric it was not his responsibility to report Smyth to the police and that he passed all relevant information to his superiors .
However , The Rape Crisis Network Ireland ( RCNI ) said his position had become untenable .
" Cardinal Brady is personally implicated in collusion with clerical child sexual abuse , " RCNI director Fiona Neary said .
" In recent public statements regarding clerical child abuse he did not make public his role in pressuring and bullying victims to remain silent .
He did not make public his own failures to disclosure a known abuser to civil authorities . "
" Sexual abuse that could have been prevented was not , and Brendan Smyth continued to abuse children . "
The opposition Irish Labour party has added to the pressure on Cardinal Brady calling for the police to investigate his role .
The party 's spokeswoman on social and family affairs , Roisin Shortall , said the cardinal was " hopelessly compromised by what had emerged " .
" I believe that there should be a Garda ( Irish police ) investigation to determine whether or not the failure to report Fr Smyth 's crimes to the civil authorities was , itself , a criminal offence , " she said .
" I am advised that the administering of an oath requiring these children not to disclose the abuse to anyone else may also have constituted an offence . "

Confiscated by U.S. Customs agents in Miami , a brightly painted , 3,000 - year - old sarcophagus was handed over to Egypt 's antiquities chief , Zahi Hawass , on Wednesday .

UNEDITED TRANSCRIPT
A stolen ancient Egyptian sarcophagus is returning home .
The sarcophagus , nearly 3,000 years - old was seized by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement , or I.C.E , during a routine shipments inspection at the Miami International Airport in 2008 Agents became suspicious when they noticed inconsistencies in the shipment ’s documentation .
Customs investigated the importer and the seller in Spain and concluded the sarcophagus was indeed stolen property .
An Egyptologist verified that the sarcophagus is an authentic Egyptian artifact .
With its elaborate hieroglyphs , the wooden coffin belonged to a prominent man named Imesy who lived during the 21st Dynasty of Egypt .
After the sarcophagus was seized , the United States and the Spanish art gallery that sold the artifact engaged in a legal battle over ownership .
Eventually the gallery abandoned its challenge and Egypt ’s ownership was ensured
ICE .
arranged a repatriation ceremony at National Geographic Society headquarters in Washington , DC to officially return the sarcophagus to its home country .
To prepare for its journey , agents thoroughly wrapped and boxed the delicate delivery for its departure from Miami .
Agents accompanied the sarcophagus to Washington and were greeted by staff from the National Geographic who were on hand to make sure the precious cargo arrived safe and sound .
The sarcophagus was carefully unpackaged and further inspected .
At the repatriation ceremony , representatives from the Egyptian and United States governments signed the official custody documents .
Dr. Zahi Hawass , Secretary General of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities and a National Geographic Explorer - In- Residence , accepted the sarcophagus on Egypt ’s behalf .
Once the sarcophagus safely returns home it will be put on display at the Global Egyptian Museum in Cairo in early April in an exhibition showcasing artifacts recovered in the last 8 years .
So far approximately 31,000 Egyptian artifacts have been repatriated yet the number of items that are still illegally distributed and owned is unknown .
The repatriation of the sarcophagus called attention to the ongoing struggle to protect ancient art and antiquities from the black market trade .
Egyptian artifacts are often smuggled because there is a high demand for them on the international market , and as a result countries such as Egypt have been robbed of their history and culture .
An article here in German from today is on the green light being given by the interior ministry for an expansion of the so - called " Sex tax " ( Sex - Steuer ) in North Rhine - Westphalia ( northwest Germany , next to Belgium ) where a number of cities have been taxing prostitution for a while now .
The argument for this resembles that made for marijuana - that regardless what one thinks of the practice itself , it 's not going anywhere so legalization and taxation is the best way to both regulate the practice ( improved safety for workers , removing a source of revenue for organized crime ) as well as raise tax revenues at the same time .
Some information from the article :
Köln ( Cologne ) made headlines in 2004 when it introduced a sex tax .
This brings in about 800,000 to one million euros a year , or $ 1 - $ 1.3 USD for a city with a population of almost a million .
Each prostitute in Köln pays a tax of 150 euros per month , and club owners pay three euros per ten square metres in their establishments .
Now the cities of Oberhausen , Dorsten , Gladbeck and Sprockhövel are applying to the interior ministry for taxes of their own , modeled after that used in Köln .
Dortmund is debating whether to enact a " toll " on prostitutes of one euro ( per day ? ) to use the streets , and 15 euros per working day to work as a prostitute .
The FDP ( the most libertarian party in Germany in terms of taxes and economic view ) is skeptical , calling it a Bagatellsteuer ( nuisance tax ) and stating that these taxes only make up 0.8 % of the budget , and thus not enough to be a " road to rehabilitation of municipal finances " .
According to them the total amount of tax money brought in last year nationwide through these " nuisance taxes " ( which includes other taxes like dog licenses and other areas where cities collect a fee ) was 590 million euros ( $ 790 million USD ) .
Whether enacting a tax like this in the US would be worth it or not depends on how difficult it would be to enact politically .
Of course , states are the ones that decide on the legality of prostitution and Nevada has some , but in terms of public support legalizing marijuana is a much easier sell to voters , and also much less tricky to enact given that it only involves buying and selling a crop .

Orrin Hatch ( R - UT ) worries that repealing the “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy which has been in place since the Clinton presidency will result in gay rights groups wanting “ special rights . ”
“ Special Rights . ”
We hear this term a lot .
For example , with regards to the issue of same - sex marriage .
“ That ’s special rights , ” we ’re told .
The argument has actually been advanced that since heterosexuals can’t marry people of the same sex that for homosexuals to demand that right is “ special rights . ”
They say , “ Well I ca n’t do it .
Why should he be able to ? ”
Somehow , in the theater of the absurd that is the bigoted mind , the fact that everybody can legally marry a person of the opposite sex makes the world of matrimony a level playing field .
The term special right is not new and it was not originally the battle cry of the Right - wing .
It was libertarians who first began using it to refer to laws giving rights to groups that other groups do n’t have .
Advertisements
Like being able to marry a person of the same sex .
Special rights are prohibited by the Constitution , which says everyone must be treated equally ( Constitution of the United States : Article 1 , Section 9 ) .
But how is everyone equal if some people are allowed to get married , and some are not ?
How is everyone equal if some people can join the military ( and openly express their sexuality ) and some cannot ?
How is everyone equal if some people have more rights than others ?
Obviously , they ’re not .
The whole “ special rights ” issue as expressed by the religious conservatives in this country is hypocritical .
Because what the religious conservatives have , and what they wish to maintain for themselves , is a privileged position sustained by the principle of special rights .
Granting what in actuality amounts to equal rights for others - a leveling of the playing field – erodes their position of privilege .
They believe homosexuality is evil , that it is a lifestyle choice , a deliberate turning away from God .
Therefore – whether the rest of us agree with them or not – we must abide by their understanding of the situation .
Gays must not be allowed to engage in what they falsely claim to be the religious institution of marriage ; they must not be allowed to openly flaunt their opposition to God by being publicly gay .
In an instant , all other God-choices are negated .
All that matters is what they think their god wants .
That anyone might believe in other gods or in no gods at all is irrelevant .
Their position is privileged .
Granting everybody the same rights – to serve in the military , to get married , to have the same rights before the law – these are not “ special rights ” but the very basic rights guaranteed to every individual in the United States – by law .
Historically , minorities – of all types – have not been well protected by the Constitution .
Sure , it ’s all there in black and white on paper , but in practice efforts to secure these rights have either not existed at all or have fallen short of the ideal .
Blacks were denied their rights – they were slaves and that ’s all they were good for .
When a bloody Civil War determined that they had the same rights as everybody else , they were still treated as second - class citizens until Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement of the 60’s – a full century after that Civil War – and it can rightly be argued that that imbalance still exists .
Another example is women ’s rights .
Women did not have the right to vote – universal suffrage – until progressive president Woodrow Wilson forced passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920 , an amendment that should , in theory , not have been necessary .
But the religious conservative position was that blacks were not equal .
The Bible defended the institution of slavery .
The Bible was used to deprive people of rights they were guaranteed to possess by the Constitution .
The Bible was used to deprive women of equal rights – women should be barefoot , pregnant , stay in the kitchen and not speak unless spoken to and they should certainly not be paid proportionate to men !
From any reasonable standpoint , the only case of special rights that is readily apparent is that of the WASP – the White Anglo - Saxon Protestant :
White male Christians ( Palin ’s “ real ” Americans ) .
And equal rights for all – in fact and not on paper only – will remove that last bastion of privilege enjoyed by these bigots .
The cry “ special rights for homosexuals ” is as evocative and powerful as it is false .
It is an appeal to fear based on a self - serving twisting of logic and fact , and is no different than the attempts to deprive other minority groups of their rights .
There is no exception clause in the Declaration of Independence or in the Constitution .
They do not say “ except for blacks . ”
They do not say , “ except for women . ”
They do not say , “ except for Christians . ”
And they do not say , “ except for gays and lesbians . ”
The essence of America has always been inclusion – not exclusion .
E Pluribus Unum :
Out of many , one .
Either everybody is equal or they are not .
But if they are not , then we had best pass a Constitutional Amendment saying the Constitution is no longer valid , and that ’s an absurd position , is n’t it ?
And in answer to John Boehner ( R - OH ) the House G.O.P. leader , who asked : “ In the middle of two wars and in the middle of this giant security threat , why would we want to get into this debate ? ”
I would say simply this :
“ Because virtue is never inconvenient . ”
That was essentially Admiral Mullen ’s answer , and it should serve equally well for all of us , who stand up for the principle espoused in our founding document :
“ We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . ”
No exceptions .

My daughter started watching The Big Bang Theory with my wife and me last fall , and she got hooked pretty quickly .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .

The show took far longer to reel me in , frankly , because when TBBT kicked off in fall 2007 , it seemed much more about poking fun at geeks rather than skewing its humor toward geeks .
That pendulum has swung significantly in the opposite direction over seasons two and three , though , so I recently brought home the season one DVDs from the library to see if the early adventures of Leonard Hofstadter , Sheldon Cooper and their neighbor Penny were as bad as I remembered .
They ’re not , really , although I ’m obviously watching them now through a fan ’s eyes .
Still , they make it easy to see just how much the show has evolved .
Consider some of the early gags , like Leonard emerging from his bedroom armed with a Force FX Lightsaber to investigate a middle - of - the - night noise .
Though I appreciate the shout out as a Star Wars fan , it ’s really an all - too - easy joke , and besides , as everybody knows , those things are expensive and breakable .
That same oft - mined - nerd - joke - territory feeling comes up all through the early episodes :
The guys and their friends Howard Wolowitz and Rajesh Koothrappali play Klingon Boggle ; they only talk to women on MySpace ; they visit Penny ’s ex-boyfriend and get sent home de-pantsed .
It all struck me as rehashed Revenge of the Nerds stuff , and that was already well - worn in the 1980s .
Now , contrast that with what we see in seasons two and three , and it ’s clear TBBT has totally aimed itself at a geek audience rather than making the easy jokes at their expense .

And the offhand references and minor plot points have also become much more geek - Easter - eggy , with nods to everything from Edwin Abbott Abbott ’s Flatland to a Pictionary representation of the phrase “ Higgs boson particle ” to a bet with The Flash # 23 and Fantastic Four # 48 at stake .
Penny ’s at the epicenter of the other pretty seismic shift in TBBT ‘s tone .
Even my daughter noticed right away while watching the DVDs that through the first four or five episodes of the series , it was seemingly not enough that Kaley Cuoco ’s bubbly blonde was n’t a geek .
She was portrayed as an airheaded idiot who talked in a squeaky Valley Girl voice .
( I ’m not the only one to notice this change , either . )
Fortunately , that persona – and , thankfully , that voice – disappeared pretty abruptly beginning with an episode in which she joins the guys for Halo 3 and utterly pwns Sheldon .
This marked the beginning of her growth as a character and really makes a huge difference in the show ’s chemistry .
Oh , and Bonus Points because TBBT has UCLA particle physicist David Saltzberg on board as a science consultant .
He takes care of things like making sure appropriately complex - appearing equations show up in the background , and he writes a little about some of the science in each episode at his own The Big Blog Theory .
Yes , the easy jokes still come around from time to time .
And being a sitcom , TBBT is still prone to circumstantial exaggerations that stretch credibility .
And yes , its writers will take a hit or two in some quarters for perpetuating stereotypes of brilliant social misfits .
But you know what ?
It ’s clear now that they get us .
One of the very nice things about fruit is that it will often ferment all on its own .
And a few animal species take advantage of this , deliberately seeking out fermented fruit with the objective of painting the jungle red and waking up in the natural equivalent of a ditch at the side of the road .
This works well if you happen to be fairly safe from predators , but not many animals have this luxury .
Fruit and nectar eating bats certainly do n't fall under the heading of " immune from predation , " so researchers wondered what happened to fruit bats that ate from the fermented fruit .
Considering body weight and the amount of energy required to keep a fruit bat going , the researchers figured that even the low alcohol content of fruit should still be enough to mean that a night 's feeding involved a substantial amount of imbibing .
To test the fruit bat 's alcohol tolerance , researchers from Canada gave two groups of bats , from a variety of different species , a sugar water drink .
One of the group 's drinks was spiked with 1.5 percent alcohol , and both groups were made to drink the same amount per gram of body weight .
After waiting a short time , the bats were then released , whereupon they flew through an obstacle course .
The researchers measured the time it took to get through the course and how often the bats collided with obstacles .
In addition , the echolocation calls were recorded to see if those varied .
The second part of the experiment was determining the bat 's blood alcohol concentration .
The bats , unfortunately , refused a breath test , and it seemed a bit cruel to take blood samples , so the researchers used saliva swabs 15 minutes after consumption .
This length of time allowed the excess alcohol in the mouth the wash out and the majority of the consumed alcohol to enter the blood stream .
The bat 's saliva indicated that they had a range of blood alcohol concentrations , with a substantial portion having concentrations in excess of 110 mg per 100 ml of blood — enough to make most people observably intoxicated .
Despite the alcohol , the bats maneuvered through the course with pretty much the same speed as the control group .
No bats collided with any obstacles and the echolocation calls had not changed .
Clearly , the bats were not drunk .
The researchers speculate that there may be a combination of factors at work here .
First of all , bats that do get drunk and run into stuff are likely to get eaten , so there is an advantage to being resistant to intoxication .
However , there are three possible routes for this resistance to appear : fruit bats recognize the smell of fermented fruit and only partake of the fruit that is not yet too far gone ; fruit bats are able to process alcohol effectively and quickly ; and what we call the W.C.
Fields effect : fruit bats build up a tolerance over a lifetime of hard drinking .
The researchers point out that the first option reduces the range of foods that a bat can feed on , and this is disadvantageous — though many animals are known to avoid fermented fruit .
Furthermore , some bat species do n't avoid fermented fruit and nectar , clearly precluding that as a good explanation .
Although it is still possible that these species have higher tolerances to alcohol through some evolutionary adaption , the authors think that it is more likely that they are simply hard drinkers .
So , if you weigh 500g , do n't get into a drinking competition with a fruit bat .

Gerald Ford is in the White House , South Vietnam falls , Muhammad Ali defeats Joe Frazier in the " Thrilla in Manila " world championship boxing match , the late - night comedy show NBC's Saturday Night ( later called Saturday Night Live ) debuts , One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest sweeps the Oscars , and Captain & Tennille 's " Love Will Keep Us Together " and Glenn Campbell 's " Rhinestone Cowboy " top the music charts .
And in Albuquerque , N.M. , Harvard dropout Bill Gates and his high school friend Paul Allen set up a tiny business to write software for a new microcomputer called the Altair 8800 .

Savviest business deal
In November 1980 , Microsoft signed an agreement with IBM to provide an operating system for the still - secret IBM Personal Computer , to be released in 1981 .
The operating system would ultimately be called PC - DOS , a rebranding of Microsoft 's MS - DOS .
An original IBM PC 5150 running PC - DOS Version 1.10 ( courtesy of Personal Computer Museum ) .
Microsoft did n't actually write MS - DOS ; instead it paid to have Seattle Computer rewrite its own QDOS ( Quick - and - Dirty Operating System ) for the purpose , without telling Seattle Computer to whom the operating system would be sold .
( Microsoft signed the contract with Seattle Computer one day after signing the contract with IBM . )
QDOS was largely based on the CP / M operating system , owned by Digital Research .
Ironically , IBM had originally turned to Digital Research for an operating system for the IBM PC , but the two companies ' negotiations broke down .
Too bad for Digital Research ; Microsoft went on to use its relationship with IBM as a springboard to develop its worldwide dominance in business operating systems .
Smartest acquisition
In July 1987 , Microsoft bought Forethought Inc. for $ 14 million in cash .
Forethought had developed a presentation program for the Macintosh , initially called Presenter , which it renamed PowerPoint for trademark reasons .
PowerPoint later became one of the core programs of Microsoft Office , which for many years has been the dominant office productivity suite .
Prickliest partnership
OS / 2 Version 2.1 ( courtesy of GUIdebook ) .
In August 1985 , Microsoft and IBM signed a deal to partner in the development of an advanced operating system called OS / 2 .
The operating system never achieved the widespread popularity of DOS -- or , later on , Windows -- and became a bone of contention between Microsoft and IBM .
Microsoft devoted most of its development resources to Windows and Windows NT , rather than OS / 2 , and ultimately abandoned OS / 2 to IBM , which eventually abandoned it as well .
Most surprising investment
In August 1997 , longtime Microsoft rival Apple Computer was teetering on the brink of disaster and in desperate need of cash .
Microsoft rode to the rescue , buying $ 150 million in nonvoting Apple stock .
As part of the deal , Microsoft agreed to continue to develop Microsoft Office for the Mac , and Apple agreed to bundle Internet Explorer with the Mac OS operating system as the default browser .
Both parts of the agreement have since fallen by the wayside : IE for the Mac is gone , and although Microsoft continues to update Office for the Mac ( usually some time after the Windows version is updated ) , it is n't required to do so .
It had to happen eventually .
Having wowed people ceaselessly since E3 with a a succession of explosive trailers , Just Cause 2 has finally put a foot wrong .
And as far as the PC crowd is concerned , it 's a big foot .

It 's been revealed that the game wo n't run on Windows XP .
Why ?
Because it 's DirectX10 only .
So only those running Vista or Windows 7 will be able to play the game , making it one of the first high profile releases to completely lock out the nine year - old operating system .
Sure , that makes it old , but as Rock , Paper , Shotgun point out , it also makes it established , the latest Steam hardware survey revealing 42.15 % of users were running XP .
That 's one hell of a market share to freeze out of a game .

Gmail ’s “ turn off buzz ” ( still ) does not turn off Buzz ; here ’s how to really do it
I received lots of feedback to yesterday ’s post “ Lawyers ( or journalists ) with Gmail accounts : Careful with the Google Buzz ” .
My focus was the privacy implication of Google automatically publishing the identity of people you have communicated with in the past .
What distressed me most is that Google made Buzz automatic .
It was folded into Gmail , assimilated your contacts ( and email history ) , and created these first social connections without ever asking permission .
If you had ever created a Google Profile ( an innocuous webpage that might collect comments you left on Maps or links to your Linked In profile ) , then Google went a step further — it published these social connections in a place accessible to the world .
And even if you had not yourself created a Google Profile , your social connections could still be exposed on the other person ’s Google Profile .
Update : On February 13 , 2010 , Google announced it would be making the privacy options for Buzz more explicit .
I wrote about the good ( and bad ) parts of that announcement in On February 13 , 2010 , Google announced it would be making the privacy options for Buzz more explicit .
I wrote about the good ( and bad ) parts of that announcement in this newer post
Now there is a “ Buzz ” preference pane under your Gmail settings .
And the little “ turn off buzz ” link does take you to this preference pane :
The choice at the bottom of this preference pane explains that by disabling Buzz you are disconnecting your followers and deleting your Google Profile .
Those happen to the be the same steps I discuss below — so when it was posted , these tips were apparently the right way to proceed .
But Google has now given you a single button to do the same thing .
If you clicked the small “ turn off buzz ” link in the footer during the first few days of the service and were never presented with this preference pane , you may need to turn it back on ( using that same link at the bottom ) before you can fully disable the service .
Do n’t like it ?
The burden was on you to track all this down and make the privacy changes you wanted .
Even if you did that , it was n’t clear that it was even possible to truly “ turn off buzz . ”
Flipping the switch at the bottom of Gmail did n’t work .
Who knows how many people have been misled by that .
( Google now acknowledges this on one of its support pages .
All that switch does is “ remove the Buzz label from your Gmail account , ” or in other words , hide it within Gmail . )
Even after clicking “ turn off buzz ” , your Buzz connections persisted , they were still shown on your profile , and Buzz was still active ( as you could readily see from a mobile client , such as an iPhone ) .
Yesterday ’s slight modifications by Google make clear that this was indeed their design
Yesterday afternoon , Google released a statement . (( Who wrote this statement ?
A person with the shiny new title “ Product Manager , Gmail and Google Buzz . ”
My flip suggestion yesterday that Buzz had assimilated the Gmail client seems rooted in the organization chart .
Google is shifting its well - respected email platform into being a social - media tool , whether its users like it or not . ))
They did not back away from their business plan — they still make Buzz automatic and create these connections for you .
Their response is , in essence , to blame you for not having figured out how to tweak these engineering settings yourself .
((
In particular , they point out that it ’s possible to manually go through and block particular followers .
But , to take one example , they do not mention the data leakage I talked about yesterday , in which these followers get access to information about your other social contacts before you block them . ) )
Their post does note a couple of very slight tweaks they have made that make their service less objectionable for users new to Google .
But the basic deal remains the same .
Google did not ask your permission for this repurposing of your personal email information , it did not ask your permission to share it , and is not asking for your forgiveness now .
Imagine if Facebook had done this .
Imagine they bought a major email provider , folded all of its users into their social network , and prepopulated lots of connections based on who they had emailed the most frequently .
Okay , now imagine that Facebook had placed a button on the email client page that said “ turn Facebook off . ”
And that the button did not actually do what it said .
Users and the press would be calling for Facebook ’s head .
How to really turn off buzz
If the “ turn off buzz ” link at the bottom of Gmail is n’t the right way to actually turn the service off , what is ?
Buried within its support pages , Google offers a three - step procedure you can follow to actually disable Buzz .
Follow these steps in order , or it does n’t work at all .
The first step , contrary to what you might expect if you were not a Google engineer , is not to click “ turn off buzz . ”
( I just saw that CNET has also printed up these instructions , with helpful screenshots . )
First , you delete your google profile .
You do n’t hide it or change the name .
You have to delete it completely .
This does n’t destroy your overall google account , but it does limit some of your functions .
Here ’s how to delete your profile .
You have to go into buzz and manually delete your connections , including blocking everyone who is following you already .
Now it ’s safe to go back to Gmail and click “ turn off buzz . ”
Make sense ?
Well , if you think about the whole social graph Google built automatically based on your email history — as if you and everyone else were just pieces of data whose permission was irrelevant — I suppose it does .
You first have to disconnect all those nodes ( by blocking your followers ) and delete the hub ( your profile ) so you do n’t get new connections .
This process makes mathematical sense , but not human sense .
What should Google do ?
What would make human sense is for the “ turn off buzz ” link to take you to a page that gives you a big button that really , really does turn off Buzz .
Update :
And now it does !
( See the yellow box above . )
Until then ?
The “ turn off buzz ” link is like those office thermostats you find sprinkled around a large workspace .
The thermostats do n’t work at all .
But the feeling of control they give the occupants is a nice placebo effect .
If you want to still participate in Google Buzz but to have more control over your privacy , you ’re left with the privacy tips and warnings I offered yesterday and the hope that Google will offer up a decent preference pane in the future .
And even if Google does give us a nice , big “ opt - out ” button , this remains a massive violation of user trust on Google ’s part .
This sharing of personal information never should have been opt-out .
This is a huge shift in how Gmail uses our data .
If this is Google ’s method of dealing with our previously private data in the future , how many of us will really feel good about trusting our documents to Google Docs ?
Or our photos to Picasa ?
Will it take an engineering degree ( and constant vigilance ) to protect your confidential information from being published ?
I have no theoretical objection to a Google - run social network .
I would like a nice way to easily share stories from Google Reader , for example .
What bothers me is that Google seems to think that its behavior with our email history was acceptable , even commendable .
If this is truly the new Google attitude toward user privacy — if they are willing to do this even with emails , traditionally a private realm — that should give you pause before you decide to sign up for the next great Google webapp .

It might seem like a bit of an odd question , but what speed does time travel at ?
The obvious answer is that it ticks by at exactly the rate of 60 seconds every minute .
But new research into our perception of time shows that for us humans , time is a lot more complicated .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Our feelings about time are captured in common sayings - how time flies when you 're having fun , or how it drags when you 're bored .
Associations between this feeling of time passing and enjoyment run so deep that researchers in the United States were able to make people feel that they were having fun , just by simulating the experience of time flying .
By a surreptitious switching of stopwatches , the study at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota was able to make those taking part in the experiment believe that a task had lasted 10 minutes , while in reality it lasted either five or 20 .
" In controlled circumstances we could manipulate people 's feelings of time quite easily , " says Professor Aaron Sackett , who led the research .
HOW TO MAKE TIME FLY Remove time cues - clocks and watches Drink tea , coffee or other stimulants
Allow yourself to become absorbed in what you are doing
They found that people who were made to believe time had flown reported enjoying the task more , and those who believed time had dragged reported the opposite .
The study shows just how important the feeling of time passing at different speeds is in our evaluation of how much we enjoy life .
But while the feeling of time passing is essential to the experiment , Prof Sackett is " agnostic " about how we actually experience time .
Subjective time
He is perhaps wise to steer clear of the question .
While there are numerous anecdotal examples of dramatic distortions in our perception of time - from the intense slowing of time reported in car crashes , to the extreme speeding up of time reported by people under the influence of certain intoxicants - the actual brain processes involved are something of a mystery .
What then is time ?
If no one asks me , I know what it is .
If I wish to explain it to him who asks , I do not know .
Saint Augustine
" There 's no agreement on the biological basis for time perception .
A lot of papers are published but they are all contradictory , " explains Professor John Wearden , a time psychologist at Keele University .
The study of other areas of psychology are grounded in firm objective foundations , he says .
With vision , for example , scientists already understand the wavelengths of colours and the biology of the retina , " so you know where to start " .
But with the feeling of time passing , there is nothing to go on except what people say about time passing .
These reports , says Prof Wearden , often seem to contradict themselves - citing the example of his mother , who often reports that days seem to last forever , but the months fly by .
The difficulty comes because what people say about time passing is based both on the experience of time , and their inferences about its passing .
The hospital waiting room is a hot spot for slow time perception Because there is just one word to capture both " subjective " and " objective " time , people 's feelings about how long something lasted become quickly entangled with the judgements they make from looking at their watch and calculating how long similar things usually last .
So Prof Wearden 's mother feels like time is passing slowly in the moment , but when she reflects on the month that has just passed and the things she has done , it looks like it went quickly , hence the apparent contradiction .
Nevertheless , he says , it is possible to measure the passing of time , even if the results are " not like physics " .
In countless experiments , psychologists have shown that people report that their perception of time is faster in exciting situations , such as watching action films , and slower in boring situations , like sitting in a waiting room .
While these experiences are only one part of people 's judgements of how long has passed , he says , there is no doubt that they do take place .
Body time Given Prof Wearden 's warnings , it would perhaps be sensible to take new research from psychologist Dr Mark Wittmann , based at the Institute for Frontier Areas of Psychology and Mental Health in Freiburg , with a pinch of salt .
Space and time are not conditions in which we live ; they are simply modes in which we think .
Albert Einstein
His research , however , does seem to give a persuasive account of what is going on in the brain when we experience time .
By using an fMRI machine to scan people 's brains as they made timing estimates , he found a " significant neural activation signature " in one brain area , the insular cortex .
This region , he says , is the main brain area where our bodily sensations are processed , leading him to theorize that the feeling of time passing is based on the amount of stimulation our brain receives from our body .
When we are engaged in activities where we forget about our body , immersed in an exciting film or an absorbing task , time seems to fly , he says .
But when we are acutely aware of our own body , and this region of our brain becomes highly stimulated - as in threatening situations - our time perception slows down .
Emotional music could alter your perception of time Previous research has demonstrated that bodily sensation is heightened in when we get emotional , which if Dr Wittmann is correct , is why time seems to fly in absorbing action films , but seems strangely slow in emotional dramas , especially those which touch on issues in your own life .
" If you lead an emotional life , if you are more aware of yourself and what is happening , you would feel that time passes slowly , " he concludes .
Dr Wittmann 's research is still in its infancy , and fits , he admits , into a research area where there are " five researchers and 10 theories " .
So before you launch yourself into a psychological journey of discovery into the meaning of subjective time , or try to extend your life by being more emotionally attuned , it is perhaps best to finish with a word of warning from Professor Wearden .
" Remember , time does n't really go fast or slowly , it can't do .
We are stuck in time , it just goes at the speed it goes , " he says .
" There 's only one objective time , and that 's measured by a clock . "
Have you had experiences of extreme time dilation ?
Do you think our feelings of time passing are important ?
Let us know using the form below or join the debate on Twitter .
I think that time is not an absolute variable but a relative one .
it is different for different people , and also perhaps different when you are travelling beyond the speed of light .

My guess is that events are recorded ( experienced ) at different rates , but only played back ( recalled ) at a constant rate .
Thus in body - threatening situations , many events are recorded , but in abstract situations fewer events are recorded .
Play these back at the same rate , and the threatening situation appears in slow motion detail , whilst the abstract one is less detailed and played back in a short time .
Richard Payne , Leicester , UK I think to an extent time is subjective - i.e if your mind can process things quicker , would n't the same time period feel slower to you than someone else and vice versa ?
Simon , stafford , UK
When I was a student , I worked as a security guard one summer .
Looking back at it , all those nights as a guard were pretty much identical in their rhythms and routines and thus equate one night only in my memory ( even though time went slowly at the time ) .
During my nights off , I went out partying a lot .
Recollections from those nights are strong , hence each night fills up so much of my memory that I 'm tempted to say each single night lasted for two ( even though time flew while it was all going on ) .

The interview about this on today 's programme felt like it went on for over an hour .
Lou , London
As we now know , time is not a single entity .
It is inextricably linked to space , hence ' space - time ' , and we also now know , due to Einstein 's Theory of Special Relativity ( not really a theory any more , as it has been proven experimentally - GPS !!! ) , that objects moving relative to each other experience their own measurements of distance and of time , ie They have their ' own time ' .
How this associates with people sensing time differently when enjoying themselves or when bored , is obviously not due to moving close to the speed of light ( as they 'd need to do in order to experience a noticeable time dilation ) , but it does show that time and space are not as simple as we first thought !!

February 16th , 2010 Just when you thought you ’d seen it all .
BBC News Presenter Ray Gosling found an odd , yet strangely poignant time to admit to killing his former lover who was dying of AIDS – while hosting a BBC documentary on death and dying .
Police are now investigating the admission , and an online debate is now raging on whether or not this was assisted suicide or murder .
The stunning video admission is below .
BBC UK reports : Police are investigating after the Nottingham film - maker said he had a pact with the deceased man to act if his suffering increased .
During a documentary on death and dying , Ray Gosling , 70 , said : “ I killed someone once .
He ’d been my lover and he got Aids .
“ I picked up the pillow and smothered him until he was dead .
No regrets . ” Mr. Gosling said he smothered his former lover while he was in a hospital – which he did not name – after doctors told him that there was nothing further that could be done for him .

decade , hell , I got a hole - in - one in real golf .
This stuff is certainly difficult but I do it .
And I put up with how badly society wants me to be the Golf God , but there 's got to be a give and take , right ?
You want a superhero , so I 'll be one , fine .
Just so long as I can get some fucking done on the side .
I do n't think I 'm being unreasonable .
The media follows me every day to see what I 'm doing .
People come up to me on the street and tell me I 'm the greatest .
If I 'm so great , should n't I be fucking something ?
I think you see my point .
Additionally , you may not know this , but my real name is Eldrick Tont Woods .
Say it out loud .
Look in the mirror and introduce yourself as Eldrick Tont , and see if you do n't want to beatyou up .
Do you think I scored a lot of ass in high school being a golf - loving , black / Asian / Indian kid named Eldrick ?
That 's not a boy 's name , I sound like some kind of goddamned forest mage .

My Marriage
Do you know how many sorority sisters were chasing after dudes who read Golf Digest and idolized Jack Nicklaus ?
Fucking zero .
" Oooh , Eldrick , your putting makes me so hot .
Can you show me your Junior World Golf Championship medals again ? "
Bullshit .
A mixed race , giant - toothed kid in Orange County , the whitest place on the planet , who had weird hobbies ?
Do n't tell me I did n't earn as much porking as I can get my hands on .
Look , I 'll be straight with you .
My marriage is fine , sure .
I do n't want to talk a lot of shit on my marriage , but at the end of the day , she 's a Swedish model who married a professional athlete worth over a hundred million dollars .
Terrific girl .
Would we have met and married if I was n't Tiger Woods ?
Or if she was n't a Swedish model ?
I do n't know , but probably not .
Do you know why she came to America ?
On the advice of It 's just sort of how things go .
And to begin with , when your marriage lives and dies in the media , the sanctity of that marriage is ultimately , at best , shaky .
There will always be doubt on both sides , because the circumstances by which we came together are so suspect .
" He only likes me because I 'm a model , " " She only likes me because I'm Tiger Woods . "
And stop feeling sorry for her .
She 's fucking Tiger Woods in one of her many luxurious mansions .
She 's doing fine .
And , at any rate , what does it matter ?
As far as your golf - watching experience goes , what does it even matter ?
Did you watch me , buy my games and enjoy my commercials because I ruled ass at golf , or because you thought I was faithfully sticking it only to my wife ?
Costa Rica has excellent healthcare
By almost any standard , Costa Rica has some of the best healthcare in Latin America .
There are two systems , both of which expats can access : the government - run universal healthcare system , Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social , known as Caja , and the private system .
Both health systems are constantly being upgraded — new hospitals , new equipment , and improvements in staff training .
Despite the advancements , costs are low in comparison to those in the U.S. and even some European countries .
Healthcare costs are about a third to a fifth of what you ’d pay in the U.S. , depending on the treatment .
Many doctors , especially in private practice , speak English and have received training in Europe , Canada , or the U.S. Drugs are also much less expensive .
Private healthcare is also available , which is affordable and high quality .
There are three large , private hospitals that most expatriates use : CIMA hospital in Escazú , Clínica Bíblica in San José , and Hospital La Católica in San José - Guadalupe .
All these facilities are in and around the capital of the country , San José .
In this private system you can pay cash or use insurance , including some policies from the U.S. and Europe , international policies , and insurance from Costa Rican companies .
Health insurance from the Costa Rican government monopoly Instituto de Seguro Nacional ( INS ) , for example , is available to legal residents , affiliated with doctors , hospitals , labs , and pharmacies in the private sector .
Even if you pay cash , costs are low .
Doctors , for instance , rarely charge more than $ 60 a visit , even for house calls .
And visits to see a specialist , of which there are many in the country , will run you $ 80 to $ 100 .
Tests like ultrasounds are $ 75 .
And even major surgeries are half to a quarter of what they ’d be in the U.S .
A new full - service hospital from CIMA opened a couple of years ago in Liberia , capital of the Guanacaste province .
It ’s just an hour or so away from northern Pacific coast beaches like Tamarindo and Playas del Coco , home to many expats .
It joins a Clínica Bíblica medical center already in town .
Statistics from the World Health Organization frequently place Costa Rica in the top country rankings in the world for long life expectancy .
Arguably , one reason for this is the slower pace of living in Costa Rica .
And , of course , the healthy , fresh , non-preservative - laden foods found there , and the welcoming tropical climate .
Costa Rica just seems to be a healthy place to live .
In fact , the Nicoya Peninsula region , on the northern Pacific coast , has been found to be one of the world ’s Blue Zones .
Researchers have discovered that the residents there live longer on average thanks to a combination of climate , diet , and other factors .
Costa Rica ’s Government - Run Healthcare System
With a government - sponsored network of hospitals and clinics throughout the country , the Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social ( CCSS ) has primary responsibility for providing low - cost healthcare services to the Costa Rican populace .
Although sometimes overburdened , this system has worked well for Costa Ricans for the past 60 or so years .
Foreigners living in Costa Rica — legal residents only in one of the residence progams like pensionado or rentista — can join the CCSS and get free treatment ( everything from check ups to prescription drugs to major surgeries ) by paying a small monthly fee–based on income .
Tourists and visitors can use Caja facilities only in emergencies .
In 2010 , the government made it mandatory for residency applicants to become members of Caja .
The monthly payment is 7 % – 11 % of the applicant ’s monthly income .
A dependent spouse is also covered and able to join Caja under that payment .
Costa Rica ’s Private Healthcare System
Many of the country ’s highly trained physicians and some dentists work in the mornings for the CCSS and operate their own offices and clinics in the afternoons and evenings .
While private healthcare in Costa Rica is more expensive than that offered by the same doctors and surgeons through the CCSS , the price is still far below that of the average office visit in the U.S.
Cost for continued treatments for diagnosed problems will vary , but will almost always be considerably less than comparable treatment in the United States .
Dental work , too , is provided at a much lower cost than in the U.S. – prompting a phenomenon known as “ medical tourism . ”
Knee replacements , hip replacements , and cosmetic surgeries are some of the most popular procedures done in Costa Rica .
On the dental side , implants and teeth whitening are popular .
Many patients find that the entire cost of the trip to Costa Rica ( including a vacation before or after treatment ) , including the procedure , is much cheaper than having it done in the U.S .
Three well - known private hospitals , Clínica Bíblica , CIMA hospital , and Hospital La Católica , where many CCSS doctors practice in the afternoons and evenings , offer first - class , ultra - modern services .
Affiliated with U.S. hospitals and certified by Joint Commission International , these three private providers have costs somewhat higher than the public providers but still considerably below anything found in the U.S .
Many expats elect to use a mix of public and private care due to the wait times for certain procedures and treatments in the public system .
For example , if a Caja doctor requests an ultrasound but the Caja testing facility has a wait time of a couple of weeks , the patient can get the test done at a private clinic and bring the results back to the Caja doctor .
Also , many private doctors who also work in the public system can write prescriptions for Caja pharmacies so there ’s no cost to the patient .
Cosmetic Surgery in Costa Rica
A full range of cosmetic and reconstructive procedures are available in several modern clinics .
With the addition of contemporary laser technology , the ability of Costa Rica ’s plastic and cosmetic surgeons to provide world - class services has been enhanced .
Prices are sometimes 50 % lower than in the United States , but it is important to note that each case is different , and prices are quoted on an individual basis after a consultation .
Dental Procedures in Costa Rica
From simple fillings to complicated multiple implants and periodontal work , Costa Rican dentists are as qualified and skilled as dentists anywhere–and the prices are far less .
This is another growing area of health tourism–foreign patients seeking dental work arrive in Costa Rica in greater numbers every year .
Laboratory work , too , is much cheaper in Costa Rica , and materials used are all FDA - approved and imported from the U.S .
A Texan Doctor ’s Take on Costa Rican Healthcare By John Michael Arthur
Volcano - chaser braves some of Earth 's most dangerous situations to capture amazing photos of violent eruptions
Most people would think themselves unlucky if they passed a volcano as it erupted , but this counts as a good day at the office for one photographer .
Martin Rietze is part of a select group of volcano - chasers who seek out the exploding phenomena , and braves huge electric storms and boiling lava to get the perfect shots .
The 45 - year - old travels around the world 's volcano hotspots , from Costa Rica to Italy , in his pursuit of Earth 's greatest fiery spectacle .
This picture was taken in January 2010 , of Sakurajima volcano near Kagoshima town in south Japan .
The volcano ejected lava bombs and created forks of lightning - possibly due to electrically charged ash
This photo from December 2009 , shows a glowing lava pond inside the summit crater of the Villarica volcano in Southern Chile .
The full moon can be seen behind in the early morning dawn
But Mr Rietze is undaunted by the challenges of his profession likening it to an extreme sport .
In fact he says he has had had fewer mishaps chasing eruptions than when mountain climbing .
Mr Rietze relishes the dramatic encounters despite the danger .
He told the Mail Online : ' I will never ever forget those moments surrounded by poisonous gas , feeling the heat of the flowing and bubbling lava and hearing noises louder than a plane taking off .
' Sometimes your body can feel the shockwaves and the ground is shaking . '
However , he said : ' There is a big difference between a tourist and a long - term experienced observer .
' One has to know when it is safe to come near and when it is a matter of survival to stay away , sometimes many miles away . '
' Nature 's fireworks ' : Stromboli volcano in Italy , Sicily erupts in May 2009 .
This volcano erupts more or less constantly
Kawah Ijen volcano in Indonesia in June 2008 .
This volcano has a extremely acid crater lake and possibly the strongest sulphur vent in the world .
It is so hot that the sulphur ignites leading to burning rivers
Mr Rietze used his vast pool of experience to capture a dramatic shot of volcanic lightning at Sakurajima volcano in Japan last month .
Scientists are still uncertain as to why lightning occurs during some eruptions .
One theory is that it is caused by charge - inducing collisions in volcanic dust .
A great deal of planning goes into Mr Rietze 's expeditions .
He tries to catch volcanoes when they are their highest levels of activity , but calculating the ups and downs of the eruptions can take days to complete .
' For long distance destinations I have to invest a fortnight to give myself a good chance of getting some decent shots , ' he said .
' In principle a volcano can erupt at any time , day and night .
This means you have to wait as long as you can for something spectacular , including whole nights .
' So if the weather is good I must be patient and wait for it to erupt , whether it is lunchtime or two in the morning . '
The Soufriere Hills Lava Dome on Monserrat Island in the Caribbean violently erupts in February 2010 .
The southern cross star constellation can be seen behind
The photographer , from Germany , said each volcano requires a different approach .
He gives active stratovolcanos a wider berth as they can throw out lava bombs that travel several miles and create pyroclastic flows .
Some 350 prominent economists from all over the world have written to the leaders of the G20 calling on them to implement the so - called " Robin Hood tax " on the banks " as a matter of urgency " .
Two Nobel prizewinners , including the outspoken critic of the financial system Joseph Stiglitz , and scores of professors at universities from Harvard to Kyoto , are calling on G20 governments to back a financial transactions tax on speculative dealings in foreign currencies , shares and other securities of 0.05 per cent – say £ 500 on a £ 1 m transaction .
The letter argues : " This tax is an idea that has come of age .
The financial crisis has shown us the dangers of unregulated finance , and the link between the financial sector and society has been broken .
It is time to fix this link and for the financial sector to give something back to society .
" This money is urgently needed .
The crises of poverty and of climate change require an historic transfer of billions of dollars from the rich world to the poor world , and this tax would offer a clear way to help fund this . "
Professor Sir Tony Atkinson from Cambridge , and Professor Sudhir Anand at Oxford are among senior academics from the UK and 34 other nations supporting the Robin Hood tax .
Other British academics backing the plan come from Oxbridge , Sheffield , Warwick , London , Stirling , Essex , Manchester and de Montfort , and economic thinkers from 35 nations are represented in the list of signatories .
Professor Jeff Sachs of Columbia University , also an adviser to UN Secretary general Ban Ki-moon , said : " The transaction tax is technically feasible and morally essential to repair the mess made by the banks .
" I have long advocated such a tax , as a clear way to raise billions of dollars to fight climate change and to achieve the millennium development goals .
The transaction tax is the only option on the table at the G20 that will deliver the scale of resources needed . "
The Robin Hood tax is also being backed by high - profile showbusiness personalities such as Bill Nighy , who plays a squirmingly embarrassed banker in an online video promoting the tax .
Bankers at Goldman
Sachs were accused last week of spamming the campaign 's web site to engineer an online poll to go against the tax .
The letter goes on to say : " Given the automation of payments , this tax is technically feasible .
It is morally right .
We call on you to implement it as a matter of urgency . "
Confusingly , international plans for a tax or levy on banks are well underway – but this is not the Robin Hood tax .
A plan for a levy on the banks will almost certainly be proposed by the IMF at its spring meeting in April , and offered to world leaders for approval .
The G20 leaders requested the Fund to come up with options for a bank levy , designed purely as an insurance fund to deal rescue stricken banks and prevent another meltdown .
The IMF 's Deputy managing director , John Lipsky , recently told The Independent that the new scheme would not provide a long - term flow of funds to the world 's poor or for climate change mitigation , and would be more like the deposit insurance schemes that operate already in the UK and US .
Nor are international moves to tax bankers ' pay or to impose levies on transactions purely to dampen speculation – the motivation behind the original proposal for a Tobin tax by the American economist James Tobin in 1972 – likely to be agreed by the G20 or the IMF .
Rep . Paul Ryan 's daring budget proposal
The White House 's 2011 budget is only the second - most interesting budget proposal released recently .
First prize goes to Congressman Paul Ryan , the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee , who 's released a budget proposal that actually erases the massive long - term deficit .
That 's not mere press release braggadocio .
CBO agrees ( pdf ) .
Under the CBO 's likeliest long - term scenario , deficits are at 42 percent of GDP in 2080 .
Under Ryan 's proposal , we 're seeing surpluses of 5 percent of GDP by that time .
But Ryan 's budget -- and the details of its CBO score -- is also an object lesson in why so few politicians are willing to answer the question " but how will you save all that money ? "
As you all know by now , the long - term budget deficit is largely driven by health - care costs .
To move us to surpluses , Ryan 's budget proposes reforms that are nothing short of violent .
Medicare is privatized .
Seniors get a voucher to buy private insurance , and the voucher 's growth is far slower than the expected growth of health - care costs .
Medicaid is also privatized .
The employer tax exclusion is fully eliminated , replaced by a tax credit that grows more slowly than medical costs .
And beyond health care , Social Security gets guaranteed , private accounts that CBO says will actually cost more than the present arrangement , further underscoring how ancillary the program is to our budget problem .
An important note to understanding how Ryan 's budget saves money :
It 's not through privatization , though everything does get privatized .
It 's through firm , federal cost controls .
The privatization itself actually costs money .
The CBO 's analysis of Ryan 's Medicare changes tells the story well :
Both the level of expected federal spending on Medicare and the uncertainty surrounding that spending would decline , but enrollees ’ spending for health care and the uncertainty surrounding that spending would increase .
Under the Roadmap , the value of the voucher would be less than expected Medicare spending per enrollee in 2021 , when the voucher program would begin .
In addition , Medicare ’s current payment rates for providers are lower than those paid by commercial insurers , and the program ’s administrative costs are lower than those for individually purchased insurance .
Beneficiaries would therefore face higher premiums in the private market for a package of benefits similar to that currently provided by Medicare .
Moreover , the value of the voucher would grow significantly more slowly than CBO expects that Medicare spending per enrollee would grow under current law .
Beneficiaries would therefore be likely to purchase less comprehensive health plans or plans more heavily managed than traditional Medicare , resulting in some combination of less use of health care services and less use of technologically advanced treatments than under current law .
Beneficiaries would also bear the financial risk for the cost of buying insurance policies or the cost of obtaining health care services beyond what would be covered by their insurance .
That 's a bit of a slog , so here 's the translation :
The proposal would shift risk from the federal government to seniors themselves .
The money seniors would get to buy their own policies would grow more slowly than their health - care costs , and more slowly than their expected Medicare benefits , which means that they 'd need to either cut back on how comprehensive their insurance is or how much health - care they purchase .
Exacerbating the situation -- and this is important -- Medicare currently pays providers less and works more efficiently than private insurers , so seniors trying to purchase a plan equivalent to Medicare would pay more for it on the private market .
It 's hard , given the constraints of our current debate , to call something " rationing " without being accused of slurring it .
But this is rationing , and that 's not a slur .
This is the government capping its payments and moderating their growth in such a way that many seniors will not get the care they need .
This is , in its simplest form , a way to limit the use of a finite resource : Money .
Here 's the graph :
You can argue whether this cost control is better or worse than other forms of cost control .
But it 's a blunt object of a proposal , swung with incredible force at a vulnerable target .
Consider the fury that Republicans turned on Democrats for the insignificant cuts to Medicare that were contained in the health - care reform bill , or the way Bill Clinton gutted Newt Gingrich for proposing far smaller cuts to the program 's spending .
This proposal would take Medicare from costing an expected 14.3 percent of GDP in 2080 to less than 4 percent .
That 's trillions of dollars that 's not going to health care for seniors .
The audacity is breathtaking .
But it is also impressive .
I would n't balance the budget in anything like the way Ryan proposes .
His solution works by making care less affordable for seniors .
I 'd prefer to aggressively reform the system itself so the care becomes cheaper , even if that causes significant pain to providers .
I also would n't waste money by moving to a private system when the public system is cheaper .
But his proposal is among the few I 've seen that 's willing to propose solutions in proportion to the problem .
Whether or not you like his answer , you have to give him credit for stepping up to the chalkboard .

Dubai ’s police chief said Monday that an 11 - person team of trained killers with European passports carried out the mysterious assassination of a senior Hamas official last month in a Dubai hotel .
The chief , Lt. Gen. Dahi Khalfan al - Tamim , provided names and photographs of the suspects , along with a detailed account of how they tracked the Hamas official , Mahmoud al - Mabhouh , and suffocated him within minutes of his arrival on Jan. 19 at Al Bustan Rotana hotel , near the international airport .
The suspects , who disguised themselves with wigs and fake beards , left Dubai immediately after the killing on separate airlines , the chief said .
He also said that two Palestinian suspects in the case were arrested in Jordan and extradited to Dubai , where they are now in custody .
Mr. Mabhouh played a role in the kidnapping and killing of two Israeli soldiers in 1989 .
Hamas has accused Israel of his killing , and has vowed to retaliate .
I got bored , so I looked at everyone 's schedules and played out the rest of the season in my mind .
Here 's the final standings in the West :
Some interesting things I noticed about the last day of the season .
( 1 ) San Jose plays Phoenix .
In my mind , the winner of that game gets second and the loser gets fourth .
( 2 ) Also on that day , the Kings play Colorado .
In my mind , the winner of that game gets fifth and the loser gets sixth .
( 3 ) The other big game is Detroit / Chicago .
In my mind , if Detroit wins that game , they get seventh and Nashville gets eighth ; if they lose , swap 'em . ( 4 ) The only seeds that are certain on the last day of the season in my mind are Chicago and Vancouver .
( 5 ) The eight playoff teams will already be decided in my mind before the last weekend .
I would be willing to bet the Kings are going to play one of PHX , SJS or VAN in the first round .
But the way I played it out in my mind , the match - ups would be :
Chicago vs. Nashville
Phoenix vs. Detroit
Vancouver vs. Los Angeles
San Jose vs. Colorado
Although I would be happier if the last day 's games played out differently and the match - ups became :
Chicago vs. Detroit
San Jose vs. Nashville
Vancouver vs. Colorado
Phoenix vs. Los Angeles
Of course I could have played them out that way , since I did it in my mind .

Various groups arond the country are demanding that President Obama and members of Congress skip this year ’s National Prayer Breakfast , calling its organizer “ shadowy ” and “ cult - like . ”
The Fellowship Foundation , which has organized the breakfast with presidents and prominent Washington and world leaders since 1953 and uses The National Prayer Breakfast and then uses imprimatur of the elected leaders who attend to give the Fellowship greater credibility and facilitate its networking and fundraising .
The Fellowship is closely connected to the now - notorious C Street residence has recently become the epicenter for Republican sex scandals , a fact impossible to divorce from the savage irrationality of The Family ’s religious and legislative crusade against the sexual freedom of others , here at home or in other countries .
The Family have a notorious reputation for homophobic stances on just about every issue facing the LGBTQ community .
The Family ’s National Prayer Breakfast brings together elected officials and businessmen from here and abroad and this will take place on February 4 at the Washington Hilton , and includes Ugandan officials directly involved in this new legislation .
All of The Family ’s many questionable machinations , including the National Prayer Breakfast , have become a source for U.S. State Department concern because its dealings operate dangerously outside established diplomatic relations and governmental authority , but the State Department does NOTHING and President Obama and other politico ’s still attend .
Full Equality Now DC , will protest against The Family the night before the National Prayer Breakfast , Wednesday , February 3 at 5:30 p.m. , with a Protest and Rally outside The Family ’s residential headquarters at 133 C Street SE , a home - away - from - home for such far right politicians as Senators John Ensign ( R - NV ) and Jim Inhofe ( R - OK ) and South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford .
I fully support Full Equality Now DC 100 Percent , they are a group of “ doers ” that get out there and stand up and fight for what they believe in and make a point .
The time has come for us to make a stand for what we believe in and not only fight for our rights , but fight against those who stand against us getting them and that means being visible and showing strength in numbers .
PLEASE , if you are in the Washington .
DC area attend this protest and rally .
Stand up and let your voices and your anger be heard .
And pass the word

.
Life is not always happiness , indeed .
Or is it ?
To wit : " Candide , " the musical with a glorious score by Leonard Bernstein and words by a kitchen - sinkful of distinguished writers , has been a problem child ever since its Broadway premiere in 1956 .
The work went on to numerous revisions , none of which resulted in a completely satisfying theatrical endeavor .
But Bernstein 's rich , whimsical music is reason enough to tackle this challenging take on Voltaire 's satire of worldly pleasure and evil .
The Oberlin Opera
Theater bends over backwards , forwards , sideways and myriad other ways to instill life into its blissful production of " Candide . "
The version used in Oberlin is credited to Hugh Wheeler , who came up with a new libretto – to replace the perfectly credible , but no longer available , original Broadway text by Lillian Hellman – for the 1974 New York revival .
Like Voltaire 's book , Wheeler 's scenario is a roller coaster of events .
The work 's frenetic nature has not been lost on Jonathon Field , whose inventive Oberlin staging emphasizes the artifice by making clear distinctions between the 18th - century players and modern - day ensemble that acts as Greek chorus and stage crew .
Michael Louis Grube 's turntable set , Chris Flaharty 's colorful costumes and Carol Hageman 's zany choreography add vibrant character to the production , which exults in the theatrical possibilities in this most operatic and operetta - like piece of musical theater .
" Candide " retains its stature because Bernstein 's voracious musical appetite conveys Candide 's journey from optimism to realism with endless suavity , humor and feeling .
As the cast faces us at the end to sing " Make Our Garden Grow , " we 're grateful that a difficult expedition has taken us to so many inspiring and frolicsome destinations .
The Oberlin forces let you know what an exhilarating ride it is .
After a bit of early hesitation , guest conductor Joseph Mechavich gave the score requisite affection and spunk .
The Oberlin Chamber Orchestra , if too loud at times , abounded in elegance , vitality and cohesion .
The opening night cast , which also performs Saturday , could have made more of words and applied less relish to the foreign accents .
But their characterizations were funny or touching across the board , and the voices sent Bernstein 's music soaring .
Adrienne Sereta , dolled up ( literally ) in frilly dress and curly wig , was a delectably clueless and feisty Cunegonde with a coloratura soprano of wondrous precision and tonal focus .
She made a sumptuous meal of " Glitter and Be Gay . "
As Candide , Roy Hage used his football frame and fresh tenor to endearing effect .
Alexandra Roth poured enough borscht into her droll portrayal of the Old Lady for a chain of Russian Tea Rooms .
Austin Bradley 's Maximillian had the right preening lunacy , Alex Boyd excelled in a quartet of roles ( including Voltaire and Pangloss ) , Sara Casey made a peppery Paquette and Corey Arnold ’s Governor oozed slimy charm .
The ensemble also deserves high praise for undertaking many roles and theatrical functions with great panache while treating Bernstein 's choral writing as if it attained Verdian grandeur .
Which , of course , it does .
The attack on the FIA published by Ferrari on their website has already drawn some reaction in the daily round - up .
Ferrari has made several such criticisms in the past months but this is the most vociferous yet .
It claims Lotus and Virgin “ will limp into the start of the championship ” , calls Stefan GP the “ Serbian vultures ” and leaves no - one in any doubt where Ferrari believe the blame lies :
This is the legacy of the holy war waged by the former FIA president .
Last week the team marked the 112nd anniversary of founder Enzo Ferrari ’s birthday .
It published a short interview with his son Piero Ferrari which was light on reminiscences about Enzo but heavy on the politics :
Q : What would he have thought about a Championship where the test sessions are concentrated in four weeks and obstructed by lots of rain ?
A : He would have been completely against it .
That ’s for sure . [… ]
I completely agree with Luca di Montezemolo when he says that there should be the possibility to start a third car , which can be managed by smaller teams , or maybe even do it like we did in the 1970s , considering the stable rules , private teams often used cars from the bigger teams from the previous year .
I really think that it ’s absolutely possible thinking about introducing a third car , which could guarantee more suspense and lower costs .
It is clear the Ferrari and the FIA have different interpretations of what caused manufacturers to leave F1 and what the solution should be .
The FIA believes high costs drove the car manufacturers out and the remedy is to change the rules so teams with smaller budgets can compete .
Ferrari believes Mosley ’s governance of F1 drove the likes of Toyota and BMW away ( and Renault in all but name ) and the solution is to allow teams to run more cars .
The problem with Ferrari ’s ‘ three car teams ’ solution is it will stifle variety , make it easer for a single team to dominate the championship and make it harder for existing small teams like Williams and Force India to compete .
Allow teams to enter more than two cars and it ’s not hard to see F1 gradually degenerating into a DTM equivalent with just two car makers supplying the entire field .
That scenario would be far worse for F1 than having a couple of uncertain entries at the back of the grid .
And it would bring the added problem of races being spoiled by team orders which the DTM has struggled with in recent years ( more on that here :
Why three - car teams is n’t a great idea ) .
But what is most surprising is that Ferrari are happy for their point to be put across in this fashion .
The hectoring style and grandiose language in the statement verges on comical at times .
Perhaps something has been lost in translation .
The wording may be odd but the meaning is clear .
The question now is whether Jean Todt will heed the words of his former team .
Here ’s the original statement in full :
Maranello , 22nd February –
Only less than three weeks to go until the ultimate form of motor sport , the Formula One World Championship , gets underway , while celebrating its sixtieth birthday this year .
For many of the teams , this coming week is a crucial one , as the bell rings to signal the final lap , with the last test session getting underway in Barcelona .
It is one last chance to run the cars on track , to push reliability to the limit and to try and find some performance .
That ’s the situation for many teams but not for all of them .
Of the thirteen teams who signed up , or were induced to sign up , for this year ’s Championship , to date only eleven of them have heeded the call , turning up on track , some later than others , and while some have managed just a few hundred kilometres , others have done more , but at a much reduced pace .
As for the twelfth team , Campos Meta , its shareholder and management structure has been transformed , according to rumours which have reached the Horse Whisperer through the paddock telegraph , with a sudden cash injection from a munificent white knight , well used to this sort of last minute rescue deal .
However , the beneficiaries of this generosity might find the knight in question expects them to fulfil the role of loyal vassal .
All this means , it is hard to imagine the Dallara designed car showing its face at the Catalunya Circuit , with Sakhir a more likely venue to witness the return of the Senna name to a Formula One session .
The thirteenth team , USF1 , appears to have gone into hiding in Charlotte , North Carolina , to the dismay of those like the Argentinian , Lopez , who thought he had found his way into the Formula One paddock , ( albeit with help from chairwoman Kirchner , according to the rumours ) and now has to start all over again .
Amazingly , they still have the impudence to claim that everything is hunky - dory under the starry stripy sky .
Next , we have the Serbian vultures .
Firstly , they launched themselves into a quixotic legal battle with the FIA , then they picked the bones of Toyota on its death bed .
Having got some people on board , around whom there was still a whiff of past scandals , they are now hovering around waiting to replace whoever is first to drop out of the game , possibly with backing from that very same knight in shining armour whom we mentioned earlier .
This is the legacy of the holy war waged by the former FIA president .
The cause in question was to allow smaller teams to get into Formula One .
This is the outcome : two teams will limp into the start of the championship , a third is being pushed into the ring by an invisible hand – you can be sure it is not the hand of Adam Smith – and , as for the fourth , well , you would do better to call on Missing Persons to locate it .
In the meantime , we have lost two constructors along the way , in the shape of BMW and Toyota , while at Renault , there ’s not much left other than the name .
Was it all worth it ?
Do you think he should ?
Is replacing car manufacturers with the likes of Virgin Racing really such a bad thing for F1 ?
Have your say in the comments .

The scenario is familiar to us all – Some sort of disease begins in a small town or large city , it spreads rapidly , infecting everyone in its wake , the infected become mindless , murderous creatures , hellbent on consuming or converting everyone they encounter , the walking dead .
Finally , through some heroic effort , the survivors either turn back the tide or find a stronghold from which the human race can be rebuilt .
It is the Zombie Apocalypse .
Hollywood is full of hype and heroic exploits .
Of simple people overcoming tremendous odds , of triumph in the face of certain destruction .
But how well would we really fare in a zombie apocalypse ?
Fortunately , Munz et al. ( 2009 ) have done the math for us , and the outcome does not look good .
These are , of course , the shambling , slow - witted classical zombies , hungry for your flesh , not the sleek , mean zombies of whimsy .
They propose 5 scenarios – basic outbreak ( no quarantine , no cure , no coordinated response ) , an outbreak with a latency period , an outbreak with quarantine , an outbreak with a cure , and an outbreak with coordinated attacks .
For all but the last two , the zombies make short work of the human race , with the only variation being in time and number of zombies produced .
In the cure scenario , a small population of humans survives ( 10 % the zombie population ) , and in the attack model , frequent , increasingly aggressive attacks eventually eradicate the zombies .
Listen to an interview with the lead author here .
The future does not look good for the human race during a zombie apocalypse .
But what about our other undead brethren ?
Vampires are dependent on us for survival , both as a food source and a template for reproduction .
As the human population declines , what happens to the vampire population ?
Can vampires survive a zombie apocalypse ?
Several studies of vampire population dynamics and predator / prey relationships have been conducted over the years .
In “ The Transylvanian Problem of Renewable Resources ” and its follow - up “ Cycles of Fear : Periodic Bloodsucking Rates for Vampires ” , Hartl et al. attempted to solve the optimal conditions for vampire feeding strategies and equate it with periodic empirically observed vampire appearances .
Physicists Efthimiou and Gandhi attempted to prove the impossibility of vampires through an exponential growth curve .
Basically , if insatiable vampires produced a new vampire every month , beginning in 1600 , the whole human race would be vampire before the end of 1602 .
Mathematician Dino Sejdinovic has something to say about that .
Exponential growth is a sub-optimal condition .
Building on the pioneering work of Hartl et al , Sejdinovic did something no previous vampire ecologist had done before , he added variables to account for a vampire death rate – unfortunate encounters with stakes , garlic , holy water , Southern Fried Scientists , and the occasional slayer .
Brian Thomas , a graduate student in ecology at Stanford University , put together a nifty little treatise , using a fictional California town as a model .
In short , a town of 36,000 can support about 18 vampires .
Extrapolating out to the whole world ( and this is a suspect figure at best ) that gives us a standing vampire population of about 3.25 million .
But all these models rely on one important assumption – that vampires are the top predators .
What happens when we pit the undead against the undead ?
First , a few assumptions :
Vampires need to feed on humans .
Although technically immortal , starving vampires are weak and easily killed .
Vampires cannot feed on zombies .
Most recent cases of zombie outbreaks are the result of a blood - born vector , so zombie blood is tainted .
Vampires cannot become zombies .
That just gives me the willies .
Vampires are strong , but not invincible .
The Zombie Survival Guide estimates that an average human can fend of 8 to 9 zombies .
Assuming vampires are at least 10 and at most 50 times stronger than humans , then a single vampire could fight off between 80 to 450 zombies .
Vampire victims , if not turned or destroyed , will eventually be infected an become zombies .
Vampires are capable of feeding without killing , but it requires discipline .
Although not susceptible , vampires can transmit the infection to humans .
A vampire that ’s bitten an infected – but not yet zombified – human can spread the disease to new hosts .
Zombies eat anything with a brain , undead or not .
If we start with the basic model – Humans are quickly eradicated and zombies take over , infecting everyone – then vampires obviously lose too .
With their food source completely tainted , the vampires grow weaker as the zombie population reaches an asymptote around 2.5 billion .
this is more than enough to handle the 3.25 million vampires , who at full strength could handle only about 1.7 billion zombies .
Starving and outnumbered , the vampires would be overrun .
The same is true for the latent infection scenario .
With an even greater zombie population , the vampires would fall .
However , there is a twist .
Because vampires would be able to sense latent infection ( the blood would be undrinkable ) they could screen out infected individuals and remove them .
In the quarantine scenario , this means that a buffer could be built to keep out the infected .
The trade - off is that human - vampire cooperation in this scenario is unfeasible .
Vampires can still spread the infection , so “ farming ” uninfected humans would be ineffective .
The time to Armageddon may be delayed , but eventually zombies would rule the earth .
The cure model holds the most promise for vampires , but not necessarily humans .
With a surviving human population reduced to 50 million , only 25,000 vampires could be supported .
Since the initial vampire population is much higher than this , a feeding frenzy would commence , decimating the human population .
Human “ farming ” could be an effective solution , but the vampires would be faced with a desolate future with few humans and billions of roving zombies to fend off .
The human race would be reduced to livestock .
The most interesting scenario for both dead and undead alike is a coordinated attack of increasing intensity .
This is the only scenario that showed promise for the human race , hit them hard and hit them often with overwhelming force .
Provided vampires could be convinced that their existence depends on this tactic ( perhaps that is my goal here ) they could provide an extra level of overwhelming force that would allow us to drive the zombies back before the apocalypse .
How the human - vampire conflict will change post - zombie - eradication is best left to the scholars .
In conclusion , Vampires can only survive if humans also survive , and the vampire population is so small as to have no effect on human survival .
Vampires are helpless to alter their fate unless they join forces with their living brethren for an all out zombie - human - vampire rumble .
Both zombie and vampire population growth is directly proportional to food consumed .
In both cases the food is us .
Zombies represent one end of the spectrum – uncontrolled consumption with exponential growth eventually leading to a complete population collapse , while vampires represent the other extreme , controlled consumption and a stable state directly proportional to the size of the prey population .
The only question left then is “ who ’s managing our fisheries ? ”
Happy Halloween .

Morris and Steel argued that they were already at a disadvantage , because they did not have access to expensive daily transcripts .
Last year , the $ 30 billion corporate giant broke an agreement to provide each of the two defendants with a transcript of each day 's testimony at its own expense for the remainder of the trial .
To their dismay , the trial judge ruled that the activists had to begin closing arguments on October 21 .
Against protests by Steel and Morris that they have not had adequate time to prepare for closing arguments , the trial is expected to end by New Year's .
The pair had asked the court to have the corporation summarize its case first , so that they could offer rebuttal to McDonald 's interpretations of the mountain of evidence and testimony .
The trial , which began in the summer of 1994 , was originally expected to last a few weeks but has stretched beyond two years , with roughly 15 thousand pages of testimony from 180 witnesses .
An additional 40,000 pages of evidence has been entered into the record .
Coca - cola provides water , part of a balanced diet
Johann Hari recounts his own experience at the hands of a variety of intellectuals whose fundamental desire is not to engage in debate about Israel and Palestine , but to control the debate with smears and character assassinations .
Note Johann 's credentials as a writer and reporter , whose brave and extensive record exposing vile Islamist anti-Semitism cannot be denied .
Hari won Britain 's Orwell Prize for journalism last year , and has been nominated for columnist of the year in Britain for the last two years .
He is a friend of mine , and , along with Irshad Manji and me , one of a small group of non-Jewish socially liberal writers who have devoted a great deal of their time exposing the anti-Semitism in Europe and the Muslim world , and the evil of Jihadism .
We have done this because we care passionately about the poison of anti-Semitism :
I have worked undercover at both the Finsbury Park mosque and among neo -Nazi Holocaust deniers to expose the Jew - hatred there ; when I went on the Islam Channel to challenge the anti-Semitism of Islamists , I received a rash of death threats calling me " a Jew - lover " , " a Zionist - homo pig " and more .
Ah , but wait .
I have also reported from Gaza and the West Bank .
Last week , I wrote an article that described how untreated sewage was being pumped from illegal Israeli settlements on to Palestinian land , contaminating their reservoirs .
This is n't controversial .
It has been documented by Friends of the Earth , and I have seen it with my own eyes .
The response ?
There was little attempt to dispute the facts I offered .
Instead , some of the most high profile " pro-Israel " writers and media monitoring groups  including Honest Reporting and Camera  said I an anti-Jewish bigot akin to Joseph Goebbels and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , while Melanie Phillips even linked the stabbing of two Jewish people in North London to articles like mine .
Vast numbers of e-mails came flooding in calling for me to be sacked .
Any attempt to describe accurately the situation for Palestinians is met like this .
If you recount the pumping of sewage onto Palestinian land , " Honest Reporting " claims you are reviving the anti-Semitic myth of Jews " poisoning the wells . "
If you interview a woman whose baby died in 2002 because she was detained  in labour  by Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint within the West Bank , " Honest Reporting " will say you did n't explain " the real cause " : the election of Hamas in , um , 2006 .
And on , and on .
The former editor of Israel 's leading newspaper , Ha'aretz , David Landau , calls the behaviour of these groups " nascent McCarthyism " .
Those responsible hold extreme positions of their own that place them way to the right of most Israelis .
Alan Dershowitz and Melanie Phillips are two of the most prominent figures sent in to attack anyone who disagrees with the Israeli right .
Dershowitz is a lawyer , Harvard professor and author of The Case For Israel .
He sees ethnic cleansing as a trifling matter , writing : " Political solutions often require the movement of people , and such movement is not always voluntary ...
It is a fifth - rate issue analogous in many respects to some massive urban renewal . "
If a prominent American figure takes a position on Israel to the left of this , Dershowitz often takes to the airwaves to call them anti-Semites and bigots .

One of the best moments from the Sunday shows was the slam at Republicans for playing politics with terrorism and national security :
Deputy national security adviser John Brennan complained Sunday that politicians , many of them Republicans , were unfairly criticizing the administration for partisan purposes and second - guessing the case with a “ 500 - mile screwdriver ” that reaches from Washington to the scene of the abortive attack in Detroit .
“ Quite frankly , I ’m tiring of politicians using national security issues such as terrorism as a political football , ” Brennan said .
“ They are going out there .
They ’re unknowing of the facts .
And they ’re making charges and allegations that are not anchored in reality . ”
Unfortunately , that ’s what Republicans do .
Remember Dick Cheney outed an undercover CIA spy for political reasons .
And , never forget , the war in Iraq was based on Weapons of Mass Destruction , a charge that was not anchored in reality .
Brennan personally briefed top Republicans about the arrest of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , telling them he was in FBI custody , on Christmas day .
( In America , being in FBI custody means law enforcement is involved . )
Senators Mitch McConnell and Kit Bond , along with House GOP leader John Boehner and Rep. Pete Hoekstra , were notified personally by Brennan .
There were n’t any complaints then .
Nope .
Instead , Hoekstra turned around and did a political fundraising mailing on the bombing within days .
Everything is a “ political football ” these days for the GOP .
President Clinton Talks About His Internet Legacy ( BTW , He ’s an iPhone Dude , While the GOP ’s # 41 Is a BlackBerry Teen )
Here is a video I did of former President Bill Clinton talking at an event related to the 25th anniversary of the first .com domain registration .
Clinton gave a keynote speech first –which was , inexplicably , about health - care legislation and global warming .
But after Clinton was done , he sat down with VeriSign ( VRSN ) CEO Mark McLaughlin to talk about a range of Web - related topics , in a very amusing interview exchange .
They included what devices he uses , broadband access and the dire state of traditional media .
Clinton talked about what sites–largely political –he likes .
He mentioned Politico , Daily Beast and the Huffington Post for their analysis and outlook , as well as far - right ones , to keep track of his opposition .
Interestingly , he did not mention the Washington Post ( WPO ) or the New York Times ( NYT ) online , although he said their deep reporting was valuable .
Still , Clinton noted , “ It ’s almost impossible , given the economics of the modern world for newspapers to continue . ”
And the 42nd President of the United States is an Apple ( AAPL ) fanboy , naming his iPhone as his fave gadget ( although he said he also has a BlackBerry ) .
Clinton joked that his predecessor , No. 41 , former President George H.W. Bush , is a maniac user of the Research in Motion ( RIMM ) BlackBerry , likening him to a teenager .
Also , no Kindle from Amazon ( AMZN ) , since Clinton said he still likes books .
Here ’s the video ( sorry about his shiny watch , but you can hear him ! ) :
News came down the wire yesterday that Jackets prospect Matt Calvert was signed to his entry - level contract .
This is good news for the Jackets because if he was n't signed soon he would re-enter the draft .
There was really no chance that he was n't going to be re-signed , but it 's good news nonetheless .
When the Jackets drafted him in the fifth round of the 2008 NHL Entry Draft , he was the least heralded of a group of three youngsters playing for the Brandon Wheat Kings .
Those three would spend most of their junior career playing as a line - the other two players are 2009 first round draft picks Brayden Schenn and Scott Glennie .
Schenn went to the Los Angeles Kings and Glennie was taken by the Dallas Stars .
In the fall of 2009 Calvert was very impressive in training camp , and the Jackets were eager to sign him with the intention of sending him to Syracuse of the AHL .
However , he was still eligible to return to junior for one more season .
Most players elect to skip their overage year in junior and make the jump to professional hockey , but there was a huge incentive for Calvert to return to Brandon .
They are the hosts of this year 's Memorial Cup - the holy grail of junior hockey .
Being the hosts , Brandon gets a bye right to the Memorial Cup tournament .
The other three teams in the tourny are the champions of the QMJHL , OHL and WHL .
Add to this fact that Matt is a Brandon native , and he made the decision to return to junior .
He is currently tied for the team scoring lead with Schenn , with 99 points apiece .
Next year he will be a professional .
With the current makeup of the team , he has a good shot at making the Columbus roster right out of camp .
He is a tenacious player who 's engine never quits .
He can supply offense and for a smaller player he can be quite physical .
For those Jacket fans who have been here since the start - he plays a hell of a lot like Tyler Wright .
He is a logical replacement for Raffi Torres , so seeing him in a CBJ sweater next year should help ease the pain of trading Raffi .
While on the topic of Calvert , let 's take a quick look at some other prospects .
For the first time since the early years of the franchise , the prospect cupboard is relatively bare .
There are still some very good players on the way for the Jackets though :
Nikita Filatov is still the team 's best prospect , and count me in the group that wants to see him be a star in Columbus .
Also in the mix is John Moore , the team 's first round pick from last year .
He will likely be in Syracuse of the AHL next season .
Maksim Mayorov just completed a brief stint with Columbus and did n't do much to impress .
That does n't mean he is n't going to be a good player , he just needs some more time to develop .
Two more players are making the future look bright - The Cannon favourites David Savard and Cam Atkinson .
Savard is piling up the points as a defenseman with Moncton of the QMJHL and Atkinson is curently fourth in Hockey East scoring with 34 points in 27 games while also leading his Boston College team in scoring .
Savard has been nominated for the QMJHL's Best Defenseman Award , Sportsman of the Year Award , and Best Defensive Defenseman Award .
A pair of college prospects have been nominated for some CCHA hardware also .
Forward Matt Rust , who was acquired from the Florida Panthers for defenseman Mathieu Roy has been nominated for the CCHA Top Defensive Forward Award .
He plays with fellow CBJ prospect and 2009 second rounder Kevin Lynch at the University of Michigan .
The other prospect up for an award is 2007 second round pick Will Weber , he is nominated for the CCHA top defensive defenseman award .

By Deshakalyan Chowdury , AFP / Getty Images A DEADLY FEBRUARY A DEADLY FEBRUARY WASHINGTON  Attacks on U.S. and allied forces with makeshift bombs in Afghanistan are 50 % more lethal than three years ago , reflecting insurgents ' use of more powerful explosives and the increased vulnerability of troops who patrol more on foot than in the past .
Lt. Gen. Michael Oates , director of the Joint Improvised Explosive Device ( IED ) Defeat Organization , told a House subcommittee that the casualty rate was " disturbing " and half that of troops hit by IEDs in Iraq .
INTERACTIVE : A look at U.S. lives lost in Iraq , Afghanistan Overall , IED attacks have doubled over the past year in Afghanistan , Oates said .
It was even worse when comparing February 2010 with February 2009 , attributed in part to a Marine - led offensive in the town of Marjah in Helmand province .
This year , insurgents planted 721 bombs compared with 291 last year .
Those attacks killed or wounded 204 troops this February compared with 51 in February 2009 .
Oates cited several advantages Afghan insurgents had over U.S. forces : • Reliance on fertilizer - based explosives that lack metal components frustrates attempts to detect buried bombs .
• U.S. forces traveling in heavy vehicles are forced to travel on the few improved roads in Afghanistan , making them easier targets .
" This facilitates a successful enemy tactic of emplacing large explosive charges buried in the middle of the road or in culverts , " Oates said .
•
The counterinsurgency strategy pushed by Gen. Stanley McChrystal stresses protecting Afghan civilians and requires troops to be in close contact with them .
The downside , Oates said , is that " separated from the protection of an armored vehicle , they are also more vulnerable to casualty from an IED . "
Oates , in a USA TODAY interview , said winning the trust of Afghans will ultimately provide the best protection for U.S. troops .
Afghans will identify insurgents and provide tips on where they have planted bombs .
Oates said the military will focus on fielding new all - terrain Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles designed specifically to protect troops in Afghanistan .
Surveillance aircraft will monitor roads , troops will be trained to find and defuse bombs , and the networks that produce IEDs will be attacked .
" There is no silver bullet , " he said .

Today ’s big news is that the White House announced a bunch of new recess appointments :
Fed up with waiting , President Barack Obama announced Saturday he would bypass a vacationing Senate and name 15 people to key administration jobs … .
The 15 appointees to boards and agencies include the contentious choice of union lawyer Craig Becker to the National Labor Relations Board .
Republicans had blocked his nomination on grounds he would bring a radical pro-union agenda to the job , and they called on Obama not to appoint Becker over the recess .
Obama went ahead anyway , while also choosing a second member for the labor board so that four of its five slots will be filled .
The board , which referees labor - management disputes , has had a majority of its seats vacant for more than two years , slowing its work and raising questions about the legality of its rulings .
This is pretty fascinating .
Years ago , after Republicans filibustered a Carter nominee to the NLRB , the two parties made a deal : the board would have three appointees from the president ’s party and two from the other party .
So after he took office Obama nominated two Democrats and one Republican to fill the NLRB ’s three vacant seats and got support from a couple of Republicans on the HELP committee for the entire slate .
But when it got to the Senate floor John McCain put a hold on Becker , and his nomination — along with the others — died .
Fast forward to today and Obama finally decides to fill the board using recess appointments .
But what does he do ?
He only appoints the two Democrats .
This is not what you do if you ’re trying to make nice .
It ’s what you do if you ’re playing hardball and you want to send a pointed message to the GOP caucus .
You wo n’t act on my nominees ?
Fine .
I ’ll appoint my guys and then leave it up to you to round up 50 votes in the Senate for yours .
Have fun .
Does this mean the postpartisan Obama is finally dying away , overtaken by a newly muscular president willing to duke it out with a Republican Party that he finally realizes has been utterly consumed by its hardcore obstructionist wing ?
Maybe !
Stay tuned .

If you click to read more , you will find an interesting essay by Mr. Justin McCollum , member of Houston and Fort Bend Astronomy clubs .
We salute the late Mr. Tombaugh and remember his accomplishments with awe and admiration .
( He once replied when asked about his political views : “ I am not a Republican or a Democrat … for several years now , I have been a Plutocrat . ” )
( Mr. McCollum ’s article is reposted from the Houston Astronomical Society mailing list and has been slightly edited and condensed . )
Hello Everyone ,
It is on this day 80 years ago that Clyde Tombaugh , a staff Astronomer working at the Lowell observatory in Flagstaff , AZ , discovered the planet Pluto .
At the time the big thing in Planetary Astronomy was the search for a ninth planet in the solar system as an explanation to the gravitational distortions in the orbit of the Planet Neptune .
Mr. Tombaugh was hired by the observatory for his ability to build his own telescope and make detailed maps from his observations of the planets Jupiter and Mars .
He used the old 13 inch f/5.3 Astrograph , 3 element lenses telescope to make photographic plates in scanning certain sections of the night sky over several nights to observe the movement of any new potential planet against the background stars using a blank comparator .
I had the pleasure of seeing the Astrograph telescope back in 2003 during my visit to the observatory [ and ] touring and talking to professional Astronomers who worked there at the time [ and paid ] homage to Percival Lowell ’s mausoleum which is there .
I even saw the 24 inch ‘ Alvan Clark ’ refractor which Lowell used in his observations and mapping of the planet Mars along with the museum there which had his ..original maps and drawings of Lowell ’s observations of Mars .
A globe of the planet Mars made during the early 20th century based on his observations [ is ] also located there [ along with ] the original plates and the blank comparator that Clyde used to discover the planet Pluto !
[ The public is able to ] use a similar blank comparator to watch the faint white dot move against the background stars to see the first observations of Pluto .
In those days there were [ not ] any exact methods available to determine the size of Pluto at that distance from the Sun , but estimations varied from the size of Neptune to [ a planet the size of ]
Earth as a means of believing it had to be the cause and massive enough to affect Neptune ’s orbit .
Today though we now know a lot more about Pluto from when it was discovered back on this day [ Feb 18 , 1930 ] and that Pluto is much smaller than the Earth ’s Moon .
Tombaugh worked at the observatory from 1929 until 1945 and then worked for White Sands Missile Test Range in the 1950s .
[ He ] then taught Astronomy at New Mexico State University from 1955 until his retirement in 1973 and passed away in Las Cruces , NM in 1997 .
The Asteriod 1604 Tombaugh [ discovered in 1931 ] is named after him .
One of the byproducts of his research in the search for ‘ Planet X ’ was the discovery of some 14 asteriods starting with 2839 Annette .
He received the Jackson – Gwilt medal from the Royal Astronomical Society in 1931 and one ounce of his ashes from his cremated remains were placed in the New Horizons Probe on its 2015 redezvous flyby with Pluto .
The Jackson – Gwilt medal is awarded [ by the Royal Astronomical Society ] to those who have contributed in improvements , inventions , and new techniques and instrumentation in observational Astronomy or research into the history of Astronomy .
Today that Astrograph telescope is now known as the ‘ Discovery Pluto Telescope ’ .
So Remember that today Feb 18 , 2010 is the 80th Anniversary of the discovery of Pluto by Clyde Tombaugh !

Haggis , traditionally eaten on Burns night , is banned in the US The US government said it is planning to relax the ban on imported meats which prevents the sale of haggis .
The Scottish government said it was greatly encouraged by the move , which was also welcomed by haggis producers .
The ban was introduced in 1989 because of concerns about the safety of British meat during the BSE scare .
On the eve of Burns night , the US Department of Agriculture said new regulations were being drafted , in line with international standards .
' Greatly encouraged '
Imports of Scotland 's iconic dish were banned by the US 21 years ago because it contains offal ingredients such as sheep lungs .
In the words of Scotland 's bard Robert Burns in his Ode to a haggis , the US could be said to have looked down with " sneering , scornful view " on the " great chieftain o' the puddin ' - race " .
The dish is traditionally served with neeps and tatties on Burns night ( 25 January ) .
In my experience when I have encountered American tourists in Scotland they absolutely loved it
Jo MacSween
Haggis maker Scottish Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead said : " I am greatly encouraged to hear that the US authorities are planning a review of the unfair ban on haggis imports .
" We are in regular contact with the industry on this issue and believe that reversing the ban would deliver a vote of confidence in Scottish producers , and allow American consumers to sample our world renowned national dish .
" An increasing number of people at home and abroad are recognising the fact that the Saltire is a stamp of quality .
" It 's time for the US authorities to deliver a Burns Night boost and recognise that Scottish haggis is outstanding quality produce . "
Jo MacSween , co-director of Macsween Haggis , said it would come as good news to expats and tourists .
She said : " I 'm very excited by this news .
" In my experience when I have encountered American tourists in Scotland they absolutely loved it .
" So they will be delighted that next time they come to visit they can not only take it back but hopefully manufacturers like us will actually start shipping it there too . "
Ms MacSween said sales of haggis were no longer confined to the Burns Night season in January .
The company has also diversified into products such as haggis nachos , she said .

Worker - owners from the We Can Do It ! co-op went to Washington recently to participate in the Hispanic Caucus Public Policy conference .
From left to right : Teresa Perez , Margarita Pavon , Inocente Ponce , Daniela Salazar , Alicia Chavez , Patricia Mora , Monica Valerio and Luz Maria Hernandez .
In 2006 , Latina immigrants in Brooklyn , N.Y. formed a housekeepers ' co-op to avoid exploitation , according to Vanessa Bransburg , cooperative coordinator of the Center for Family Life .
With the help of the community organization , 19 women from Mexico and the Dominican Republic formed We Can Do It ! , or Si Se Puede ! , a slogan used by organized workers in Latin American and California .
" A lot of these people really had the entrepreneurial spirit , but a lot of them do n't really have up to high school education , so they were n't able to get a traditional job , " said Bransburg .
" Instead of following somebody else 's rules , they wanted to be the bosses . "
The Center acts as their agent , with 100 % of the cleaning fees going to the workers , who pay $ 40 in monthly dues to cover marketing costs .
The organization has spun off two other worker co-ops : Beyond Care , with 19 child care workers , and Émigré Gourmet , a cooking collective .
All the worker - owners have equal control over marketing and they develop their own relationships with their clients , said Bransburg .
" With all of this happening , they 've been able to withstand the recession and even grow in the last few months , " she said .
The Florida Republican Party is in disarray , with two of its top operatives embroiled in financial scandals that threaten to derail the party ’s efforts to win seats in this year ’s mid-term elections .
Party Chairman Jim Greer is resigning after it was revealed that he had entered into a secret contract with a dummy corporation set up by the Florida GOP ’s executive director , Delmar Johnson .
Under that agreement , Johnson would collect 10 percent of “ all major donations ” to the party , reports the St. Petersburg Times .
ADVERTISEMENT
Greer and Johnson ’s spending on GOP credit cards has also come into question .
Documents obtained by the Times and the Miami Herald show that , among other things , Johnson spent $ 15,000 on a chartered flight to attend the swearing - in of Florida ’s temporary senator , George LeMieux .
Johnson spent $ 1,800 on in - flight catering .
In all , the party ’s executive director racked up more than a million American Express points .
For his part , Johnson has been accused of padding his $ 100,000 salary as executive director with a $ 260,000 fundraising contract , on top of having charged $ 42,000 to the party for expenses .
“ The revelations have rocked the once disciplined Florida GOP , which finds itself consumed with turmoil and controversy when it should be focused on electing Republicans , ” the Times reports .
Making it all worse is the fact that the Florida GOP was “ hemorrhaging money ” as Greer and Johnson reportedly padded their salaries with lavish spending .
In fact , last fall , “ Greer made a show of rescinding the party credit cards of top elected officials and cutting up his American Express card last summer to stem criticism of party spending , ” the Times reports .
But the spending continued .
ADVERTISEMENT
Republican Florida lawmakers are distancing themselves from the scandal - plagued operatives .
Governor Charlie Crist has called for the party to release its credit card records .
But the state ’s attorney general , Bill McCollum , who himself has gubernatorial ambitions , has disputed that , saying that the party ’s internal finances are its own business , the Associated Press reports .
The party operatives hoping to replace Greer as chairman are pushing for more transparency .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s time to come clean , ” state Sen .
Paula Docker declared , arguing the party should release all its financial records .
The financial scandals could also have a negative effect on Gov. Crist , who hand - picked Greer for the state party chairman job .
Crist admitted Tuesday that the revelation about Johnson “ does n’t look good , ” and was noncommittal when asked if he still thought Greer was the right choice .

“ Well , you know , I think originally he did a great job , worked very hard , and tried to do the very best that he could , ” Crist said , as quoted at Tampa Bay ’s Buzz blog .

Ford sales up 43 percent
Which is a long way of saying that Ford 's February sales put the Dearborn automaker solidly in first place among automakers , squeaking past General Motors by 471 units and solidly trouncing the beleaguered Toyota .
Ford 's U.S. sales rose 43 percent against this month last year , while GM 's rose just 12 percent and Toyota 's fell 9 percent , due in part to several models having been pulled off sale until they could be fixed to resolve accelerator design problems that led to a massive recall .
The nature of Ford 's achievement is illustrated by the last time its monthly sales beat GM , in July 1998 -- when GM production had been shut down by a United Auto Workers strike .
It 's all about product
Ford [ NYSE : F ] is riding a resurgence of well - reviewed products , including its 2010 Fusion and Fusion Hybrid midsize sedans .
Ford is swiftly launching more fuel efficient and smaller engines -- with direct injection and turbocharging -- under the EcoBoost label , fitting them first to the 2010 Lincoln MKS sedan and MKT crossover and to the Ford Flex crossover and Taurus SHO performance sedan .
Its revamped 2011 Edge crossover will offer a 2.0 - liter EcoBoost four , and it has already shown its subcompact 2011 Fiesta and compact 2012 Focus - - both offered as four - door sedans and five - door hatchbacks -- to great acclaim .
No government dollars
Then there 's the fact that unlike GM and Chrysler , Ford did not go through bankruptcy and receive billions of dollars of government loans to enable it to survive and restructure .
Instead , in 2006 , then - new CEO Alan Mulally took out " the world 's largest home equity loan " -- $ 23 billion -- to pay for a total overhaul of the company 's product lines and technology .
The results of that investment are now showing up in showrooms .
And they 're paying off .
Place your bets now ...
GM has been first in U.S. annual sales for 78 consecutive years , though it lost its global sales crown to Toyota in 2008 .
But after bankruptcy , shedding four brands , and several management shakeups , it sells only slightly more than half the units it did three years ago .
Whether its sales slump will be permanent or it can fight its way back to dominance seems a very open question , this month .
Can Ford keep up the pace ?
Could it even beat GM for the year ?

Every morning at 6 a.m. , Brenda Duchemin kneels down on two plush throw pillows in front of a carved teak shrine in her Diamond Bar home and chants .
In front of a cluster of oranges , a small teacup and a golden lotus flower on the shrine , the slight 53 - year - old tries to expel the negative images : the two homes she and her husband , Mohammad Ashraf , lost to foreclosure auctions last month , the bankruptcy petition they were forced to file in 2009 , and their ongoing battle to stay in their spacious and airy home , which is furnished with soft blankets , leather couches and Elvis commemorative plates on the walls .
Daily chanting helps her karma , Duchemin says , which is currently not in such a good state .
“ We do n’t know what we did in a past life to bring this out , ” she said , a slight Boston accent tinting her speech .
“ I must have been a horrendous person down the line . ”
Though signs of recovery in the housing market are emerging , thousands of people throughout the Southland are still in a precarious position on the brink of foreclosure , struggling with monthly bills and mortgage payments .
Duchemin and Ashraf are an extreme example because they ’ve gone through foreclosures on two homes and are in danger of losing a third .
They are n’t alone :
Flimsy lending practices mean that thousands of other borrowers face the prospect of repeated foreclosures , mortgage and foreclosure experts said .
The problem is especially visible in areas that attracted speculative buyers during the boom .
In Maricopa County in Arizona , which includes Phoenix , at least 283 individuals have received a foreclosure notice on two or more properties since 2006 , according to data provided by RealtyTrac Inc .
Multiple foreclosures are “ probably more common in this decade than they ’ve ever been because everyone was running to get into the real estate investing business , ” said Rick Sharga , a senior vice president at RealtyTrac .
Clark County in Nevada , another area that attracted house flippers , had at least 179 buyers who were foreclosed on more than once over the same period , the data show .
A RealtyTrac spokesman said the actual numbers were probably larger than the estimates provided , because some of the data were private .
The search only looked at multiple foreclosures within the seven counties that the firm studied -- Maricopa , Clark , Los Angeles , Orange , Riverside , San Bernardino and San Diego .
“ It was n’t unusual to allow folks to buy not only two homes but three , four or five , ” said Sean O’Toole , founder of data - tracking firm ForeclosureRadar .
Because people thought the price of real estate would keep climbing , O’Toole said , they figured that the more homes they bought , the more they ’d earn eventually .
“ In a lot of cases , you had folks in this gold rush mentality : ‘ Real estate is going up , the more houses I buy , the more money I ’ll make . ’ ”
The practice appears to have been less common in areas with higher prices and fewer speculative buyers .
Los Angeles County , where Duchemin and Ashraf live , had just 135 people with multiple foreclosures , despite having significantly more foreclosures overall than Maricopa or Clark counties .
Duchemin and Ashraf say they are anything but flippers .
Had not both their health and the economy taken bad turns , they say , their finances would have been able to support their real estate investments .
The couple bought their Diamond Bar house for $ 550,000 in 2006 , hoping to finance the purchase by selling their town home in Brea -- a sale that never materialized , they say , because of the housing crash .
The year before , they ’d also bought a $ 340,000 home in Las Vegas as a retirement property , which they rented to a tenant until last year .
At the time of the purchases , their only sources of income were workers ’ compensation insurance payments and Social Security , but that was n’t a problem for the lender .
“ We do n’t know how much longer we can keep going , ” Duchemin said , stroking their white Maltipoo , Sugar , one of four dogs the couple keep segregated in various areas of their house because the pets fight .
Ashraf , a warehouse supervisor , was injured in 2003 and had to have three discs replaced in his back .
The surgery went poorly :
He was in the intensive care unit for six days and had a stroke during that time .
He now takes fistfuls of medicine each day , and has been even more subdued since his father died in Pakistan in 2008 .
Duchemin was hit by an 18 - wheeler truck in 1994 and has suffered severe seizures since then , although she had a device inserted in her chest to stem the seizures .
Ashraf is just a shell of the man he once was , Duchemin says .
“ This is a man who took pride in supporting me , making me feel like I was a queen -- he was one of the strongest men I ever met , ” said Duchemin , who has voluminous brown hair and carefully sculpted eyebrows .
“ To see him go from that to an invalid . . . . " she said , trailing off .
Ashraf ’s workers ’ comp payments were cut in half in 2008 , hampering the couple ’s ability to pay any of their three mortgages .
Duchemin , who has worked as a teacher ’s assistant , a marketer for a chiropractic office and a locksmith , among other things , started looking for work last year but has n’t had any luck .
Now she ’s applying for jobs that a high school student would be overqualified for , she says .
She ’s tired of hearing people say the economic downturn is ending .
“ There is no recovery , ” she said .
Though they were heartened by the news that the government was trying to help homeowners , the couple does n’t have much hope for mortgage help .
They informed Washington Mutual in March 2008 that they were in trouble and asked for a modification on the Diamond Bar home , but tried to pay the mortgages on all three of their houses , missing a payment here , a payment there .
They eventually lost the Brea town house and Las Vegas home to foreclosure , and both properties went up for auction last month .
Duchemin and Ashraf say they are doing everything they can to keep their Diamond Bar house .
They filed for bankruptcy protection in July in the hope that it would enable them to keep the house .
They ’ve been to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles three times since October to get their bankruptcy confirmed , but each time a problem has arisen .
The next date is Monday .
To keep making payments on their home , they sold their Toyota Tacoma and family jewelry , including a gold anchor necklace Ashraf had since he served in the merchant marine .
They canceled every service they could except for the Internet , which allows Ashraf to keep in touch with his family in Pakistan .
Duchemin rides her bike everywhere to save money on gas -- when she goes out .
Mostly they stay at home , worrying that the water or electricity will be turned off soon .
If they are forced to move , the two do n’t know where they ’ll come up with a deposit for a new place -- filing for bankruptcy has ruined their credit .
“ We ca n’t afford to stay in our home , but we ca n’t afford to move , ” Duchemin said .
They ’re entrenched for now : Board games are stacked up on tables , crystal figurines shine on display in a case , and the four bedrooms are packed full of stuff , including Duchemin ’s artwork and teddy bears bigger than a toddler .
But every day finds them on edge , waiting to see what happens next .
They spend their days trying to appreciate the home they love , with its hand - laid brick walkway , fig and lemon trees in the yard and “ Wizard of Oz ” paintings on the walls , wondering what went wrong .
“ I ca n’t provide the way I used to provide everything for .
. . .
Excuse me , ” Ashraf said , breaking down .
“ For my family , ” he continued .
“ And I just -- at this point , I do n’t know what I ’m going to do . ”

For the past 12 hours , app developers have been getting notices from Apple saying that their apps have been taken down , due to a new policy that bans all " overtly sexual content " .
Apple has a history of making sudden changes to its policies and removing apps , but a developer we spoke to said that the scale of the current purge is unprecedented .
On the Go Girls , for example , has had 17 apps removed so far , about half of its total portfolio .
The latest notice came less than an hour ago , so the clean - up is still in full swing .
Jens Ltd , another top adult developer , has only one app remaining .
Developers were not warned of the new policy in advance , and it is unclear what prompted it .
This could be a major financial setback to adult app companies , most of which are very small .
But they do n't anticipate going out of business .
" It 's not like pictures of beautiful women in bikinis suddenly became irrelevant , " one developer told us .
Established brands are n't safe from the purge either .
For the moment , Playboy 's latest app is still up , but a number of Maxim apps have disappeared .
Apple has so far refused to confirm or deny a policy shift .
The only statement from the company thus far states : " Whenever we receive customer complaints about objectionable content we review them .
If we find these apps contain inappropriate material we remove them and request the developer make any necessary changes in order to be distributed by Apple . "
Apple has not responded to a request for clarification .

Gauthier Lefevre was seized near the Chadian border last October
The longest - held foreign hostage in the Sudanese region of Darfur has said he was not mistreated , but faced a " daily struggle " to stay positive .
Gauthier Lefevre , a 35 - year - old French - British aid worker , spoke about his 147 - day ordeal in the Sudanese capital Khartoum , two days after his release .
He said he was moved around regularly , and had been held in mountain camps or isolated in vast expanses of savannah .
He said Sudanese agents eventually made contact and rescued him by helicopter .
Mr Lefevre , who works for the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , was the last foreign hostage being held in Darfur .
He was seized by gunmen near the Chadian border last October .
Although a major Darfur rebel group last month signed a peace deal with the government , the region remains unstable and armed robberies and low - level crime are rife .
Mr Lefevre said he fought feelings of despair during his captivity .
" You do spend a lot of time sitting on a dirty blanket and not having much to do and wondering about what is going on , when you will be released , what will happen , " he said .
" You feel the time stops and it is difficult to remind yourself that of course the ICRC colleagues and lot of people are involved in trying to secure my release . "
He said his captors appeared to be organised criminals as " it was pretty clear they were just after money " and had no intention of harming him .
The ICRC's Sudan spokesman , Saleh Dabbakeh , has said that no ransom was paid despite the abductors ' demands .
Mr Lefevre said his rescue was sudden .
He was approached by two Sudanese security agents one evening when he was left alone for the night at his camp .
" [ They ] turned up and said ' Let 's go ' .
We walked for about three hours , a car was waiting for us and we drove through the night and got to the helicopter ...
There was no violence at all . "
Mr Lefevre said he plans to return to Paris before flying on to his wife 's native Australia .

Toronto taxpayers are not contributing to the costs of Tuesday ’s funeral for troubled former child star Corey Haim , a city spokesman says .
“ The city of Toronto has never received an application for assistance with the funeral costs for Mr. Haim , ” Kevin Sack said in a statement released Monday morning .
“ While the city would normally not confirm or deny the existence of an application for assistance with funeral benefits as this is a matter covered by privacy regulations , given the number of reports , the City has chosen to confirm the facts in this matter . ”
An uproar began after Haim ’s mother , Judy , was quoted in a report from Los Angeles on the website of Access Hollywood as saying the city of Toronto would be “ covering ” the funeral costs of Toronto - born and raised Haim , 38 , who died Wednesday in Burbank , Calif .
Haim shot to fame as a teen heartthrob in the 1980s movies License to Drive and The Lost Boys .
He later struggled with well - publicized drug addiction and declared bankruptcy in 1997 .
Sack , the city ’s director of strategic communications , told the Star Sunday that he could neither confirm nor deny the claim because of privacy laws .
Toronto ’s employment and social services department pays provides financial help “ on behalf of deceased city residents who do not have enough funds in their estate to fully cover funeral costs , ” the department ’s website states .
But the Haim story was picked up by news and entertainment outlets across the city and the rest of North America , prompting the Monday morning clarification .
At the time of his death , Haim was reportedly living with his mother in Los Angeles , taking care of her as she battled cancer .
He was making some money by selling things personal items to a celebrity auction website and making personal appearances at fan conventions .
A notice on a Haim fan MySpace page from Saturday states : “ It appears that we may now have raised enough money to cover all the expenses of Corey 's funeral !!
Many thanks to all who donated ! ”
Michael Kronick , who runs the Startifacts celebrity auction website , told the Star on Sunday that he is going to give Haim ’s mom $ 20,000 as a gift to help with expenses from her son ’s death .
The private service will be held Tuesday at a Jewish funeral home in Thornhill .
An administrator said the funeral home will help defray the funeral costs if the family needs help .
Corey Feldman , Haim ’s sidekick back in his child - star days and later co-star in the reality show The Two Coreys , released a statement Sunday saying that he wo n’t go to the funeral out of respect for the family ’s wishes .
Feldman also urged media outlets to stay away from the funeral .
" In the days following my best friend Corey Haim 's death , I have spent much time with his mother Judy , who has always been like a mother to me , " the statement said .
" I would love nothing more than to be by her side at Corey 's funeral , however due to their strong religious beliefs , and need for privacy , the family has decided to make Corey 's funeral on Tuesday a small , private affair . "
Instead , Feldman will help plan a public memorial in L.A .

MANISTEE , Mich ./ WACO , Texas / WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Some Tea Partiers say they can pinpoint the precise moment when they made it clear to the Republican Party they had no intention of being its lapdog .

On a bright , brisk afternoon in mid-February , with snow still thick on the ground from storms that had battered Washington the week before , Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele met with more than 50 members of the Tea Party , the Twitter Age conservative movement that is reshaping the U.S. political landscape .
Steele , RNC chairman since January 2009 , had invited them to the plush Capitol Hill Club , built as a clubhouse for the party ’s top brass next door to RNC headquarters .
According to several accounts , not long into the meeting JoAnn Abbott , an activist from Virginia who calls herself the ‘ Tea Party Grandma , ’ raised her hand to ask a question .
She asked about a web page on the RNC site where visitors could send their member of Congress a postcard with a tea bag .
On the tag at the end of the string were the letters ‘ RNC . ’
“ Respectfully , sir , while we do not have a trademark on the tea bag , you are well aware that people associate it with the Tea Party movement , ” Abbott , 50 , recalls saying to Steele .
“ If you co-opt that image , you damage our brand and weaken our movement . ”
Lest there was any confusion , she added : “ It does not belong to you , it belongs to us as an independent movement . ”
Abbott said within an hour of the end of the meeting the page ( www.teaparty.gop.com) was gone -- and the Grand Old Party was finally aware of conservative frustrations she and others felt with Republican leadership .
“ The GOP now knows we ’re not asleep anymore , ” Abbott told Reuters .
“ The giant has been awakened . ”
RNC officials said Steele , who according to Abbott and others agreed at the time to hold regional meetings with Tea Party groups around the country , was traveling and unable to comment for this story .
But on Fox News the day after the meeting , Steele described the meeting as part of a “ healing process ” with people disaffected with Republican leaders .
Part of the process includes “ acknowledging where we have gone wrong , where we have made the mistakes in spending , in growing the size of government , in stepping away from those very constitutional principles and values that have certainly defined this party , ” he said .
CONSTITUTIONAL CONSERVATIVES
Accounts of that February 16 meeting challenge a common perception that the Tea Party movement was founded , funded and dominated by the Republican Party .
Most of them are current or former Republicans -- up to 80 percent or more , with the rest split between Democrats , independents and Libertarians .
And the movement has received help from conservative groups like FreedomWorks , which has provided training and logistical support to Tea Party groups and hopes the movement will boost fiscal conservatives in congressional midterm elections .
But Tea Partiers insist that they are not beholden to the GOP and warn that Republican candidates counting on an endorsement from them in November may well be disappointed .
Interviews with Tea Partiers across the country paint a picture of a genuine , amorphous , conservative grassroots movement united by three core principles : constitutionally limited government , free market ideology and low taxes .
The American Constitution is a rallying cry and many now dub themselves “ constitutional conservatives . ”
They are angry not just at what they describe as the socialist policies of U.S. President Barack Obama .
They also feel Republican politicians have betrayed the party ’s ideals .
For many in the movement , purging the party of moderate Republicans is a major goal .
“ I used to be a dyed - in - the - wool Republican .
Now if we have a Republican lined up to come to our meetings , I do n’t even want to go , ” said Nate Friedl , 41 , a member of the Rock River Patriots , a Tea Party group in southern Wisconsin .
Following a first year marked by protests , the movement is evolving .
The political novices of a year ago are forming coalitions and learning how to change things from the ground up .
After rallying against government bailouts and Obama ’s healthcare reforms , as well as mobilizing the vote for key electoral races such as Republican Scott Brown ’s victory in Massachusetts in January , many Tea Partiers feel empowered .
“ Tea Party people have realized that you cannot change the system by protesting on the outside , ” said Richard Viguerie , author of ‘ Conservatives Betrayed : How George W. Bush and Other Big Government Republicans Hijacked the Conservative Cause . ’
The movement is also debating whether to remain independent -- or stage a conservative takeover of the Republican Party .
And some , a tiny minority , favor becoming a third party .
“ The two - party system is too ingrained in America , ” said Rod Merrill , head of the Ludington Tea Party in western Michigan .
“ Every time someone has tried to form a third party , it has failed . ”
An Ipsos / Reuters poll shows that although a majority of Democrats and a plurality of independents voters would support Tea Party candidates , less than one third of Republicans would support them as a third party .
Regardless of the debate ’s outcome , Tea Partiers are targeting not just prominent Democrats in the midterms but also key moderate Republicans like Charlie Crist in Florida and former presidential candidate John McCain in Arizona .
United as never before by the internet and weekly conference calls , conservatives are eyeing a few “ national ” primary races .
“ The Tea Party movement needs champions , ” said Larry Sabato , a professor of politics at the University of Virginia .
“ They have to be able to say ‘ We ’re the reason they got elected . ’
Otherwise the movement may dissipate . ”
The Tea Party movement has resonated with many Americans , as demonstrated by a March 15 Rasmussen Reports poll putting Tea Party candidates in third place with 21 percent approval among voters behind the Republicans at 27 percent and the Democrats at 34 percent .
A December poll had put the movement in second place ahead of the Republicans .
Some Republican politicians have actively courted Tea Partiers , whose fiscal conservative focus is close to the Republicans ’ stated principles .
Democrat politicians have largely shunned the movement .
“ This year the momentum is away from the Democrats as they ’re the party in power , so Republican candidates espousing Tea Party views in general have a better chance in the midterms , ” Sabato said .
“ But movements like this have come and gone before , so it ’s still too early to say if the movement will survive long term . ”
In the near term , the mostly white movement faces a possible showdown with the religious right over divisive social issues .
But its biggest challenge lies in tackling its extremist fringe , including those who equate Obama with Hitler and the “ birther ” movement that doubts Obama ’s U.S. citizenship and the legitimacy of his presidency .
“ The majority of Americans can agree with the core principles of the Tea Party movement , ” said Ned Ryun , president of American Majority , a conservative group that has provided training programs for Tea Party groups .
“ But if it allows itself to be defined by its extremist fringe , then it ’s lost . ”
THIS REVOLUTION WILL BE TELEVISED
Around 11 pm local time on November 4 , 2008 , America ’s first black president - elect strode out onto a stage in Grant Park in downtown Chicago and told a cheering crowd of about 250,000 that “ change has come to America . ”
Some 40 miles away in the suburb of Grayslake , local businesswoman Janelle Nagy sat up in bed watching Obama ’s victory speech in horror , her bedcovers tucked tightly under her chin .
“ I told my husband how afraid I was for America , ” she said , her hands held close to her face as if still clutching a blanket like a scared child .
“ Obama said he wants to fundamentally change America .
But I do n’t want to fundamentally change this country . ”
“ I love America the way it is , ” added Nagy , now a leader of the Northern Illinois Patriots .
Tea Partiers across the country recall a growing sense of anger well before presidential election night in 2008 , as outgoing President George W. Bush helped prop up the teetering U.S. financial sector amid the worst downturn since the 1930s and issued emergency loans to struggling automakers General Motors and Chrysler .
Under Obama , the government took stakes in both companies .
“ I remember just screaming at the TV , ” said Tanya Bachand , 35 , a trial lawyer and Connecticut state coordinator for the Tea Party Patriots .
“ I was frustrated long before Obama came along because of how much the government grew under Bush .
To me Obama was like Bush , only much worse . ”
The moment that launched the Tea Party came a shortly after Obama took office .
On cable business channel CNBC , on February 19 , host Rick Santelli launched into an impromptu tirade from his regular slot at the Chicago Board of Trade against plans to help struggling homeowners .
Santelli proposed a tea party in Chicago in July to protest government bailouts .
This was a reference to the Boston Tea Party , an act of protest against the British government over taxation in 1773 , a moment that has resonated throughout American history .
“ The Rant , ” as Santelli ’s monologue has become known , struck a chord with conservatives .
“ If we had n’t had all of those bailouts the economy would be back on track by now , ” said Tina Dupont , a founding member of the Tea Party of West Michigan .
“ The jobs would be back , companies would be coming back .
If they ’d let the banks and others collapse , we would have had a short , sharp downturn . ”
The consensus among economists is that had the U.S. government and Federal Reserve not propped up the markets , a global depression would likely have ensued .
Yet Dupont and others profess an unshakable belief in the power of the free market .
To them , government intervention makes crises only worse .
They argue runaway government spending threatens America ’s future .
Tea Partiers say Santelli spoke to a deep - seated anger among conservatives who felt betrayed by the Republican politicians they had believed in .
Many want big government spending programs like social security scrapped .
“ Social security is socialism , ” said Jim Chase , 80 , a retiree on social security , who is a member of the Ludington Tea Party .
“ If we do n’t stop all this spending , we wo n’t have anything left for our grandchildren . ”
Chase said he would rather have a system where Americans were able to invest their social security payments themselves , an idea not unlike President Bush ’s proposal to privatize social security .
So when Santelli let rip , fiscal conservatives were eager to answer the call .
“ It was n’t like all of a sudden we woke up and said we need a Tea Party , ” said Amy Kremer , 49 , one of the founders of the Atlanta Tea Party .
“ This came after years of rumblings through the conservative world .
The fuel was already there and he ( Santelli ) just lit the fuse . ”
A small group of conservatives on Twitter instantly took up the Tea Party theme and in a conference call on February 20 they planned tea parties for the following week .
On Friday February 27 , 2009 , a total of 48 tea parties were held around the country and coordinators estimated turnout at 35,000 people .
Mark Meckler , 48 , a lawyer in Sacramento and independent who was a Republican until eight years ago , threw a party on February 27 thinking he would have six attendees .
Instead , 150 people showed up .
“ That inspired me to keep going , ” he said .
Jenny Beth Martin , a former Republican activist in Atlanta , was on the original conference call and said after the surprising success of February 27 , a second round was planned for April 15 , the day American ’s taxes are due .
Activists used Facebook to spread the word .
“ It went viral , ” said Brendan Steinhauser , director of federal and state campaigns at FreedomWorks .
“ It was a beautiful moment for us because it ’s not like you could create that if you wanted to . ”

FreedomWorks , which is in frequent contact with up to 2,000 local leaders , estimates 3 million to 5 million people have participated in Tea Party meetings or donated money .
Martin said according to local organizers , on April 15 some 1.2 million people attended 850 tea parties .
Martin and Meckler are now national coordinators of the Tea Party Patriots , a grouping of more than 1,200 local Tea Party groups .
Following the early rallies , the Tea Party movement evolved quickly , cheered on avidly by right wing commentators , above all Glenn Beck on cable channel Fox News .
“ The past year has been like drinking out of a fire hydrant , ” Martin said .
“ Everything has moved so fast . ”
Early on Tea Partiers found an enduring target in the Obama administration ’s attempts to reform the healthcare system .
Highly publicized and frequently angry confrontations with members of Congress at “ town hall ” meetings in the summer became a hallmark of the Tea Party ’s first year .
“ I WAS NOT ALONE ”
A common thread to tales of Tea Partiers is that in the early months they discovered others felt the same and , all of a sudden , they felt empowered .
Tanya Bachand traveled to New York for the February 27 Tea Party event in New York and was surprised at how many conservatives there were in a liberal city .
“ I did n’t even vote in the last midterm elections because I felt so disillusioned , ” she said .
“ But all of a sudden I felt I was not alone . ”
Bachand returned to Connecticut and started her own Tea Party group .
She recalls an early meeting where a biker , a preacher and a businessman in a suit sat together on her living room couch .
“ They had absolutely nothing in common , except they wanted to do what ’s right for this country , ” she said .
Bachand ’s group teamed up with others in the state -- from gun rights to anti-abortion groups -- to form the Connecticut Patriot Alliance .
“ Everybody in the alliance has their own particular bugaboo , ” she said .
“ But we all agree on the Constitution , so we work together on the big issues . ”
They focused on local Senator Chris Dodd , the Democrat chairman of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee .
“ Every time Chris Dodd set foot in the state , between us we had 50 to 100 people waiting to protest , ” Bachand said .
“ We made a real statement . ”
In Waco , Texas , the town ’s Tea Party group blocked a local bailout .
According to local media reports , in October the Waco City council approved a $ 700,000 loan to keep a local high - tech firm afloat under new ownership .
But when the Waco Tea Party got wind of the decision , they mobilized to prevent it .
“ It made me mad , ” recalled leadership council member Lisa Dickison , a mild - mannered woman who looks incapable of anger .
Waco Tea Party head Toby Marie Walker said five or six members went to a county commissioner meeting , where the bailout was due to be approved .
Walker said their presence alone led the commissioners to stop the bail out .
“ We just had to show up and they knew why we were there , ” she said .
The healthcare debate is where conservative Tea Partiers feel they have had most impact .
They are convinced they forced Republicans into opposing the reform and felt they were a crucial factor in getting Scott Brown elected to the Senate seat left vacant by the death of Ted Kennedy .
“ On a conference call in December someone said maybe Brown could win and that we should get behind him , ” Meckler of the Tea Party Patriots said .
“ The idea gained momentum from there . ”
People like retirees Calvin and Linda Dykstra wanted to eliminate the Democrats ’ 60 - seat , filibuster - proof majority that helped healthcare reform pass a vote in late December .
They drove from western Michigan to Massachusetts in January and spent a week campaigning for Brown .
Speaking at a Tea Party meeting in Manistee , Michigan , the two beamed and blushed like newlyweds , despite being in their mid-60s .
“ Not everyone had the time or the money to do what we did , but we felt we had to stop the socialist government takeover of healthcare , ” said Calvin , a former physician .
GETTING ORGANIZED
As the movement has grown , coalitions have formed .
In Michigan , Tea Party groups have formed the Michigan Tea Party Alliance with supporters of Glenn Beck ’s 9.12 Project -- a conservative group that wants America to resume the spirit of unity of September 12 , 2001 , the day after the September 11 attacks .
“ The movement is beginning to coalesce around a core set of principles -- constitutionally limited government , free market ideology and low taxes , ” said Tony Raymond , who was laid off at consulting company Accenture in March 2009 and is now a leader of the Northern Illinois Patriots .
The Tea Party Patriots now have two paid national coordinators -- Jenny Beth Martin and Mark Meckler -- whose salaries come from member contributions .
“ I only started getting paid last month , ” Meckler said .
“ I went through my life savings to get to this point and my family has really suffered . ”
“ I was working for the movement 100 hours a week and they either had to start paying me or I ’d have to go back to work . ”
There is a mentoring program to teach novice local leaders how to organize , as more than 200 new groups have joined them since the beginning of 2010 .
Staff at FreedomWorks believe the movement ’s expansion is largely behind it , but American Majority ’s Ryun said “ the Tea Party is going to continue to grow until the country gets back on the right track . ”
Other volunteer groups have stepped in to aid conservatives in their quest for ideological purity .
Utah - based Independence Caucus , for instance , vets conservative candidates using a questionnaire containing 80 questions based on the U.S. Constitution .
Candidates who answer yes to at least 70 percent of those questions are interviewed by local conservatives .
If they pass muster , Independence Caucus backs their candidacy .
“ But if we find someone is a chameleon and was lying , our policy is we ’ll work twice as hard to remove them from office as we did to get them elected , ” said Donald Jakel , the group ’s coordinator for Ohio and Michigan .
Independence Caucus has vetted at least one candidate in half the state and national seats up for grabs in Michigan .
CONSERVATIVE MACHINE
The efforts of Tea Party movement have also been backed by some well - funded conservative groups .
FreedomWorks , headed by former Republican House Majority leader Dick Armey , says it was involved from the outset .
It helped political novices navigate the bureaucratic requirements of holding a protest , including insurance issues and permits .
The group has provided training for television interview , on meeting congressmen and public relations .
Spokesman Adam Brandon said FreedomWorks ’ budget in 2009 was $ 7 million , up to 70 percent from individual donations , up to 25 percent from foundations and the rest from corporations .
The group does not name donors but said the foundations were those that typically give to conservative libertarian causes .
In 2006 to 2007 FreedomWorks had zero online donations ; in 2009 they had 19,000 individual online donors who contributed more than $ 500,000 in total .
The group hopes to add up to 15 fiscal conservatives in the House of Representatives this year , plus four in the Senate .
Purcellville , Virginia - based group American Majority has also provided training .
It was founded in 2008 with financial backing from the Chicago - based Sam Adams Alliance , which promotes free market principles .
Individual conservatives have given as much as $ 25,000 or as little as $ 100 each .
The group ’s president Ryun said conservative donors are taking a fresh look at the RNC and wondering if their money would be better spent on grassroots conservative groups .
“ The Republican grassroots operation is pretty much defunct , ” he said .
“ Conservatives are looking for a better bang for their buck .
There is going to be more competition for money that has traditionally gone to the RNC and I for one am going to go after that money , hard . ”
FreedomWorks and Our Country Deserves Better , a political action committee that has formed Tea Party Express , have been accused of being GOP operatives , including by other Tea Party groups .
But both groups say their money comes from conservatives .
Tea Party Express is staffed by people from Russo , Marsh & Associates , founded by Sal Russo , who began his political career as an assistant to Ronald Reagan when he was governor of California .
A review of the Federal Election Commission filings from Our Country Deserves Better shows mostly small donations of a few hundred dollars , many of them from retirees .
Joe Wierzbicki of Russo , Marsh & Associates said the GOP was hostile to the Tea Party movement at first .
“ The response from the party establishment was that this was bad , that this would look like sour grapes and paint conservatives in a poor light , ” he said .
More recently , Wierzbicki said the Republican Party has belatedly tried to woo Tea Partiers .
Some Republicans have openly courted the movement , especially Sarah Palin , McCain ’s running mate in 2008 .
She gave the keynote speech at the Tea Party Convention in Nashville in early February .
Organized by Tea Party Nation , the event was derided by some other Tea Party groups as being a GOP front .
“ We like Sarah Palin , she ’s one of us and she speaks to us , ” said Tina Dupont of the Tea Party of West Michigan .
“ But she does not speak for us . ”
Her views were echoed by many .
Most Republicans are not so popular .
“ The Republican Party would like to take over the Tea Party and use it to gain power , ” Tanya Bachand said .
“ It ’s the other way around and they do n’t know what ’s coming . ”
“ Their reckoning is coming . ”
The GOP and individual Republican candidates are actively seeking Tea Party endorsements and votes .
“ At every meeting we have , we see local and state representatives of the Republican Party counting heads and trying to drum up support from our members , ” said Nighta Davis , organizer of the North Georgia Patriots .
“ For six years the Republicans controlled Congress and the White House under Bush and they could have solved this country ’s problems .
But they did nothing of the kind . ”
“ Now they want to co-opt us , ” she added .
“ But they just do n’t get it . ”
Ray Franz , a local Republican politician in western Michigan for three decades , is running for state representative for the 101st district , which includes Manistee .
“ The Republicans and the Tea Party movement are on the same page on most issues , ” he said at a local Tea Party meeting .
“ The party has lost its brand and these conservatives are right to want to hold our feet to the fire and make sure we represent them properly . ”
Adam Kinzinger won the Republican primary to run for Illinois ’ 11th district in the U.S. House of Representatives .
In a blog in early January Eric Odom , executive director of the American Liberty Alliance , described Kinzinger as a “ strong ” Tea Party candidate and recommended readers consider donating to his campaign .
Kinzinger said his campaign saw a major spike in small donations between $ 10 and $ 20 following that blog .
“ I ’m a conservative Republican , and Tea Party people believe in the same things that we do , ” he said .
“ The movement has helped remind the party that it lost track of the Republican principles that I believe in . ”
ENDANGERED RINOS
The polarization of U.S. politics may explain why moderate Republicans are in trouble .
According to the Pew Research Center , as recently as 2004 , 30 percent of Americans were Republicans , but that fell to 23 percent in 2009 .
Conservatives made up 37 percent in 2004 and ended 2009 at the same level .
According to Gallup , conservatives went from 36 percent of the population in 1992 to 40 percent in 2009 , while moderates slid from 43 percent to 36 percent .
Conservatives derisively call moderate Republicans RINOs -- Republican In Name Only .
They are angry at moderates over issues like immigration and the cap and trade climate bill .
Joe Walsh , a Tea Party Republican who won the Republican primary for 8th U.S. congressional district in Illinois , said conservatives in his district are furious .
“ The biggest applause I get from audiences comes when I whack the Republicans over the head for doing the same thing as the Democrats , ” he said .
“ This year , party establishment support could be the kiss of death .
What will matter this year is the support of the rank and file . ”
Ted Schendel , 53 , a semi- retired police officer and a Tea Party Republican , is running against “ four millionaires ” to be the Republican candidate for the 2nd district of Michigan .
“ Just before Christmas I was watching Glenn Beck when I realized that Glenn alone cannot take our country back , ” he said , speaking at the Manistee Tea party meeting .
“ So instead of just shouting at the TV , I decided to run for office . ”
“ I ’m not stupid , I know I ’ve got one almighty mountain to climb , ” he said .
“ The only way I can do it is if I can get the common man behind me . ”
Tea Party Democrats are a rarer breed .
Tim Curtis , 53 , is a former U.S. Marine who owns a UPS Store franchise and is a member of the Tampa 9.12 Project .
He is running as a Democrat for U.S. Congress in Florida ’s 11th district .
“ There are those who believe in bigger , more costly and more intrusive government , ” he said .
“ That ’s not what this country was intended to be .
The Tea Party movement cuts across party lines , as there ’s more uniting us than separating us . ”
According to the Ipsos / Reuters poll , while 49 percent of Republicans said they identify with the Tea Party movement only 11 percent of Democrats said the same .
While there appear to be Tea Party - inspired candidates running as Republicans across the country , there is not yet a clear picture of just how many are out there .
“ We ’ve heard from a lot of them from around the country , but I do n’t think anyone has counted them yet , ” said JB Williams , who runs conservative web site www.freedomforce.us.
“ But we ’ll see more of them as the year goes on . ”
“ This is a movement that is determined to enact change peacefully , ” he added .
“ But if someone tries to stop them , do n’t be surprised if they resort to other means . ”
Many others are getting involved in local politics to push fiscal conservatism , including at the precinct delegate level .
Called a number of different things in different states , this is the lowest elected unit in both political parties .
The average precinct represents 1,100 voters .
They get out the vote and can influence candidate selection .
Selected in primaries , few people vote in these races .
“ In some counties up to 60 percent of these slots are vacant , ” said Philip Glass , a commercial mortgage banker and national director of the National Precinct Alliance .
This volunteer group is mapping the rules nationwide for becoming a precinct delegate to aid conservatives take these seats .
“ The tools for taking over both parties are just lying there waiting to be picked up , ” he said .
In Connecticut both parties use a town committee system .
As a registered Republican , Tanya Bachand went to her Republican town committee and asked how to run .
She was told three of the committee ’s 12 spots were vacant and was asked to take a seat .
“ We have heard the same story many times from across the state , ” she said .
“ This is the way to take over the Republican party from the ground up . ”
Tea party conservatives are also paying attention to key races in other states .
“ Any race in the country can become a national race , ” said Tea Party Patriots ’ Meckler .
The movement has its sights set on a number of RINOs in this year ’s Senate races .
They are backing Marco Rubio against Charlie Crist in Florida , Rand Paul ( the son of Republican Congressman Ron Paul ) against Trey Grayson in Kentucky , Mike Lee in Utah against incumbent Robert Bennett , Chuck DeVore against former Hewlett - Packard CEO Carly Fiorina in California and , last but not least , J.D. Hayworth against McCain .
“ Many people in Arizona feel that John McCain has leaned across the aisle , ” said Kathy Boatman , a member of the East Valley Tea Party in the Phoenix suburb of Gilbert .
“ But the only problem is that when he leans across the aisle ... they pull him down , and sometimes flat on his face . ”
At a Tea Party event in south Miami , everyone favored Rubio , who has a substantial lead over Crist in the polls .
“ Charlie Crist is exactly what we do n’t want , ” said Nancy Meinhardt , a paralegal and a leading light in the Florida Tea Party movement .
“ He ’s a Republican in name only , he ’s not a conservative .
It ’s all a facade . ”
While some Tea Party groups endorse candidates , others steadfastly do not .
“ We leave that to individual groups to decide on a local level whether to endorse someone , ” Tea Party Patriots ’ Meckler said .
Tea Party candidates did not fare well in the Texas primaries in early March , though James Henson , a politics professor at the University of Texas , said the state is a “ low tax , low service , small government environment . ”
“ Texas is already Tea Party country , ” he said .
“ You ’d have to represent some fairly extreme views to push Republicans here further to the right . ”
“ In the midterms I would n’t be surprised to see Tea Party voters hold their noses and vote for the Republican candidates who won the primaries . ”
In the primaries in Illinois in early February , with the exception of Joe Walsh , Tea Party candidates fared badly .
Tony Raymond of the Northern Illinois Patriots said Tea Partiers were kicking themselves for not getting involved sooner .
“ We missed the boat and are now stuck with some candidates we ’d rather not vote for , ” he said .
Chris Merrill , a conservative radio host in Kansas City , said even if candidates are not running specifically as Tea Party candidates many are running on fiscal conservative platforms .
“ In some years the Tea Party message would not have resonated like it does this year , ” he said .
“ It ’s hard to say how many Tea Party candidates will get elected , but we will see more fiscal conservatives . ”
“ We ’ll have to wait and see whether that will still be the case in 2012 . ”
BATTLES AHEAD
Of the possible challenges ahead for the Tea Party movement the two main ones are not from the left , but from the right .
The first comes from social conservatives , or the religious right .
The Tea Party movement is dominated by fiscal conservatives and leaders like Eric Odom of the American Liberty Alliance say social issues like abortion and gay marriage should be avoided .
When asked about abortion , for instance , Tina Dupont of the Tea Party of West Michigan says the group does not discuss it .
“ Most of us are probably pro-lifers , ” she said .
“ But we avoid the topic because it is so divisive . ”
This has been noted by some on the religious right .
“ At the national level you have people saying it is all about fiscal issues and not about social issues because they say they are divisive , ” said Tony Perkins , president of Christian lobby group the Family Research Council .
Chris Merrill said while Tea Partiers can avoid divisive issues at meetings , they cannot if they run for office .
“ Running a campaign is different , ” he said .
“ At some point they have to take a stand on social issues . ”
Some say a showdown between social and fiscal conservative groups may be inevitable .
“ Fiscal conservatives want to limit the size of government , social conservatives want to use government to further their agenda , ” Henson said .
“ That will likely cause problems . ”
The other problem is the extreme fringe of the Tea Party movement , which was evident at a demonstration outside the Detroit auto show on a snowy day in January .
More than half of the 20 or so protesters held signs protesting government bailouts .
The rest held placards with black and white pictures of President Obama ’s face , with a Hitler mustache added .
Within minutes , both groups had moved to opposite corners of their allotted patch of concrete .
Andrew Moylan of the National Taxpayers Union said with evident discomfort he had tried unsuccessfully to get rid of the Obama - as - Hitler posters .
“ I oppose Obama ’s policies vehemently , I do n’t agree with what he is trying to do , ” he said .
“ But I believe that he is well - intentioned , even if he is dead wrong . ”
“ Comparing him to Hitler is not only wrong on so many levels , it also reflects badly on us because all the pictures in the papers and on TV will be of them , ” he added .
“ Our message will get lost in that . ”
Those who argued here that Obama is like Hitler say that healthcare reform would grant doctors the power of life and death over patients , as under the Nazi regime .
The movement has also attracted members of the Council of Conservative Citizens , which supports some white supremacist causes , and from the John Birch Society and the LaRouchies .
In a February 19 column in the Wall Street Journal , former Bush adviser Karl Rove described both as “ fringe groups . ”
“ If tea party groups are to maximize their influence on policy , they must now begin the difficult task of disassociating themselves from cranks and conspiracy nuts , ” Rove wrote .
“ This includes 9/11 deniers , ‘ birthers ’ who insist Barack Obama was not born in the United States , and militia supporters espousing something vaguely close to armed rebellion . ”

Women from the Islamic world are attending the three - day conference
Organiser Abdennur Prado Pavon says the struggle for gender equality in Islamic countries involves refuting chauvinist interpretations of Muslim teachings .
The congress is being held in Spain , organisers say , because they want their message to reach the growing number of Muslim women in Europe .
Around 300 delegates are looking at women 's rights in the Islamic world .
Mr Prado , of the Catalan Islamic board , believes a common misconception in the West is that women 's liberation is not possible in Muslim societies .
Activists representing the Islamic feminist movement are in Barcelona to counter that view and discuss ways of achieving female equality in an Islamic context .
Collaboration
Among the delegates is the Pakistani feminist Riffat Hassan , regarded as one of the pioneers of Islamic feminist theology .
Also here are representatives from the international association , Islamic Feminism .
Islamic Feminism argues that the inferior legal and social status of women in Muslim countries is a result of misogynistic distortions of the teachings in the Koran .
Organisers say they want more collaboration with western feminists but say non-Muslim feminists need to challenge their anti-Islamic stereotypes .
What do you think should be done to address misconceptions of women and Islam ?
The following comments reflect the balance of views received :
It is a common misconception in Western nations that Islam is an inherently oppressive religion with regards to women , but as the Islamic feminists themselves argue , it is the interpretations and cultural influences of the societies in which the religion spread that allowed for the current status for women in Islamic cultures today .
The West is hardly so far advanced from Islam as we would like to believe .
We are just less open in our practices than others .
Carolyn Bailey , Gothenburg , Sweden
The major factor behind discrimination against women in the Muslim world is lack of knowledge about rights and duties as defined in the Holy Quran .
We reject and accept whatever we feel like without even bothering to consult the Quran .
We Muslims should understand that our religion is not just a few praying rituals but a doctrine defining our behaviours and ways of life .
Lack of education and weak financial conditions make men insecure and more liable to turn oppressive , violent and dominant , proving to themselves and others that they are still " Man enough " .
Education and good job opportunities is a way to make them realise that there are better ways to prove themselves " Man " rather than beating their wives .
Shaheera Munir , Lahore , Pakistan
There is a lot of action these days in the context of activism among Muslim women .
This is very gratifying .
I am happy to see that the educated women in Islam are taking the lead .
Some times , it borders on the ridiculous - as when a lady decided to lead Muslim prayers in congregation .
But the movement is gaining momentum - despite false starts like this .
And it is not just the liberated , educated , western Muslim woman - we also have Mukhtar Mai from Pakistan ( in New York at present ) - one can have nothing but admiration for her .
Usman Suleman , Wappingers Falls , NY , USA
It is about time that women 's rights are addressed within Islam without feeling the need to reject Islam itself .
We in the West tend to forget that women here were not treated with any semblance of equality until fairly recently .
The rights of women in many Islamic countries is indeed a disgrace .
But that is more likely to be due to a bunch of old men than to any innate aspect of Islamic faith itself .
We should continue to engage Muslim theologians , governments and immigrants on women 's ' rights .
Jean - Luc , Vancouver , Canada
Bravo and all that , but Muslim women in Europe are not really the ones who face most of the sexual discrimination that has tarnished the reputation of Islam .
Why not hold this in Pakistan or in the Middle East ?
These are the places where wonderful opportunities like this could go a long way in changing mindsets .
Suraj Menon , Cardiff , Wales
The best way to solve discrimination against women and other races is education .
If you study more educated societies you find women in better social status .
Even in America , New York is a location where women are most prosperous .
Mohammad 's first wife was his boss even before she married him .
After the revelation he stopped working to devote his energy for the message while his wife carried on the business .
Mazhar Raslan , New York , US
Unfortunately , one of the tallest hurdles these women face is an internal one .
Traditional gender roles and subjugation to fathers and husbands have been ingrained in the minds of women from birth .
Mothers too , pass this mindset on to their daughters and so most women defend their second - class status whenever it is challenged .
For a women 's liberation movement to get off the ground , we must first convince the women themselves .
Zaher Ali-Dib , Damascus , Syria
Why must women in Middle Eastern countries / cultures be forced to define themselves according to religious terminology at all ?
Women 's liberation does not require the rubber stamp of Islam or any other religion .
If Westerners will not accept " Christian feminism " as the basis for the feminist argument , then we must also not accept " Islamic feminism " for the argument as well .
Feminism is liberation , and any time it is recast in religious terms , women 's liberation inevitably becomes deceptive yet beautified misogyny and discrimination .
Daniel Schereck , San Francisco , USA
Judaism and Christianity were not the first to give women the right to vote in history .
It was Islam , though it is bitterly hurtful to see many cultures today prohibiting women from exercising the rights Islam gave them .
Do not blame Islam for the actions of these self serving idiots who name their cultures pro-Islam and destroy the peaceful image it bought centuries ago .
The fact is the US still has never elected a female president , though many Islamic countries have or had female heads of the nation .
Farrukh , St Louis , Missouri
I think that education and public discussion can change perceptions on any issue over time .
However , as long as women continue to raise their sons to believe that they are little princes , I do n't think that things will change much for their daughters .
Regardless of where they live , or what religion they believe in ( if any ) , mothers and grandmothers have a lot of power over society that is unrealised at present .
Zena Curwain , Toronto , Canada
I am a Muslim woman , some would say an " Islamic feminist " .
Despite the stereotypes , radical Islamists like the Muslim Brotherhood , or Hizb - ut - tahrir , unlike the traditionalists or culturalist movements like the Taliban , are usually the source of most Muslim women 's sense of Islamic empowerment or Islamic liberation away from things like forced marriage , child custody , abortion , domestic violence , sexploitation , etc .
It is these movements on a grass roots level that have advanced a message of re-visiting the Quran to see how it does not in any way endorse the above oppressive practices , and this is one of the reasons why they find support .
The sad thing is they are viewed as " extremists " and unpalatable to the West because they are also fiercely against Western foreign policy , and crude capitalism .
Dr Habibah Ellahee , London , UK
Aside from the humanitarian aspect , this is a vital economic issue for the Muslim world , as cultures that treat their women more equally just function better .
Before anyone in the West starts making condescending remarks , we 've got a long way to go as well .
Eliot Axelrod , Bloomington , Minnesota
I am a father of three , two of whom are girls , all under ten .
I wish to see my children treated equally in all and every aspect of their lives by the religion whose core values I am trying my very best to pass on to them .
This is an encouraging news item to me .
I wish the organisers the best of luck and hope they will avoid the early trajectory of feminism in the West , that of excluding men from their just struggle .
If they do exclude men of good will , I worry progress will be so slow that even my under tens will not enjoy the fruits .
Kamal Ibrahim , Carbondale , IL , USA
First , I think we should not think misogyny in the Islam world is " their " problem .
The oppression of women is global and we are all involved with it to great extents .
As a male , I feel especially responsible to deconstruct myths of " masculinity " and how many historic and current interpretations use masculinity to support a patriarchy .
But to do this , I feel it seems a great deal of the problem could be alleviated if the media stops looking at the oppression of women as transparent or like it is some one else 's problem .
I would like to hear and read a lot more about Islamic misogyny and to begin to understand what Islam means to many women and men .
Josh Zimmerman , Portland , Oregon USA
Having been a resident of Middle East a few years back , there is a long struggle ahead .
We must remember however , that gender equality is as important as racial , religious , sexual orientation , political affiliation equality .
We can not shy away from the fact that many religions openly ( it is not a misinterpretation ) reject under the " word of lord " these and many other rights .
In my opinion , we need not constantly be defensive and try to appease to people who believe in the infallible status of religions .
Ketan Sudhakar Khare , Mumbai , India
The religion of " Patriarchy " predates Islam , Christianity , and Judaism , and underlies them all .
If we see an " ugly face " to Islam , let us Christians remember to look to our own house first .
What we have done in the name of Jesus has surely made him grieve a thousand times over .
Thomas McCabe , Lakewood , OH , USA
One can guess the relative support of a religion by counting the number of priests ( or whatever the religious ' leaders ' are termed ) who are women .
Using that criterion it is quite obvious that Islam is not alone in promoting male chauvinism .
John , Canada
I grew up though the " women 's movement " in North America .
We have the issues with feminism today , all over the world , simply because religious male leaders quote from their religious texts why a female is considered unequal ; or my favourite : equal but different .
In some countries , as in Canada , females are protected against this male mindset by human right laws .
In many countries the law of the country is the law of the religious faith of the country .
Adjusting a male mindset from self interpreted religious text will take generations , maybe never .
Civil laws outside the boundaries of this text must be written and enforced to protect females .
The civil law is without passion to the unreasonable demands of a religious text , civil law is concerned of what is just and fair , not a passionate plea to keep a gender superior simply because they hold the XY chromosome .
Carolyn Hortie , Dartmouth , NS , Canada
There is no sexism in Islam .
Many people have misinterpreted it .
People who say Islam is sexist should learn about the Shariah , the Quran and Islamic history before they make such an idiotic statement .
I admit that violations of women 's rights have taken place in Muslim countries but Islam should not be blamed for it .
Abrarur Rahman , Dhaka , Bangladesh
Islam , like any other religion , is viewed through the actions of the people .
If there are misconceptions , then it is the responsibility of its followers to present itself as they wish to be seen .
A veil of misconception can only be removed by those who wear it .
Brian K Smith , Maryville , TN , USA
Surely it's not the Muslim women in Europe they need to focus on here , as they have comparatively much greater freedom given the make up of our societies .
It is those outside Europe that appear to be greatly oppressed by their governments and families .
Maybe they are doing this in Spain as it would be much more difficult to get away with in say Tehran ?
Marek , Hungerford , UK
Unfortunately ' Islamic sexism ' is an issue that only women from the Islamic world can defeat .
Western feminists are trained to challenge the Western style of thinking to promote positive change .
It must be the same for Islamic women , only they can understand how they see their problems and how they want them changed .
John Roman , Toronto , Canada
All religions and most men see women as second class citizens .
You can see it with the violence and the job structures everywhere .
Until men can actually start believing women are equals ( and they are ) we will not have peace & prosperity .
Charles Fetterman , Lena , IL USA
We put so much emphasis about how Islam does not treat its women right , we forget how Hinduism and Christianity in their own way deprive the women community from directly participating in their religion .
All religions must start empowering women , but over - emphasis on Islam will only leave the other religions behind !
Chetan , Bangalore , India
Well since I am responding to a media source , I think its only appropriate that it should start here .
Aside from Hollywood , news agencies have a strong influence to alter people 's stereotypes about Muslim women .
Saotomae , Tokyo , Japan
This article was helpful in debunking myths about women and Islam by stating " gender equality in Islamic countries involves refuting chauvinist interpretations of Muslim teachings . "
This tells your reader that it is not Islam itself which is bad , but it is poor interpretations of it which places women in a subordinate place .
Jessie Pettigrew , Rapid City , SD
I believe that " role equity " issues are needed in the feminist debate .
Western feminists have neglected this point .
The home tending that women have traditionally done is vital to the survival and health of the human species and , done well , serves to change both the marketplace and the environment in fundamentally positive ways .
Muslim women are powerfully home - based still .
I believe bringing the concept of " role equity " to the feminist debate would do many things , including help address the misconceptions about women and Islam .
Nancy Woodruff , Washburn , TN , USA
I am thrilled that we are re-examining the place of women of in Islam - especially as the mother of three daughters - we have a vested interest in seeing women having greater self - expression and autonomy , with a stronger emphasis on education .
While the efforts of non-Muslim feminists are valuable and enlightening , the real change will come from within .
With women moving into positions of strength , we will experience the love , peace and compassion that are the true essence of Islam .
Ameena Meer , New York , U.S.A .
I am delighted that feminist Muslim women are speaking out and telling us how we can support them .
That act in itself is countering the stereotype .
All of us in Britain need to be informed by them to counter the possible rising Islamic fundamentalism and also our idea that all Muslims approve of fundamentalism .
Jessie , London , UK
Misconceptions of women and Islam are effectively addressed when people understand the life and times of Prophet Muhammad in a sincere and honest manner .
Looking back , there is no doubt that women enjoyed equal rights and freedoms with their male counterparts while maintaining public and personal dignity .
Yet the pioneering role of women in early Islam in society , economics , and politics have been conveniently ignored in the male dominated cultures of many societies .
The best way to address misconceptions about women and Islam is to make a sincere effort to understand the religion and then through our collective behaviour to ensure that Muslim women and men around the world live the true word and spirit of God 's universal system .
Dr Basma Abdelgafar , Ottawa , Canada
This is centuries overdue .
I am afraid that this round of call for revolution is another wave of words and no action .
The inaction by the Islamic Feminists encourage the Islamic male chauvinist to continue suppressing women in the Islamic societies and further erode their civil and human rights .
John S , USA
You need to continue fighting for your rights .
Yours is a power struggle that is masked by your religion , over a millennium dominated by men .
You must chip away at stereotypes and educate .
It will take time but persevere and good luck .
Brandon , LA , Ca , USA
We as Muslim women need to be more visible in the public arena so that people can see that we are independent beings who have a mind of their own .
For too long Muslim women have been portrayed as submissive and meek .
Its about time that we stand up tall and tell the world that we exist .
Asya Jalil , Toronto , Canada
Islam is not against women .
Koran can be interpreted in a way to help women reach closer to equality in the society .
Islam as a Semitic religion protects the right of women better than Judaism and Christianity .
Money , sex and women have been clearly discussed in Islam .
Women 's issue is a civilisation .
" Please do n't use women to bash Islam " .
Women can be used easily to bash any philosophy on the Planet Earth .
Victoria Arshad , Toronto , Canada
I am an artist living in the middle of the USA , far from the coasts and even farther from the Islamic world .
It is very apparent to me however , that the only way our cultures can coexist is through the efforts of women activists .
The key to the " war on terror " is in the hands of women world - wide .
As long as men are in charge nothing will change .
Women must throw off the shackles of oppression and misogyny .
Louis Copt , Lawrence , Kansas USA
The phrase " never judge a book by it's cover " is probably the perfect way to describe a Muslim woman .
People automatically assume that a headscarf means a Muslim woman has no rights , civil liberties or a voice of her own .
Look beneath that and you will find a woman who has as many rights as a Western woman .
Anon
There are no misconceptions about Islam and the status accorded to women in Islam .
Not to single out Islam and considering the overlapping influence of religion on cultures and societies at large , the treatment meted out to women in almost every corner of the world bar none is that of a second class individual .
I have witnessed barbaric acts of violence inflicted upon women in Pakistan , yet again I have seen and witnessed violence on women in the US .
Wacar Rizvi , Gaithersburg , USA
Any religion that denigrates half its members ( or any of its members ) has no credibility .
Islam is supposed to be about peace .
There can never be peace when women are denied the basic freedoms and respect that men enjoy .
All world and religious leaders and people of good conscience should stand up and say so in support of these brave women .
Michelle Godwin , Howell , MI , US
Western feminism is incompatible with Islamic feminism by definition .
Witness the Western and university educated young women ( most born in the west ) revert to Muslim dress .
Western feminism has failed women , despite Western countries being educated and highly developed democracies .
Women 's rights in the lesser developed countries are no worse .
It remains a novelty for a Western government or political party to be lead by a woman .
Meanwhile Muslim countries like Pakistan , Bangladesh , Turkey and Indonesia have had female leaders .
Iran had a female vice - president and there are proportions of seats reserved for women in parliaments of Pakistan , Iran , UAE and few others while women are free to contest the others too .
These facts are overlooked in the West .
Shoukat , London , UK
In order to address misconceptions of women in Islam all women need to come together to spread the needs and viewpoints of Muslim women .
We must demand all political leaders stand and represent us .
The Western world has let the issues slide for so long now because there is not enough of us coming together to demand the human rights of our sisters around the globe .
If we can make a big enough ripple , leaders will rise to the task .
Angie Binoz , Tyler , Texas USA
Muslim women should be encouraged to take a leading role in Islamic academia and re-interpret texts which have been interpreted predominantly by men .
As long as religious monopoly lies with a particular group , and religion continues to exercise the social , political and spiritual influence it does , it is hard to see how less fortunate groups are ever going to get a fair hearing .
Dr Saqib Qureshi , London , UK
I am reminded of the Prophet 's most beloved wife ; Aisha who rode on top a camel into a battle to fight for what she believed to be right .
I hope that these women are successful in their long struggle for equal rights .
Anut , Oregon USA
As a woman of faith , I would love to see more co-operation when possible amongst feminist movements within faith organisations .
We should definitely all pray for each other and be willing to lend a hand breaking the stained glass ceiling when our sisters request it .
As for a perception in the West that Islam is not capable of feminism , I would like to remind us that our stained glass ceiling is not yet broken , it was not so long ago Christians debated whether or not women had souls , Jewish women who pray at the Western Wall do so at risk to themselves in the 21st century , and finally , that with God , all things are possible .
Cait , Boston , MA , USA
First and foremost , a lot of non-Muslim women , especially feminists , need to talk and interact with Muslim women .
I have several friends that have joined me in feminist activities and they wear the veil and that 's not a bad thing .
The veil can be used as a symbol of oppression , but just as equally it is used by women as a defiant act .
Communication is key to understanding the differences between Muslim and non-Muslim women without using stereotypes to do so .
Rachael , Washington DC , US
Misconceptions about women and Islam could be addressed through first - hand writings from women in Islamic countries about what everyday experience as a woman is like in those countries .
In the West , too , traditionally female - or home - focused work is often thought of as less important or valuable than office or career - centred work .
This tendency needs to be countered in both the West and Islamic countries .
Women 's experience is not a pale shadow or bad reflection of men's .
It 's different than men's and needs to be explored and written about as it's own goal .
Sheridan Mahoney , Portland , OR , USA
I have not read the Koran and it's not likely that I will .
I have a hard enough time understanding Christian feminist issues .
We struggle with why Jesus did n't seem to have any trouble with women and yet his most vocal follower , Paul , had some big issues .
How did we get strapped with Paul 's views instead of Jesus ' ?
I would like to know , in a less than Koran length article , what the similar struggles are for Islamic women .
Marguerite Casparian , Oyster Bay , NY , USA
I do n't know if the Koran has been interpreted wrongly to suit men's ideas , but what I see here in Dearborn ( highest concentration of Middle Eastern people in America ) is that these women see the American lifestyle - which is of course the complete opposite - and have to keep living this suppressed life .
Unless the men arrive at seeing the women as equal , women will stay suppressed .
Of course it has been very nice for the men to have the women in these roles , so why would they want to change that ???
It will be a process over many generations to try and achieve equality as this religion has been around for thousands of years and nothing has been done ...
Petra Elliott , Dearborn , MI , USA
